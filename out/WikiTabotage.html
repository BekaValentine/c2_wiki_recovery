        Tabotage = tab + sabotage.

        Now and then I'll go to a wiki page and I'll see a lot of stuff in fixed width font that goes right off the side of the browser. It won't be that somebody forgot to check the <a href="ConvertSpacesToTabs.html">ConvertSpacesToTabs</a> box, because the <em>whole page</em> will be like this, even though it was edited by many people. Something happened to all the tabs! Specifically, they all got converted to the equivalent spaces.

        <dd>ohhhhh! I thought "tab + sabotage" referred to <a href="WikiButcher.html">WikiButcher</a>ing while alternatively conscious. ;-)</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        I would put a case in point, but somebody would just fix it anyway...
      </p>
      <p>
        How does this happen? Is it possible that some people's browsers are converting tabs to spaces automatically? -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a>

        <em>Yes -- Early versions of KDE have a web browsing component in KFM which, when used for browsing Wiki, does exactly this. Hopefully modern versions don't, but I haven't checked to make sure.</em>
