      </h1>
      <p>
        A 'craftsmanship coach' is a person on each small team who has the following responsibilities –
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Build a consensus of what technical debt means to the team (it may differ somewhat between teams).
        </li>
        <li>
          Measure, understand, and make visible the team’s current technical debt using static analysis tools, investigation, and discussion.
        </li>
        <li>
          Track the ongoing accrual of debt and, thru instruction and incentives, minimize it.
        </li>
        <li>
          Collaborate with the team to build and execute a plan to pay down existing debts over time in a minimally intrusive way.
        </li>
      </ul>
