      <p>
        Coyote Developments is a small independent games developer based in Croydon, UK. It has been running since August 98.

        The <a href="ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices</a> that Coyote have adopted are:

          <ul>
            <li>
              Coyote's internal library code has unit tests. Some of the modules were written test first.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              This hasn't been formally adopted but is somewhat necessary as there is currently not that much space
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

            <li>
              Coyote spend more time working on legacy code than on original code. For legacy code the team occasionally pair debug or pair modify, but mostly <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is limited to new code.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              This has always been common practice at Coyote.
            </li>

          <ul>
            <li>
              This is not always possible as modifying the code base makes merging more difficult. Internal library code is improved in this way.
            </li>
          </ul>

          <ul>
            <li>
              More often than not this is a requirement of a publisher or external developer contract. A typical schedule requires releases monthly although release frequency usually increases near the end of the project.

              Although Coyote has an internal standard for coding, the standard (where it is possible to find one) of the existing code is adopted when working on legacy projects.

              Coyote operates a <a href="FlexTime.html">FlexTime</a> policy. When deadlines force the Coyote developers to work overtime, they take time off in compensation as soon as possible.

        Coyote also now documents its projects using an internal Wiki.
