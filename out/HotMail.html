        When MSFT bought <a href="HotMail.html">HotMail</a> back in 1997 (from uunet?) it was running a FreeBSD/Apache front end and Sun Solaris for the back end.  After a couple of aborted attempts to shift it to NT, the front end (but not the back end) was finally migrated to Windows 2000 over the course of several months in 2000.  To date there is no indication that the Sun Solaris back end has been replaced. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>
