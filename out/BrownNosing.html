        Brown Nosing
      </h1>
      <p>
        The art of making your boss like you not because you do a good job but because you say so many nice things about him and you do exactly what he tells you to do, it does not matter what.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The term suggests a nose which has become soiled from being planted in the bosses' a** far too often.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        BrownNoise may be something like "WhiteNoise or PinkNoise except that it is a copy?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Brown noise is 1/f^2 energy distribution, pink noise is 1/f, and white noise is constant. Not that this is the page for this. I don't think this page should even exist.]
