        Language Life Signs
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is just to prime the pump...
      </p>
      <p>
        Some signs that a language is alive (or dead):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Many people are still productively using it to get stuff done
        </li>
        <li>
           Many problems are solvable with the language (but still may be a niche, I suppose)
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>MindShare</strong> - it may not be the best or brightest, but a lot of people know it and use it
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>CorporateInvestment</strong> - vendors are actively supporting it to increase or maintain usage (such as updating features, giving it away, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           New programs/systems are written in it.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Now, it may be that <a href="JavaIsDead.html">JavaIsDead</a> was more of a <strong>ForwardLookingAssertion</strong>, in which case it would be interesting to look into the factors that change a language's status, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Changing set of problems to be solved, lack of interest
        </li>
        <li>
           Loss of <strong>MindShare</strong> for whatever reason (reliability, lack of investment, loss of interest)
        </li>
        <li>
           Fierce competition from another language drawing from the same <strong>MindShare</strong> pool
        </li>
      </ul>

        Nowadays, the language that spawns the most libraries, wins.
