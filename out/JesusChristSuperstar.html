        A "rock opera" (musical) by <a href="AndrewLloydWebber.html">AndrewLloydWebber</a> on the last week of Christ's life -- as seen by the "star" of the movie -- <strong>Judas.</strong>

      <p>
        Filmed entirely on location in Israel; but it's abstract -- mixing modern tools with ancient ruins. There is no spoken dialog; every last word is done in song.

        <em>For every culture with a repressive dominant military caste, the populace raises up with teachers and hippies to balance them and start new themes. JCS compared Jesus's disciples in the Levant, rebelling against Roman domination, to hippies in the 1960s rebelling against an un-just war.</em>

        This is my all-time favorite movie. But, as a Christian, it disturbs me that they do the resurrection before the crucifixion at the end of the movie. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        The Twelve were not paragons of virtue, which is precisely the point.

        Do you know if this was the director's point? (I'm asking seriously although I sound like a smart-aleck) -- <a href="JeanPhilippeBelanger.html">JeanPhilippeBelanger</a>

        I don't think it matters.  Who knows?  It could have been intentional casting, but that would just be an inside joke lost on the masses.  The important thing is the message of the movie.  Most people will repsond to that regardless of the cast.  -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>

        Wasn't this rock opera first a "concept album," then a stage musical, and only then a movie?  Nevertheless, the many revivals of this show have often had "self-conscious" casting.  One of the Indigo Girls played Jesus in 1994. -- <a href="DanMcKenna.html">DanMcKenna</a>
