        <a href="ExternalIteration.html">ExternalIteration</a> is very flexible but error prone. <a href="InternalIteration.html">InternalIteration</a> is easy to use but has severe limitations especially when it comes to iterating over more than one collection simultaneously.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <a href="InternalIteration.html">InternalIteration</a> in the client code for containers but make <a href="ExternalIteration.html">ExternalIteration</a> available for use in the implementation of specialized <a href="InternalIteration.html">InternalIteration</a> mechanisms (<a href="InternalizeExternalIterators.html">InternalizeExternalIterators</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The vast majority of (all?) iteration needs can be met through <a href="InternalIteration.html">InternalIteration</a> by using the following three operations in this order: <a href="TransposeFunction.html">TransposeFunction</a> to change column ordered data into row ordered data during multiple simultaneous iterations, <a href="MapFunction.html">MapFunction</a> create a new collection based on the rows created by the <a href="TransposeFunction.html">TransposeFunction</a>, and <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> to translate the collection returned by the <a href="MapFunction.html">MapFunction</a> into a single, final result. The resulting algorithms can be made to be very efficient if each of the intermediate collections is a <a href="LazyObject.html">LazyObject</a> (see <a href="StreamObject.html">StreamObject</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="TransposeFunction.html">TransposeFunction</a> takes a collection of columns and returns a collection of rows. The first row consists of the first element from each column. Successive rows are constructed similarly. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="MapFunction.html">MapFunction</a> takes a collection and a function (a <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> in non-functional languages). It returns a new collection constructed by applying the function to each element of the collection in turn and adding the results to the new collection. In the <a href="TransfoldPattern.html">TransfoldPattern</a> it takes a collection of rows and a function that does some sort of transformation on each row, possibly reducing each one to a single value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> takes a collection, a function, and a value (a <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> in non-functional languages). The value parameter is used as a seed for a running total that will be returned by the <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a>. The <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> iterates through all the elements in the collection calling its function parameter and passing both the element and the running total as parameters. The return value of the function is stored as the new running total at the end of every iteration. In the <a href="TransfoldPattern.html">TransfoldPattern</a> the <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> takes the result of the <a href="MapFunction.html">MapFunction</a> (which could be a simple collection or a collection of collections) as its collection parameter. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The collections returned by each of these functions should iterate through their elements using <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> in order to avoid the overhead of creating, maintaining, and destroying stateful container objects. The result of the final <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> should be a <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> that implements calls the <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> through <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> in order to facilitate further composition. This is often the nature of Functional techniques: functions are continually combined and often optimized away but they never seem to get evaluated. When Functional techniques are used in an OO environment evaluation is often deferred until concrete values are actually put to use.

        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="TransposeFunction.html">TransposeFunction</a> along with the <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s <a href="MapFunction.html">MapFunction</a> and <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> can be used to compose reusable <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s and collections into algorithms that are both powerful and efficient. <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> is a key element of this pattern. It allows the collection of collections returned from the <a href="TransposeFunction.html">TransposeFunction</a> to iterate over all the elements in all the base collections in a single loop. It also allows all the intermediate collections in the algorithm (those consumed by the <a href="MapFunction.html">MapFunction</a> and the <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a>) to have little or no memory foot print because each element is fully consumed by each step in the process before the next element is retrieved.

      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ExpressionTemplate.html">ExpressionTemplate</a>s in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> use this pattern without the fold step and without creating an intermediate collection in the transposition step. The collection elements that would normally have been stored during transposition are instead fed directly into the expression. Since the goal of <a href="ExpressionTemplate.html">ExpressionTemplate</a>s is to translate a set of collections into a single collection there is no need to fold the results into a single, final, value. Instead the results of the mapped expression are stored in another collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, Google's MapReduce and its open source equivalent, HaDoop, implement everything except the initial transpose.

        The use of <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> templates to implement this pattern makes me wonder if templates, and generic programming in general, couldn't be both simplified and enhanced by taking features from <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s. Someone once explained <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s to me by saying that they really wanted to be program generators: the result of a run of a functional program is a program that, if run, would yield the desired result. This may have been meant as a metaphorical description but I think that it's close enough to reality that <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s ought to be viewed as a means by which to implement template facilities for more traditional languages. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        See <a href="FunctoidsInCpp.html">FunctoidsInCpp</a> for an example of this.

      <p>
        In general, C++ templates are a <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> functional language. The lesson to learn from C++ templates is that when novel language features are introduced, it may be worth sacrificing backward compatibility in favour of a cleaner syntax.

        It's possible that I'm very dim, but I find this hard to follow without
        a concrete example. So here is one (followed by a few remarks).
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are vectors of numbers, and we want to calculate
        their inner product: that is, <em>a</em>0*<em>b</em>0 + ... + <em>a</em>{<em>n</em>-1}<em>b</em>{<em>n</em>-1}.
        If all we've got is internal iterators for <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>, then we can't
        do that. With external iterators it can be done, but that exposes all
        the machinery.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, instead:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Make a vector <em>c</em> = [<em>a</em>,<em>b</em>].
        </li>
        <li>
           Transpose it, giving [[<em>a</em>0,<em>b</em>0], ...].
        </li>
        <li>
           Map the "take a 2-element vector and multiply its elements" function over that, giving [<em>a</em>0<em>b</em>0, ...].
        </li>
        <li>
           Apply "fold" (also called "reduce" in some languages) to this vector, the two-operand "add" function and the initial value 0.
        </li>
        <li>
           Done.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can do this without having to construct all those vectors explicitly by using <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> everywhere. This remark applies also if what we've got isn't really two vectors, but two arbitrary collections that can spit out their elements in order. We don't have to "serialize" them into actual vectors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> usually carries a performance penalty.
        It's possible to get around this in some languages by compile-time
        transformations that turn all the mapping and transposing and such
        into loops; I suppose that's another way of internalizing external
        iteration. (Or do I mean externalizing internal iteration?) Actually,
        the only language I know of in which you can do this is <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>,
        whose "Series" facility does exactly this sort of thing. (The Series
        facility isn't a standard part of <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, but it's quite widely
        known and has a portable and free implementation.) -- news.generics.co.uk (server name inserted as signature so we can remember whose posts to keep my eye out for and make sure that we read them)

        In <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = [ ... ] # your vector here<br/>
        b = [ ... ] # your other vector here<br/>
        c = zip(a, b) # transpose, ie make a sequence of corresponding pairs<br/>
        d = map((lambda p: p[0] * p[1]), c) # work out the products<br/>
        e = reduce((lambda x, y: x + y), d, 0) # sum them up<br/>
        # and Bob's your uncle!<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        AFAIK, Python does this eagerly, and makes temporary lists. Note also that in Python, map can take multiple arguments, which does a sort of implicit zip on them, passing several arguments to the function. There is a gotcha: the real zip truncates if the arguments are different lengths; map's implicit zip extends the shorter list with None (ie null). Anyway, we could write:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = [ ... ] # your vector here<br/>
        b = [ ... ] # your other vector here<br/>
        d = map((lambda p, q: p * q), a, b) # work out the products<br/>
        e = reduce((lambda x, y: x + y), d, 0) # sum them up<br/>
        # and Bob's your uncle!<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Sadly, reduce can't take multiple sequences; let's make one that can ...
      </p>
      <code>
        def superreduce(f, init, *seq): # note that initializer now comes before sequences<br/>
        acc = init<br/>
        for t in zip(*seq):<br/>
        acc = f(acc, *t)<br/>
        return acc<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = [ ... ] # your vector here<br/>
        b = [ ... ] # your other vector here<br/>
        e = superreduce((lambda a, x, y: a + (x * y)), 0, a, b) # sum them up<br/>
        # and Bob's your uncle!<br/>
      </code>

        <dd>My ruby is pretty rusty, so I'm probably misreading this, but it looks like you're cheating. You're not using an internal iterator on the collections; you're creating a list of indices, and using the internal iterator of that to index the two collections. This is external iteration: you're using knowledge of the structures of the two collections to iterate over them, rather than allowing their internal iterators to take care of it for you.</dd>

        In <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, you can use the "LazyList" library to achieve similar things. I've used it in <a href="EnumeratingRegularLanguages.html">EnumeratingRegularLanguages</a> to literally translate a Haskell program that did just that to Ruby. It would be quite cool to have a "LazyMatrix" or something like that in Ruby. (<a href="AurelianoCalvo.html">AurelianoCalvo</a>)

        This is related to the various zipWiths. The first two stages (omitting the final fold) could be considered a function thus:
      </p>
      <p>
        transmap :: [∃a.[a]] -> ([∃a.a] -> b) -> [b]
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're a Lisper or a Perlist you already consider function arguments to come as a (heterogeneous) list anyway, so you'll think this is like
      </p>
      <code>
        replicate :: Nat -> a -> [a]<br/>
        map :: (b -> a) -> [b] -> [a]<br/>
        zipWith :: (b -> c -> a) -> [b] -> [c] -> [a]<br/>
        zipWith3 :: (b -> c -> d -> a) -> [b] -> [c] -> [d] -> [a]<br/>
      </code>
