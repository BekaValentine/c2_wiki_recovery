        Now, what is the significant difference between the two pages, <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> <> <a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        The inventors of XP wrote down what they were saying verbally, and they said OAOO. Then the <a href="ThePragmaticProgrammer.html">ThePragmaticProgrammer</a>s thought of an awesome acronym for it. "DRY" is very easy to say, and it fits perfectly in writing. "I need to dry that module up next".

        They are the same thing.

        Definitions given on each page:

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a><strong> <em>Every piece of knowledge must have a single, unambiguous, authoritative representation within a system</em></strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Each and every declaration of behavior should appear</em> <strong></strong><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a><strong></strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Accordingly, one is about not repeating knowledge, the other about not repeating behaviour. i.e. <em>Don't repeat or duplicate Form or Function</em> -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
