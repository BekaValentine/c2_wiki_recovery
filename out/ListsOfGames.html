        WHERE TO FIND INFORMATION ON GAMES FOR WORKSHOPS.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of BOOKS there are several kinds of sources: books on New Games (aka non-competitive games), books about Warmups and Exercises for workshops, and books about working with children.  You can also attend a COURSE on new games, though I've never seen a course on games for using in workshops.  Mostly you will PICK THEM UP by being on courses where they are used.  I've never seen anything on the WEB.

        I don't include much publishers' details here as the information I have is incomplete and probably out of date.

        Gary Kroehnert: 100 Training Games gives an "academic" explanation of the difference between games, simulations, brain teasers, role-plays and case studies. He codes his games as Icebreakers, Team-building, Communication, Facilitator/Presentation, Energiser, Learning, Perception, Evaluation and Selfmanagement. There is a useful gamesgrid included.
