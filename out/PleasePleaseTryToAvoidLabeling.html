        Please Please Try To Avoid Labeling
      </h1>
      <p>
        Be careful how you name things. The incorrect name might stick and influence the phenomenon itself. For example, <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a> was named, because it reminded me of squats in Holland. Probably <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> was a better name. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Labels are powerful things: they constrain our thinking in ways that strongly affect our behaviour. As a thought experiment, consider how your reaction to the pages in the first list above might differ if <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a> page was titled WikiSeeding, WikiLegUp or somesuch.
