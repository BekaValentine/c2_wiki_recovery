        I work for the Space Telescope Science Institute [<a href="http://www.stsci.edu]">http://www.stsci.edu]</a> on the Johns Hopkins campus in Baltimore, Maryland. Our public Hubble picture page is at <a href="http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pictures.html">http://www.stsci.edu/pubinfo/pictures.html</a>

        I am currently working on the <a href="AstronomersProposalTool.html">AstronomersProposalTool</a> - specifically the <a href="ExposureTimeCalculator.html">ExposureTimeCalculator</a>.

        I developed an interest in computers around 1971 from watching Star Trek reruns on television. Yes, I am a nerd (and darn proud of it). My first exposure to programming was basic and assembly on my parents Apple II, but couldn't program my way out of a wet paper bag until I learned a structured language (Pascal) in 1984. I have been programming in C++ since October, 1994. I have been using Java since 1996.

        I am strictly an applications programmer. I like to write programs that people find useful.

        I have a strange fascination with distributed systems, persistance mechanisms and such. I've been following <a href="ComponentManagedPersistence.html">ComponentManagedPersistence</a> and <a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a> with considerable interest and I have started working on <a href="PackagedPersistence.html">PackagedPersistence</a>. As part of my work on this subject, I've been exploring the problem with objects that are created in an unrecoverable invalid state, what I'm calling <a href="NothingHalfBaked.html">NothingHalfBaked</a>. I have also added a page about updating complicated object structures <a href="WhenOneLeafDiesBuyaWholeTree.html">WhenOneLeafDiesBuyaWholeTree</a>.

        I am have used <a href="TimeSynchronousProcessing.html">TimeSynchronousProcessing</a> in more than one application.
