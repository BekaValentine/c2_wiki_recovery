      <p>
        <a href="KwikWiki.html">KwikWiki</a> is a <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a>/<a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> built using <a href="JavaServerPages.html">JavaServerPages</a>, Servlets and <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a>. Currently at version 2.4
      </p>
      <p>
        It's written in Java. The implementation uses some ideas that may interest people with an interest in <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> (such as <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>) and unorthodox exception handling techniques.

        The website for <a href="KwikWiki.html">KwikWiki</a> itself is at: <a href="http://www.oshineye.com/software/kwikwiki.html.">http://www.oshineye.com/software/kwikwiki.html.</a> New builds tend to go up when there's been some change worth sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Slightly looser <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a> that allows numbers in <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>, e.g., Reel2Reel and J2eeSpec.
        </li>
        <li>
           Full text search. This uses Lucene and supports searching for individual words as well as phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
           TitleIndex
        </li>
        <li>
           As well as the standard recent changes functionality (albeit with a nicer ordering of changes than <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>), you also get a TodaysChanges page which is a little less daunting.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WantedPages.html">WantedPages</a>. A list of links to pages that don't yet exist.
        </li>
        <li>
           OrphanedPages. A list of pages that no other pages link to.
        </li>
        <li>
           Saves pages to text files or a mysql database
        </li>
        <li>
           Records the history of all pages
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RelatedPages.html">RelatedPages</a> functionality which shows the top 10 pages that share the same important terms as the current page. This makes it easier to navigate large wikis because it effectively recommends other pages to the user and enables people to build a mental map of the wiki.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'd welcome any comments on the code/architecture from any <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> who happen to pass by. -- <a href="AdewaleOshineye.html">AdewaleOshineye</a>

        In version 2.0 there should exist a directory named, "history" in the "metadata" directory. This bug is fixed in 2.1 which also adds OsCache based caching and other features.

        I'm using it now, and it works pretty well.  I wish I could place two capital letters next to each other in page titles.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to edit the code block matching regex as the normal one wouldn't match on my Windows 2000 server using MySQL for page persistence.  The pattern I'm using successfully is "\\{\\{\\{(.*?)\\}\\}\\}"
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want, it could be edited further to require that the braces be at the start of a new line, but I'm not concerned with it.  But don't use \n as it doesn't work on all systems - it didn't work on mine.
