        How Can Someone Type Their Name With Middle Initial Included
      </h1>
      <p>
        I would prefer to type my middle initial because there are others out there with my first and last name. Inserting underscores doesn't seem to work:
      </p>
      <p>
        George_S_Cowan
      </p>
      <p>
        Any suggestions?
      </p>

      <p>
        Spell your full name out, or accept the possible ambiguity of losing your middle initial. --<a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a> (Dave W. Smith)

        You might consider a <a href="DoubleCharacterLinkPattern.html">DoubleCharacterLinkPattern</a>: GeorgeSsCowan. As there are no words of two identical characters, this can not be misunderstood. But currently this is not popular in this wiki. --<a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>

        Well, yes, there <em>are</em> words of two identical characters.  Aa is a rough form of lava.  Mm is an interjection.  Ee is either the letter E or Scots dialect for "eye".  Oo is either obsolete terminology for "one" or a Hawai'ian bird.  I have seen "aa" in print in a National Geographic magazine.  "Aa" and "mm" are good in North American Scrabble(R).  Those two plus "ee" and "oo" are good Scrabble(R) words everywhere else.  As far as how to type one's middle name, I prefer GeorgeEssCowan, I think.

        You might try the following -It is understandable and contains no more letter or tricks other than reording as lastname firstname middleinitial: CowanGeorgeS
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unfortunately, </em>CowanGeorgeS doesn't fit the <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a>.<em></em>

        <a href="GeorgEsCowan.html">GeorgEsCowan</a> would - still no extra letters, First and Last name still Uppercase

        What strange country gives their children names with only a middle initial, and not a full name in the middle? The "S" does stand for something, doesn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The US? I think Truman's middle name was just the letter S (no period, even) and I have several Texas friends who have legal names, both first and middle, that are just single letters.</em>

        I meant as a cultural convention, not a place where where certain exceptions have occurred. Where was ee cummings based, btw?

        To be really pedantic, you could have GeorgeS<strong>dot</strong>Cowan ;-)
