        Functional Programming Environment
      </h1>
      <p>
        From time to time I come across one of the <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s and gradually I am beginning to be sold on the benefits of the concept. I have started a number of tutorials, and although impressed by the ease of creating simple functions, I am then disappointed by my inability to progress to something useful. This then stops me from pursuing the matter further, until the next time... What I would like this page to be is a series of facts and links that would help people like me to assemble an environment in which to learn, progress, and then deploy applications using <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What do I mean by useful, and what do I mean by environment? Typically most of my applications involve the collection, storage and presentation of data. This means I use PHP or Perl, IIS or Apache and MySQL or SQLServer. I can put together such an environment on a Windows or Linux machine in less than 30 minutes. I can build my application on my laptop. Once drafted, I can migrate this application for further development on <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>. Then I can deploy the application for general small scale use with my ISP. I would like to know the possibilities of doing this with any of the <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s.

        Here are the questions I woud like to ask of the functional language community.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What components do I need to set up my initial learning/development environment?
        </li>
        <li>
          Is there a mature development environment?
        </li>
        <li>
          Which ISPs would offer which functional languages?
        </li>
        <li>
          How do I access options should my application become <em>big</em>?
        </li>
      </ul>
