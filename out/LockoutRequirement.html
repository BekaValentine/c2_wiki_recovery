        Lockout Requirement
      </h1>
      <p>
        A stated requirement, the sole or primary purpose of which is to guide/force the design team into choosing a particular technology/architecture/implementation strategy.  All other choices are <em>locked out</em> by the requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often times justified by <a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a> arguments.  (If a technique is indeed a <a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a>, then there should be considerable team experience or discussion in the literature which justifies this claim....the mere unsupported opinion of the architect, manager, or project lead that something is a <a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a> is suspicious.  <em>It should also be noted that a </em><a href="BestPractice.html">BestPractice</a> is only best within an appropriate context.  And only ever temporarily.<em>)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The term only applies if the requirement is not a bona fide customer, legal, or business requirement (requirements to interface with existing or legacy systems count as customer requirements).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, if a project had a requirement to use a "statically typed, cross-platform OO language with garbage collection and a large available talent pool" (assuming not a customer requirement), you can bet that this is a <a href="LockoutRequirement.html">LockoutRequirement</a> to force the team to select Java.  Not to flame <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>; this is merely an example.
      </p>
      <p>
        More commonly seen is a "3-tiered architecture with a Web-based front end, Unix application server and database server", or more simply "J2EE compliant architecture".
      </p>
      <p>
        Another common example is one that requires big iron relational database, and no so round about either, just direct and to the point:  <em>System data must be stored in a relational database.</em>  Most likely found in government projects.
