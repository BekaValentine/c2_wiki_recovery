      <p>
        I am an "IT-Consultant" - whatever that may mean - living in southern Germany not far from Munich.

      <p>
        In August 2001 I started work on my own "kind of <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a>" written in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>. I called it "<a href="CyberPublishing.html">CyberPublishing</a>" and it's available under the GNU GPL. I just (2002-02-03) published a major release (0.5). For more information see <a href="http://cyberdev.org/cpy">http://cyberdev.org/cpy</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpy.">http://sourceforge.net/projects/cpy.</a>

        Some remarks on <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> from the time when I discovered XP and this wiki:
      </p>
      <p>
        When I discovered XP (and wiki) in May 1999 I got some sort of "that may really heal the world" feeling. I worked as a programmer and project manager in software development at a software house for eight years and were not very happy about how we did it (though I always liked it); and the next five years (as CIO at a publishing house) I often "suffered" from the products people from software houses installed (or tried to install) at the company I worked at (and they often talked about their QA departments...).
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a real global challenge on software development concerning flexibility and quality, and in my opinion XP presents the first methodology to cope with this challenge.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I now work as an IT consultant with a focus on IT organisation and OO (that now means Java and - increasingly important - Python) development and training, such ideas like XpConsulting and XpTraining (or even ExtremeConsulting / <a href="ExtremeTraining.html">ExtremeTraining</a>?) come to my mind. One important thing will be <a href="PromotingXp.html">PromotingXp</a>.
