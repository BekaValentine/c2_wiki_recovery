        Ruby Smalltalk Challenge
      </h1>
      <p>
        The challenge is simple: in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, implement a <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> that conforms to <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>'s <a href="OperatorPrecedence.html">OperatorPrecedence</a>. Or in ST, implement a DSL that conforms to Ruby's operator precedence. Whichever language requires the larger amount of code to do so probably has the less flexible notation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can please a <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a> stop this stupid challenge?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why bother? It's too vague to even get started.</em> :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Its moot now, anyway. There's OMeta for Smalltalk, and if there isn't OMeta for Ruby, there should be. Problem solved.
