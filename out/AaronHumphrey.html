        The current project is written in Visual Basic 6, and in a very non-object-oriented fashion; I am just now starting to get into that.  Our next version is to be in Java. I've been reading the <a href="RefactoringBook.html">RefactoringBook</a> and it's inspired me to try to use those techniques in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, which is why I wandered into the wiki.

        I also read a lot of books, mostly <a href="SpeculativeFiction.html">SpeculativeFiction</a>, and listen to a lot of music, and have two children and hence not a lot of spare time.

        I have a frequently-updated blog called The Den of Ubiquity at <a href="http://azpiazu.blogspot.com/,">http://azpiazu.blogspot.com/,</a> and a like-named home page at <a href="http://www.telusplanet.net/public/alfvaen/">http://www.telusplanet.net/public/alfvaen/</a> which is much less frequently updated.
