        Interaction Designer

        From the <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a> (2003 June 16 timeframe):

        <em>Exoftware did a cool presentation a few weeks ago and they mentioned using an Interface Designer (ID [I think that was the term]). The ID sits down with the customer and together they design the screens - the ID is proficient in UI design rather software development. I can really see the benefit of how they are doing it.</em>

        That would be an <a href="InteractionDesigner.html">InteractionDesigner</a> and thanks for the plug, Nick.

        I'd disagree with the above definition, or at least consider it incomplete. I believe an interaction designer is responsible for choosing then designing appropriate interactions a user of a system should have in order to meet their goals. If they're just designing UI, then they are indeed and Interface Designer. That is, they've specialized in a subset of the work done by an interactionDesigner. They haven't done the work to understand users and goals and choose the interaction first.
