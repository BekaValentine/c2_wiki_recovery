        I became interested in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> during my tenure at Kenamea, under the tutelage of the brilliant <a href="PeterSeibel.html">PeterSeibel</a>. Watching <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> and <a href="BrianMarick.html">BrianMarick</a> help take another team from a traditional <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> methodology (that wasn't working) to a more agile one (that did) convinced me that they were on to something. Now, I'm looking around, trying to figure out better what works and what doesn't. It's an interesting challenge.
