        Right To Arm Bears

        A famous historic documentation mistake which led to the invention of proof readers. -- <a href="ArnoldLayne.html">ArnoldLayne</a>

        <em>Any reference for that claim?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The inalienable right and <em>duty</em> of every US citizen. And far, far more sensible that the other way around, too - bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
        The title of a recent volume collecting many of the old "Dilbia" stories by GordonDickson. A treacherous pun indeed, and proof that few of this sort of joke are original. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

        Is this true? I just thought it was a candidate for <a href="WorstPunEver.html">WorstPunEver</a>. (Shall I add <a href="CategoryJoke.html">CategoryJoke</a>?) -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        <em>It's true. It's a decent set of stories, although the formula becomes rather more apparent than when they were spaced out in time.  It's no </em>HokaHokaHoka, but it's good.<em></em>

        <em>Sure, it's true, which doesn't mean it's not a candidate...</em>

        Most important in terms of a last straw "right" of defense or right to overthrow oppression by government. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Codified as an "inherent" right in a truly democratic government "by/of/for" the people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, that's right. When government oppresses you... arm the bears.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmmm.  The Russians are often referred to as "the bear" or just bears.  I thought they were already armed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No No No, bears don't have arms, they have legs.  Four of them.  Where on their body would they have room to add arms too?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "If you called a dog's tail a leg, how many legs would a dog have?  Four, calling a tail a leg doesn't make it a leg." Abraham Lincoln (sorry, this discussion just reminded me of this quote!) -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>
