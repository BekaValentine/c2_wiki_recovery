        Hibernate Query Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A query language from the <a href="HiberNate.html">HiberNate</a> O-R mapper project with some interesting properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Roughly based on SQL
        </li>
        <li>
           Allows ER "path" references such as "warehouse.location.zipcode" to simplify or avoid explicit joins. In this case we have an implied join between the Warehouse table and the Location table. Its impact on relational theory and "path risks" are unknown.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't need to explicitly give join parameters; it can infer them from ER-based meta-data. (Some SQL dialects also do this.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Has some OO-friendly concepts not found in SQL
        </li>
        <li>
           Allegedly can automatically translate to different RDBMS vendor's SQL dialects to avoid <a href="DatabaseVendorLock.html">DatabaseVendorLock</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although it seems tied to Java for the time being, some of its ideas can perhaps be applied to revamping, wrapping, or replacing the SQL standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example from the Hibernate docs:
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: insert description of what it actually does in English - under construction]
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>HQL</strong>:
      </p>
      <code>
        select cust<br/>
        from Product prod,<br/>
        Store store<br/>
        inner join store.customers cust<br/>
        where prod.name = 'widget'<br/>
        and store.location.name in ( 'Melbourne', 'Sydney' )<br/>
        and prod = all elements(cust.currentOrder.lineItems)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Versus allegedly equivalent <strong>SQL</strong>:
      </p>
      <code>
        SELECT cust.name, cust.address, cust.phone, cust.id, cust.current_order<br/>
        FROM customers cust,<br/>
        stores store,<br/>
        locations loc,<br/>
        store_customers sc,<br/>
        product prod<br/>
        WHERE prod.name = 'widget'<br/>
        AND store.loc_id = loc.id<br/>
        AND loc.name IN ( 'Melbourne', 'Sydney' )<br/>
        AND sc.store_id = store.id<br/>
        AND sc.cust_id = cust.id<br/>
        AND prod.id = ALL(<br/>
        SELECT item.prod_id<br/>
        FROM line_items item, orders o<br/>
        WHERE item.order_id = o.id<br/>
        AND cust.current_order = o.id<br/>
        )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (SQL 92 does support INNER JOIN, and some dialects support automatic joining between tables where key constraints are defined - i.e.  store.loc_id = loc.id would not be required. This would bring the two statements to be very close -
        the HQL example above is hiding implementation as the table mapping. It could also be achieved through use of a database view (again, pre-defined mapping). Not to say this is a bad thing - it saves on repeatedly defining the same relationships in multiple statements).
      </p>
      <p>
        {I see some other ways that could possibly shorten the above SQL, although it may lengthen others. One example is generally not sufficient enough to compare.}
      </p>
      <p>
        HQL does not actually require a select clause for mapped entities "from Product" is a completely valid query which would presumably return instances of the Product class (you could map the product entity to any Java type but the class name is customary).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important feature of HQL and Hibernate in general is the abillity to use bind parameters.  Bind parameters allow you to reliably avoid the problem of <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a>.
      </p>
      <code>
        Query q = sess.createQuery(<br/>
        "from DomesticCat cat where cat.name = :name");<br/>
        q.setString("name", "Fritz");<br/>
        Iterator cats = q.iterate();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (Almost all existing flavours of SQL have supported bind variables for the last decade. It is the treatment of SQL as concatenated strings that is the main cause of <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> - not to mention performance issues).

        Questions
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can it handle non-key joins?
          <ul>
            <li>
               Yes, but then you have to explicitly specify the join in where-clause. Just like you would do it in SQL.
            </li>
            <li>
               You can also use property-ref mappings (but this has nothing to do with HQL itself)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
