        Is the following paragraph true or is it nonsense? I probably is, but then it couldn't be. :)

        <em>In March 1997, according to BBC Online Network News, four young Italians were stopped on a train without tickets. When asked for their names, they all replied: "Luther Blissett". Hauled into court, "quartet of activists" still insisted that each was called Luther Blissett. A multiply identity of mysterious origins that first surfaced in Italy in the mid-90s, Luther Blissett has maintained a viral presence ever since: "Anyone can be Luther Blissett simply by adopting the name Luther Blissett", proclaims a Luther Blissett manifesto, ending with an encouragement to all its readers to "Become Luther Blissett". An epistemological cloning operation had taken place. Luther Blissett could be anyone and consequently do anything, anywhere at any time: from fare dodging on the italian railways to writing a best-selling novel, committing suicide, releasing a CD or playing for AC Milan in the early 1980s. "Multiple names are connected to radical theories of play", writer Stewart Home observed at the Festival of Plagiarism back in 1988: "The idea is to create an "open situation" for which no one in particular is responsible. </em>

        Some proponents of the concept also claim that it is a way to "practically examine, and break down, Western philosophic notions of identity, individuality, value and truth ".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The story about the train passengers without tickets reminds me of the </em><a href="MarxBrothers.html">MarxBrothers</a> movie <em>Monkey Business</em>. The Marx Brothers stow away on a ship. As they disembark with the passengers they each claim to be Maurice Chevalier. "If ze nightingales could sing like you, zey'd sing much sweeter zan zey do..." -- MauriceChevalier<em></em>
