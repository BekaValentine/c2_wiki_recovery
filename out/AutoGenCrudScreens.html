        Auto Gen Crud Screens
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some systems / frameworks / CASE tools have the feature that they will, with a "little or no effort" automatically generate <a href="CreateReadUpdateDelete.html">CreateReadUpdateDelete</a> functionality for you:  That is, screens (or modes) that enable the users to Create, Read, Update, and Delete objects/records.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can save <strong>lots</strong> of development time (and money)
        on the 80-90% or so of data that does <strong>not</strong> need a specialized custom interface for routine maintenance.
      </p>

        <em>One has to be careful because generated code is sometimes not easy to maintain on its own. Other caveats are raised in </em><a href="CodeGenerationIsaDesignSmell.html">CodeGenerationIsaDesignSmell</a><em></em>

        Examples of such tools:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> - does <a href="AutoGenCrudScreens.html">AutoGenCrudScreens</a> at run time and/or at development time -- <strong>and a lot more</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TheNakedObjectsFramework.html">TheNakedObjectsFramework</a> - does <a href="AutoGenCrudScreens.html">AutoGenCrudScreens</a>, and as a design philosophy restricts you to these, giving you a <a href="DirectManipulation.html">DirectManipulation</a> interface that not only simplifies development; it enables your users.
        </li>
        <li>
           corix 4i - <a href="http://www.corix.ch">http://www.corix.ch</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a>

      </ul>

        corix 4i is something very similar to <a href="NakedObjects.html">NakedObjects</a>. It's available at <a href="http://www.corix.ch">http://www.corix.ch</a>

           My German isn't very strong, so I could be wrong, but I don't think this is "very similar", I think it's simply the usual persistent-objects via RDBMS framework with a GUI modeler/wizard.

        I have been interested in automatic generation of screens for a while, particularly using Java Reflection as a starting point. I really like the idea of <a href="NakedObjects.html">NakedObjects</a> and ExpressiveSystems.
        Their demo framework is not great, so I have been developing a <a href="JavaSwing.html">JavaSwing</a> based version called Expressive, which is available at <a href="http://expressive.sourceforge.net/.">http://expressive.sourceforge.net/.</a>

        For a <a href="CrudAutoGenerator.html">CrudAutoGenerator</a> to be called "functionally complete" should be able to deal with the <a href="IrreducibleComplexityEntityModel.html">IrreducibleComplexityEntityModel</a>, sadly, some of the <a href="CrudAutoGenerator.html">CrudAutoGenerator</a> in the market right now (<a href="JbossSeamGen.html">JbossSeamGen</a> for example) are not really able to deal with all the different kinds of relationships that are represented in the <a href="IrreducibleComplexityEntityModel.html">IrreducibleComplexityEntityModel</a>.
