        ...is an apprentice human being, working in the broad area of designing distributed OO systems. So sometimes I consult on OO design, sometimes I consult on distributed systems, sometimes I evalangelize <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="JiniTechnology.html">JiniTechnology</a> or <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, and all-too-frequently find that all this drags me into the area of software <a href="DevelopmentProcesses.html">DevelopmentProcesses</a>.

        I come out of the Unix/C world in the mid-80's, into <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> in the late-80's and early-to-mid 90's, through a short flirtation with <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, via an arduous (and best forgotten) detour into <a href="ProjectManagement.html">ProjectManagement</a>, into <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> programming. But mainly the focus has been on design, and trying to make systems less brittle, more flexible, more approachable by real people, more resilient to the real world where things grow and change, organically and chaotically, and not at all in straight lines

        Live out in the countryside near an ancient indigenous forest, growing my own vegetables, chickens, etc., and thinking about design on many levels. Designed (and largely built) my own (energy conserving) house, designing a <a href="PermaCulture.html">PermaCulture</a> holding, designing software (sometimes), and starting to become involved in designing organizations.
