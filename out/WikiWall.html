        A <a href="WikiWall.html">WikiWall</a> is physical tool/technique to visualize the content of a <a href="WiKi.html">WiKi</a>. It was a started by <a href="RalfLippold.html">RalfLippold</a> and <a href="RainerWasserfuhr.html">RainerWasserfuhr</a> in late 2009:

        As of 2010 it consisted of 256 physical WikiWallCard's, that were placed on 16x16 grid with a ChessBoard-like coordinate system. Each WikiWallCard is backed by a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> in the (<a href="JspWiki.html">JspWiki</a> based) <a href="TeamWiki.html">TeamWiki</a>.

        In an initial "RampUp" phase, the <a href="WikiWall.html">WikiWall</a> was filled during extended <a href="BrainStorming.html">BrainStorming</a> sessions.
        After the RampUp, only minor changes were made.
        Replacing a WikiWallCard from the <a href="WikiWall.html">WikiWall</a> had to be justified by pointing out the importance for the overall project.

        During countless meetings with different people, the <a href="WikiWall.html">WikiWall</a> was extensively used to point to hidden connections between various people, organizations, projects and concepts.
