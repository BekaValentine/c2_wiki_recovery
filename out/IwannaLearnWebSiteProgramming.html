        The intent of this page is to gather beginner resources for website scripting and programming. I assume you've already learned some HTML (if not, see <a href="LearningHtmlAndCss.html">LearningHtmlAndCss</a>).

        WebSiteProgramming is different from <a href="WebApplicationDesign.html">WebApplicationDesign</a>. If you are more interested in the client side programming aspects, see <a href="WebDesignCurriculum.html">WebDesignCurriculum</a> instead.

        Let's <em>start with CGI</em> (<a href="CommonGatewayInterface.html">CommonGatewayInterface</a>). In today's world you need to be mindful of <a href="CgiScriptSecurity.html">CgiScriptSecurity</a>. CGI is used as <a href="ServerSideInclude.html">ServerSideInclude</a>s in almost all environments.

        CGI scripts are often associated with <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> (see note), but personally I think <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> is better for beginners, so <a href="IwannaLearnPython.html">IwannaLearnPython</a> too.

        This is going to negate a bit what was said in the previous section. There are other ways to provide server functionality.

        First, the CGI model is not tied to a specific language. And I am unable to parse the above... more powerful than what? But, traditional CGI under Unix is not a good model for web applications that must scale. Not only must a normal CGI process fork a shell on each request, it must also rebuild things like DB connections on each request (yes, I know that there are workarounds for this). If you want to run Perl CGI scripts under high load, you should take a look at <a href="ModPerl.html">ModPerl</a>'s Apache::Registry(?) module.

        See Rahul Kumar's excellent article (2000) called "Exploring the World of Application Servers". One source is <a href="http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/10825_538781_2,">http://www.serverwatch.com/tutorials/article.php/10825_538781_2,</a> but it appears to be partly broken (incomplete).

        It is certainly worth understanding the security implications of taking data from non-trusted users. There are some pretty <em>convoluted exploits</em> out there. A main focus area is to program very defensively against deliberate exploits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "poison null byte" - See <a href="http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/cgi_course/lessons/lesson_three.html.">http://users.easystreet.com/ovid/cgi_course/lessons/lesson_three.html.</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "cross site scripting attack" - What is insidious about it is that you can have secured your own site against attack, but still leave your users open to attack. See Google for details.
