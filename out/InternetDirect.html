        <strong>What is Indy?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Internet Direct (Indy) is an open source internet component suite comprised of popular internet protocols written in Delphi and based on blocking sockets. Indy is included in Delphi 6+, Kylix 1+, and C++ Builder 6+. Both client and server implementations are included as well as full source code and comprehensive demos. The Client components are easy to use because you write your transactions in a sequence and the servers are multithreaded.
