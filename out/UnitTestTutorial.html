        Ok, I'm a computer hobbyist and a novice programmer. I get a lot of the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> concepts, but I'm just not getting <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing, probably because I don't understand testing. Instead of waiting for someone to explain it to me, I'll roll up the sleeves and give it a shot. I'll explain it to myself and you all can elucidate. -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a> (April 2001)

        I'm going to use a 'real' toy example. I'm writing a program that will create characters used in a <a href="RolePlayingGame.html">RolePlayingGame</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The </strong><a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When we create a character, we roll dice. We want to specify dice rolls using the widely used </em><a href="RolePlayingGame.html">RolePlayingGame</a> format:<em></em>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <em>"2D6" or "2d6" - Two six-sided dice (as in </em><a href="MonopolyGame.html">MonopolyGame</a> or CrapsGame)<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>"3D6" - Three six-sided dice.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>"1d100" - One onehundred-sided dice.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>"2d20" - Two twenty-sided dice.</em>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Ok, I'm guessing that's an OK <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>. (Since I'm a user, and it's my story, and I'm sticking to it ;-). I tried avoiding computerese and using the nomenclature specific to the problem space.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'm going to use <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, and for this simple example, I'm not going to use <a href="PyTest.html">PyTest</a>. And I'm not even going to bother with objects until I decide I need them. I'm also going to go in excruciatingly small steps (ala <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>s <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> book).
      </p>
      <p>
        Based on the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, a string argument will be passed in, and a result will be returned. Here's a failing test:
      </p>
      <code>
        testRoll = roll("1d1")<br/>
        assert(testRoll)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I run it and it fails... And that's a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>! It's supposed to fail. There isn't any code. Now I <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> (DTSTTCPW) to make the test pass.
      </p>
      <code>
        def roll(text):<br/>
        return text<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        # Test code goes here...<br/>
        testRoll = roll("1d1")<br/>
        assert(testRoll)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now the test runs. This is the state commonly celebrated as <a href="GreenBar.html">GreenBar</a>. Granted, this doesn't satisfy the whole user story, but it does satisfy one part of it: I pass a text argument in and something comes out.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, I need to refactor any duplication... But since this is quite basic, there's not much to refactor yet. So I iterate again: Write a failing test. This time I want the function to return a "1" when I pass in "1d1". 
      </p>
      <code>
        testRoll = roll("1d1")<br/>
        assert(testRoll)<br/>
        assert(testRoll == 1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It failed as expected. Now I have to make it pass... Remember while coding to DTSTTCPW.
      </p>
      <code>
        def roll(text):<br/>
        return 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Well, that works... Now my code passes two tests: It returns "true" value, and that value is 1 when I pass "1d1" to it. I suppose I could remove the first test, but the point about writing tests is that you amass a collection of tests, one for each thing that could possibly go wrong. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sheesh, this could take all day :-)... Running <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s seems to be some form of acquired OCD. Constantly checking that your code is OK.
      </p>
      <p>
        From now on I'll be writing the failing test first, then following it with the code that makes it pass. I constrain my comments to refactorings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next step, testing that the input "2d1" returns the proper result 2.
      </p>
      <code>
        testRoll = roll("1d1")<br/>
        assert(testRoll)<br/>
        assert(testRoll == 1)<br/>
        testRoll = roll("2d1")<br/>
        assert(testRoll == 2)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I then code...
      </p>
      <code>
        def roll(text):<br/>
        if (text == "1d1"):<br/>
        return 1<br/>
        else:<br/>
        return 2<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And the tests pass. But now I have to invoke the third part of the mantra: <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>. Get rid of duplicate code. The way to get rid of the conditional it to generalize the function so that "<em>n</em>d1" will return <em>n</em>. In the language of the domain, I need to get the number of dice from the passed in argument. So I'll extract method.
      </p>
      <code>
        def numberOfDice(text):<br/>
        if (text == "1d1"):<br/>
        return 1<br/>
        else:<br/>
        return 2<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        def roll(text):<br/>
        return numberOfDice<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Wha?!? I got an AssertionError! What went wrong? Upon inspection, I determined that I forgot to add the argument to the numberOfDice function call. It just goes to show you that <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> is right when he says "A suite of tests is a powerful bug detector that decapitates the time it takes to find bugs". I fix that and then I decide I need to write some tests for numberOfDice...
      </p>
      <code>
        testNumberOfDice = numberOfDice("3d1")<br/>
        assert(testNumberOfDice == 3)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>

        Well, I'm modeling Dice, so I suppose Dice will be one of the classes.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, I should create a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> called "TestDice" that will test the following things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The function should only accept a properly formatted string in the format of "xDy".
        </li>
        <li>
           The function should return an integer.
        </li>
        <li>
           It shouldn't matter if the upper- or lowercase "d" is used.
        </li>
        <li>
           Characters before the "d" should be a positive integer.
        </li>
        <li>
           Characters after the "d" should be a positive integer greater than 1 (a 1 sided die?).
        </li>
        <li>
           The number rolled should always be greater than or equal to the lowest possible roll.
        </li>
        <li>
           The number rolled should always be less than or equal to the highest possible roll.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Please put your thoughts under the line. I'll check back in a day or so and refactor them into my understanding. Once I'm that far, I'll actually write some code... Yikes... -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>

      <p>
        These might have tests associated with them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider instead the following tests
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           RollDice( "1d6" ) returns an element of the set [1-6]
        </li>
        <li>
           RollDice( "1d4" ) returns an element of the set [1-4]
        </li>
        <li>
           RollDice( "1d100" ) returns an element of the set [1-100]
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Now, if you are implementing the <a href="SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>, then all your tests are still satisfied by a trivial implementation ( return 1; ) - so we need some more sophisticated tests
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           RollDice( "2d4" ) returns an element of the set [2-8]
        </li>
        <li>
           RollDice( "3d6" ) returns an element of the set [3-18]
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Of course, these can be satisfied by simply returning the number that appears before the d, so we'll need something harder.  That's when we start playing with "call the function N times, and ensure a reasonable distribution of the outcomes" tests and "make sure every roll in a sequence falls in the expected range" tests.

        When something is hard to test, sometimes that indicates that
        it's doing too many things at once. Suppose you split up your
        die-rolling thing into smaller bits.
      </p>
      <p>
        One takes the string "3d6" and turns it into the numbers 3 and 6.
        Since you're writing this in a language that <em>supports</em> OO
        rather than <em>enforcing</em> it, I suggest that you just make this
        a plain ol' function. You test it by feeding it a bunch of
        sample strings and making sure you get the right numbers out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next part takes the number 6 and returns a random number uniformly
        chosen from {1,2,...,6}. That's harder to test, but there are
        well-known techniques for evaluating random number generators.
        For your application, quite simple tests may suffice.
        I suggest that you actually make a "Die" class; its constructor
        takes one parameter (the number of faces), and the instance
        has a "roll" method that returns a random number.
        So you test this by making some Die objects and then
        rolling them over and over, and doing statistical tests
        on the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        The final piece in the puzzle takes the number 3 and a Die
        object, rolls the die 3 times, and adds up the results.
        You test this by making a surrogate "Die" object which
        records the fact that it's been called and what value it
        returned. Then you check that the thing's been called the
        right number of times and that the sum of the results is what
        it's meant to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        One final remark about all this: actually this particular
        problem is simple enough that such heavyweight testing
        might be a mistake. But the same principles can be applied
        to bigger and harder problems. If I were writing your
        program, I'd write a single short function to turn "3d6"
        into a suitably-distributed random number from 3 to 18,
        and I would test it only informally. But then, I'm not a
        fully paid up member of the Extreme Party, and I have a
        pretty decent idea of what sort of thing I can write without
        making non-trivial mistakes and what sort of thing I can't.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Although (again, from what this egg understands), the XP way would be to delay refactoring until the first engineering task has been completed.  It's very easy to look at "3d6" and think you need a function to parse it, but you don't need anything like that yet.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. I'd think in terms of testing a Die object first, with a constructor that takes an integer. Perhaps later I'd get to the user story that mentions that we might want to role multiple dice for a single score. Perhaps then I'd need a Dice object, whose constructor might accept an integer and a Die. I could then test Dice using a DummyDie that isn't very random!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I would separate out the Dice object (that interprets the "xDy" format) from the object that does the random number generation.   That way you can write a <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> random number generator that tests that your Dice parses strings correctly and passes the expected arguments to the RNG.  The random number generator itself will typically be provided as part of the standard library, and so you won't have to test that class explicitly.
      </p>

      <p>
        I will shortly post an even simpler example in C so that only simple programming structures are used. -- DaNuke
