        This may or may not be what the original poster had in mind:

        If it isn't, could somebody provide a link, please?

        I went to Amazon.com and searched "Books" for "classics in software".
        The search results (the first 10 books), every single one of them were
        "Out of Print--Limited Availability" except for the last one -- "Not yet released."

        Somehow I find this disturbing.

        My grandfather recently gave me a copy of the book
        _Classics in Software Engineering_ edited by Edward Nash Yourdon, copyright 1979.
        -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Right on the copyright page it says
      </p>
      <p>
        "This book was set in Times Roman by YOURDON Press, using a PDP-11/45 running under the UNIX operating system."
      </p>

        No doubt using troff.
