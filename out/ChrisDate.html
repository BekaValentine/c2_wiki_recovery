      <p>
        Christopher J Date, the current maintainer of the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, initiated by <a href="EfCodd.html">EfCodd</a>.  More information at <a href="DbDebunk.html">DbDebunk</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What exactly is meant by "maintainer"?  Is this an official title?  Or is he simply regarded by others in the relational community as the most knowledgeable researcher on the subject?</em> I suspect that the writer intended the latter. I don't know if he's the <em>most</em> knowledgeable, but he and his frequent collaborator <a href="HughDarwen.html">HughDarwen</a> are certainly among the most visible relational proponents to the general programming populace.

        For somebody who is a bit "forceful" about his opinions, <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> does not seem to spend much energy trying to popularize his ideas. He comes across as an arrogant elitist at times. Also, I think it may be possible to make relational operators/functions that are more user-friendly (based on combinations of primitives). As long as they don't violate the relational rules, I see no reason why such could not be included.

      </p>
      <p>
        That's an odd thing to say, given all the books and articles he's written, and the fact that one of his texts is, AFAIK, a widely-used introductory college text.

        I can see where you might get that impression, but I've exchanged a fair amount of correspondence with Chris, and he's actually quite charming. But he does not compromise on rigor and clarity of thought in his field of expertise. (I made a point of reviewing my messages to him several times before sending them.) There is no shame in that -- he's been working in this field for a very long time, and understands (at least) the theoretical aspects of data organization better than ten modern industry rag pundits put together.
      </p>
      <p>
        [When I first read this page I got the same impression of <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a>. However, after having read some of his articles, he seems to me to be actually a really cool guy. I guess he would come off as more of an elitist than most people in the business, but I think it's because he is very bright; and as far as arrogance is concerned, any hint of that I may have perceived at first has been completely dispelled at least in my limited reading. (And for some reason seeing his picture helped change my first impression of him.)
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, most people are a fresh of breath air after finding nothing but rants from <a href="FabianPascal.html">FabianPascal</a>.]

        That's exactly what he and <a href="HughDarwen.html">HughDarwen</a> do in <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>. In fact, everything is based on a very simple relational algebra of very few operators. The higher-level operators like Join, LeftJoin, Union, etc. are in fact somewhat more user-friendly than the fundamental algebraic operators, but the algebra is really not hard to grasp. And there is no reason not to create additional higher-level operators to address common needs -- in fact, <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> do this themselves in their texts occasionally.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Union and join are primitive operations (or very close to primitive; they're among the "basic eight" (which can be reduced to 5, IIRC).  </em>LeftJoin is only necessary when you have nulls in your database, something that <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> most decidedly does <strong>not</strong> recommend.  See <a href="NullsAndRelationalModel.html">NullsAndRelationalModel</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>, <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> demonstrate that they can be reduced to AND, OR, NOT, and REMOVE. (That's not the only possible minimal set, as they note; simply NOR and REMOVE is an even smaller such set.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Left joins are never <em>necessary</em> per se, but are very convenient. An outer join (or more properly, outer semijoin) can be expressed as a combination of inner or cartesian joins, restrictions, and unions.

        I find <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> to be rigorous in his treatment of the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, and non-rigorous in his treatment of anything that does not fit it.  Specifically, I find his treatment of <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> to be close to dishonest.  He has written <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> and a series of articles where he goes against <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>, specifically attacking at least the type systems used in them.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, not (<em>note?</em>), *after* having written <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> in 1998, he did not understand basic <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> terminology.  Specifically, in the 2001 article <a href="http://www.dbdebunk.citymax.com/page/page/622704.htm">http://www.dbdebunk.citymax.com/page/page/622704.htm</a> he states that he's misunderstood the term "derive" (as in "to derive a class from another class") during the writing of the article. The intended understanding of the term was (in my opinion) also completely obvious from the context for anybody that is at all used to <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> thinking.  From this and other comments by <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a>, I understand that he has not done much (or any?) object oriented programming, but only tried to pick holes in it from a theoretic point of view.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a such, it is interesting to take inspiration from the writing of <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a>, but when they touch on the intersection of OO and relational, they should be taken as what they are: Theoretical writings from somebody without practical experience in OO.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He tends to approach concepts from a theoretical point of view and would probably suggest that OO lacks enough agreed-upon formal theory to analyze properly. Confusion over terminology that you allude to would probably be seen as a side-effect of this. Even experienced OO designers don't always agree on terminology, especially if they come from very different language backgrounds, such as </em><a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> versus Java. See his quote in <a href="OoLacksConsistencyDiscussion.html">OoLacksConsistencyDiscussion</a>.<em></em>
