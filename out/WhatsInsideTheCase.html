        Whats Inside The Case
      </h1>
      <p>
        A system may appear to be properly configured from all external indicators, but does not exhibit the expected behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first cause is that systems often have a limited ability to report their own state, or you have a limited ability to observe state.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second cause is false assumptions.  You <em>always</em> make assumptions about the internal makeup of a system, based on what you can observe.
      </p>
      <p>
        This pattern applies when a system does not exhibit expected behavior, and reasonable external observations yield no answers as to how to correct the behavior or whether to adjust expectations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In such a case, you may need to find out "what's inside the case:"  examine the system's internal structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examining the system's internal structure can correct for incorrect or vague documentation.  The system may have flaws of its own that you need to correct or work around.  Examining how a system is put together may give you insight into how the designers intended it to be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The danger in using this pattern is that you may replace a simple assumption about what a system does with a more intimate assumption about how it does it.  This assumption may be broken if the design changes.  Also (in cases where the system is a physical entity), playing around with a system is a good way to break it.
