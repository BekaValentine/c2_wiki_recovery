        Broken Test

        At the end of the day, leave the last thing you're working on unfinished. That way, when you start again in the morning (or a week or a month later), the broken bits will refresh your memory about what you were doing.

        Kent restricts his endorsement of this pattern to those who are working solo - it's not appropriate for team development.

        This also works well for getting back into the code after lunch.

        Potentially at odds with <a href="CleanCheckIn.html">CleanCheckIn</a>, though you can do a <a href="CleanCheckIn.html">CleanCheckIn</a> and then write one more test (not checked in) as a reminder for the morning. If you end up doing something else the next day, discarding that test, then no harm is done.
