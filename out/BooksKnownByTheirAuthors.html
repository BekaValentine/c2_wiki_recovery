        Books Known By Their Authors
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some books are known informally by their author(s):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="KernighanAndRitchie.html">KernighanAndRitchie</a> -- <em>The C Programming Language</em>. Until <a href="AnsiCee.html">AnsiCee</a> was standardized; <a href="TheBible.html">TheBible</a> when it came to the <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           OppenheimAndSchafer -- <em></em><a href="DiscreteTimeSignalProcessing.html">DiscreteTimeSignalProcessing</a><em>. The classic introductory text for </em><a href="DigitalSignalProcessing.html">DigitalSignalProcessing</a>.

        <li>
           Knuth -- <em></em><a href="TheArtOfComputerProgramming.html">TheArtOfComputerProgramming</a><em>. One of the definitive works in </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               More often called TAOCP, though. <em>That probably varies by location. As a CS student at </em><a href="CalBerkeley.html">CalBerkeley</a>, I heard "Knuth" more often than "TAOCP".<em></em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> -- <em>Design Patterns</em> (<a href="DesignPatternsBook.html">DesignPatternsBook</a>) by <a href="ErichGamma.html">ErichGamma</a>, <a href="RichardHelm.html">RichardHelm</a>, <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>, and <a href="JohnVlissides.html">JohnVlissides</a>

        <li>
           AbelsonAndSussman -- <em></em><a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a><em> aka </em><a href="TheWizardBook.html">TheWizardBook</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           CLR -- <em>Introduction to Algorithms</em> by <strong>C</strong>ormen, <strong>L</strong>eiserson, and <strong>R</strong>ivest.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Unfortunately, that also stands for <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a>, and probably a few other things as well...
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>Indeed. I can't help being amused when I see late-night TV commercials for this cleaning product:</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="StrunkAndWhite.html">StrunkAndWhite</a> -- <a href="TheElementsOfStyle.html">TheElementsOfStyle</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Fowler's - FowlersModernEnglishUsage
        </li>
        <li>
           Brewer's - BrewersDictionaryOfPhraseAndFable
        </li>
        <li>
           Almost all biochemistry textbooks, and probably most textbooks generally, but only in the context of undergraduate teaching
          <ul>
            <li>
               This happens because nearly every biochem text is named <em>Biochemistry</em>, <em>Advanced Biochemistry</em>, <em>An Introduction to Biochemistry</em>, or something very similar.  The same happens in other fields.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Unfortunately for two of its authors, the book <em>Biological Sequence Analysis</em> by Durbin, Eddy, Krogh, and Mitchison is often referred to as "Durbin and Eddy".
        </li>
        <li>
           On a similar note: although somewhat out of date now, the standard textbook on 3D graphics is still 'Computer Graphics - Principles and Practice', by James D. Foley, Andries van Dam, Steven K. Feiner, and John F. Hughes, which is universally known as 'Foley & Van Dam'.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>That's because they were the only two full authors for the 1st edition. The others were added in the 2nd edition, but the popular name didn't change.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           An even worse case is Brock - 'Biology of Microorganisms' is a textbook originally written by Brock. It is now in its ninth edition; Brock has long since retired/died/etc, and it is now written by Madigan, Martinko and Parker - so the book is known by the name of someone who isn't even an author!
          <ul>
            <li>
               And in the same vein, possibly the most blatant example, Hoyle, as in the phrase "according to Hoyle". Edmund Hoyle <em>b</em>1672, an expert on popular table games of the day, originally penned his <em>A Short Treatise on the Game of Whist</em> in 1742 and is today, though dead lo some 200+ years, seemingly also an authority on online Texas Holdem Poker.
