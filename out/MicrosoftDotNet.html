        <em>A different perspective on the topic</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here in Austria we have a saying that "someone is believing in hot ice-cream" when someone believes in things that just don't go together technically. Please note the careful wording of the speech, which avoids to tell anything about the server side. .NET is a heavyweight technology that will not "just run" everywhere. There is a large gray zone between a simple HTML-like access of a protocol from the client side to a fully supported .NET on the server side. -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The CLR (VM) is like a virtual processor executing its machine (byte, word) codes. Talking about its portability is of no significance at all. Everything important is in the libraries. They can't be independent, because someone has to do all the system related stuff. Some months ago there was no support for Win98, now I read (following your links) that there are restrictions with respect to web development and server components. I really don't know what this means. I think that C# is an important improvement (has learned a lot from Java problems) and I will try it as soon as I have a chance to, but I won't if Win9x systems aren't fully supported. The question of lightweight vs heavyweight depends on how MS handles .NET: it may force customers on upgrade paths and it may offer portability with hidden traps and obstacles. This is what I meant by 'heavyweight'. -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>

But it's just CEO-speak, there's no detail, so we don't know. HL is right.

        What I don't understand about <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> is how MS is going to make money. If it's all open and cross platform, doesn't that take revenue away from Windows sales and open the door to serious competition in the tools arena?

      </p>
      <p>
        People also asked how Sun could make money from Java when they gave it away for free. I think the basic answer is that if you provide some way to make it easier for people to develop software for your systems, you sell more systems. Your competitors may sell more systems too, but so what? Microsoft's well-tuned .NET implementation on Windows servers with <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a>, BackOffice, and all that other MS stuff, along with support for legacy Windows apps as well, will always be more attractive to some than a free mostly-compatible version for some other operating system, so they will sell more Windows licenses. They can get more revenue for development tools and training materials. They may grab some mindshare from Java developers who are using Java on Windows systems just to avoid the Win32 API, MFC, and Visual Basic. I don't think .NET brings any snag or lock-in, but it strengthens the lock-in they already have. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        What about <a href="MicrosoftSecurity.html">MicrosoftSecurity</a> for <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> and its implications? I'm really concerned by the complexity (one might say Byzantine complexity) of the system: you have ActiveX style certificates, Java-style code validators, and a whole spectrum of rights an applet can possess. Even if it's technically feasible, it's going to be much harder for end-users and developers to understand how all the interlocking rights interact, and the consequences of privilege boosting are pretty dire. -- <a href="PeterdaSilva.html">PeterdaSilva</a>

        <em>Helps, in my view. A decent class library, automatic memory management, less Win32 warts and a large choice of languages</em>

        Agree. Using C# to develop GUIs and console apps lets one do the kinds of things that are easy with <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, but without the horrible language. Every once in a while, I find something missing, but it is easy to call Win32 APIs or COM objects to fill in those voids. If you like Java, but need better integration with the Windows world, then you'll probably like C# and .NET.

           OTOH, a <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> application is less stable as both languages (and extensions such as <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>) and OS (the framework) evolves. If a now obsolete version of Microsoft product (e.g. <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> / ASP etc) serve your need adequately, maybe it should be considered as well (as long as there are still lots of similar legacy applications still around).

        I hear someone from Microsoft is recommending new developers to use this <a href="http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/.">http://www.4guysfromrolla.com/.</a> What do people here think of this particular site, compared to the hundreds of others around (e.g. codeproject, gotdotnet, etc.)? -- dl

        More than one person noted in 2005 that <a href="MicrosoftUnix.html">MicrosoftUnix</a> is having a high profile presence in "Linux Today". Hopefully <a href="WindowsServerTwoThousandThree.html">WindowsServerTwoThousandThree</a> and its descendants will not run on high powered Unix boxes (<a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> has a few) too quickly, to leave room for innovation.

        Language Integrated Queries (LINQ) is something I am having trouble getting my head around.  <a href="EmbeddedSql.html">EmbeddedSql</a> was something I remember as not having worked out so well in the 70s but now it seems to be a very important part of the new version of <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>.  There are some clever extensions to the language involving anonymous delegates and type inference associated with LINQ, but I don't understand what has changed in the programming landscape to make it a good idea to once more introduce <a href="EmbeddedSql.html">EmbeddedSql</a> into a mainstream language.  What am I missing? -- <a href="SkipSailors.html">SkipSailors</a>

        <em>Well, there is a difference, first, LINQ is not SQL, SQL should be standard, but the fact is that you can not be 100% sure that a particular SQL sentence will work in all databases, but with LINQ, custom mappers can be built, and thanks to them the exact same LINQ sentence can be used for any of the supported databases (and support can be added by third party developers for particular databases, or even for OSQL languages (like </em><a href="HiberNate.html">HiberNate</a> HSQL). Another difference is that LINQ can be extended to be used as a query language for XML files, CSV files, or even in memory structures (Arrays, LinkedLists, HashMaps) and therefore gives you the ability to "query" semi-declaratively memory structures that normaly can only be processed with procedural code... what is the advantage? well, with traditional control structures, if you are looking for a Person object in an array of Persons, you have to loop from start to finish, object by object, wasting the potential optimizations that current multi-core computers could offer, but with LINQ you can specify that you want all the Person object that match with a particular condition and LINQ will be able to use the best possible strategy to do the search (parallel processing, indexing, etc, etc) that effectively brings the advantages of optimized query processing in to in memory operations (finally we have a language that transparently takes advantage of the benefits of NimbleDatabases, and it doest it even for simple collection structures)<em></em>

        I suspect its partly due to holdout fans (like me) of "data-oriented languages" (such as <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, Paradox, and <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>) where DB-like collection-orientation was built right into the language. Going through an OOP API for such is a pain compared to having it built in and us data fans miss the more direct "older" way. MS has a habit of dumping just about every paradigm/flavor into a tool in order to capture a wide audience; and perhaps to stay ahead of the open-source clones by out-featuring them. But it  creates a monster. They will do to the new VB what they did to the old one: clutter it up over time by extending onto an outdated language platform. (And Windows too for that matter. It's the MS way.) --top
