        Microsoft Anti Trust

      <p>
        The Microsoft Anti-Trust case is still ongoing, it has proven <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> enjoys TrustStatus according to the ShermanAntiTrustAct.
      </p>
      <p>
        The MainArgument of the case is that <a href="MicrosoftInternetExplorer.html">MicrosoftInternetExplorer</a> is the most popular browser because it was BunDled (<a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>!) with <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> which happens to be the most popular <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> out there. <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a> claimed that DeIntegrating <a href="MicrosoftInternetExplorer.html">MicrosoftInternetExplorer</a> and <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> would be impossible and increase support costs. Famously, this claim was rebutted by Fetser's 98Lite where he demonstrated <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> 98 running without any IE at all. The court ruled that OS and <a href="InternetBrowser.html">InternetBrowser</a> were separate. They also ruled that <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> intentionally bundled <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> and browser in order to compete with <a href="NetScape.html">NetScape</a>. (More Stupid <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> - find actual page name.)

        The act of using a monopoly to wipe out competitors is called being NetScaped.
