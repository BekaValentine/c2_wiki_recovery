        <em>The first paragraph of the marketing text is perhaps the best example of opaque jargon-infected advertising copy I have read in days, outside of parody. --</em><a href="BillTozier.html">BillTozier</a><em></em>

        Meaningless buzzwords and advertising hype highlighted.  I've left unhighlighted such buzzwords as actually describe what the project does:

        <dd>IBM <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Application Server is built on <strong>open, reusable technologies</strong> that <strong>leverage your existing resources, shorten development cycles and ease your administrative burden.</strong> The Standard Edition lets you use Java servlets, Java Server Pages and XML to quickly transform static Web sites into <strong>vital</strong> sources of dynamic Web content. The Advanced Edition is a <strong>high-performance</strong> EJB server for implementing EJB components that <strong>incorporate business logic.</strong> The Enterprise Edition integrates EJB and CORBA components to build <strong>high-transaction, high-volume</strong> e-business applications.</dd>

        I think the problem may be just that they're trying to be too information dense.  I will concede that even I can't explain the first sentence :)  However, translation key attached for the rest:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>open, reusable technologies</em> -- meaning we use things from Apache like the Apache Web Servier (The IBM HTTP Server is explicitly "powered by Apache") and Xerces and Xalan.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>high-performance</em> -- IBM has spent a lot of time performance-tuning Websphere to ensure that it performs at least as well, if not better than its competitors (e.g. <a href="WebLogic.html">WebLogic</a>, Oracle, Inprise, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>incorporate business logic</em> -- meaning that you put your business logic (e.g code that does domain things) in EJB's rather than in your GUI front ends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>high-transaction, high-volume</em> -- meaning that EE includes ENCINA and CICS, which are used to build some of the world's biggest, fastest, TP systems, like those use by stock exchanges, banks and insurance companies.  I could give you numbers, but I'd have to shoot you :) [Clarification: <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> interoperates with CICS TS (an OS/390 product) via RMI/IIOP, but CICS TS is not packaged as part of EE/390.] [Actually, once upon a time, WAS EE on the Distributed platform DID ship with CICS for Distributed platforms in the box...]
