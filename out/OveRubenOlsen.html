        My real name in writing is really Ove Ruben R Olsen (note the lack of punctuation); my real name in oral performance (that is talking) is Ruben Olsen.

        Over the years (ca 1988 to present), my online name has changed several times. The most creative was The Gnarfer.

        Over the years, I have been involved in various net-projects, but after growing up (and getting a full time job (<a href="http://www.bdc.no/))">http://www.bdc.no/))</a> the time on various projects is very limited. This I deeply do not like. At the present, I have one project running for the Norwegian Macintosh community, an <em>iTools</em> clone.

        One of the <em>things</em> that I have taken a long-term relationship with is organizing information and I find the Wiki a cool way to do this (albeit extremely disorganized ;-). I learned the usability of information design and organization while working at Bergen University Library (1990 - 1996).

        BTW - if my English sucks you are probably right since it is not my 1. language.
