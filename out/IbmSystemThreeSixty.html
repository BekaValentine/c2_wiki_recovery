        The architecturally compatible line of <a href="MainframeComputer.html">MainframeComputer</a>s whose success, following huge financial risk, allowed IBM (<a href="InternationalBusinessMachines.html">InternationalBusinessMachines</a>) to dominate the <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> business in the 1960s and 1970s. The whole project was led by <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a>; <a href="GeneAmdahl.html">GeneAmdahl</a> was the chief architect for the hardware.

        Its logo was a compass rose, signifying the 360 degrees - the full circle - of computing applications that could be addressed with the System/360 architecture, replacing the previously customarily separate lines of commercially oriented <a href="MainframeComputer.html">MainframeComputer</a>s versus scientifically oriented <a href="SuperComputer.html">SuperComputer</a>s. <em>Also the full software-compatiblity across (almost) the entire price range of 360 models, another "first" and one of the line's central achievements.</em>

        Brooks decided that it would adopt EbcdicCode, an 8-bit character set including lower-case letters, another significant milestone for the time.

        Its instruction set was summarized on a folding quick reference printed on mint-green 
        card stock, thus coming to be known throughout much of the computer industry as the <em>Green Card</em>.  The instruction set of its successor <em>System/370</em> architecture, whose fully developed models were characterized by <em>virtual memory</em> and <em>cache</em> features,
        was printed on yellow or light-goldenrod card stock, and quickly dubbed the <em>Yellow Card</em>.

        While the hardware was considered a great success, the project to create the system software became a bellwether of the <a href="SoftwareCrisis.html">SoftwareCrisis</a>. <em></em><a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a><em> was mostly based on </em><a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a>' experience as head of the project.
