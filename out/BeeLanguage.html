        The ancestor of C Language (<a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>). As well as C, B was created by K&R [see <a href="ChickenAndEggProblem.html">ChickenAndEggProblem</a>]
        Brian Kernighan had no part in the creation of B or C. Ken Thompson created B, and Dennis Ritchie created C.

        <em>More specifically, Dennis Ritchie says (in </em><a href="http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html)">http://www.cs.bell-labs.com/who/dmr/chist.html)</a> that <a href="BeeLanguage.html">BeeLanguage</a> is the<em> parent </em>of <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike C, B has really limited features. It has only one type: the cell (essentially a machine word). The first implementations used <a href="DirectThreadedCode.html">DirectThreadedCode</a> instead of being compiled.

        See also <a href="BcplLanguage.html">BcplLanguage</a> which was its predecessor.

        Incidentally, Dennis Ritchie's paper explains the origin of the default unix binary name <em>a.out</em> as being <em>output from the assembler</em> on the PDP-7 being used to develop the first Unix.
