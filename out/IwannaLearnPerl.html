        On <a href="DefinitivePerlBooks.html">DefinitivePerlBooks</a>, <em></em><a href="LearningPerl.html">LearningPerl</a><em> by Schwartz and Christiansen is called "The most commonly recommended book for anyone needing a gentler introduction than the Blue Camel [</em><a href="CamelBook.html">CamelBook</a>]". After <em>Learning Perl</em>, you should get hold of <em></em>IntermediatePerl<em> (ISBN 0596102062) - formerly </em>Learning Perl Objects, References & Modules<em> (ISBN 0596004788). </em><a href="http://learn.perl.org/">http://learn.perl.org/</a> lists a number of good <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> books.

        As you get into Perl (or are coming from another language where you already have a OO grounding) and want to know how to implement OO behaviour in a Perlish way, you would do well to read <a href="DamianConway.html">DamianConway</a>'s book <em></em><a href="ObjectOrientedPerl.html">ObjectOrientedPerl</a><em>. It is also well worth checking out the </em><a href="ManPage.html">ManPage</a>s perlboot and perltoot. -- <a href="DarrenTarbard.html">DarrenTarbard</a>

        If anyone here really does want to learn Perl, I would highly suggest a book by Ellie Quigley, based on a popular class she teaches, and called <strong>Perl by Example</strong>. You will want the third edition (ISBN: 0-13-655689-2). -- <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>

        Really? Having read that one I found it to be atrocious. Perhaps not quite the worst I've seen, but fairly bad anyway (in fact, I'm yet to be impressed by any of that publisher's produce). -- IainTruskett

        <em>Having had a look through a copy I just found in my office, I'm not impressed at all - it strikes me as being like trying to learn a language from a phrasebook. The approach of </em><a href="LearningPerl.html">LearningPerl</a> is much more logical. Anyway, Amazon says this one is now out of print, so I would definitely recommend against it. As a general point, Perl learners should consider joining their local Perl Mongers chapter - see <a href="http://www.pm.org/">http://www.pm.org/</a> for details. Having a friendly community around to talk to and ask questions of helped my learning process immensely. -- EarleMartin<em></em>

        I'm surprised to see any book Joshua favors disliked by other. I know he demands a great deal from anyone who claims to educate. Perhaps my unorthodox introduction has colored his expectation in this case. I taught Joshua perl in an afternoon over a chat connection. I did this by creating <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> as a cgi scrip on my server and aliasing the source as a .txt file he could read. We then discussed things that the script might do. I would implement one of these in a line or two that he could read and try. In the few cases where the perl idioms were not obvious a line or two of chat was enough to make the program clear. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Hello folks,
      </p>
      <p>
        This is my first day at Wiki. I am enjoying this here even though I admit that its a bit of <a href="CultureShock.html">CultureShock</a> for me. This page will essentially deal with <a href="PerlProgramming.html">PerlProgramming</a> and getting started with it. I am an amateur Perl programmer and I have had a number of people asking me on how to learn Perl, where to get started etc. Though I have given them directions, I am sure they haven't still started learning Perl yet. Frankly am not an expert (I learnt Perl over a weekend ) so I am not even sure if I was giving them right directions. Here I would like suggestions on where a person should start if he/she wants to learn Perl. We can discuss people from different backgrounds and how each one would get started. This is essential because a Java programmer thinks differently from a person who hasn't had any programming experience at all. I'll try to update this as frequently as possible. I already have a few ideas on this. -- PerlPathi

           came across this intro Perl page from a person who has written lots of material on HTML, etc. Location is at <a href="http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/perl/course.html">http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/perl/course.html</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Is it suitable for beginners?
              <ul>
                <li>
                   No. It uses at least four outdated and/or dangerous idioms which beginners should avoid until they understand the language:
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       Use of the comma operator to concatenate output for a print statement.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Use of the two-argument form of open (and minor nit: using '||' instead of 'or' for the die statement).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       All variables are declared global instead of lexical with 'my'. This code will not pass 'use strict'.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Use of the &sub calling convention.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
