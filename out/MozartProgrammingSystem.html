        Mozart Programming System
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Mozart Programming System is an advanced development platform for intelligent, distributed applications. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mozart is based on the <a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a>, which supports <a href="DeclarativeProgramming.html">DeclarativeProgramming</a>, <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a>, and concurrency as part of a coherent whole. And <a href="TransparentDistribution.html">TransparentDistribution</a>. Should the <a href="MilosProject.html">MilosProject</a> succeed, the Oz-E variant of Oz will also be an <a href="ObjectCapabilityLanguage.html">ObjectCapabilityLanguage</a>.

        Version 1.3.0 of Mozart/Oz was released on April 15, 2004. <a href="TheOzBook.html">TheOzBook</a> was designed to be accompanied by this version. Even if you're not interested in <a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a>, go read <a href="TheOzBook.html">TheOzBook</a>.  It's a great companion to <a href="TheWizardBook.html">TheWizardBook</a>.

      <p>
        Version 1.3.2 was released on 2006/06/15.
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 1.4.0 was released on 2008/07/03.  This version has a complete redesign of the network-transparent distribution support, based on Raphael Collet's Ph.D. dissertation:

        <em>Is the language still under active development, or is it effectively dead?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Distributed Oz was released as 1.4.0 in July, 2008.
      </p>

        One exciting development is the work done on QHTML as a declarative web interfaces alternative to QTk.

        Perhaps some of the momentum has transferred over to <a href="AliceLanguage.html">AliceLanguage</a>, which to me seems not quite as interesting a language (it's SML with extra goodies) though its interactive interpreter is far less cumbersome to use.

      <p>
        Alice is a functional programming language based on Standard ML [<a href="SmlLanguage.html">SmlLanguage</a>], extended with support for concurrent, distributed, and constraint programming. Alice extends Standard ML with several new features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AliceLanguage.html">AliceLanguage</a> builds on the experience gained through developing the Mozart system. Previous versions of Alice were based on the Mozart <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> -- it now uses the <a href="SeamVirtualMachine.html">SeamVirtualMachine</a>.
