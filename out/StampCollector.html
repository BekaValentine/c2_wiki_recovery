        Stamp Collector
      </h1>
      <p>
        Stamp Collectors collect specific examples. When asked to solve a problem, they try to find the closest match. They then use that example as a template for the correct course of action. Contrast <a href="ModelMaker.html">ModelMaker</a>.

      <p>
        Stamp Collectors don't want to know why you push in the clutch when changing gears in a stick-shift car.

        No, not the guy who likes collecting stamps.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stamp Collecting is a frame of thought where one is primarily interested in 'simple' answers to questions (i.e., How do you do <foo>?  Step 1: ... Step 2: ..., etc...), and not the underlying reasons, forces, etc.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When faced with flaws, Stamp Collectors prefer to patch symptoms,
        rather than continually refactor designs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interest in underlying reasons and forces vs. requiring 'simple' steps seems to be the main difference between Stamp Collectors and PeopleWhoLikePatterns.
