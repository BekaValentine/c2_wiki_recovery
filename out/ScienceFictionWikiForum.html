        As one can foresee an avalanche of <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> related contributions in <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, the undersigner calls for a dedicated forum on this topic.
        Perhaps someone can point to an existing forum being at the same high level as here.

      <p>
        <a href="ScienceFictionWikiForum.html">ScienceFictionWikiForum</a> is also entered in <a href="WikiEnginesWanted.html">WikiEnginesWanted</a>, because it would be nice to have a special purpose <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> supporting VRML, multimedia 3D applets, etc. that could be uploaded by the Wikizens. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>

        Just for info, check out <a href="WikiForumsCategorized.html">WikiForumsCategorized</a> -- I think there are two entries under science fiction so far, and there may be more to come. (One is German, one is Swedish, but the Swedish one seems to be primarily in English -- I forget whether the German one is English or German (or mixed).) -- <a href="RandyKramer.html">RandyKramer</a>

        There is so much SF content already here it would be a shame for it not to be copied. What would it take for it to be okay to copy it?
