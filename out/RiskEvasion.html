        Strictly, it's only <a href="RiskEvasion.html">RiskEvasion</a> if we actually do get away with it. If we don't our project just goes down as another victim of risk. <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> features heavily in this strategy. The phrase, "it's a calculated risk" may well be employed, which means: it's a risk but I can't be bothered to calculate it.
