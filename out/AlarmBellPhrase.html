        For me, nearly any <a href="ManagerSpeak.html">ManagerSpeak</a> is an alarm bell -- using "challenge" for "problem," for instance. Problems are the be-all and end-all of engineering, and nobody should denigrate them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Houston, we have a challenge" would not have saved the 3 on board Apollo 13; a "problem," however, makes a true engineer ready to tackle the world, because WE EXIST TO REMOVE PROBLEMS! -- Pete Hardie
      </p>
      <p>
        Same goes for "opportunity." I always like to refer to it as a big, steaming pile of opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        OTOH, I used to know a stage manager who produced really big shows. One of the shows he worked on had government bureaucrats involved. Whenever anyone said on the radio "We've got a problem here" the bureaucrats would flock to the location and get in the way, causing more problems then they were solving. The techs quickly learned to say "I have an opportunity here..." -- Jim Hyslop

           "There are no politics at this company."

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>What is alarming about this phrase?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>It means that the company is a dictatorship.  This statement can be given with a smile or a snarl, but if it's given with a smile the first day you're there, the company might actually be a good place to work.  It's an exceptional leader who can say this without inspiring fear.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To try to answer my own question: In <a href="PeopleWare.html">PeopleWare</a>, they mention how many different things people label as "politics". Ultimately, people use it to describe any sociological aspect of a project. Maybe the person who finds the phrase, "There are no politics here," to be alarming has heard it used to mean, "We are going to ignore the sociological aspect. (And we'll do it my way, regardless of your feedback, thanks!)". Could this be what they meant? <em>Partly, yes.</em> In the particular case I have in mind, the company was actually rife with under-the-table (and sometimes under-handed) political maneuvering. But because the company "had no politics" there was no above-board way to acknowledge the political realities.
