      <p>
        As a shorthand to refer pages in another Wiki, an external Wikipage reference
        looks like this: Wiki:<a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> (e.g. <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> referenced from <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wiki
        </li>
        <li>
           please add
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Because <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is the first of its kind, it has the unique prefix "Wiki".

        I don't get it. That syntax doesn't work here. Why should we care what other sites use for off-site references? They should document their stuff there, not here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not sure I like the syntax, anyway. The stuff that comes before the colon should name a protocol, like http or news or ftp. As far as I can tell, you are using it instead to be the name of the site. Isn't this flouting existing conventions and standards? -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

      <p>
        What about dropping the colon and writing WikiWikiPage instead of Wiki:<a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>? 
        The underlying <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> would parse the prefix out and route to the remote <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> accordingly. -- fp

        Unless all of the collaborating Wiki Engines conform to the same rules for recognizing links, a prefix won't be sufficient. Classic Wiki, for example, doesn't recognize diacriticals. Also, the engines would some way to map a link name to the URL expected by the target Wiki.
        How is Wiki to know that a link to
        Foo<strong>'Wiki:</strong><a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> should map to
        "http<strong>'://www.random.org/foowiki?read=</strong><a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>"?
