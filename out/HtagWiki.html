        <a href="HtagWiki.html">HtagWiki</a> is a Wiki written in the <a href="HtagLanguage.html">HtagLanguage</a> by <a href="SvenNeumann.html">SvenNeumann</a> and has currently one instance running at <a href="http://wiki.ywp.d2g.com.">http://wiki.ywp.d2g.com.</a> [<em>broken link</em>]

        <strong>I have now added most of the basic formatting!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would really welcome peer review, comments and dialogue. I have yet to find a nice list of <a href="TextFormattingRegularExpressions.html">TextFormattingRegularExpressions</a> for the various <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>. Please drop in and test my <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> at <a href="http://wiki.ywp.d2g.com.">http://wiki.ywp.d2g.com.</a> -- <a href="SvenNeumann.html">SvenNeumann</a>

        <em>How? The site gave "you don't have permission to access / on this server"!</em>

        I'm sorry, I had to take the wiki offline for now. As it was used for internal company work. I've now implemented a multiple pagesets login system, and hope to bring the original public <a href="HtagWiki.html">HtagWiki</a> back online.
      </p>

        I've rewritten and decomposited the <a href="HtagWiki.html">HtagWiki</a> as far as is possible with the current <a href="HtagLanguage.html">HtagLanguage</a> syntax. I found many deficits I had not encountered while using it as a simple dynamic website language. The lack of complex data types and local variables makes functional decomposition awkward and recursion <em>extremely</em> messy. Maybe now that I have regular expressions, rewriting the parser for more concise syntax would be much easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope soon the code will be more or less in a release state so I can start filling the <a href="HtagWiki.html">HtagWiki</a> pages at last.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now supports the outing mechanism, double bars/slashes as well as the html style <i> and <b>.
        Also does monospacing as well as ordered and unordered bulleting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Will be moved to <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a> soon and gain the remaining formatting options.
      </p>

        <em>Beware that until a problem with page size on </em><a href="HtagWiki.html">HtagWiki</a> is resolved, it's easy to lose the end of a page as it gets larger. Despite having first noticed the problem, I still lost one of your replies by accident.<em></em>
