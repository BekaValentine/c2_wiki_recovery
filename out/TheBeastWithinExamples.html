        <strong><em>ConvinceYourBrotherHeHasPsychicPowers</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One summer when my brother and I were kids, I convinced him he was psychic.  I am two years older than my brother, and at the time, he was 12.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had from an early age been interested in stage magic.  Early on, this meant learning how they used props and gimmicks to produce illusions.  But as I grew older, I started to realize that the <em>real</em> trick with magic was using people's assumptions and willingness to believe.  In other words, it was manipulating people, not just stupid linking rings or silk handkerchiefs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was around that time I decided it would be funny to pull a prank on my brother.  The initial conversation went like this:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>	</dt>
        <dd>	Me:  <em>Hey, I just read that lots of people have psychic powers.  You might even have them!</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	</dt>
        <dd>	He:  <em>Wow!</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	</dt>
        <dd>	Me:  <em>Let's do a simple test.  I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 10.  You tell me what it is!</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	</dt>
        <dd>	He:  <em>Uuuh, 5?</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	</dt>
        <dd>	Me:  <em>Right!  Well, that doesn't prove anything.  We have to do this several times before we can tell if you're psychic.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        You can probably figure out what happened next.  He never picked up that there was no way to verify what number I had really thought of-- or even if I had thought of a number at all.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I would ask him to guess the number I was thinking of, he would come up with a number, and I would indicate (most of the time) that he was right.  I was smart enough to know that he would never believe he had flawless psychic ability, so I introduced a few errors every now and then to make it more believable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once I had suckered him in, I decided to see how far I could take this.  We started to do experiments.  I had him put a piece of aluminum foil on his head because I wanted to see if metal would block his psychic ability."  No, it didn't, but through experimentation we found that clear plastic wrap did attenuate his abilities somewhat.  We then did a distance check where we repeated the same experiment using walkie-talkies.  Guess what-- he was psychic for up to 100 feet away!
      </p>
      <p>
        I was learning about basic electronics at the time and had some test equipment.  In one of my more inspired moments, I gave my brother the probes to an analog multimeter set to measure ohms.  I told him to touch the metal leads.  Of course, skin resistance caused the needle to move.  As we continued in our psychic experiments, I would eye the needle and write down meaningless numbers.  Boy, was he impressed.  <em>(Note this was several years before I learned about Scientology...)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of thing went on for the rest of the day-- right up until Mom came home from work.  My brother wanted to demonstrate his psychic abilities to our mother, and asked her to think of a number that he would guess.  He guessed wrong.  Not discouraged, he tried again and missed again.  A third time and he missed again.  My brother looked disappointed and had a frown.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mom could always tell when I was up to something.  She only had to look at me and the growing smile on my face to know that I was being evil again.  She yelled at me, "John, what's going on here?!"  My brother then explained it all-- that we had discovered he was psychic, but that for some reason he couldn't read Mom's mind-- maybe because she was a grown-up...
      </p>
      <p>
        Mom figured it all out in a millisecond and gave me a look that I would end up seeing many times after that.

        -- It should be noted that the use of magical principles to con someone is called "Charlantry" and one who does so a "Charlatan".
        This is universally despised in the magic community.  So maybe you learned less then you thought you did.
