        Simulated Dynamic Binding

      <code>
        template <class _T><br/>
        class CMyXMLBase : public CExpatImpl <_T><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>I can't figure out why everyone keeps doing that. In this case, it's probably a doggerel version of the </em>AbstractTemplate <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>. If so, make CExpatImpl into a concrete class and an abstract interface (IExpat, for example). Then CMyXMLBase inherits IExpat and resolves any methods we need in it, such as OnStartElement or OnEndElement.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Appendix A of <em>ATL Internals</em> talks about this, as well as an article on devx [1].  It's been called "simulated dynamic binding", "ATL style inheritance", "upside down inheritance", "static polymorphism", [the "<a href="CuriouslyRecurringTemplate.html">CuriouslyRecurringTemplate</a> pattern"] and other things.  It's used quite a bit in <a href="ActiveTemplateLibrary.html">ActiveTemplateLibrary</a> / <a href="WindowsTemplateLibrary.html">WindowsTemplateLibrary</a> for various <a href="BaseClass.html">BaseClass</a>es.  It's not mutually exclusive to an interface, but is often used in conjunction with an interface (such as IDispatchImpl, IProvideClassInfo2Impl, etc.).  It's also the technique used by of all the "<a href="MixIn.html">MixIn</a>" windowing base classes of ATL / WTL (CWindowImpl, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        Using this approach, in the base class you do something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        T* pT = static_cast<T*>(this);<br/>
        pT->OverrideableFunction();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It's essentially like having "OverrideableFunction" be a virtual function, but with a couple of benefits:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It saves at least 2 levels of indirection (with a virtual function pointer and virtual function table) at run-time.
        </li>
        <li>
           The calculations for a static_cast<> are performed at compile time, so the code can be optimized better because it's a compile-time thing rather than a run-time thing. (The compiler might even be able to inline the function call - which would be impossible if using a virtual function).
        </li>
        <li>
           It can possibly save you from needing a v-table and virtual function pointer altogether - which saves at least the 4 byte virtual function pointer per instance, plus the size of the virtual table.
        </li>
        <li>
           Your base class doesn't have to define the method - thus acting like a <a href="PureVirtual.html">PureVirtual</a> function that has to be defined in derived classes or you get compile errors.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can call static methods on the derived class. (And technically you could use public member variables as well - both static and non-static.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Other stuff I'm forgetting I'm sure.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Item #5 can't be done with virtual classes and functions even if you wanted to.  Just one of the many examples of this in the <a href="ActiveTemplateLibrary.html">ActiveTemplateLibrary</a> is when you are making a COM object with ATL: you define "BEGIN_COM_MAP", which expands to you defining a handful of static methods and members that the base class CComObjectRootEx calls to help implement <a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, that's not to say that every single bit of code using "template <T> class Base : public T" always do things right, or that the author understood what it's doing.  I haven't look at CExpatImpl, so I can't speak to its use.  But if you use the technique correctly, it's a good thing, IMO.

        Although the ActivexTemplateLibrary list used to debate whether <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> was the first in print, Coplien himself attributes the [<a href="CuriouslyRecurringTemplate.html">CuriouslyRecurringTemplate</a>] pattern to others. The article Igor mentioned is reproduced in <em>C++ Gems</em> (ISBN 0135705819) -- TimTabor

        I must say that the non-traditional inheritance (<a href="DynamicBinding.html">DynamicBinding</a>) has allowed us to create a really cool skinning engine at our company. We take full advantage of the dynamic binding to create our skinned UI and our lower-level classes. We couldn't have done what we have done in WTL with <a href="MicrosoftFoundationClasses.html">MicrosoftFoundationClasses</a> or without <a href="DynamicBinding.html">DynamicBinding</a>. -- ScottAndrew

        Gee, why do a lot of porn queries redirect to this topic? :-)
