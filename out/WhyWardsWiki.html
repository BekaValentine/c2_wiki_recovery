        Q: <a href="WhyDoYouWasteYourTimeHere.html">WhyDoYouWasteYourTimeHere</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: I waste my time here because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is here I first discovered the value of collaboration and the synergy of like-mindedness in a community of trustworthy people
        </li>
        <li>
           It is here I have been introduced to concepts and ideas I would not have encountered elsewhere
        </li>
        <li>
           It is here I have learned to apply discrimination in the pages I read and the pages I contribute
        </li>
        <li>
           It is here I have observed the interactions of people about the systems, technology, thinking and working processes employed in the business of computing
        </li>
        <li>
           It is here I have come to value the importance of critical thinking and the resolution of complex problems and issues.
        </li>
        <li>
           I am observing the evolution of personal expression in a free-form venue which allows newbies and veterans to interact and learn from each other.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are just a few of the reasons which come to mind. Other reasons exists, but the foregoing are enough to convince me that if one has time to waste, there is not a better place to waste it than here. Over 25000 pages of information and expressions which have developed over the last 8 years, and provided by a visionary who not only invented the wiki, but is tolerant enough to allow the existence of pages that ask questions, promote a technological viewpoint, compare alternatives and introduce new concepts and issues that are developing in the Ongoing and challenging field of computing. -- <a href="AnonymousOnPurpose.html">AnonymousOnPurpose</a>
