        <strong>Interpreter</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Given a language define a representation for its grammar along with an interpreter that uses the representation to interpret sentences in the language.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        At first sight it seems a little hard to find uses for this pattern.  The example in GoF is a regular expression matching interpreter which most of us either take for granted or do without.  However, the first sentence of the motivation gives a clue as to how to use this pattern:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If a particular type of problem occurs often enough, then     it might be worthwhile to express instances of the problem as sentences in a simple language.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Examples</em>
      </p>

        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
           Anything that requires parsing
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Warning:</strong> this pattern is not <em>Parser</em>.  It specifically does not address the issue of parsing your sentence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Method:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        First define your grammar, and then construct a class hierarchy that describes your grammar.  Each rule is a class; each symbol in the rule is an instance of the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example: Graph Drawing</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose your are writing a graph drawing application.  You want to graph simple functions such as <em>y = 2x^2 + ln x + 1</em>.  This is a simple sentence in mathematics.  The grammar may be described something like
      </p>
      <code>
        constant   ::= '0'|'1'| ... |'9'| {'0'|...|'9'}* |<br/>
        {'0'|...|'9'}*'.'{'0'|...|'9'}*<br/>
        variable   ::= 'x'<br/>
        add        ::= expression '+' expression<br/>
        subtract   ::= expression '-' expression<br/>
        multiply   ::= expression '*' expression<br/>
        divide     ::= expression '/' expression<br/>
        power      ::= expression '^' expression<br/>
        unary      ::= '-'expression | 'ln('expression')' |<br/>
        'sin('expression')'|...|'function('expression')'<br/>
        expression ::= constant | variable | add | subtract | multiply |<br/>
        divide | power | unary | '('expression')'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There are two types of expression class: those that represent terminal expressions (they hold no references to further expression classes) e.g. constant and variable, and non-terminal classes which are typically rules that represent compound expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Classes representing the binary operators add, subtract, multiply, divide and power may be written as
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Addition extends AbstractExpression {<br/>
        private AbstractExpression left, right ;<br/>
        public Addition(AbstractExpression left,<br/>
        AbstractExpression right) {<br/>
        this.left = left ;<br/>
        this.right = right ;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        while those representing unary expressions will be similar but take a single AbstractExpression.  Finally:
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Constant extends AbstractExpression {<br/>
        private double value ;<br/>
        public Constant(double value) {<br/>
        this.value = value ;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and the class representing the variable has nothing in it so far.
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Variable extends AbstractExpression {<br/>
        public Variable() {}<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        As mentioned above, the problem this pattern does not address is that of parsing sentences in the grammar.  Specifically it provides no way to get from the equation <em>y = 2 * x^2 + ln(x) + 1</em> to its class representation. This is someone else's problem.  The class representation looks something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        Addition<br/>
        _________/    \_________<br/>
        /			       \<br/>
        Multiplication     	       	      Addition<br/>
        / 	     \			        /    \ <br/>
        Constant        Power 	  	  Logarithm  Constant<br/>
        / \		      |<br/>
        /   \		      |<br/>
        /	    \  	       	      |<br/>
        Variable  Constant	  Variable<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Where the lines represent <em>is a member of</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, we must implement an <em>interpret</em> method for each concrete subclass of AbstractExpression.  In this case we shall make <em>interpret</em> a member function of the concrete subclasses.  It will take a double as its single parameter.  The way the graph drawing program will use this structure is as follows.  Suppose it wants to graph the equation above with the <em>x</em>-range from 0 to five, plotting points every 0.1.  Then it would call interpret on the structure above for each value of <em>x</em> from 0 to 5 in intervals of 0.1.  Let the top addition class be a field called <em>function</em>.  The the program would do
      </p>
      <code>
        for (double x = 0; x<=5; x += 0.1) { 	   	  <br/>
        double y = function.interpret(x) ; 	 	  <br/>
        plot(x, y) ; 	 	<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now, the interpret function is implemented as:
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Addition {<br/>
        double interpret (double x) {<br/>
        return left.interpret(x) + right.interpret(x) ;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public class Logarithm {<br/>
        double interpret (double x) {<br/>
        return Math.log(expression.interpret(x)) ;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public class Constant {<br/>
        double interpret (double x) {<br/>
        return value ;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public class Variable {<br/>
        double interpret (double x) {<br/>
        return  x ;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That's all there is to it!
      </p>

        Here are some consequences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is easy to implement the grammar
        </li>
        <li>
           It is easy to change the grammar
        </li>
        <li>
           Complex grammars are hard to maintain	
        </li>
        <li>
           It is easy to add new ways of interpreting sentences
        </li>
      </ul>

           No hints about parsing
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't have to put <em>interpret</em> in the expression classes; we can 	  use Visitor, for example, or Iterator
        </li>
        <li>
           We can share terminal symbols using Flyweight
