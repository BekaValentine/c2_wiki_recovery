        I am a software developer in Austin, Texas. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Between playing in a PunkRock band and remodeling my house, I try to find time for reading, drinking GreenTea, and riding my bike.

        <em>Have you tried </em>YerbaMate? I'm told it blends well with certain Chinese teas.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope. I'm becoming more and more of a purist as I get deeper into the GreenTea thing. About the only thing I can honestly claim to like with it is ToastedRice (common in many Japanese restaurants).
