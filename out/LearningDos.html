        Learning Dos

      <p>
        <em>This page assumes you are using </em><a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> and is just about teaching a beginner how to use it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        DOS stands for <a href="DiskOperatingSystem.html">DiskOperatingSystem</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To open it go to 
      </p>
      <p>
        START
      </p>
      <p>
        RUN
      </p>
      <p>
        Type in COMMAND <em>(CMD on some systems)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ENTER
      </p>
      <p>
        You should now have a black window with white writing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Type HELP
      </p>
      <p>
        ENTER
      </p>
      <p>
        You should now have a list of the main commands you need to work with. Read them. Some systems don't have a HELP command available, in which case just read on. You can get help info for individual commands by entering the command name followed by /? and pressing Enter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a brief list of the most useful ones for beginners
      </p>
      <code>
        CALL - calls a batch file from another<br/>
        CLS  - clears the screen<br/>
        DIR  - displays a list of what is in the directory you are currently in <br/>
        CD   - change directory (changes your current position)<br/>
        MD   - make directory (creates a new directory)<br/>
        EXIT - close the DOS window<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Commands to beware of if you a beginner.
      </p>
      <code>
        DEL  - will delete files (try to avoid doing this, there are more sensible ways to delete stuff)<br/>
        FORMAT - similar thing as delete (don't touch this command until you really know what you're doing)<br/>
      </code>
