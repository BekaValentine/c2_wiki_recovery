        Defensive Coding
      </h1>
      <p>
        Depending on the context, can mean several things.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The act of putting in redundant error-checks (assertions and the like) in a program, to make sure that errors are caught early and caught as close to where they actually occur, as possible.  Some methods/methodologists frown on this (BetrandMeyer and <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> in particular; one rule Meyer gives is <em>never re-check a precondition in the function body</em>).  Others view this as a legitimate form of <a href="DefenseInDepth.html">DefenseInDepth</a>--useful especially if a process such as <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> isn't followed rigorously.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Avoidance of programming constructs known to cause trouble.  This can be good or bad--often times the "advice" is based on rumor, folklore, or plain inexperience (and may not be relevant to your environment anyway).  Sometimes useful--one way to successfully program in C++ is to adopt a style of coding which avoids HeapAllocation as much as possible (that way, you don't have to worry about deallocating the memory; a common bugbear for C++ programmers).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The first meaning already has a page at <a href="DefensiveProgramming.html">DefensiveProgramming</a>.
