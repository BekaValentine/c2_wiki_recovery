      <p>
        Boa Constructor is a <a href="RapidApplicationDevelopment.html">RapidApplicationDevelopment</a> tool for <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> written by RiaanBooysen. It uses the <a href="WxPython.html">WxPython</a>, which is the Python language binding for <a href="WxWidgets.html">WxWidgets</a> (formerly <a href="WxWindows.html">WxWindows</a>), and it is a forms-based RAD tool, similar to <a href="BorlandDelphi.html">BorlandDelphi</a>, but 100% interpreted Python instead of native-code compiling like Borland Delphi. It runs on Linux and Windows, and may offer support for <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> in the future if <a href="WxWidgets.html">WxWidgets</a>/<a href="WxPython.html">WxPython</a> is stable there.

        The term "BOA constructor" is also used in the <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> community to refer to a type of constructor for structure objects. By default, when one defines a structure called foo with fields bar and baz, a keyword-driven constructor is automatically generated. This constructor is called like (make-foo :bar 1 :baz 2). However, one can also specify a constructor function that takes no keywords and expects its arguments in a given order, so that (make-foo 1 2) can be defined to be equivalent to the above make-foo call. As <a href="CommonLispTheLanguage.html">CommonLispTheLanguage</a> states: "Because a constructor of this type operates By Order of Arguments, it is sometimes known as a BOA constructor."
