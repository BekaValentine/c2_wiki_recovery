        Three Oclock Sleepies
      </h1>
      <p>
        How you feel two hours before you're about to leave from work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>pm or am?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, by 5 you're on fire and forget to leave until 6 rolls around, and when you get home supper is cold, as is the family.

        I've often felt that the tradition of siesta would greatly enhance *my* productivity. -- <a href="JavaSchrod.html">JavaSchrod</a>

        <em></em><a href="ThreeOclockSleepies.html">ThreeOclockSleepies</a> are a logical practice in hot countries, such as those in the Middle East. When I was out there, I saw for myself that people start work at about 7am and finish at about 3pm before going home for a nap during the burning hot afternoon. Life continues as usual in the evenings.<em></em>

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>, if you will. I've always attributed it to the effect of having lunch - the body reroutes effort from doing things to digesting things, or so i've heard. -- <a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>

        I <a href="HadThisPattern.html">HadThisPattern</a>, but have resolved it by drinking a cup of hot tea and eating a few biscuits (or crackers, or cookies, or whatever) at around 3:00 or 4:00, during which I take an actual break of several minutes from working.  I won't even look at a computer screen during this time.  This gives me the energy I need to push through that final hour or two of work. -- <a href="BrentNewhall.html">BrentNewhall</a>

        I <a href="HadThisPattern.html">HadThisPattern</a>.  During University I discovered that during certain classes, I would get very bored and fall asleep.  On weekdays when I didn't have those classes, I would still get sleepy at the same time (not on weekends though).  Once I graduated and started working, I developed <a href="ThreeOclockSleepies.html">ThreeOclockSleepies</a> (which I seem to get even if I eat a light lunch or no lunch at all).  I counter with coffee and/or snackfood such as a chocolate bar.

        I once read a Greek study which claimed that males who take naps live longer. The 3pm-sleepies may be our body telling us something.

        Like sleep more than once a day!  
      </p>
      <p>
        I have this pattern: Two periods of sleep of from 3 to 4 hours seems to give me two days every day to accomplish stuff. The first dayper , what I have to do, the second dayper, what I don't have to do.

        I get the <a href="ThreeOclockSleepies.html">ThreeOclockSleepies</a> even worse when I haven't been able to get any sleep the night before. You might think that it would hit at a different time, but it hits almost like clockwork, only harder. It also does not seem to be completely dependent on lunch. Although, if I have a heavy lunch at noon (buffet), the <a href="ThreeOclockSleepies.html">ThreeOclockSleepies</a> might hit me at about 2pm.

        The obvious solution is to speed up Earth's rotation period from 24 hours to 15 hours. -- Q

        My understanding (no references, sorry) is that it's less about eating lunch at midday, and more about hitting a low point approximately twelve hours after the midpoint of one's normal sleep period. So, if you generally sleep from 2300 to 0700, 0300 is the midpoint, so you'll hit your low point at around 1500.
