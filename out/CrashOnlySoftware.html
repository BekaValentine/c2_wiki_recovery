        Crash Only Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        Crash-only software was described in a nice paper in the 9th Workshop on Hot Topics in Operating Systems (HotOS-IX), May 2003;

        <dd>Crash-only programs crash safely and recover quickly. There is only one way to stop such software—by crashing it—and only one way to bring it up—by initiating recovery. Crash-only systems are built from crash-only components, and the use of transparent component-level retries hides intra-system component crashes from end users.</dd>

        I've only seen Crash-only computing described in the paper above. There are no references in the Wiki. The idea of only having one code path for starting and one for stopping seems like a really good example of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
      </p>

        But:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           has anyone really tried this? (1)
        </li>
        <li>
           aren't "recursive microreboots" a truly horrible idea?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Crash only computing seems a bit similar to Erlang's "<a href="LetItCrash.html">LetItCrash</a>".
      </p>

        (1) I used Crash-Only design to coordinate distributed workers and manager in a continuous integration test farm at a Large Well Known Search Engine Company. Setting time-outs correctly was a tuning point for the system. - <a href="JeffreyMiller.html">JeffreyMiller</a>

        I've seen transactional databases essentially run in this way. Bring it up and it only goes down on a crash, whereupon you recover from the logs. There was a procedure for a clean shutdown, but it never got used. And the clean startup only got used once.

        Please note that allowing a system to crash may be acceptable in handling data transactions for, say, DVD rentals out of a Redbox, but this is not an acceptable behavior for, say, a medication delivery cabinet. Let's set some limits here, folk.
