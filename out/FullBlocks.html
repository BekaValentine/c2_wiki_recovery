        <em>The trouble with layers and layers of computer software is that sooner or later you lose touch with reality.</em>

      <p>
        Reality. That's what's going on with the physical stuff that
        makes computers go.  <a href="CarverMead.html">CarverMead</a> points out that all
        computation is a physical process.
        Why not exploit the myriad effects of <a href="ChargeCarriers.html">ChargeCarriers</a>
        passing through material, instead of overcoming them?
      </p>
      <p>
        But I digress.  Right now I'm thinking about efficiently
        transferring information from block storage devices.
        What in the world is my <a href="ThinkPad.html">ThinkPad</a> doing as it sits there
        blinking my disk light while it boots?  A few bytes here,
        a few bytes there, that's what it's doing.
        I'd love to put a <a href="StripChartRecorder.html">StripChartRecorder</a> on that light and find out
        what the real DutyCycle is.  Then again, it probably lights
        up while it seeks.  I'd need to monitor the actual transfer.

        Some people seem to understand this and get it right...

               regardless of whether this means a full track read or a small boot, such things pre-date Jef's work on the <a href="CanonCat.html">CanonCat</a> by years and years; let's not Canonize people for standard practice

           <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a> -- a filesystem abolitionist from the beginning, he strongly prefers to record source code and all persistent data using block storage.  Whether using a block cache (a la demand-paging systems today) or full memory image (a la <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> today), Chuck gets extremely efficient I/O by eliminating unnecessary filesystem intervention, which from personal experience with both filesystems and direct-access methods, I agree is unnecessary.

        Since this page was created June 9 1995 and hasn't significantly changed since then (typos fixed 3 times, is all), I probably shouldn't bother to comment...
