        This term relates to the nowadays <a href="BuzzWord.html">BuzzWord</a> <strong></strong>ScaleAbility<strong>.</strong>

        There are situations where adding more power to one machine or exchanging a machine with a more powerful one reach the limit of what is physically or economically feasible. Then, and I say <em>only then</em>, you should think about putting the load to be handled on more than one machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        But remember, there are other ways to <em>scale</em> a system: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           use better algorithms or structure
        </li>
        <li>
           avoid unnecessary overhead
        </li>
        <li>
           reduce the number of system calls (crossing component chasm)
        </li>
        <li>
           avoid acquiring concurrent resources requiring locks
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sharing the load of a system across several computers requires a duplication of the system and an additional component for coordination (the LoadBalancer or see MasterSlavePattern in <a href="PatternOrientedSoftwareArchitectureOne.html">PatternOrientedSoftwareArchitectureOne</a>). If the split system requires some global state, there is need for another component that coordinates access to this global state. Often this is implemented as a database dealing with the issues of transaction control, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        As you see, just by saying: let us scale the system you get into a much higher level of complexity. You get a system consisting of more computers performing less  (at least in terms of user perception) because of the latency required by the additional communication and the coordination overhead involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please think of that, when you next read the word <em></em>ScaleAbility<em> or multi-tier.</em>

        That doesn't mean <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> is not a good concept, but it shouldn't be blindly used to distribute functionality across deep chasms.

      <p>
        The big mainframe computers (I never used one) as all singular systems have an enormous benefit: if something goes wrong you know where to look (or who to blame).
