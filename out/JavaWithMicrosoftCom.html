        Thanks. I only asked because one of my apps is in the same boat(!).

        JIntegra is a pure Java product that talks <a href="DistributedCom.html">DistributedCom</a>.  See <a href="http://www.linar.com/">http://www.linar.com/</a> for details.  The software can be downloaded on a trial basis (it will expire after 6 weeks without a license key).  Costs vary by application--client licenses can cost as little as $375 for 5 clients, while server licenses cost $3000 "per production server CPU".

        From the JIntegra whitepaper:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>J-Integra's pure Java runtime talks to COM components using <a href="DistributedCom.html">DistributedCom</a> (DCOM) layered over <a href="RemoteProcedureCall.html">RemoteProcedureCall</a>s (RPC), which are themselves layered on <a href="TcpIp.html">TcpIp</a>. So at the lowest level J-Integra uses the totally standard Java networking classes. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>To the Java programmer, J-Integra makes COM components look just like Java objects, presenting COM properties, methods and events as Java properties, methods and events. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The J-Integra bridge is bi-directional. COM developers can make callbacks into Java objects. J-Integra dynamically "remote-enables" any Java object, making all of its public methods and member variables accessible from COM. </dd>
      </dl>

        Disclaimer: I wrote J-Integra
      </p>
      <p>
        The main downside to J-Integra is that some COM objects can not be accessed via DCOM (the COM network protocol which J-Integra talks) -- some kinds of COM objects that require a special "helper" COM class be loaded into the client address space to help unmarshal data -- this isn't possible using J-Integra because the client can be sitting anywhere (not necessarily a windows platform).  There are not many objects like this, but they do exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess the best thing about J-Integra is that because the runtime is pure Java your Java code can be sitting on anything that has a JVM and a TCP/IP link to the Windows box you are talking to (or that is talking to you).
      </p>
      <p>
        I know it sounds insipid, but if you want something changed or added or if you dislike something about it (including the price ;-) please email me -- can't promise, but if you have reasonable suggestions there is a very good chance of getting changes incorporated into the next version.

        J-Integra doesn't work if the windows box has the Local Security Policy: NTLMv2 response only, refuse LM & NTLM
