        Complexity In Com Plus
      </h1>
      <p>
        Microsoft's <a href="ComPlus.html">ComPlus</a> lacks entity beans which help manage more complex applications.  How then do you program a complex application in <a href="ComPlus.html">ComPlus</a> without it becoming a lot of low level relational database/SQL coding?

        I don't think it is possible to avoid SQL coding in a moderate to large database if you want any level of performance.  I've seen an order of magnitude improvement in many cases by changing a SQL call (seconds to tenths of seconds).  There may be other reasons to have "entity beans," but I would not give up the ability to view and debug the underlying SQL calls.  --<a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
