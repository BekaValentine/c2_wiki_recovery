        <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a> programming is a bit of a <a href="BlackArt.html">BlackArt</a>.  Compared to other types of programming, there are relatively few authoritative texts and few college programming courses available that describe the common patterns for solving problems such as these:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ensuring that deadlines are met, and/or doing something reasonable when deadlines are not met.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ensuring that periodic tasks (possibly with very short periods) run periodically.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ensuring that high-priority tasks are able to interrupt low-priority tasks, avoiding deadlocks and priority inversions.
        </li>
        <li>
           Optimizing the scheduling of tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
           Managing resources (memory, I/O, etc.) such that operations take a predictable bounded amount of time.
        </li>
        <li>
           Handling real-time system startup/shutdown/restarts/resets/reboots.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please list such patterns here, along with links to their descriptions.

        <a href="DougSchmidt.html">DougSchmidt</a> and his team have described several patterns for concurrent, parallel, and distributed systems, many of which are designed to also address real-time constraints: <a href="http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/patterns-ace.html">http://www.cs.wustl.edu/~schmidt/patterns-ace.html</a>

        This book uses pattern form to explain how to build controllers for things like microwave ovens and clocks.  The computers for these devices are very small, with a few hundred bytes of RAM. It is a fascinating book! -- <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>
