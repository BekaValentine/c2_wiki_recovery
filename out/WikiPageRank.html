        The <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> engine assigns <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a> values to indexed Web pages based on their "popularity" using a proprietary weighting and ranking algorithm. Web pages assigned PR10 will show up on the first page of <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> results, while PR1 content will be several pages back.
      </p>
      <p>
        Content referenced from <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s appear to be given a high <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a> using the current algorithm (March 2003), leading me to wonder if someone could exploit this fact, similar to what SearchKing did with their private network of interlinking Web sites (<a href="http://www.pandia.com/sw-2002/40-google.html).">http://www.pandia.com/sw-2002/40-google.html).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not that I would condone such an experiment, but I wonder if the most frequently visited pages on various Wikis could effectively be used for <a href="GoogleBombing.html">GoogleBombing</a>?

        To see for yourself, check out via Google "OneYearAgo" (159 Occurrences). You will see the <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> page at the top of the list, page one. It has more to do with the infrequency of the use of <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s in generally appearing pages on the Web, In contrast try the same search with "One Year Ago" (308000 Occurrences) This represents a ratio of 1 to 1937.

        <dd><em>Note: the </em>OneYearAgo page, cited above as an example, ceased to be maintained by its original author.  Eventually someone replaced it with a content-free message, whereupon it was deleted. So you cannot perform the experiment as suggested. However, the reference remains here because the point it illustrates is still valid.<em></em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        For another observation, Trying "<a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>" vs "Recent Changes" will give a ratio of 317000 to 4418000. This represents a ratio of 1 to 14.

        The more unique and restrictive a search parameter is, the more likely will the page appear high on a relatively low number of pages listed by Google.
