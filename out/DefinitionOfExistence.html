        Definition Of Existence
      </h1>
      <code>
        Things exist, or so they say,<br/>
        And don't just spend time making hay,<br/>
        While rivers flow and the breezes blow,<br/>
        And flowers writhe and the bees just follow ...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Could what exists and what does not<br/>
        Change depending whose speaking about<br/>
        The moment to moment and eye to eye<br/>
        Sensations flitting about like butterflies?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Existence seems to be a patchwork cloth,<br/>
        The crazy quilt each mind's knitted of,<br/>
        Outside, inside, you and me:<br/>
        Illusions of <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        But closer still, is there conspiracy<br/>
        Among all the things we seem to see?<br/>
        Particles wave and waves correlate<br/>
        So <a href="QuantumTheory.html">QuantumTheory</a> makes a fool of fate.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        But get hung up on what exists and don't<br/>
        And superstition that's finely honed,<br/>
        Debates, inflates, rewrites and borrows,<br/>
        A million stories, names and ritual hallow.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        And then what underpins a story's language<br/>
        When language carries about so much baggage?<br/>
        A mutual agreement might be the last defence<br/>
        Of existence of that thing we call existence.<br/>
