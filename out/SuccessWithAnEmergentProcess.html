        Success With An Emergent Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bill Tozier wrote a very interesting article on how to be successful with evolutionary algorithms and machine 
        learning, and how it applies to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.

        "At every company I've ever visited, early on during my time there I have met a person in a position of decision-making power (call them the Expert) who says to me, 'Oh, one time I tried using <XXX>, but they don't work.'"

        See, I think many modern folks are used to thinking in terms of general-purpose tools, and the consequent ability to apply them liberally anywhere and always. They misunderstand the words "general purpose" to mean just that: good for what ails ye. But personally I think it's a <em>fallacy</em> to believe that what makes a tool "general-purpose" is its ability to work, without adjustment or adaptation, in a variety of settings. That, in fact, is what's <em>provably</em> wrong and misunderstood with the notion as it applies to the sordid world of machine learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        What makes a tool -- or any approach to solving problems [What difference, really?] -- "general-purpose" is the ease with which one can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>examine</strong> the tool's structure
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>understand</strong> the reason for that structure in getting you to the goal
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>make changes</strong> to that structure to cope with special circumstances
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, <strong>adapt</strong> the tool.
      </p>

        I'm surprised this is posted under the heading of an "EmergentProcess". I don't see how learning to use a tool is an emergent process.  Elaboration might help me understand how this is a good name for this page.

        <em>Careful reading of the link and the material and the realization that all tools are not tools producing emergent artifacts might help you.</em>
