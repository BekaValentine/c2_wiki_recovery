        Wiki has been pretty good at self-policing, in my experience. Tangents tend either to not go very far or to take twists and turns that intersect with the core themes. Of course, offering the opinion that a topic is not appropriate for Wiki is a part of self-policing. -- <a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        Wiki has found a scope that is neither too narrow nor too broad. I attribute this to a community seeking excellence in a medium that permits it. The result is a place that is neither wide open, nor easily characterized in how it might be closed. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        To avoid a <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>, it may be useful to discourage <strong>large</strong> numbers of offtopic pages, and not starting other offtopic pages when the current number is too high. Avoid thinking, "I can post this because <em>other</em> people are offtopic". (<a href="FixBrokenWindows.html">FixBrokenWindows</a>) -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

        Wiki works analogously to a human mind, and a human mind works because of its wide associations and creativity, not by staying "on topic". Topics that don't interest a lot of readers and are not related to existing pages do not occupy a lot of Wiki's mind, neither conscious nor subconscious - see <a href="ForgetfulnessAsFilter.html">ForgetfulnessAsFilter</a>, <a href="ThingsOnWikisMind.html">ThingsOnWikisMind</a>. --<a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        So, put more succinctly, <em>in the beginning</em> everything is <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, and to create something (e.g. on a <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a>), you render something <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>, see where it links out into the <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a><strong>'ness and see if you get support from the </strong><a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a>. -- <a href="StijnSanders.html">StijnSanders</a>
