        Intermedia From Iris
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="IntermediaFromIris.html">IntermediaFromIris</a> was created at Brown University by the Institute for Research, Information, and Scholarship (IRIS). Contributors to Intermedia included <a href="NormMeyrowitz.html">NormMeyrowitz</a>, BernHaan, CharlieEvett, MattEvett, KenUtting, <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>, PaulKahn, NicoleYankelovich, and others.

        Intended for use by scholars, it supported a variety of media, including text, graphics, images, and video. Users could add links, annotate links, add documents, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Intermedia kept link information in a database separate from the information being linked. This had several advantages, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Easy to link to read-only media
        </li>
        <li>
           Links can be remote from targets
        </li>
        <li>
           Link access can be faster than media access
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the Intermedia links are disappearing from the Web. Intermedia was described in the literature, including the 1986 and 1987 OOPSLA proceedings.
