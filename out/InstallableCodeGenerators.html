        Installable Code Generators

        Create a specification language, perhaps in XML. Expose the parse
        tree and allow backend code generators to generate target code. CASE tools
        take over code generation when they are the least capable entity
        for generating code because they have no idea what is the target
        infrastructure.
      </p>

        For example, a FSM description can be generic, but the code generated can be
        customized by target environment. Many high level ideas like timers, message
        flows, threads, hierarchical relationshipts, etc can be embedded in the
        FSM specification, but no commercial tool can possibly know what environment
        the code will run in so the code is worthless. In my FSM generator I have
        installable code generators for C, C++, and for different OSs and different
        middleware layers. In my dreams I think developers would work at the
        specification layer with a few select others working at the code generation layer,
        much like we do with compilers today. Very few developers generate assembly.
        Systems are similar enough that a higher level "assembly" language is possible.
