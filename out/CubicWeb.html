        At the moment this is a good example of how difficult it is to do <a href="ContinuousOutegration.html">ContinuousOutegration</a>. I am very keen to get an installation working and have found considerable difficulty getting things working on <a href="UbuntuLinux.html">UbuntuLinux</a>. This was because the distribution had not been kept uptodate with changes of dependencies, althought this has now been remedied. After quite a lot of help I now have something approaching working systems for a blog and a wiki. I appreciate the difficulties of doing this when the focus is on software development. I also appreciate the positive engagement from the development team at Logilab. I want to use this as a tool for <a href="LiterateProgrammingAndTheSemanticWeb.html">LiterateProgrammingAndTheSemanticWeb</a>. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        I have returned to this after some time doing other things and find that in the interim there have been upgrades to a lot of the components and now some things don't work and it is hard to get a fully compatible system. I want very much to like this as there is a lot of potential but it needs a lot of effort to understand how things work. I need my copy of <a href="ProgrammingPython.html">ProgrammingPython</a> for this and I am not a <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> person. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
