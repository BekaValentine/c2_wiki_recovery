        <em>Pains</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>BASIC (since 1980)</dt>
        <dd>My first programming experience was with BASIC on Commodore 64. I learned it by try and error. I typed the game's code from games magazines. At that time I thought computers were great and the tools were ingenious.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>C64 Assembler (since 1983)</dt>
        <dd>The games I typed from the magazines became wore complex and assembler has been added as binary data. I was fascinated by the power of assembler and tried to probe the limits of the hardware. I started some game projects, but usually the projects died after finishing the welcome screen. I got a notion of computers are kind of dull.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>FORTH (since 1984)</dt>
        <dd>Realizing that neither BASIC nor Assembler brings the right power of getting a project done, I accidentally bought a FORTH-extension for the C64. It was a new language for C64 It was an accidental buy, promoted as very productive and smart. Probably I mistook FORTH for FORTRAN that I knew was widely used in professional development. But, the feature to extend the compiler was challenging. However, I stopped working with FORTH because it seemed to me rather technical and editing and compile was cumbersome on C64. Amazing is the distinction between <a href="CompileTime.html">CompileTime</a> and <a href="RunTime.html">RunTime</a>.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>C (since 1986)</dt>
        <dd>Possessing the Amiga ST I was confronted with C as the operating language. At that time I couldn't appreciate this language and was glad when I found GFA BASIC to talk to my computer.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Pascal (since 1988)</dt>
        <dd>I got to know Pascal in school and started my first commercial project using Turbo Pascal 2.0. I went up till Pascal 6.0 and learned about object oriented programming.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Fortran (since 1993)</dt>
        <dd>I took a Fortran course at university - this language is dull.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>C++ (since 1994)</dt>
        <dd>In the Physics department C++ was the preferred language for scientific simulations - I learned and loved it - and it's good <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>VC++/MFC (since 1997)</dt>
        <dd>I got my first job as a programmer and was confronted with the microsoft development environment (IDE) and framework (MFC/Win32 API) - and loved it.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> (since 1997)</dt>
        <dd>One just needs it.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>PL/SQL (since 1998)</dt>
        <dd>I wrote my first routines in PL/SQL - and loved it</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Java (since 1999)</dt>
        <dd>I used Java because it was sexy - I was very sceptic about the usefulness of this language - I missed C++.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>XML/XSL (since 2001)</dt>
        <dd>I implemented my first (and only) three tier web application with PL/SQL as back end, Java in the middle and HTML at the front end. I used XML/XSL for code generation - I rated that as very convenient.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>VBA (since 2002)</dt>
        <dd>For some reason I needed to use that language in Excel. However, I must confess I rate this as quite useful for small office projects.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Haskell (since 2002)</dt>
        <dd>I did some steps in Haskell because I was looking for some functional language as a replacement for Excel formulas.</dd>

        <em>Visions</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 1983</dt>
        <dd>I tried to figure out a general framework for (action) games rendering the use of assembler programming unnecessary.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 1985</dt>
        <dd>I envisioned the <a href="PfompVision.html">PfompVision</a> and started to invent a new programming language.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 1987</dt>
        <dd>I tried to re-invent the Commodore BASIC on Amiga ST because I missed the abbreviations for the keywords.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 1989</dt>
        <dd>Playing with analysis in school I missed a flexible term transformation tool - I wanted a graphical tool where you can just drag and drop the terms - the computers cares about signs, parenthesis, etc.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 1992</dt>
        <dd>I am looking for some neat editor for everything (letters, formulas, programs) - the vision is to start with a blank screen - and just enter what and how you want.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 1995</dt>
        <dd>I realized the limits of the available C++ framework, so I started to implement a toolkit - however, the first class was Strings - and it was the last class ;-(</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 1999</dt>
        <dd>Using SqlPlus for database access I worked on SqlTree - a universal and configurable tool for database access. It was a first try to extend SQL with some GUI elements.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 2000</dt>
        <dd>Continuously switching operating systems and browsers I wondered, why isn't there a tool to synchronize your bookmarks and favourites between systems? I invented BookmarkSync.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 2001</dt>
        <dd>On the one hand I liked the database features of PL/SQL, on the other hand I hate the unavoidable copy and pastes. I wanted a language that automatically generates patterns out of redundant code.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 2002</dt>
        <dd>Excel is fine for one user - why is web programming not as easy as Excel?</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 2003</dt>
        <dd>I wondered, is it possible to program only by configuration of objects? The idea of MBorg was born. MBorg is mainly influenced by the mathematical concept of <a href="TopologicalManifold.html">TopologicalManifold</a>s and maps. The software should be universally available, installation as a <a href="ComputerVirus.html">ComputerVirus</a>.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 2004</dt>
        <dd>Assume, coding were no problem - the big issue remains: how to handle team communication and project management?</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>around 2004</dt>
        <dd>I discovered Wiki - let's push <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopment.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopment</a> to the limit by allowing the users to code in a democratic way</dd>

        I bet that this short account of computer experiences is quite typical for many of us. One has just to replace some OSes/languages/years. One or another will have accomplished somewhat more or less, or in some other areas. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What is most interesting is, that the development goes always (I guess) from low-level (assembly) over languages and applications to social aspects (team, wiki).
