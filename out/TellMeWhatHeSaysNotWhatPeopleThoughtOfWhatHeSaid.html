        There's got to be a better title for this page.

        Basically, it's a whine. I got a phone call from a recruiter the other day. And the conversation went something like this
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"And you'll get a chance to work with <name I'd never heard>, who's world-famous for her work in distributed systems."</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Oh really ? I've never heard of her. Could you give me some references."</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Well, I don't have any. But she's highly respected."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <strong>scream.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had this conversation too many times. In our industry, home of absurd puffery and inflated claims, I no longer care who claims to be world renowned and who is well-known for something but sorry I don't know the specifics.
      </p>
      <p>
        Give me thoughts. Concisely phrased, well-reasoned, actual-by-god thoughts. It's not that I'm skeptical, mind you, but simply that I need some filtering mechanism.

        I love it!  I've had the same experience.  Another (related) one is listening to keynote speakers at conferences:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>(1st attendee) "So what qualifies this guy to talk about this subject?"</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>(2nd attendee) "Well, he managed a big project that used it"</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>(1st attendee) "So does he know anything about it?"</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>(2nd attendee) "Probably not..."</dd>
      </dl>
