        Chronicles Of Narnia
      </h1>
      <p>
        Seven novels by <a href="CsLewis.html">CsLewis</a> about the fictional land of Narnia. Written for children, they are also a good read for grown-ups. The story has many allusions to Christianity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Belongs to best literature ever written.

        <em>In the opinion of some.</em>

        True. <a href="JrrTolkien.html">JrrTolkien</a>, who disliked allegory of all kinds, didn't think much of them at all. AN Wilson's biography of Lewis is one of the few by a experienced literary biographer to acknowledge both the enduring charm and the literary weaknesses, even the apparent sloppiness of the text, which Lewis dashed off at great speed.

        <em></em><a href="CsLewis.html">CsLewis</a> claimed that the Narnia books aren't allegory. His point is that (e.g.) Aslan doesn't <strong>represent</strong> Christ in the sort of way that Giant Despair in PilgrimsProgress represents, er, despair; rather, Aslan is his attempt at saying what Christ might be like, so to speak, in a world like Narnia. Note that he wasn't denying that the portions of the books generally reckoned to be "about" Christianity are about Christianity; merely that they're allegorical.<em></em>

        Interesting to see an Internet-enabled world this weekend in the middle (exactly) of another seven book fantasy series for children which is fast becoming a classic for all ages. Two out of three children in my house (aged 9 and 11) have gone strangely quiet. I have to sneak in a few chapters after bedtimes. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        Although to be strict to the point of pedantry, <em>The Horse and His Boy</em> occurs <em>within</em> <em>The Lion, the Witch, and the Wardrobe</em> ;-)

        When I was a child I read the whole series, and while reading it, I swear it never occurred to me for a second that any of it had anything to do with Christianity. But then, I don't know terribly much about the religion (despite being supposedly born into it), and I read them in <strong>reverse</strong> publication order... -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>

        <em>I read them too as a child, and to me they were just cool adventure stories.  The religious impact on me was absolutely zero. --</em><a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a><em></em>

        Me too. But they were unreadable when I tried to re-read them as an adult, because of the bludgening-the-reader-over-the-head-with-religion that was there all the time. -- Anon

        I read them dozens of times, then was shocked, bemused, and somewhat smug to be assigned to read <em>The Lion, The Witch, and The Wardrobe</em> as a theology class assignment for my Jesuit-run high school. Funny, though, was that I had to reread it to get the theological points we were discussing, which did take away my smugness. -- <a href="JasonFelice.html">JasonFelice</a>

        <strong>About the movie:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems peculiar to me that this movie was so heavily pooh-poohed. It was quite wonderfully realized, very faithful to the book, well-acted and paced. My only issue is with the level of gore, which seemed completely unnecessary to this father of a five-year-old. But in general I have no problem. My boy says that the book "has a lot more in it". Which makes me feel, as ever, very proud of him. -- Pete
