        Quoted as saying:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"If someone says 'within 5 years we can ...' then they probably know how to do it,</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	 </dt>
        <dd>but if they say 'within 10 years we will be able to ...' they don't."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        In my experience this is a pretty good predictor.
