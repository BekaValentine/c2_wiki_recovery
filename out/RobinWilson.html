      <p>
        My name is Robin Wilson and I am a retired local government officer in Yorkshire, UK.

        About thirty years ago I gained a Ph.D. in theoretical physics but, being a Quaker and concerned about the military applications of science, I decided not to stay in the discipline.  However, I retain a keen interest in a subject which brought great joy and challenge to my youth.

        My main interest when I was in work was to make local government work better for local people.  This is not a small problem and tends to bring rather less joy and a lot more challenge than physics.  I have a particular interest in project management and often visit this wiki because it has proved to be a useful source of ideas and advice.  I also find it entertaining and enjoy listening in to the lively flow of debates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I have retired, I still take an interest in performance and project management and occasionally do training and consultancy work.
