        Xp Vs Standard Definition Of Unit Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Is the </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> definition of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s compatible with the <a href="StandardDefinitionOfUnitTest.html">StandardDefinitionOfUnitTest</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Failure of a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> implicates only one unit. Failure of a <a href="DeveloperTest.html">DeveloperTest</a> implicates the most recent edit, following the <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are expensive, and <a href="DeveloperTest.html">DeveloperTest</a>s are cheap & easy to write, and they lead towards <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DeveloperTest.html">DeveloperTest</a>s fail early, loudly, expressively, and reversibly. They often fail accurately, but if they don't, you don't care. Using Undo to back out from the failure of a HyperactiveTest is often cheaper than tuning up the test.

        Point 0 of <a href="StandardDefinitionOfUnitTest.html">StandardDefinitionOfUnitTest</a> says that when you're dealing with object-oriented software, the units you're testing are classes. The <a href="StarUnit.html">StarUnit</a> tools and most XP discussion goes along with this.

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing (as defined in the software testing literature) requires that we test the unit in isolation. That is, we want to be able to say, to a very high degree of confidence, that any actual results obtained from the execution of test cases are purely the result of the unit under test. The introduction of other units may color our results.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Since we can seldom, if ever, test a unit without the presence of at least some other software, unit testing involves such things as "drivers" and "stubs."
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Response: <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> does not <strong><em>require</em></strong> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to test a class in isolation from all other classes; <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>. But XP uses stubs to isolate classes being tested whenever the team finds it worthwhile to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chapter 13 of the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingInstalled.html">ExtremeProgrammingInstalled</a> book, titled "<a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s," describes the creation and testing of a "Scrutinizer" class that will hold, filter and return collections of TaxReturn objects. The TaxReturn class hadn't been written yet, so all testing was done using "FakeTaxReturn" stub objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you felt the need, you could use <a href="StubObject.html">StubObject</a>s in place of classes that are implemented. To quote from the book: <em>"[...] with more complex collaborating objects than the Scrutinizer, you can get strange interactions in your testing. We often find that using stub objects instead of the real thing will simplify the testing and help you go faster."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So the practice is encouraged but not required. If you need isolation, do it; otherwise remember that <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Bedard's definition of </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s being tests that rely on no other stuff in the system is fatuous, since no such test is possible.<em></em>

      <p>
        So, the use of other units in the testing of a unit creates two sets of problems:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The other units may color the results of a test case, and lower our level of confidence in the unit under test.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The other units may interfere with the straightforward execution of one or more test cases.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Use of multiple units (classes) in one test may "color the results" to the extent that tests fail on many classes at once.
        But you know that the problem was caused by what you did since you last ran the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s successfully.
        And if you're using <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practices, you wouldn't have done much.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As a </em><a href="RegressionTest.html">RegressionTest</a>, this use of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing isn't interesting. Moreover, it's not the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> that determines whether you failed, but microiterations. Microiterations limit the number of things that changed to a small set that can be manually examined. This is close to (but weaker than) the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a>. The <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> works because it is theoretically stringent, ala <a href="InformationTheory.html">InformationTheory</a>. Anyway, the point is that <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s only tell you that something is wrong in the area they test. However, it's how often you run the tests (or more importantly, the system) that ensure that you don't lose control of the system.<em></em>

      <p>
        Point 3 of <a href="StandardDefinitionOfUnitTest.html">StandardDefinitionOfUnitTest</a> deals with black-box vs. white-box testing. Black-box testing, which is based on the specification for the unit, is present in XP if you <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>. White-box testing, which tests the code, happens if you add more tests after writing the class/method/function, or if you add a test to cover a bug that slipped through.

        <em>First question, does XP use </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s like I've defined them or not?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unit tests as you defined them are a subset of the XP definition, and many people do use them the way you defined. Using a <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> as a class stub for example, and doing white box testing. There was a huge discussion on the XP mailing list a while ago about whether you should test private members, and the consensus was that XP doesn't say either way and that people had their own personal preferences. Why is the fact that the XP definition of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s is less strict than yours such an issue?
        -- <a href="DaveKirby.html">DaveKirby</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's an issue because if I claim I don't use <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, then I don't mean I don't use XP-style <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. Basically, I'm totally confused as to what XP means by <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing, hence the prompting above for more information. But consider this, despite the dozens or more times I've UnitTested to great disaster (often to the point where <em>all</em> testing got thrown out as a result), XP people are the <em>first</em> people I've ever seen that have become "<a href="TestInfected.html">TestInfected</a>."

        Actually, I rarely care what the testing methods I use are called. I just do them. More carefully stated then, I do <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>, but not as my mainstay. There are other ways that I've found are useful. -- ss

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Now that we understand what each other does, I want to attempt to define XP unit and functional tests, according to my poor understanding of XP. The standard disclaimer applies: I don't even speak for <em>myself</em>, much less XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction between an acceptance (nee "functional") test and a unit test is not what they test or how they're done, but in who they satisfy. The acceptance test makes the customer satisfied that the software provides the business value that makes them willing to pay for it. The unit test makes the programmer satisfied that the software does what the programmer thinks it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the essence of it. There are a whole lot of traditions for these tests, which I think people get mixed up with the actual definitions. These traditions are a result of the forces acting upon you when you do testing, but are not essential to the definition of the tests. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A unit test often tests classes in isolation.
        </li>
        <li>
           An acceptance test usually tests an entire system at once.
        </li>
        <li>
           A unit test often runs in only seconds.
        </li>
        <li>
           An acceptance test often runs in minutes, or even longer.
        </li>
        <li>
           A unit test is usually programmatically driven.
        </li>
        <li>
           An acceptance test is often script or mini-language driven.
        </li>
        <li>
           A unit test is seldom end-to-end.
        </li>
        <li>
           An acceptance test is sometimes end-to-end.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think many people, even within XP, confuse these traditions with the actual definition of the tests. So one might say, for example, "A unit test is testing an individual class in isolation," or "An acceptance test tests the entire program." That would be wrong. They are not the definitions, just traditions resulting from the forces that act upon you when you are doing testing. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the programmer writing a so-called unit test that tests the whole program, or with the customer defining a functional test that stubs out part of the system. It's up to the people doing it to weigh the costs and benefits, not to follow some arbitrary definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that's how I see it. I hope that someone who actually knows something about XP can correct whatever gross misunderstandings of it that I have. -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wayne, I'm not volunteering myself as an XP expert, but I'm pretty familiar with it now. You are, IMHO, pretty much on the money. Especially with the "feedback, feedback, feedback" and the para. that precedes it. You sound pretty "extreme" there. That's not so surprising. Every good developer I've spoken too about it has found a lot of what they already do in XP (and a lot of bad ones <em>think</em> there's a lot of what they do in XP, which can cause...confusion).
      </p>
      <p>
        The thing with XP unit tests is that you write them first. This makes them a design tool, not a testing one. I think it was Ward that first made that distinction explicit, somewhere. This difference in emphasis seems to be where certain testing experts elsewhere get lost when trying to critique XP. I suspect it's also partly behind the mess up at the top of the page. (I don't see how one can discuss the things XP calls "unit tests" apart from the practices surrounding them.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The acceptance tests <em>are tests</em>, the unit tests <em>turn into</em> a regression testing suite, but aren't written as tests. They are written as executable design documents. They are your <em>throw</em>, the code written afterwards is the <em>watch</em>.

        I hope that's helpful. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Great stuff, Wayne and Keith. I also don't know if it is XP, but this is very much my view. The point that tests are a design driver is on the mark. No wonder "testers" don't understand why XPers like tests. And why we don't focus on coverage and other normal testing attributes. The intent makes the difference. It goes to explaining why we are happy to create the tests that Sunir sees as such a chore. -- <a href="LeoScott.html">LeoScott</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the best description of the test first approach is to apply the standard debug process to new design. When doing debugging, you create some sort of test which recreates the problem, then you go in and modify code until your test passes. Anyone who has done a fair amount of debugging will feel very comfortable with this approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, I feel the preceding discussion has only added to my confusion over the difference between <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s. If <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> does not imply testing at a class level, then the term is only adding to confusion. I have adopted the test first approach, but I will usually write a test description for individual executable modules (EXEs, DLLs, ASPs, etc). Often times, these are little more than a set of steps to perform from the application GUI and a description of the expected result (i.e. purely manual). Does this fit with the XP definition of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>? If so, I would suggest changing the name to something like module test (I would really like <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>, but that name is sort of taken in the XP world). -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        The above reminds me of something. On the rare occasion I actually get to program in Smalltalk, I often write a list of small tests when I code things because it's simply more efficient to do that than step through the code in the idiotic debugger. For those who don't know, all methods are public in Smalltalk, and non-declarative Smalltalk is an online system so it's easy to whack stuff in and then <strong>Do It</strong>. In languages as anal as Java and C++, I don't bother because it's too slow (I get bored and frustrated). I occasionally do this in Perl, but my development practices with Perl are bizarre given what I do with it (my development environment is several time zones away from the runtime environment). Anyway, the point is that another force on whether to choose a practice is how expensive it is <strong>given your development environment's support</strong>. This is important.
      </p>
      <p>
        (But that's not to say that one should write an RUP or XP or whatever development environment. That would be a disaster. Tools should enable, not lock the users into the developers' world view--just look at how annoying <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>'s <a href="CodeOwnership.html">CodeOwnership</a> repository system is to people who disagree with <a href="ObjectTechnologyInternational.html">ObjectTechnologyInternational</a>'s "every line of code must be owned by somebody" mantra.) -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        XP uses <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s with the intent of reaping the benefits you refer to and attempt to refute above. Since in fact many XPers are in their own estimation reaping the benefits, your refutation is either erroneous or based on what I might call technicalities, like your assertion that it isn't the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s that keep you focused but "you" that keep you focused. Of course it is "you" that keeps you focused but we find it easier not to go down the "improving this object to oblivion" rat hole when we focus on just testing whether it does what we need. When the test that says it does what we need runs, that's a solid signal that maybe we should stop. Perhaps some folks are so connected that they don't need cues. Me, I'll take all the cues and clues I can get.
      </p>
      <p>
        In sum, and sincerely with all due respect, I think your remarks remain off the mark. There is something happening with the way XP does the thing it calls <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. We may not express it perfectly yet, and we may not use the term the way the terminally retentive would, but there is something going on. I get that you haven't had that thing go on for you, but IMO that's because you have resisted letting it happen. I sincerely believe there is some kind of <a href="ShuHaRi.html">ShuHaRi</a> thing going on in the XP practices. You have to start at Shu, unless there is some other path to enlightenment.
      </p>
      <p>

        Hopefully, every statement in the code is essential to some function or attribute of the unit, or else that statement shouldn't be there. One approach is to say "I know what this thing is supposed to do, now let's see what might go wrong" and write tests based on that. That's the functional approach, exploiting knowledge of the interface. Another approach is to look at the code and muse "I wonder if this particular statement has a problem", then try to figure out how to exercise the unit so that statement will execute. Either is valid unit testing. Both involve bad behavior and lines of code. The main thing about unit testing, to separate it from other kinds of testing, is that it seeks to work on very small pieces. When you try to define "how small", you get into a bit of a mess, but the idea is to avoid the complexity of integrated stuff and work with what's small and simple. Could be just a method, not a whole class, too. -- <a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a>

        What strikes me odd in all these pages in Xp about <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s is that they always stress "AS MUCH TEST AS POSSIBLE" and say that you should test every line of code. To me this seems to skip two much more important tests: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BlackBoxTesting.html">BlackBoxTesting</a>: Test to make sure that the inputs you get from your functions match your outputs. And only do this for all possible inputs that could generate a different case including the exceptions the method is documented to throw.(this is always based on the documentation or the contract between the 'user' and 'developer' of the specific class or function). I guess <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s sort of run along with this.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WhiteBoxTesting.html">WhiteBoxTesting</a>: Given the knowledge of where your data flow changes within a method or function, test only those values that lead to different traversals of that method/function. Here we open up the <a href="BlackBox.html">BlackBox</a> and look inside to see where the inputs actually go to and where the method takes a different path.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'll try to illustrate with a simple example. If my example is not sufficient you're welcome to change it with another simple example (I've got the flu at the moment so my thinking capabilities aren't at the max).

        The tests for <a href="BlackBoxTesting.html">BlackBoxTesting</a> would be:
      </p>
      <code>
        check when div < 0<br/>
        check when num < 0<br/>
        check normal status<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Where check means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           make sure no non-allowed exceptions are thrown (AS DEFINED IN THE JAVADOC)
        </li>
        <li>
           make sure the return value is correct (SAME AS ABOVE)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="WhiteBoxTesting.html">WhiteBoxTesting</a> would test the same (in this case) plus it would also:
      </p>
      <code>
        check when num == 0<br/>
      </code>

        <em>I think the black box/white box distinction is solving the wrong problem. I don't create </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to because automation is a cheaper way to complete <a href="BlackBoxTesting.html">BlackBoxTesting</a> or <a href="WhiteBoxTesting.html">WhiteBoxTesting</a>; I create <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to produce working software.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That said, a truly </em><a href="BlackBoxTesting.html">BlackBoxTesting</a> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> would be a rare beast. Too expensive to create, too expensive to run. Any <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> is testing the behavior of the unit in a particular context, but only by knowing the implementation can you eliminate parts of the context as irrelevant, replace other parts of the context with <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s, and so on.<em></em>

        <em>I wouldn't create a </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> unless I expected it to generate profit (value in excess of development and running costs) - the value is a totally subjective thing, and does include "confidence that I do know what is going on". If delivering the behavior described in the example above, I probably wouldn't bother with a num == 0 check, because it doesn't affect my confidence. But if I came across this code during a RefactoringExpedition, I would add the num == 0 check before trying to remove that branch, because I know that I'm tinkering with that part of the behavior, which I want to preserve. -- <a href="DanilSuits.html">DanilSuits</a><em></em>

        I think the above is missing the point of regression tests for refactoring. When refactoring, I want to assume that every significant condition is already contained within the tests, I don't want to have to search through the tests to find missing conditions I might break. I should be able to do most, if not all, refactoring without looking at the test code. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hmm. There's obviously an assumption you are making that I am not, or vice versa. Care to look for it? It may simply be this: when I'm about to refactor, and am worried about num == 0, I add the test. This may result in more than one test that checks that behavior, which is fine - test duplication can be cleaned up when it the drag coefficient gets out of control. Or you can remove the new test when the refactoring is done - reasonable if the implementation no longer treats that circumstance as a special case.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Alternatively, if you want to assume that everything significant is covered, then do that. If you manage to pass all the tests and break something, you'll add a new test when you fix it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Adding a bunch of </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s because we suspect that at some time in the future somebody might want to refactor this section, and that they might make a mistake that no other test catches, strikes me as a bad parley.<em></em>
      </p>

        Remember the main purpose of <a href="ProgrammerTest.html">ProgrammerTest</a>s (nee <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s) is <a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a>.  The tests are written prior to the code and define the code to be written. "num == 0" indicates there is a branch which means at least 2 tests have been written; one that covers the path that fails the test and one that covers the path that passes the test; combined the two tests verify the "num == 0". The tests were not written because the code may be refactored, the tests were written to define the code to be developed.  Additionally, if one practices <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>, refactoring will be required.  The cost benefit analysis must consider all three of these elements together and consider they permit one to avoid the costs of BigDesignUpfront.  When considered as a whole, a strong economic case for these practices can be made.  Adding any of the elements in isolation to a waterfall development methodology will not reveal any significant cost savings.  --<a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
