        Parable Of The Bruises
      </h1>
      <p>
        A bright little boy with heavy astigmatism came home from the eye doctor with his very first pair of glasses. In a short while, he discovered that his glasses distorted the aspect ratio of objects: circles became ovals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Worried that he was seeing a "distorted view of the world", he stopped wearing them. Due to his poor eyesight, he kept tripping over furniture and objects and collected quite a set of bruises.
      </p>
      <p>
        His mother asked him why he had so many bruises. His new glasses were supposed to solve that. "I found out my glasses show me an incorrect aspect ratio; fat people look skinnier than they are, for example. I want to see the world <em>right</em>!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Isn't blurriness also distortion?" asked his mother. "Yes," he said, "but I can tell if something is blurry, but it's not obvious that I am seeing the aspect ratio wrong. I may forget I'm seeing the world wrong. I would rather have bruises than see the world wrong and not know it."
