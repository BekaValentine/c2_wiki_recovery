        American psychological fantasy author, best known for <em>The Martian Chronicles</em> and the dystopian novel <em></em><a href="FahrenheitFourFiveOne.html">FahrenheitFourFiveOne</a><em>. He generally writes about themes and passions, not hardware, and dislikes being lumped in with all the shoot-em-up </em><a href="SciFi.html">SciFi</a> authors.
