        Reversible Programming Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A reversible programming language produces code that can be stopped at any point, reversed to any point and executed again. Every state change can be undone.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is this really a function of the language, or is it more a function of the environment? Are there any examples?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It could be either. This page was started when someone asked about a proprietary language I worked on specifically created to generate reversible code. It had a keyword that indicated when reversal should stop.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a bad idea for several reasons. We ended up replacing it with a C++ library that let us achieve the same goals with normal C++ code.

        There is a weird language named Kayak, which is reversible.

        The Abundance language seems relatively non-weird, except ...
        "All Abundance programs can Jaunt -- run backward in time."
      </p>

        A quick Google led me to

        <strong>Aren't all </strong><a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s reversible in this sense?<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not really: after a BetaReduction you don't know what formula the result was reduced from. That is, beta-reductions are deterministic into one direction only.

        <em>Do they save all of their state changes on stacks? Can you reverse execution direction and unwind the state changes to any previous state?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, you can't. <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> can unwind to any state (which is required for backtracking), but these choice-points are not first level objects.
      </p>

        <em>How closely coupled is this to hardware implementing </em><a href="ReversibleLogic.html">ReversibleLogic</a>? Does one imply/require the other, or not?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They are unrelated, but I first heard about <a href="ReversibleLogic.html">ReversibleLogic</a> when searching <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> while trying to debug the reversible programming language.

        With logging, there are some <a href="GoodDebuggers.html">GoodDebuggers</a> for Java that allow you to "step backwards" through a detailed history of your program's execution, to examine past state.
      </p>
      <p>
        In theory, it wouldn't be hard to restore a system to a previous state and continue, but the listed Java debuggers don't have this feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        (The <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, by contrast, has always had a "retry" operation on all the items you see on the stack.  It isn't a strong "rollback to previous state," but it suffices for most common usage.)
