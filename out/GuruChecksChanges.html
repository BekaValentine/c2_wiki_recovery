        Guru Checks Changes
      </h1>
      <p>
        A variation on <a href="GuruWritesAutomatedTest.html">GuruWritesAutomatedTest</a>, with a different set of tradeoffs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The usual setting is an operation with a long, complicated output.  Rather than testing for correctness, the focus here is to test that behavior is preserved.  When an automated scan of the current output discovers a mismatch with the standard, diffs are displayed for the Guru to examine.  If the changed result is correct, the latest output is stored as the new standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        If code changes are made in small steps, the Guru will only have a small alteration to approve at any given time, reducing the likelihood of errors [hmm, that feels true; are there any studies to back up the claim?].
      </p>
      <p>
        In cases where the output does change from one run to the next (time stamps, unique keys, etc.), the output is run through a masking filter before the comparison.
