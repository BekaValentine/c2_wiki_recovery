        I was going to do a <a href="SuperAbstract.html">SuperAbstract</a> description of <a href="LittleSimulator.html">LittleSimulator</a> reconstructed from this code, preparatory to <a href="ModelTargeterSurface.html">ModelTargeterSurface</a> analysis. However I must be missing something: can a person choose where to get off an elevator (as opposed to asking the elevator to move to a floor)? So instead here's a <a href="SuperAbstract.html">SuperAbstract</a> description of my uplifting (I'm a Brit) take on the problem domain; real-world descriptions in "quotes". 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><em>building</em></dt>
        <dd>Has an immutable list of <em>floor</em>s, sorted by their <em>number</em>s ("one above the other"); another of <em>elevator</em>s. Maintains the <em>person</em> lists for <em>floors</em> and <em>elevators</em> by setting itself as an observer of each member of the initial <em>person</em> list passed to the <em>ground floor</em> ("Tracks people moving from floor to floor, with everybody starting on the ground floor")</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><em>person</em></dt>
        <dd>Has a <em>waiting</em> flag and a <em>location</em> reference which must be to either a <em>floor</em> or an <em>elevator</em>. ("Must be either on a floor or in an elevator.")</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>waiting</em> can only be set if <em>location</em> is a <em>floor</em> and is reset when it changes to an <em>elevator</em> ("Isn't necessarily waiting for an elevator, stops waiting on getting into one"). 
        </li>
        <li>
          <em>location</em> can be set from a <em>floor</em> to an <em>elevator</em> if the current <em>floor</em> reference of the <em>elevator</em> is to the current <em>location</em> ("Can get onto a lift - sorry, elevator - only while it's visiting the current floor..."); or from an <em>elevator</em> to the current <em>floor</em> reference of that <em>elevator</em> ("...and off at the floor the elevator is currently visiting.").
        </li>
        <li>
          Changes in location are notified to the <em>building</em> which updates the <em>person</em> lists for the <em>elevator</em> and <em>floor</em> involved. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt><em>floor</em></dt>
        <dd>Has an immutable integer <em>number</em> (heuristically known never to be 13) and an immutable list of <em>elevator</em>s that can visit it. A mutable list of <em>person</em>s can only contain <em>person</em>s whose <em>location</em> is set to the instance; this list is initially empty except for the <em>ground floor</em> which receives its initial list from the <em>building</em>. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><em>elevator</em></dt>
        <dd>Has a reference to its <em>building</em> and an immutable list of indexes into the <em>building</em>'s list of <em>floor</em>s, not necessarily a continuous sequence but guaranteed not to be resorted; and an iterable index to its position in that list. An initially empty mutable list of <em>person</em>s can only contain <em>person</em>s whose <em>location</em> is set to the instance. </dd>
      </dl>

        Now left for revision by any interested reader as not really suitable for demonstrating <a href="ModelTargeterSurface.html">ModelTargeterSurface</a>: too much domain design required as above, objects do not have a wide range of properties. But it could be an excellent problem domain for demonstrating several key aspects of practical OOP:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The top-level decision about whether or not to model real-world entities (my analysis actually collapses two entities, in that the <em>person</em> observer is not really the <em>building</em> but a singleton <em>god</em>.)
        </li>
        <li>
          Collections, some mutable and some not
        </li>
        <li>
          The observer and singleton patterns
        </li>
        <li>
          Unit tests (and their applicability to interactive programs and simulations)
        </li>
        <li>
          Extensibility of both the design and implementation: what happens when you allow people to leave the building, add stairways; can you simulate emergency situations? 
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>Looks good but how about identifying the methods for each object at a high level, as well as the attributes. For example whatFloor() is a method of Elevator at the top.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Give us a chance guv, I'm making this up as I go along. Also I always like to do the data design first.

        <em>I think I can satisfy these tests without modeling people, buildings or floors.</em>

        [If you want to do the example as <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> isn't it wise to model the basic entities?] <em>I </em><a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> as can be seen from the above<em> - </em><a href="DavidWright.html">DavidWright</a>

      <p>
        <em>Only if you need to.  </em><a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.  The system isn't going to control people, so modeling them is probably a waste of time.  None of the tests interact with the building, so I can ignore that.  The floors have buttons and the elevators move between them, but the tests probably just interact with the buttons (as a person would) and the floor is probably modeled as part of the elevator's state.<em></em>

        <em>Shouldn't the </em><a href="LittleSimulator.html">LittleSimulator</a> be more general, ie just be an engine that takes a file (or arrays if we don't want to make it too complex) representing objects, rules and events so it could be used to simulate a bank, gas (or petrol) station etc without re-coding each time?<em></em>

        It's only a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> after all, and even as such quite tricky as this discussion demonstrates.

      <p>
        [If it's quite tricky, perhaps there's a simpler <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> lurking. The generalization suggested might actually be simpler. More general isn't always more complex, sometimes it's the other way around.]

        Try this domain model.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           an Elevator holds Passengers with Destinations up to a Limit, and changes Floors at varying Speed.
        </li>
        <li>
           a Passenger has a Location (either a Floor or Elevator) and a Destination Floor
        </li>
        <li>
           a Bank is a number of Elevators servicing the same Floors and is aware of the direction of Destinations of Passengers at each
        </li>
        <li>
           the Traffic describes the arrival of new Passengers 
        </li>

        Try these use cases.

      <ul>
        <li>
           watch the activity of a Bank of Elevators from the perspective of a Passenger waiting at a given Floor. 
        </li>
        <li>
           watch the activity of a given Elevator from the perspective of a Passenger on the Elevator.
        </li>
        <li>
           watch the activity of a given Passenger traveling on and off the Elevators (make choices for that passenger)
        </li>
        <li>
           run any combination of any number of these views simultainously.
