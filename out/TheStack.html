        The Stack
      </h1>
      <p>
        When used without other qualification, <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a> refers to one of two things (which in many systems are handled the same way).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In languages such as <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>/<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, or <a href="RexxLanguage.html">RexxLanguage</a>, a <em>contiguous</em> region of memory used to hold <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s (which in turn contain such things as local variables, function/method arguments, return address of caller, other things as required by the language).  Note that not all languages use a single stack for this purpose--multithreaded programs in C/C++ use one stack per thread; some languages use a <a href="CactusStack.html">CactusStack</a>, and some (like <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>) allocate activation records on <a href="TheHeap.html">TheHeap</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In <a href="StackBasedLanguage.html">StackBasedLanguage</a>s such as <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, <a href="JoyLanguage.html">JoyLanguage</a>, or <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>, the implicit data stack which commands operate on or data can be stored for later processing.  In Forth, for example, there are usually two stacks: one for manipulating arguments, and one for holding return addresses (often treated as a stack of partial continuations).  Characteristically, there is no concept of an <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a> in stack-based languages. In the particular case of Forth, some systems may use a separate "floating-point stack" if it's more convenient to do so (e.g., as when using an Intel 80x87-based FPU).  Some ANSI Forth systems may even implement a fourth, transient stack called the <em>control stack,</em> for holding control-flow state while compiling definitions into executable form.  This stack only exists while compiling, however.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="RexxLanguage.html">RexxLanguage</a> is <strong>not</strong> a stack-based language.  It's an applicative, infix language just like BASIC or PL/1.  I corrected this above.  --SamuelFalvo<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In many architectures, <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a> has CPU support of some kind (a dedicated register to hold the current address--the StackPointer, dedicated memory space, preferential cache treatment, etc).  In many other architectures, a GeneralPurposeRegister is used by convention (on PowerPC processors, register R1 is used as the stack pointer in the various <a href="PowerPc.html">PowerPc</a> ApplicationBinaryInterfaces; even though there isn't anything special about this particular register in the InstructionSetArchitecture).
      </p>
      <p>
        As stacks generally have to occupy contiguous areas of address space, stack management can become a big problem with some operating systems, especially for multi-threaded programs.  Also, since access to <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a> generally has to be fast, most languages do not peform runtime checks for stack overflow.  (One common technique employed by many operating systems is to have a GuardPage at the bottom/top of the stack; any memory access to this page results in a page fault.  The <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> is required to verify that the operand stack sizes are correct when loading a class.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How does paging </em><a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a> work?  Don't interrupts use <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a> too?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In user applications, virtual memory pages related to the stack can be paged in and out, just like any other application data pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software interrupts such as Unix signal/signal handlers do use <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a>; the previous context is pushed wherever the SP happens to be pointing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More precisely: When an exception is triggered (either a software or hardware trap, interrupt, et. al.), the microprocessor pushes this information onto a </em>'kernel stack,<strong> not on the </strong>process stack.<strong>  The kernel stack is located in a swath of memory that is guaranteed to always be in RAM at all times.  The </strong>current user stack pointer<strong> (usually abbreviated USP, to distinguish it from the kernel or system stack pointer, SSP) is pushed onto the </strong>kernel<strong> stack, thus providing the necessary linkage to allow the kernel to return back to the user process.  At it's option, the kernel MAY choose to off-load some state onto the user stack and adjust the USP accordingly, then return back to the user-mode process, thus effecting an "asynchronous subroutine" (as VMS calls them) or "signal" (as Unix calls them).  --</strong>SamuelFalvo<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In some language implementations this has sometimes meant that a stack backtrace isn't available from the debugger from within a signal handler, because the previous stack frame isn't in the canonical form, since the signal handler function was called unexpectedly.
      </p>
      <p>
        The OS stack is (in a protected memory environment) a separate area from that of application process stacks, and may or may not be paged. Operating systems typically have a certain set of pages that are locked in physical memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        True (hardware) interrupts depend on the host cpu architecture for their details, but they switch to privileged mode and save context somewhere -- possibly in a reserved area, possibly on a stack. For the purpose of discussion one can imagine that it saves the previous context to the primary OS stack (there might be several in multi-threaded OSes).
      </p>
      <p>
        The "bottom half" of interrupt handlers queue a request to handle the interrupt and then return as rapidly as possible; it's A Bad Thing to spend much time in interrupt routines. The OS then handles that request at its leisure.
