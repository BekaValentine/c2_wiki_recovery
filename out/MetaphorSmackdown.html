        Metaphor Smackdown
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ten metaphors enter! One metaphor leaves!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Compare and contrast the following metaphors, all culled from pages on this very Wiki. Mix and match them, combine them, make them have children with each other in steamy, incestuous transitive verb couplings.

        <dd>Programming is writing. Stone soup is architecture. Refactoring is writing. Source code is a car design. A software binary is a car. Software is manufacturing. Software is art. Architecture is art. Newspaper design is architecture. Programming is life.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        If a conversation veers dangerously close to clarity, incisiveness, or insight, throw in a few more metaphors. Repeat until sleepy.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're having a hard time coming up with a new metaphor, try this exercise: Look up two random words in the dictionary. Then start a Wiki page called <randomword1>Is<randomword2>. Explain why.

        Are you sure these are really metaphors? It seems to me that in nine out of ten cases, the word on the right is more of an abstraction than the word on the left. These might be attempts to place specific activities into abstract frameworks. That isn't necessarily metaphorical.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What do you mean by "abstract framework"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They aren't metaphors, they are more like half a simile.  I'd disagree with abstract framework, too, 'abstraction' is sufficient.</em>
