        Standard Average European
      </h1>
      <p>
        Standard Average European (or SAE for short) is what BenjaminLeeWhorf of the <a href="SapirWhorfHypothesis.html">SapirWhorfHypothesis</a> called similarities among European Languages, but it can also be applied to other languages. Like, <em>Chinese is actually rather SAE.</em> Or, <em>Don't tell </em><a href="JamesCookeBrown.html">JamesCookeBrown</a>, but <a href="LoglanLanguage.html">LoglanLanguage</a> is actually very SAE.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why is Chinese SAE?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And why, pray tell, is </em><a href="LoglanLanguage.html">LoglanLanguage</a> SAE?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know if they are, I just heard that somewhere, but see <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lojban/message/7580.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/lojban/message/7580.</a>

        How can we tell <a href="JamesCookeBrown.html">JamesCookeBrown</a>? He's dead.

      <p>
        The standard non-SAE language according to Whorf is HopiLanguage.

        <em>Jeepers H. Creepers, NONE OF THIS gives me any information on what it means to be Standard Average European, or what you're trying to connote when you say that? It's enough to make one motion for deletion of this page...</em>

        This whole page seems to be nothing but an expression of LojbanicSnobbery.
