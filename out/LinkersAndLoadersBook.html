        <em>Linkers and Loaders</em> by JohnLevine (ISBN:1558604960).  A thorough treatments of the subject of binary linkers and loaders (see <a href="LinkerProgram.html">LinkerProgram</a> for definition).  Short, but sweet.

        One issue with this book is that the material focuses on linkers for native machine <a href="ObjectCode.html">ObjectCode</a>  It covers these in great depth, including modern techniques like shared libraries and some issues with linking languages like C++ and Java.  However, it gives little attention to issues like <a href="DynamicCompilation.html">DynamicCompilation</a>, <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>s, <a href="IntermediateLanguage.html">IntermediateLanguage</a>s/<a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a>, and the like--perhaps this is an unfair complaint as this material may be considered out of scope by the author.  If you are looking for material on how the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> or <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a> work, this probably isn't the book for you (though you may find it useful).

        If, OTOH, you're looking for information on how ld.so works, this is <em>the</em> book to read.  I'm aware of no other text out there that covers this topic in as much breadth and depth.
