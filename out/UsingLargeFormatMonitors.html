        Large format (46 inch and larger) can be especially useful for personal computer users who wish to view multiple screens and/or applications simultaneously. The SoloProgrammer can find this of use. Those who view MultimediaPresentations and wish to make notes about the subject being presented, or who wish to display internet information (via searches and following linkages supplied via a concurrently running localhost wiki) will find such displays helpful.

        It is found particularly useful in ProgramDevelopment where multiple screens running under the same executable can be arranged for use with other programs of collaboration, such as when working with associates via Skype, or other AudioVideo communication programs. It widens the possible ways such programs can be used, including using a second webcam for whiteboarding hand writing or documents. For those wishing to view the world in wide scope and who want to use more than two thumbs and a limited vocabulary to communicate, such viewings can be liberating.

        The workstations of the future may employ multi-displays which include the use of large monitors and wireless peripherals. One such device presently being investigated includes a 7 inch PersonalPad/Reader/AvDevice which uses <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> and has a touch-screen. It employs the AndroidPlatform, and opens up a multitude of possible applications. (Android_Apps)
