        Stop Calling Acronyms Used As Links Ugly
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems some of the <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s have a rather limited sense of what is important when they post something like "it's <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a>", or some other such comment. It doesn't add much to the page, and it doesn't add anything constructive.
      </p>
      <p>
        So two pages can cover the problem as some see problems. This page, and another one call <a href="StopTryingToUseAcronymsAsLinks.html">StopTryingToUseAcronymsAsLinks</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then we can be done with the topic and move on to more constructive postings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Or perhaps you can understand that <a href="AcronymsAreConcise.html">AcronymsAreConcise</a>.
