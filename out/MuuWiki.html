        Muu Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        The experimental wiki of <a href="MathiasDahl.html">MathiasDahl</a>, <a href="http://klibb.com/wiki.">http://klibb.com/wiki.</a> Uses the <a href="OddMuse.html">OddMuse</a> wiki engine. Contains topics about everything. Most, but not all information is in Swedish though it's up to anyone to enter new pages in English or Swedish.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wiki is mostly used for communication between a small group of friends. We use it to publish links to picture, create pages about parties someone is going to have etc etc, but it also contains pages on various topics that interests me, or about things I have done.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far most of the pages (at least when one lists the last 90 days <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>) seem only to have been originated, placed or modified by <a href="MathiasDahl.html">MathiasDahl</a>. It would help to promote the wiki if translation were built in, as is the case in some multilingual wikis. Or at least a filter mechanism which would list pages according to the language used.

        I did locate several English pages and a file organization technique he call QuickPaths. It seems Mathias is also interested in productivity and making thing that works. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

      <p>
        In short, all pages that I think might interest a broader audience than myself and my friends are written in English. Most other information is not very interesting for non-Swedish speaking people. And yes, most pages are written by me though I try, without much success :), to get my friends to comment and contribute too. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Just now I enabled the "language guessing" feature so that it is possible to search for only English pages, or to display only Enlgish pages on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Right now, the configured languages are Swedish and English. If there is a need for more languages I will add that when needed.
