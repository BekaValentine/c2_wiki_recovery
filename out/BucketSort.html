        <a href="BucketSort.html">BucketSort</a> is a family of sorting algorithms which divide an array into buckets of related values, sort each bucket with some other sorting algorithm, and then concatenates them.

        MSD <a href="RadixSort.html">RadixSort</a> is often a form of <a href="BucketSort.html">BucketSort</a>.

      <p>
        <a href="BucketSort.html">BucketSort</a>'s WorstCase performance is O(n^2), its average case is O(n+k), and its space complexity is O(n*k), where k is the number of buckets.  In a well-implemented <a href="BucketSort.html">BucketSort</a>, however, the  can drop to O(n + k) by allocating only enough space to hold every element in the array, then storing pointers to where each bucket starts.

        <a href="CountingSort.html">CountingSort</a> is a specialisation of <a href="BucketSort.html">BucketSort</a> where the size of each bucket is always one.
