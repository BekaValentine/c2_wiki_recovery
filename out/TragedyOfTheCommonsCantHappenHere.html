        Tragedy Of The Commons Cant Happen Here
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>I've been reading the </em><a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> stuff and, of course, <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>. And I just don't buy it. I think the wiki is a self-stabilizing system, and that it can't be damaged in this way.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This has to do with the fact it has complete write access (so, what do you need moderators for? it's self-moderating).</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How exactly can you take resources from a wiki and by taking, deprive others? All I can do is destroy pages, but in doing so I never gain in resources, even temporarily.</em>

        <strong>Here is how it has happened:  it exhausts the community until they hardly participate (leaving behind a </strong><a href="CrystalPalace.html">CrystalPalace</a>).  But there is a solution in process, see <a href="WikiVersionTwo.html">WikiVersionTwo</a>.<strong></strong>

        The main limited resource is <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. People's attention is limited, and they don't want to hunt for "good" pages among those they consider "offtopic". See <a href="AppropriateWikiTopics.html">AppropriateWikiTopics</a>, <a href="WikiConsensus.html">WikiConsensus</a>, and especially <a href="MissingWikiBeforeXp.html">MissingWikiBeforeXp</a>. <em>- I don't agree, people will just have to find new ways to direct their attention, like categories in </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, or use more advanced search options.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As it turns out, the main limited resource is people's memory. No one knows the entire </em>PageDatabase any more so people just rewrite the same crap over and over again, because everyone wants to write on wiki but no one wants to read wiki.<em></em>

        The WikiNamespace isn't particularly scarce. Even the set of "two words stuck together" is pretty huge, but current thinking is that we don't want to use any significant fraction of them. The discussion of "but Ward has plenty of disk space" and "surely the Wiki doesn't use that much bandwidth?" has been covered elsewhere (<a href="WikiStatistics.html">WikiStatistics</a>).

      <p>
        Scarceness of space on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> leads to <a href="TooManyRecentChanges.html">TooManyRecentChanges</a>. It's not a huge problem - since most editors are <a href="RecentChangesJunkies.html">RecentChangesJunkies</a> (?) it probably self-regulates to some extent. It's also a temporary problem, because quietness comes later.

        I suspect the relative lack of <a href="ReallyValuablePages.html">ReallyValuablePages</a> is neutral as far as <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a> goes.
      </p>
      <p>
        [as stated above] Scarceness of "memory for existing pages" is the long term problem (<a href="NobodyReadsEveryPage.html">NobodyReadsEveryPage</a>). Attempts to regulate this have to be deliberate, and require some effort (<a href="WikiRefactoring.html">WikiRefactoring</a>, <a href="MySignalIsYourNoise.html">MySignalIsYourNoise</a> and the constant application of DeleteTestAndWelcome). Related to this is the problem that the <a href="TestForSameness.html">TestForSameness</a> is getting harder .. maybe.

        Some people believe that this wiki community has suffered from the <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>. The topics and writing styles have changed greatly over the history of this site, and several people have described the changes as negative. Other authors support the changes, or do not see the problems. There are many forces in conflict, and the technical freedom to alter every page is usually balanced with a community "consensus" spirit.
      </p>
      <p>
        While some pages describe a "<a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a>", many of the original pages (1995-96) were about more general software development topics. Over time, the participants in this wiki described several patterns and a few pattern languages. This forum had many rich discussions, especially in the intersection between <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>'s <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a> and the "realities" of software development (<a href="BeautyAintMyBusinessNoSir.html">BeautyAintMyBusinessNoSir</a>). The pattern and software development segments of the wiki community coexisted (peacefully?).
      </p>
      <p>
        The conflicts over appropriate topics have usually been resolved quickly, with unpopular topics either erased (such the Dmoz project) or withdrawn by their authors. <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (XP) was the first topic that deeply split the wiki community. At least one of the well-respected core members of the community left because of this shift in focus. See <a href="MissingWikiBeforeXp.html">MissingWikiBeforeXp</a>, <a href="XpFreeZone.html">XpFreeZone</a>, and <a href="MustEverythingOnThisWikiBeExtreme.html">MustEverythingOnThisWikiBeExtreme</a> for views on this split, and many proposed solutions. There were no generally-agreed solutions, however. As of late 1999, most new XP content is produced for XP-dedicated sites, and wiki XP-content is largely limited to replies to new authors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other major conflict is the style of contributions, which has two related issues: <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>/<a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, and anonymity/signatures. The wiki <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a> is used by some to describe the trend away from anonymous documents to signed threads. See <a href="ThreadModeConsideredHarmful.html">ThreadModeConsideredHarmful</a>, and <a href="InPraiseOfThreadMode.html">InPraiseOfThreadMode</a> for some views on this conflict. This issue has not split the community, but it remains irritating to many with strong views on either side.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many people are concerned that the polite focus of the community will not scale to larger groups. Some have proposed solutions, such as limiting the number of authors, or the form of new contributions. Another idea is the <a href="WikiStoneSociety.html">WikiStoneSociety</a>, which would create a marketplace of content. Other wikis (like the <a href="FoxForumWiki.html">FoxForumWiki</a>) are successful by clearly focusing on a small topic area. Finally, there is a continuing concern over vandals.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some suggest that a technology change in wiki may help resolve some of these forces (see: TechnologyChangeInWiki).

        The way <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a> is averted in <a href="JosWiki.html">JosWiki</a>, <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a>, <a href="WebWebTwo.html">WebWebTwo</a>, and <a href="OrgPatterns.html">OrgPatterns</a> is by giving some writers privileged access to pages - moderators and authors get to write pages that other people can't amend, or can't amend without approval. This, IMHO, removes most of the advantages of using the wiki form in the first place - you may as well just link to ordinary web pages. A feudal system arises and the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> vanishes.

        Reading this thread from start to finish, I wonder if what was initially being described might more correctly be viewed as <a href="LowestCommonDenominator.html">LowestCommonDenominator</a>. As described above, most of the discussion of commons seems to center on the notion of use and exhaustion of a finite resource (grass, cookies, etc.) I'm not convinced that this applies to the Wiki, and am inclined to think that the WikiIsAnInfiniteResource. The discussion regarding <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a>s seems more concerned with the moderation of content in order to insure a high-level of quality and coherence within the Wiki. -- <em></em><a href="SeanMcNamara.html">SeanMcNamara</a><em></em>

Certainly some of the XP pages have seen agreement-by-attrition as correspondents tired of repeating the same edits over and over. The mightiest became the rightiest, which isn't truly the token of social acceptance some XPers have claimed. Not to say I don't think XP is just grand, most of the time, but there are certainly visitors here who don't. Worse, at least one notable deserter (Cope) left because of the wiki's change in focus.

           In the XP case at least all the people involved are somewhere this side of reprehensible. I was thinking more of the exposure of the Wiki to people who are just completely outside politeness. How often does Ward and/or whoever have to go through and wholesale reconstruct a large number of pages because someone has replaced them all with obscenities, or with rants about how the Greys and the CIA are sending messages to his implants? Always/sometimes/never? I should probably just ask Ward; I assume he watches the logs closer than anyone else... *8) -- <a href="DavidChess.html">DavidChess</a>

        There's a specific behaviour pattern, whereby each individual thinks, "If I don't abuse this resource, someone else will. Given that the abuse is going to happen whatever I do, it might as well be me that gets the benefit." The expectation of abuse becomes a <a href="SelfFulfillingProphecy.html">SelfFulfillingProphecy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        That, for me, is almost the defining characteristic of the <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>, and it doesn't strongly apply to Wiki. I don't much benefit from abusing it, and I don't really expect other people to, either. This may be why we have not had big problems. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The tragedy often occurs when an individual action is not abuse, but the combined effect degrades the shared resource. The limited resource in this wiki is the attention (and replies) of interesting people. </em>[See <a href="IsAttentionScarceOnWiki.html">IsAttentionScarceOnWiki</a>]<em> When interesting people decide they aren't getting enough from the wiki for the time spent, they will leave. Some of them have already, or greatly reduced their involvement.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The wiki situation is similar to the classic commons in that there are few/no formal rules, but the commons is preserved by unwritten traditions. People learn these rules by watching the users of the commons, and trying to fit in. The problem arises when people disagree, and there are no clear standards from commonly accepted leaders. (Ward could say "no signatures allowed", or "no Smalltalk discussion", and people would accept it and/or leave. Nobody else has clear authority over the PPR.) Without clear leadership, well-meaning people need to choose standards of behavior, and it is easier to choose rules one agrees with...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also consider that there are people for whom, in the strictest self- interest, <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is a learning place. For others it's a knowledge base. Yet for others it is a forum for debate. Then it seems that, for a few, <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is a place in which to prove they're right. Those are the ones who will comment, question, or refute on a paragraph-by-paragraph basis. It's far from clear how anyone (even the perpetrators) get any value out of it. It didn't use to be that way.

        I think they get cleaned up behind our backs - we only notice them as they are going on. Some examples from the last six months (and I don't really see these as "tragedies"):

      <ul>
        <li>
           Some people find Wiki, and start using it to discuss something <em>other</em> than patterns and leave OffTopicPages before they eventually moved to their own Wiki.

      </ul>
      <ul>

           Occasionally, some browser/web screw-up means that an entire page gets munched - Ward seems to be able to resurrect these from backups, some of the time.

        As <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> says on the <a href="WikiStoneSociety.html">WikiStoneSociety</a> page, the Tragedy is averted on Wiki because everyone is polite - we
        self-moderate, and are mature enough to stay on topic. There seems to be an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> that this behavior doesn't scale up to large groups of people, though.
        -- <a href="KatyMulvey.html">KatyMulvey</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Apart from the obvious scaling issues, I think the dominance of XP-related discussion gives the lie to this. Certainly all participants are polite and self-moderate; <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> applies too. But we've certainly seen that a few participants driving their kine onto this commons have produced a tragedy, albeit a fascinating and useful one. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        On scaling I'd advise applying <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>. I have the same concerns, but it's not a problem yet. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        As noted on <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, even if you haven't implemented such a thing yet you ought to plan for it. To plan for large scales it's good to prototype on smaller ones. And I humbly submit that when folk like Cope are compelled to go elsewhere, it <em>is</em> a problem. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It <em>is</em> very sad that Cope went away. I miss him: he's brilliant and witty. But he wasn't compelled, he chose. How many besides me should we have asked to stop trying to contribute, in order to keep Cope? -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry Ron, a poor choice of words; I meant it seems he felt compelled. And I don't think you or anyone should be asked not to contribute; that's not the point. If XP hadn't become the dominant theme here, something would have. I'd venture to say there are very few who don't find your XP contributions highly valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact it's the value of your contributions that have led directly to this tragedy. Let's look back at the village commons again for a moment. Say I want to grow some carrots there, and you want to keep a cow or two fed. Well, your cattle reproduce faster and provide a more vital service than my carrots - soon the village depends on cattle for its day-to-day business and my carrots are all trampled. Evolution sets in - no one's fault, just the nature of commonses.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the valuable stuff survives, is this "tragedy" really a bad thing? It's free-market dogma to say that it's not bad at all. But let's look closer. Consider the use of antibiotics. Humans depend on them to protect against microbes, but the microbes eventually adapt, rendering the antibiotics useless. In fact the microbes are smarter than we used to give them credit for - once one bug evolves a tolerance to an antibiotic, it actually communicates that tolerance to other species. So a resistant e-coli, for example, can communicate its tolerance to a more dangerous bug like GoldenStaph.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more the antibiotics are used, the more the microbes evolve into strains that can tolerate them. But human medicine isn't the only beneficiary; factory farm animals benefit from antibiotics too, and use more of them more often. So the tragedy here is that the more they're used in factory farming, the more rapidly they're exhausted for human medicine. Since new antibiotics are much harder to develop than they are to mass-produce, the free market is permitting them to be used up by factory-farming instead of conserving them for human medicine. This is serious; there have already been instances of infections untreatable by <em>any</em> known antibiotic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So how would <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a>-style economics help here? Simply, transactions in a <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> aren't restricted to just two parties; any member of the society can pitch their stones in, for or against. So if doctors and their patients were worried about depletion of the antibiotic space by factory farmers, they could bid directly against the supply of antibiotics to those farmers, effectively driving up the price of antibiotics for that use so that the farmers would be forced to consider the true social costs of their abuse. Other forms of farming - free range and organic, of course, but also some alternative factory techniques too - don't require the same abuse of antibiotics, and would naturally become the most cost-effective way to farm.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here on the wiki, I dare say most participants have enjoyed and continue to enjoy the XP discussions. Likewise, most have and do enjoy the pattern pages. Not to mention the many other themes that continue here. A <a href="WikiStoneSociety.html">WikiStoneSociety</a> still seems unnecessary to most participants, I think. Certainly it seems like it would be overkill to me. <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a>(s) will have to prove themselves by prototype and new use before we even consider their application in a pre-existing community like this. <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> is not a mystery, but the scaling limits of the form really ought to be explored before we try to screw around with wild-ass changes. I brought the thing up because it occurred to me that XP here is a pretty fair example of the tragedy, not to complain or suggest any real change of the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        Hm. If I may present an alternate view: the Tragedy of the Commons occurs when people using a shared resource don't treat it as well as they treat their own private stuff, so it ends up going to heck. No one has a short-term individual incentive to treat it nicely (since their one act of treating it nicely won't have a material impact on how well-maintained it is), so it rots. <strong>Enlightened</strong> self-interest is, I think, enlightened precisely to the extent that it manages to avoid this Tragedy by seeing beyond each short-term individual interest. The XP case, which simply shows that not everyone can get what they want in any real community, isn't an example of this Tragedy (or any Tragedy), in the way I think of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would in fact be hard to have a true <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a> on Wiki, since there aren't really scarce resources? Maybe my imagination is just limited this morning. In the canonical <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>, everyone has a short-term incentive to graze Just One More Cow on the commons, and the sum of those incentives results in a useless overgrazed commons. In Wiki, perhaps it's that everyone has a short-term incentive to post One More Yabbit, which eventually leads to so much chatter that no one bothers reading? But we have the good fortune to have the occasional <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> straighten things up; this may allow us to avoid even that form of the Tragedy...
