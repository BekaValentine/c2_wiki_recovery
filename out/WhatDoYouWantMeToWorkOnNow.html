        Conversation: (this really did happen)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Project W, X, Y, and Z Manager: <em>We have run out of money on Project X, it needs to be done, but you can't charge any more of your time to the Project X Account</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Team Leader who is lead on Project W, X and Z: (as he logs-out of project X) <em>What do want us to work on now?</em> (<em>Project W, or Project Z, or some other new project</em>)
        </li>
      </ul>

           <em>To illustrate to those who have never encountered something similar, that others have.</em>

            <li>
               <em>To illustrate </em><a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> situations encountered, hidden agendas and all that, when a team leader is cheesed off.<em></em>

            <li>
               <em>That sometimes managers who run out of money, instead of getting more money for continuing a work, try to get it done by utilizing resources not paid for by the project receiving the benefits of work done.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>That jobs are terminated or fail, when adequate resources and management are not applied.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>To illustrate that resourceless projects may only be done when resources are made available, or are not withdrawn.</em>
