        The meme that says (roughly) that stereotypes can be self-perpetuating; for instance, if everyone assumes that all programmers are geeky antisocial males, only geeky antisocial males are likely to (want to) become programmers.

        Once again, <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a> has demonstrated his masterful ability to document the <a href="ScreaminglyObvious.html">ScreaminglyObvious</a> so even managers can "get" it. -- PCP

        This might be a separate topic called <a href="AfterTheGoldRush.html">AfterTheGoldRush</a> (McConnell's new book), but wouldn't it be interesting to see a <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a> vs. <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> debate about Software Development as a true profession vs. power in the hands of the coders approach of XP?  Although they're both heading for the same goal (better software), the approaches in each of their books seem to be slightly perpendicular to each other.  <em>Slightly perpendicular?</em>

        I bet that <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> would agree with all the problems that <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a> describes. In fact, XP addresses most of them directly, and I bet that <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a> would agree that XP is a fine solution to these problems in certain cases. They would probably disagree on how widely applicable XP is, but <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> does not claim it is applicable to every project.  So, a debate might turn into a boring love-fest. -- <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        That's pretty much the case.  <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a>'s company is now selling <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a> courses, and he's said almost exactly what you conjectured in a number of interviews. -- <a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>
