        Catharsis Hypothesis
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hypothesis: If you buy a punching bag, or release your aggression by playing Quake, or by screaming, then you will be less violent and aggressive in day-to-day life, having "released" your aggression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deprecated? No, disproved!
      </p>
      <p>
        What actually happens is that the person's inhibition against violence lowers and they become more likely to engage in violence against everyone, even innocent bystanders. Violence begets violence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only has the catharsis hypothesis not a skerrick of empirical evidence in its favour, but there are studies showing the exact opposite.

        I know that lots of people use this argument to explain poor behavior including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Being stupid while drunk.
        </li>
        <li>
           Losing control when imposed upon by others.
        </li>
        <li>
           Complaining about systems in which individuals have no power (taxes, the draft.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm sure that in some cases letting these emotions show brings a measure of relief.  Lifting the lid on a pot of boiling water stops the rattle.  But wouldn't it be a better solution to turn down the heat, so that the pot doesn't threaten to boil over in the first place?  Wouldn't it be better to not act stupid/thoughtlessly/anti-socially at all?

        <em>These cases are different from the opening example, because the actor is not releasing stress on a displacement object (punching bag, Quake monster, etc)< but upon another real person.</em>
