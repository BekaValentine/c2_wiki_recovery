        Implementation Inheritance
      </h1>
      <p>
        The class inherits an interface - a set of member function prototypes defining its externally visible usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also inherits any data members or code for those member functions defined in the parent class including construction and destruction code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More specifically, class operations are delegated to the base unless explicitly overriden.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The class may choose to re-implement the member functions defined in order to become differentiated in behaviour from the parent, although in some languages I believe this can be forbidden. Is this true?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A method can be marked to prevent overriding (Java uses the "final" keyword for this).  In some languages this is default behaviour.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the parent class is abstract, the child class will be abstract unless it defines enough members to become concrete. <em>On the other hand, a child class of a concrete class could declare -- but not define -- additional methods, thereby becoming abstract.</em>

        I think the issue here is the way that each level of inheritance may add additional functionality to the object creating method bloat (at least at the exposed levels). I have an object I am currently working with that has 60+ methods/interfaces after two levels of inheritance (yes, a serious case of Refactoring is needed).  Some of the methods that are being added to the more specific daughter class may eventually need to be refactored out into a separate class that will become a variable used with the final object.  If my object (call it BloatClass) is concerned with manipulating a set of data and I just add here and there along the class tree small functions that would enable sorting, I may be able to abstract those functions out of BloatClass into a separate interface or object variable and streamline the inheritance path at the same time creating more reusable code -- and in this case, if I am able to abstract out a sorting class, I probably already have a base class to build that new sorter out of anyway.  <a href="WyattMatthews.html">WyattMatthews</a>
