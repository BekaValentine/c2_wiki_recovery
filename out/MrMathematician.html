        Mr Mathematician
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>, similar to <a href="MrGuruCoder.html">MrGuruCoder</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MrMathematician.html">MrMathematician</a> corrects obviously incorrect mathematical statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in <a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a>: "because the square root of a non-integer is always irrational", the note was added by <a href="MrMathematician.html">MrMathematician</a>: "definitely wrong: sqrt(0.01) == 0.1, where 0.01 is non-integer and 0.1 is rational".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Whereupon that </em><a href="MrMathematician.html">MrMathematician</a> is immediately fired, and replaced with another who notes that sqrt(0.01) is either +0.1 or -0.1. MrProgrammer objects that the sqrt() <em>function</em> usually is single-valued. MrPedantic notes that the original statement is about pure mathematics, not programming, so the new <a href="MrMathematician.html">MrMathematician</a>'s point is well-taken. They all go relax over a pint.<em> (</em>MrPedantic relaxes?)
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't the value of the function sqrt() defined as the positive root (and <em>only</em> the positive root), even though a solution to an equation involving sqrt may be of any sign?
