        Why not sign your name like this -- isn't it more stylish? ~ <a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a>

        I kinda like that, but Ward has a semi-official standard of space-double-dash-space. -- <a href="LikeThis.html">LikeThis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>double-dash-space, of course, is the standard signature separator in email.</em>

        plus, we wouldn't want to suffer the same fate when the squatter sends down the troopers.

        A tilde is often used in a filename to indicate a temporary or backup file, so count me in favour of the TildeSig <em>temporarily</em>.<-~-~~ <a href="CarstenKlapp.html">CarstenKlapp</a>

        I use both. Perhaps a standard will evolve where

      <ul>
        <li>
            --<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>  is for serious comments.

        <li>
           ~<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> is for quips, <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> comments, and anything the author feels is transitory in nature. It sure is easier than putting <a href="OpenAuthor.html">OpenAuthor</a> after each sig.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The tilde can be used to mean "approximately", as in "pi ~= 4" (For sufficiently small values of 4 :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also standard unix shorthand for a home directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tilde also combines with an n in Spanish to form the "<em>eñe</em>", as in "<em>Mañana</em>". But can the ñ be used in a WikiÑame? HastaMañana?  Sadly, no, it can't.

        I like it better for a short sig. Not so much for a long one. ~ Pete
