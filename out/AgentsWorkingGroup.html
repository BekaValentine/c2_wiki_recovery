        The mission of the <a href="ObjectManagementGroup.html">ObjectManagementGroup</a> (OMG) <a href="AgentsWorkingGroup.html">AgentsWorkingGroup</a> is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>to provide a forum to educate OMG on agent technology (</em>e.g.<em>, via presentations);</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>to develop a framework or architecture for agent technology that is complementary and consistent with the OMG </em>ObjectManagementArchitecture and existing and emerging OMG specifications.  A corresponding roadmap of recommendations for priorities for technology adoption will also be developed. Agent WG will work with existing task forces to develop a possible RFI and one or more RequestForProposals (RFPs) related to the agent architecture and roadmap; and <em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>to develop liaison efforts with FIPA and other groups focused on agent technology to coordinate standards adoption.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The issue of the scope of the <a href="AgentsWorkingGroup.html">AgentsWorkingGroup</a> is still to be determined, and requires discussion at future meetings and possibly an RFI. How an agent architecture relates to OMA is still to be determined as well but that is the central question of the <a href="AgentsWorkingGroup.html">AgentsWorkingGroup</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue of which group(s) <a href="AgentsWorkingGroup.html">AgentsWorkingGroup</a> should report to was handled by having both the platform Internet SIG and the domain ElectronicCommerceTaskForce formally jointly meet to sponsor the group.  But at the same time there is interest from other groups (e.g., OA&D TF) and there is an intent to accommodate the wide interest in agents and not just look through Internet or EC glasses, so all interested parties are invited to participate in <a href="AgentsWorkingGroup.html">AgentsWorkingGroup</a>.
