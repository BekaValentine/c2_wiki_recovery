        ... after the <a href="AuthorReadsTheWork.html">AuthorReadsTheWork</a>, the reviewers are
        seated in the <a href="AuthorsCircle.html">AuthorsCircle</a>, ready to give feedback
        on the work.  What does the author do now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The author should hear the comments directly,</strong>
        <strong>and should know who said them, so they</strong>
        <strong>have the fullest possible context.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Yet the comments are likely to be more frank if</strong>
        <strong>the author isn't present.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But too much frankness contradicts </strong><a href="SafeSetting.html">SafeSetting</a>.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ask the author to step out of the </strong><a href="AuthorsCircle.html">AuthorsCircle</a> and<strong></strong>
        <strong>become a </strong><a href="FlyOnTheWall.html">FlyOnTheWall</a>.  During <a href="VolunteerSummarizesTheWork.html">VolunteerSummarizesTheWork</a>,<strong></strong>
        <strong></strong><a href="PositiveFeedbackFirst.html">PositiveFeedbackFirst</a>, and <a href="SuggestionsForImprovement.html">SuggestionsForImprovement</a>,<strong></strong>
        <strong>the author:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>is not referred to by name, but is instead called: 'the author';</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>may absolutely not speak;</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>should not make eye contact with the reviewers (which is largely the responsibility of the reviewers)</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This helps the
        reviewers to focus on the material by putting the author
        out of sight, out of mind.
        The author can still appreciate <a href="PositiveFeedbackFirst.html">PositiveFeedbackFirst</a>,
        but is distanced from the personal impact of
        <a href="SuggestionsForImprovement.html">SuggestionsForImprovement</a>.
