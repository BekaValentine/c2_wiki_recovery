        Delta Configuration List
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>: Complex system is acting strange. Technician suspects that some obscure setting has been inadvertently changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>: A <a href="DeltaConfigurationList.html">DeltaConfigurationList</a> that shows only those settings different from default and/or outside of expected range. (A complete list would also be nice as an option.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An operating system <a href="DeltaConfigurationList.html">DeltaConfigurationList</a> could look something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        USER INTERFACE:<br/>
        Pull-down list length: 400px (default: 200px)<br/>
        Double-click wait gap: 8000ms (default: 400ms) ** FAR OUTSIDE OF TYPICAL RANGE **<br/>
        PRINTING:<br/>
        Double-sided: On (default: off)<br/>
        Orientation: Landscape (default: auto)<br/>
        Etc...<br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        A common cause of problems is some doofus fiddling with settings out of boredom or naivety and making a system act strange by flipping some obscure setting. I've seen technicians eyeball through hundreds of parameter and configuration settings trying to find something out-of-the-ordinary. I admire their patience and keen eyes, but it seems anti-automation. If there was a way to generate a delta-list, then hunting down such problems would be easier. (If vendors would tablize their config settings into standard DBMS, then writing our own comparison queries would at least be an option.) --top
