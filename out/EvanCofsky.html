        Wow, it's certainly been a long time since I was here.  I've since been working on many things, had some interesting times, and managed to get reconnected and disconnected again with old friends.  Currently I'm working for a start-up very close to home, am spending more time working on music again, and generally having fun doing interesting things for a change.

        And, of course, working with some brilliant people and helping where I can.  I may be a good software developer, but the work this company does involves more algorithms, analysis, and hard math than I know.  So instead I help clean up code, the build system, and try my hand at increasing other people's awareness of unit tests, code reviews, and beer runs.

        Oh, and I'm practicing off and on (mostly off) for auditions, music festivals, and looking for music students (not very hard yet).
