      <p>
        John Farrell (<a href="mailto:friendless@optushome.com.au)">mailto:friendless@optushome.com.au)</a> is a programmer from a research background who lives and works in Brisbane, Australia.
        He was once known as Friendless (well, still is).
        He's an active member of the Australian Java User Group in Brisbane.
      </p>

        John holds a Ph.D. in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> from the University of Queensland [<a href="http://www.uq.edu.au/].">http://www.uq.edu.au/].</a>
        His doctoral dissertation was on <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>, in particular the mathematical analysis of functional programs to find CompilerOptimizations.
        It all seems so long ago.

        In my spare time, I play squash and drink beer, in that order.
        Even though the beer returns the calories I burnt, the IncreasedBasicMetabolicRate seems to keep me fitter.
        That's my story and I'm sticking with it.

        On the <a href="MyersBriggs.html">MyersBriggs</a> temperament assessment, I'm an ENTP (Inventor).
        Inventors are the people least likely to do things one way because that's the way they've always been done.
        You may notice I am often a voice of dissent, e.g. I started <a href="DoNotUseAssertions.html">DoNotUseAssertions</a>.
        However, any useful idea will be able to withstand some criticism.

        <em>John, sorry I didn't answer to your comment on my homepage (</em><a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>) any sooner - I just didn't look at that page.
        When I said there were so many GreatBooksToRead, I was probably mostly referring to my (partly unread) software engineering books. Great Fiction? Haven't encountered any in the last few months, sorry.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks Falk.
        I had a look at the Refactoring book over the weekend, and was quite impressed. Unfortunately, I squandered much of the weekend reading the history of WorldSeriesCricket :-) and didn't get a good look. Seems to be a lot of <a href="WikiWisdom.html">WikiWisdom</a> distilled, we could do with a few more books like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"</em><a href="WikiWisdom.html">WikiWisdom</a> distilled" would be a good phrase to describe <a href="ThePragmaticProgrammer.html">ThePragmaticProgrammer</a>, which is the book I liked best since the Refactoring book. -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a><em></em>

        The other day, I came across your article MakeBadCodeGood. It turned out to be very helpful in my current project - as a discussion starter, as way to quickly get across another big piece of <a href="WikiWisdom.html">WikiWisdom</a>, and as a source of new ideas. Thanks a lot! (More of the same! ;-) ) -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        I think I'm an Imbecile:
      </p>
      <code>
        "With the eyes of a fool," he said,<br/>
        "You see the state you're in,<br/>
        Still you stumble through your stupid life,<br/>
        Still you laugh and grin;<br/>
        Vagabond on a winding road,<br/>
        That only leads you down,<br/>
        Blind to the danger and dismay,<br/>
        That wiped the innocent smile away,<br/>
        From the face of a laughing clown."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Imbecile, you are acting like a fool again,<br/>
        In a world of thieves all ready to run you down,<br/>
        Imbecile, they are waiting 'til you make the first mistake,<br/>
        And you're goin' to make it,<br/>
        That's why I'll always call you an imbecile.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        "You weren't always a sorcerer,"<br/>
        The joker then replied,<br/>
        "It seems to me you've learned it on the way,<br/>
        You live by tricks and lies,<br/>
        Standing 'round in your jugglers gown,<br/>
        There seems no reason why;<br/>
        Flashing your eyes and casting spells,<br/>
        With candles, and signs, and magic bells,<br/>
        Oh, you are the fool, not I."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Imbecile, you can call me that if you feel the need,<br/>
        But life is short, and I am living it while I can.<br/>
        If it rains I'll get wet, but in the sunshine I'll be dry,<br/>
        It is you who are foolish,<br/>
        Just 'cause I laugh don't call me an imbecile.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        "We both are right," said the sorcerer,<br/>
        "And both of us are wrong,<br/>
        For though we walk this road, we don't know where it leads.<br/>
        We only know it's long.<br/>
        You have something to learn from me,<br/>
        And I can learn from you;<br/>
        You with your jokes and simple plans,<br/>
        And me with my tricks and sleight of hand,<br/>
        Together we could get through.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Imbeciles, we are dancing down a darkened road,<br/>
        Though the stars are out not one of us knows the way.<br/>
        Imbeciles up ahead of us, and millions more behind,<br/>
        And we're laughing and smiling that's why I say,<br/>
        We're all of us imbeciles.<br/>
      </code>
