        I'm just a new user to Wiki and making webpages in general, so I figured that the best way to learn Wiki would be to have my own page. This system seems pretty neat though.

        This summer I am working at the University of Washington (Seattle) on a physics research project called WALTA, which investigates the origins of high energy cosmic rays. You can learn more about it by clicking on this link:

        As you can tell by the link, the WALTA webpage needs a little bit of work, so that's one of the many things I will be working on this summer along with Professor Jeff Wilkes, Mara LeMagie (an undergrad at the UW), Seattle area high school teachers, and several other UW undergrads (I haven't met them yet).
