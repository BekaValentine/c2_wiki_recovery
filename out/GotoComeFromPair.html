        Goto Come From Pair
      </h1>
      <p>
        An attempt at alleviating the dangers of Goto (<a href="GotoConsideredHarmful.html">GotoConsideredHarmful</a>) and <a href="ComeFrom.html">ComeFrom</a> (<a href="InterCal.html">InterCal</a>), by combining the two into something a little more strict. The basic concept is that each <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> and <a href="ComeFrom.html">ComeFrom</a> has a list of targets/sources - <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>'s must be mentioned by the target <a href="ComeFrom.html">ComeFrom</a> clause, or else the <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> is illegal (compiler-enforced).
      </p>
      <p>
        In serial languages, it'd be sensible to only allow one target for each <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>, and only let one <a href="ComeFrom.html">ComeFrom</a> reference a single <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> label. In a parallel language, just insert thread spawning where appropriate :P
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
      </p>
      <code>
        void someFunc()<br/>
        {<br/>
        T *X1, *X2;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        X1 = (T*)malloc(...);<br/>
        ...<br/>
        if (FAILED(func1())<br/>
        func1_failed: goto clean1;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        X2 = (T*)malloc(...);<br/>
        ...<br/>
        if (FAILED(func2())<br/>
        func2_failed: goto clean2;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        clean2: comefrom func2_failed, func3_failed, ...;<br/>
        free(X2);<br/>
        clean1: comefrom func1_failed, funcX_failed, ...;<br/>
        free(X1);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        See, that's just <em>soo</em> readable, isn't it? Might put this in my next language, unless I go with swap/cc instead (goto^comefrom is a bit too self-documenting for that language's goals :P)  I'm hardly plagued by the simultaneous ugliness and self-documentativeness of the construct. Is this made for a serious language or for a prank language? *Dunno*

        Some ideas for extensions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Add a when ... clause, kind of like Ada's entry conditions (you'd probably want it so that the conditions have to be compile-time enforcible though... at least in a C-style language)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        clean2: comefrom ... when (success1 == true && success2 == true);<br/>
        clean1: comefrom ... when (success1 == true && success2 == false);<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Add an 'indecision' clause, which halts program execution for a random amount of time before proceeding to a random comefrom statement.
        </li>
        <li>
           Add a 'googlemaps' clause, which traces out a series of goto/comefrom jumps that will automagically lead to a correct program, as long as you're connected to the Internet.  However, if you try to print from a program with a 'googlemaps' clause, it will behave as an 'indecision'.
        </li>
        <li>
           Add a 'honey_lets_just_ask_for_directions' clause, which crashes your program while a <a href="CowboyCoder.html">CowboyCoder</a> jumps in the car, er, computer, takes control, corrupts all variables, and then dumps you at a random comefrom location.
        </li>
      </ul>
