        Apt Get
      </h1>
      <p>
        apt-get [--options] [command] [package]
      </p>
      <p>
        Very popular command for <a href="DebianGnuLinux.html">DebianGnuLinux</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Say you decide you want office for your <a href="DebianGnuLinux.html">DebianGnuLinux</a> box; you simply follow the following steps:
      </p>
      <p>
        First you want to check whats new on the net, the command doesn't return any useful info, unless you encounter an error.
      </p>
      <code>
        apt-get update<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then you want to check out which packages you can choose from:
      </p>
      <code>
        apt-cache search office<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That gives you a fairly long list of office (and esp. office related) packages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say you choose <a href="OpenOfficeOrg.html">OpenOfficeOrg</a>, and you want danish language:
      </p>
      <code>
        apt-get install openoffice.org<br/>
        apt-get install openoffice.org-l10n-da<br/>
        apt-get install openoffice.org-hyphenation-da<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or simply:
      </p>
      <code>
        apt-get install openoffice.org openoffice.org-l10n-da openoffice.org-hyphenation-da<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To remove a package:
      </p>
      <code>
        apt-get remove "package"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To remove and delete configuration files:
      </p>
      <code>
        apt-get remove --purge "package" <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It might turn out, that in order to actually run the office package, you need some libraries or other files, if this is the case, <a href="AptGet.html">AptGet</a> will ask you if its ok to download and those also.  When you answer yes, the download starts, and when it finishes, you might be asked some configuration questions, but I don't think there are any for <a href="OpenOfficeOrg.html">OpenOfficeOrg</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caveat: You have to be root to run this from the command-line.  Hopefully someday it will be a wrapper to <a href="SuDo.html">SuDo</a> or something.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        GUI's ARE also available for apt, such as dselect, Aptitude, Synaptic, or Kpackage. This is important so that you don't spend all your time looking for packages through HTML websites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is doubly true since packages.debian.org is down a great deal of the time.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Aptitude is more a TUI (uses ncurses) than a full GUI. It also has a command line mode that is mostly compatible with apt-get eg. you can say 
      </p>
      <code>
        aptitude install "package"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It will also complain if you try to run it as a normal user and give you a chance to enter the root password instead of just failing.
