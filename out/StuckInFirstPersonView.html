        Stuck In First Person View
      </h1>
      <p>
        From the <a href="FraudulentMindset.html">FraudulentMindset</a> page, someone who is <a href="StuckInFirstPersonView.html">StuckInFirstPersonView</a> sees every problem from a first person view rather than stepping outside and considering third person view. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea is also promoted in Buddhism, where one is supposed to view oneself in another person's shoes.
      </p>
      <p>
        One may go so deep inside his <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> (and become nearly romantically involved with it) that he almost becomes the <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> himself. Advertising it as if he is the <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> <em>advisor</em>, he who sees all through the <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>. The first person view of the <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> becomes that person's life.
      </p>
      <p>
        One should step outside of first person view and become a third person - looking in virtual mirrors, checking to see if he is being a hypocrite, if he is solving problems only from one view point, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Every problem can be solved with Lisp. All programming languages just reinvent Lisp (<a href="StuckInFirstPersonView.html">StuckInFirstPersonView</a> seeing everything as Lisp).
        </li>
        <li>
           That person over there is very critical (hey, so are <em>you</em> for saying such - critical of criticism)
        </li>
        <li>
           My running shoes are the best. No other shoes would work (try stepping into someone else's shoes, you might like them)
        </li>
      </ul>
