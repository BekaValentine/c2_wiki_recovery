        When Earth's last picture is painted and the tubes are twisted and dried,<br/>
        When the oldest colours have faded, and the youngest critic has died,<br/>
        We shall rest, and, faith, we shall need it -- lie down for an aeon or two,<br/>
        Till the Master of All Good Workmen shall put us to work anew!<br/>

        And those that were good shall be happy: they shall sit in a golden chair;<br/>
        They shall splash at a ten-league canvas with brushes of comets' hair;<br/>
        They shall find real saints to draw from -- Magdalene, Peter, and Paul;<br/>
        They shall work for an age at a sitting and never be tired at all!<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        And only the Master shall praise us, and only the Master shall blame;<br/>
        And no one shall work for money, and no one shall work for fame,<br/>
        But each for the joy of the working, and each, in his separate star,<br/>
        Shall draw the Thing as he sees It for the God of <a href="ThingsAsTheyAre.html">ThingsAsTheyAre</a>! <br/>

        We are much beholden to Machiavel [Machiavelli] and others, that write what men do, and not what they ought to do.  --<a href="FrancisBacon.html">FrancisBacon</a>

        All enemy divisions,<br/>

        The craft that we call modern,<br/>

        Likewise the Lords of Looseness<br/>
        That hamper faith and works,<br/>
        The Perseverance-Doubters,<br/>
        And Present-Comfort shirks,<br/>
        With brittle intellectuals<br/>

        John Bunyan met that helpful set<br/>
