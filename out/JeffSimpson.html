        Previous to that, I spent about a year watching dot-coms become <em>dot-gones</em>.  Wasn't pretty. I kinda got burned out from total company meltdowns while I was doing some of the best engineering I've ever done.

        I used to be a consultant for <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> in the days before the <em>fall</em>. Got to know a couple of extremely talented people there.

        Before that, I spent several years programming in Smalltalk, C, C++ and Fortran.

        I spent the first 5 years of my professional career doing Biomedical Engineering for Harvard and University College London.

        And the first dime I ever made programming was building and running a computer dating service. That was fun.
