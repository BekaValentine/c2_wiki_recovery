      <p>
        <a href="CindyScript.html">CindyScript</a> is an easy to learn yet still very powerful <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>. It is designed to allow high-level interaction with geometric constructions or physical simulations created in Cinderella.2. Nevertheless, it can also be used as a standalone language for performing mathematical calculations.

           just found it after looking at some cool applets in <a href="http://www.gfalop.org/I/">http://www.gfalop.org/I/</a>

        It's new to me, and I wanted to see what c2 had to say about it.
        A new language for the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>! -- <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a>

           Samuel A. Falvo II sez: <em>The language appears to be very strongly inspired by </em><a href="IoLanguage.html">IoLanguage</a>, as far as its syntax is concerned. I like the syntax, at least, even if I'll never use the language. :-)<em></em>

           It looks ok, though somewhat awkward. I don't see much sense in functional control flow. I would have chosen to make minor extensions to <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. There's probably more code written in C, C++, or <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> than anything else. Comfortable syntax and semantics.
