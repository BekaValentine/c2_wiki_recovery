        Games As Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        A game can be a solution to a problem in a context.  Just one course of action among many.  So a pattern language for running workshops would have patterns about playing games.  My intuition is to have patterns about games, and to have them referring to categorised <a href="ListsOfGames.html">ListsOfGames</a>.

        Getting an idea of the forces would be good learning for the pattern-writers, and pattern-users.

        For one workshop I made a grid of games under intimacy (low/high) and energy (low/high) and found it useful.  At one time during the session I asked the participants to choose the quadrant themselves, and went along with their choice.  They wanted quiet and close, whereas I wanted running about and distance - probably my own distress.  Plenty of patterns here.
