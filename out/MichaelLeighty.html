        Just messing around with wiki.  It's pretty freakin neat.  I really wish though that you can change the font.  I know I am being picky but Times New Roman just doesn't do it for me.  If anybody knows the easiest way to change this. Please let me know at the following address (minus the underscores and spaces - they're there to make sure i don't get spammed)  m_ l_e i __g_ _h__t__y   @  an__g_e___l__i__c__a     .____com
