        Hive Mind
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a> is not the same as a <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>. A <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a> has one thought process that controls each of its composite agents. Thus, there is a strong dictating force, the overmind, that implants an idea into the weaker subminds that enact it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why is that the definition of </em><a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a>? Hives don't work that way. They have no "overmind".<em></em>
      </p>

        Yes and this weaker mind is the one who the idea seems hard to.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if the idea was so hard that no one person could think of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if the idea were so large that 1000 people could not think it.

        But what if the idea were good for everyone, like <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> - OS commerce is an example of an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> commercial application which people contribute to, and has fostered cooperation between many online businesses

        I'd say television is the best mechanism created for creating a <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a> (followed closely by religious institutions and the academic tradition). People who watch television share common experiences and thoughts, although these are created by television. Take, for instance, the phenomenon of two people discussing sitcoms they watched the previous night, even if they didn't watch them <em>together.</em> Many people's entire conversational context is TV. These people are the types who quote <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> and TheSimpsons to each other all day long. <a href="GlobalVillage.html">GlobalVillage</a>. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

      <p>
        <em></em>TheSimpsons and <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> are possibly some of the few shows that don't fit this category. Many things from soap opera to teen series to sports do, though.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Come to think of it, I never heard people quote either </em>TheSimpsons or <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> unless in rare and fitting contexts while I have seen people talking about sports or some series all the time and in all walks of life.<em></em>

        Did you read <a href="OrsonScottCard.html">OrsonScottCard</a>'s <a href="EndersGame.html">EndersGame</a>? It's a very good <a href="SciFi.html">SciFi</a> novel (in my opinion). The aliens are ant-like and their behaviour is based on <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a>. -- JeanMarcHeneman
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes. Card develops the </em><a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a> better in SpeakerForTheDead. The buggers aren't truly ant-like because there is a <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a>. Ants follow the rules of <a href="InsectBehaviour.html">InsectBehaviour</a>. The Pequeninos, on the other hand, are first a human-like society, and then turn into a <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a> of sorts. Jane is definitely a <a href="DistributedMind.html">DistributedMind</a>. Card spent a lot of the series contrasting different systems of thinking/society (which are equivalent at some scale). Which means it was very useful to remind us of the series! Thanks. -- ss<em></em>

        Wow, TheSimpsons, Seinfeld, <a href="ThePrincessBride.html">ThePrincessBride</a>, and <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> are some of the most oft-quoted sources among my fellow college students.

        Another good <a href="SciFi.html">SciFi</a> example of the creation of a hive-mind (albeit from a negative perspective) is the book ChildhoodsEnd by ArthurCClarke. Rather than talking about the consequences of such a transformation, it talks about the evolutionary necessity of it, and of the possibility that the perfect human is actually an evolutionary dead end. -- Leadhyena Inrandomtan
