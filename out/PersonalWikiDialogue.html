        Personal Wiki Dialogue
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>If you buy into the </em><a href="WikiMind.html">WikiMind</a> even a bit, interacting with the Wiki is not a dialogue with each other user<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, you are engaged in a personal dialogue with the Wiki itself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each person using the Wiki has their own conversation. Mine has been, so far, illuminating if slightly repetitive. For example, this very concept is more tastefully explained in <a href="WikiInternalDialogue.html">WikiInternalDialogue</a>!

        Sometimes I reply to myself, only years later. It scares me when I do that. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        <em>It's because you are not now what you were years ago, and you have learned (or forgotten) what you were like then and what you are now.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           What <em>was</em> can be as though it is <em>now</em>, so your now can converse with your was  and your <em>now</em> can speak to a <em>future</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           It is a little wild isn't it.  It speaks to the tone of conversation on the Wiki, we can speak on a page as if it were a real time conversation, though the time scale is stretched

           Try having a conversation with <a href="MrSocrates.html">MrSocrates</a> or <a href="MrAristotle.html">MrAristotle</a>! See also <a href="LongNow.html">LongNow</a> and <a href="PerpetualNow.html">PerpetualNow</a>, for related concepts.
