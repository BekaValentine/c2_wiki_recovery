        When the following statement was encountered, I didn't understand it. So I created a structure which included <a href="SimpleMinded.html">SimpleMinded</a> examples:

        Often phrases, sentences and paragraphs will fall into the Domain of "I Don't Understand This", perhaps a similar technique of providing personally understandable examples will bring some enlightenment. It takes some time and some head scratching, but can prove to be a valuable use of both time and thought. The above was constructed in about 5 minutes.

        To make it "reachable", I use the technique of capturing the page to <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a>, because it will provide searching capabilities fitting the developed structure into a large collection of artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make a page "readable", I convert them into <a href="ReallyValuablePages.html">ReallyValuablePages</a> to a Pdf Format which is then readable using my Reader/Browser/Pad. (Pandigital 20110203)

                   <em>Abstract | In this chapter, we advance, from the point of view of Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, an analysis of which ontological dimensions are needed to develop Mobile Web 2.0 on top of Semantic Web. This analysis will be particularly focused on social networks and it will try to make an outlook about the new knowledge challenges on this field. Some of these new challenges will be linked to Semantic Web context, while others will be inherent to Semantic Mobile Web 2.0.</em>
