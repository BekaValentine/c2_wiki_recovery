        Is there any discussion etc about coding styles here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yep. Check out </em><a href="CodingStandard.html">CodingStandard</a>. In my opinion having, _a_ standard is more important than having _a particular_ standard --<a href="AlexVanDenBergh.html">AlexVanDenBergh</a><em></em>

        <em> What about </em><a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a> or <a href="CodingStandard.html">CodingStandard</a> for languages that don't rely on curly brackets for scoping? I can see how this page applies, for example, to <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a>, but what is a good <a href="SqlCodingStyle.html">SqlCodingStyle</a>? -- <a href="BevanArps.html">BevanArps</a>

        I prefer this
      </p>
      <code>
        int f(int a, int b)<br/>
        {<br/>
        if(a<b)<br/>
        {<br/>
        printf("hello!");<br/>
        return a+b;<br/>
        }<br/>
        return a-b;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        instead of 
      </p>
      <code>
        int f(int a, int b) {<br/>
        if(a<b) {<br/>
        printf("hello!");<br/>
        return a+b;<br/>
        }<br/>
        return a-b;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        -- <a href="SavasAlparslan.html">SavasAlparslan</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Those are the two main styles, the difference being the top style is liked by programmers looking at the braces as the scope while the bottom style is preferred by programmers using indention as the scope. The indented scope is actually easier to read if you quit trying to find the braces and just look at the text indention. It also makes better use of vertical space allowing for more compact looking code.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a third mainstream style.
      </p>
      <code>
        int f( int a , int b) {<br/>
        if ( a<b ) {<br/>
        printf("hello !);<br/>
        return a + b ; }<br/>
        return a-b ; } <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That's why in the current project we enshrined the standard that everybody can close braces wherever he or she damn pleases, with the only condition that the identation look should reflect the block structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Quite aside from how it looks, this has the problem that, when the last line of the block changes, the brace must be continually fiddled with, which takes more editing effort. Similarly the following less-than-universal comma style is helpful in initializers:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        char *strings[] = {<br/>
        "one"<br/>
        ,"two"<br/>
        ,"three"<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I hold that the editing effort should be the least of concerns in <a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a>. First of all, code is much more read than edited, that's an universal observation that everybody seems to agree with. Second, I do expect people to do more thinking than typing when programming. The later is per good old <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a>, but I know the principle became much less fashionable lately. In any case the extra editing effort necessary to maintain the third style is minimal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see your point of view, and that it could work for you, but I don't see that this would persuade people to switch.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That was my "insight" into the problem. The problem with enforcing (it is rarely persuasion ) strict <a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a>s on grown up programmers is that it is most like an invasion of privacy. So wouldn't it be nice if everyone would write in the style he/she is more confortable with ? Therefore pretty much all styles suggested on this page will be acceptable, even in the same codebase. Of course if someone is editing a file someone else's code he/she will have to adapt to the local style, however this should be a rare occurrence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yep. But also see </em><a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>s comments below about just using a <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>er. I don't mind at all making minor edits to a file that uses even pretty strange stylistic conventions, but when one is required to actually <strong>author</strong> all files in a strange project convention, the pretty-print-anyway-you-like-on-edit approach is nice.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Apparently the </em><a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a> comment has been removed or his name trimmed - however, my current project is only one thing away from a wholly automated solution - the code is stored in the version control system in a minimal style, perhaps sans any indentation, and every checkout would prettyprint the module following the developer's personal style, and checkins would prettyprint into the minimal style. The only obstacle is that C++ has no good <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>er - the best I've found cannot keep one structure the same - it flip-flops between 2 indentions for some constructs<em> -- </em><a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

      <p>
        (Oops, I meant <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>, not <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>) Cool; pity you haven't found a good C++ <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>er; I thought maybe I just hadn't looked hard enough. If you find one, I see a plea on the <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>er page; good place to put a link. I'm sure someone could turn the GNU <a href="GnuCpp.html">GnuCpp</a> parser into a good <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>er, if it were worth the effort - which I suppose it hasn't been, so far. I've never seen even a perfect C <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>er, even though that's an easier job than C++. But I've often settled for whatever <strong>indent</strong> can manage. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        I prefer the other one...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Opinions notwithstanding, this is the correct style:
      </p>
      <code>
        int f(int a,int b){if(a<b){printf("hello!");return a+b;}return a-b;}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Anything else is wrong.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Yikes! <a href="WhereDoTheBracesGo.html">WhereDoTheBracesGo</a>?! This particular style issue has been debated since the dawn of curly braces. I suggest you flip a coin to pick your team's style. If you're used to the one style it takes about ten minutes to learn to like the other just as much (assuming you try).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Or get a <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>er, like e.g. SourceStyler (<a href="http://www.ochresoftware.com/">http://www.ochresoftware.com/</a> - commercial, Windows-only), and let people reformat each other's code to a style that suits them. -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is my favorite approach, since it's a win-win on an otherwise lose-lose religious war topic. -- </em><a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ers can mess up good formatting, so I wouldn't bother unless the code is really badly formatted. Don't get in the habit of running perfectly good code through a <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>er just because the brace placement isn't the one you like to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to use this form consistently:
      </p>
      <code>
        int f(int a, int b) {<br/>
        if (a < b) {<br/>
        printf("hello!");<br/>
        return a + b;<br/>
        }  <br/>
        return a-b;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now I use either of the two up top (with 4 or 8 character indent), it doesn't matter to me anymore. I can read both, no problem. The best argument both for and against lining up the braces is ease of copy and paste.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>this is the style I'm drifting toward:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        int <br/>
        function(int a, int b) <br/>
        {<br/>
        if (a < b) <br/>
        {   printf("hello!");<br/>
        return a + b;<br/>
        }  <br/>
        return a - b;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The ugliest brace form I've seen (from the Lightspeed C compiler libraries):
      </p>
      <code>
        int f(int a, int b) <br/>
        {<br/>
        if (a<b) <br/>
        {<br/>
        printf("hello!");<br/>
        return a+b;<br/>
        }  <br/>
        return a-b;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I have preferences about white space, but they're just preferences.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Python C style guide has pretty good whitespace recommendations: <a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0007.html">http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0007.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some things that <strong>do</strong> matter:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tab characters are 8 spaces - not 4, 3, or 2
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't use them
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't put the target of the if on the same line, or multiple statements on the same line:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        /* don't do this */<br/>
        if (a < b) callthis();<br/>
        else       callthat();<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        /* or this */<br/>
        x = function1();  y = function2();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Why is this a bad idea? It interferes with debugging - debuggers only like to set breakpoints on line numbers. You can't set a breakpoint on either of the if target clauses. This can be a real problem if the code is called a lot and your only interested in the one in 10000 case where one of the specific clauses is triggered. Setting a breakpoint in the assembly is possible, but it's tedious and a waste of time. Why bother? Just split up your if:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (a < b) <br/>
        callthis();<br/>
        else<br/>
        callthat();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, I prefer the one-liner because it looks better and doesn't waste vertical space. Scrolling sucks.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I always use braces - makes it MUCH easier to add lines - <a href="NissimHadar.html">NissimHadar</a>
        :
      </p>
      <code>
        if (a<b) {<br/>
        callThis();<br/>
        }<br/>
        else {<br/>
        callThat();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        if(a<b)callthis();<br/>
        else callthat();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>and my debugger set's breakpoints just fine for those either on the if or on the callthis(), so maybe you need a better debugger.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Conventions about symbols are probably more useful than formatting conventions. Guidelines for capitalization are a good place to start.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Taligent's conventions are worth a look

        A contrary rule of thumb for C++ classes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Put the private data up top. Trust me. dB^)
        </li>
        <li>
           [An extension of the above] <em>Put member variables at the top, followed by inline constructors, followed by an inline destructor. Why? It makes it visually easy to verify that everything gets initialized and destroyed. I can live with other approaches, this one just eliminates hopping around in the editor.</em>

      </ul>

        My opinion has changed recently with respect to member ordering. I used to put public methods first (followed by private member vars), since the public interface is arguably more important to anyone browsing the code. However, I've recently been using the 'traditional' style of putting private members, etc., first, followed by methods, and it just seems faster to work with... although I can't explain why. -- <a href="MikeWeller.html">MikeWeller</a>

        For the code example we've been using on this page, I would probably write:

        int f(int a, int b) {<br/>
        if (a >= b) return a - b;<br/>

        return a + b;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That is, I prefer to handle simple cases earlier in a function, and return from the middle of functions freely. But if not permitted to rewrite the logic like that, I'd prefer
      </p>
      <code>
        int f(int a, int b) {<br/>
        if (a < b) {<br/>
        printf("hello!");<br/>
        return a + b;<br/>
        }  <br/>
        return a-b;<br/>

        I think that one difficulty arises from the use of whitespace as 2 things - a code structure delimiter, and a readability aid. I sometimes see assignments lined up with all the ='s in a column, or all function arguments split out on separate lines, lined up with the first one vertically. Those are readability. Indents following if/then/else are code structure. Some things are both - alignment of subclauses in a large boolean condition, frex. I don't think that readability can have only tabs, while code structure seems possible with only tabs. -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

If only twice, do so only after you have a good <em>conceptual grouping</em>; that is, an abstraction that would likely facilitate code re-use.

           Documentation/Comments?  If your language integrates it lexically (ex. <a href="DocStrings.html">DocStrings</a>), probably yes, because there will be more eyeballs/tools keeping docs up-to-date.  If it integrates <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> via <a href="DocTest.html">DocTest</a>s, for sure.   Otherwise, <em>there is no rule</em>, because out-of-date comments are worse than useless (cf. <a href="TimPeters.html">TimPeters</a>).

        <em>Your tips are reasonable, but none are about </em><a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a>.  The first is more about levering language capability than applying <a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a>, and it's largely governed by the language you're using -- for example, some languages reasonably and usefully support anonymous functions and/or classes.  Your second tip is a good example of <a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a> and <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.  It's more about good programming practice -- and common-sense avoidance of repetition and redundancy -- than <a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a>.  The last is also an issue of good (or not -- it's controversial) programming practice.  However, how you format the comments would be about <a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a>.<em></em>

           You got me before I updated.  I've called-out my recommendations for procedural languages.  Thanks for reminding me of the pre-existing pages.  I disagree that they aren't coding style, because they inform every line of code you type.
