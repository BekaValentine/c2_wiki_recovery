        Workshop Comprises Authors
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... as described in <a href="SafeSetting.html">SafeSetting</a>, the goals of the writing
        community can best be achieved only when authors are given
        feedback useful for evolving their work
        while preserving their dignity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*   *   *</strong>

      <p>
        <strong>The best feedback comes from authoritarian sources,</strong>
        <strong>and most review settings elicit the feedback of</strong>
        <strong>experts (and those with vested interests)</strong>
        <strong>in an authoritarian setting.</strong>
        <strong>This posture can contribute to a feeling that</strong>
        <strong>critics are not accountable for what they say,</strong>
        <strong>and that leaves the author</strong>
        <strong>in a disadvantaged position.</strong>
        <strong>We feel uncomfortable while in this position.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no reason that an author should trust
        reviewers except on the basis of their reputation.
        Trust based on subject matter reputation creates
        a hierarchy in the review community, structuring
        "those who know" against "those who write."  This
        breaks down the sense of community and leaves the
        author vulnerable to feelings of inferiority.

        Weinberg notes that one of the strongest
        power positions is learned in our grade school
        years, where the teacher is in the position of power
        to convey ideas to the student, who is passive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Even though expert feedback is important,</strong>
        <strong>pattern authors are usually the most expert</strong>
        <strong>at communicating the pattern they have</strong>
        <strong>experienced again and again.  What nature of</strong>
        <strong>expertise can best improve the work?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the pattern community, it is best that
        <a href="AuthorsAreExperts.html">AuthorsAreExperts</a> in the material they compose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Assemble the workshop membership from other</strong>
        <strong>authors who are interested in the material,</strong>
        <strong>who have a stake in the material, or whom</strong>
        <strong>the author otherwise believes will contribute</strong>
        <strong>to the goal of improving the work.</strong>
        <strong>If all the participants are authors,</strong>
        <strong>it contributes to an egalitarian community.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors know and appreciate the <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a>
        culture and are less likely to be disruptive
        with faux pas than a casual outsider would be.
      </p>
      <p>
        As authors, the reviewers have experience with the
        pattern form and its effectiveness, and can contribute
        ideas to improve the expression of the idea.

        This principle derives from the prevailing practice of
        the creative literature review community.
        <a href="RichardGabriel.html">RichardGabriel</a> relates that he knows only of one
        major review setting where this principle is
        violated (BreadLoaf), but that, even there, they
        are explicit about putting the rule aside.

        You wouldn't engage a bereavement expert to improve
        a poem on dying, but an accomplished poet.
      </p>
      <p>
        The author may invite non-authors that they trust to
        improve the work while maintaining the sense of community.
