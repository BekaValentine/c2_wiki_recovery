      <p>
        A very new language:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Object oriented (see <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Garbage collected (see <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> functions
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> continuations
        </li>
        <li>
           Macros
        </li>
        <li>
           Modules
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think this combination makes for the best language possible.  It is really <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, and <a href="MlLanguage.html">MlLanguage</a> combined, with none of the drawbacks.  It is still being developed, but I think it's the most promising language yet.

        My biggest complaint about OO is abstract classes.  They are arbitrary and a pain to maintain.  You make them when you want to write a method that works for different classes - a generic method.  <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> does this automatically, so you don't have to write virtual classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't need abstract classes to write generic methods in <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages, such as <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> or <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> (I don't know about <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>).  A class does not define a type in a dynamically typed language, it only <em>implements</em> a type.  So an object of any class that provides the behaviour expected by a generic method can be passed to that method no matter where that class is located in the inheritance tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you took this powerful concept much further, you would get <a href="PrototypeBasedLanguage.html">PrototypeBasedLanguage</a>s like <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, and <a href="CecilLanguage.html">CecilLanguage</a>.

        Where are some examples of Needle code?  The website only has PDF slides.

        This language has not been worked on since 2002, so don't hold your breath.
