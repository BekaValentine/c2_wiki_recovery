        Carbonated water. (Carbonic acid reverses unpleasant effects of alkalines in the next two ingredients).

        Extract of Coca leaves. (Cocaine, Stimulant.)

        Extract of Kola nuts. (Caffeine, Stimulant. Theobromine (the good stuff in chocolate), Stimulant.)
      </p>

        Sugar. (Considered a stimulant.) (These days, from high-fructose corn syrup. <em>In the US, perhaps, but the </em><a href="CocaCola.html">CocaCola</a> sold in Canada still uses "glucose-fructose", i.e. ordinary sugar. I am told that many Americans prefer the Canadian version.<em>) (Why are you so sure? They switched to corn syrup because it was cheaper than cane sugar, and no one noticed (see the snopes.com discussion). Why wouldn't they use the same cost-reduction measure everywhere in the world?) </em>Because corn syrup in only significantly cheaper than sugar within the US, due to tremendous corn subsidies. -- Scott Vokes<em></em>

        <em>Which is puzzling, since the ingredients and proportions of the Coke formula (and a variety of other colas) are fairly well known. Your list also omits one openly recognized ingredient, phosphoric acid, which is what makes Coke such an effective toilet-bowl cleaner, metal polish, engine de-greaser, tooth disolver, etc. etc.</em>

        Today's formula. The simplistic liquid candy sold now can't account for the product's original meteoric popularity. It was invented by a pharmacist and sold at a time when heroin was an ingredient in a widely used infant teething pain remedy.

        <em>One particular point: present-day Coke doesn't contain any cocaine - although it does contain Coca extract. What's denied is that it </em>ever<em> contained coke, which it almost certainly did sometime in the past.</em>

        It was also used to soothe upset stomachs.  Perhaps to a lesser extent, it can still be used for this.  I find <a href="CocaCola.html">CocaCola</a> helps immensely when I get nausea.  --Samuel A. Falvo II

          As a data point, I have tasted a <em>medio litro</em> <a href="CocaCola.html">CocaCola</a> and noticed it did taste <em>ever so slightly</em> better than the American-made equivalent.  Both are quite good, and unless you're <em>looking</em> for the difference, you probably won't find it.  But, if you do a taste-test between the two, there will be a noticable, albeit very subtle, difference in taste.  As a citizen of the USA, I prefer the Mexican formula over the USA formula. --Samuel A. Falvo II
