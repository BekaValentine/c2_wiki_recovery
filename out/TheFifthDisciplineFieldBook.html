        The amazon reviews are very enthusiastic, but how much benefit could I, someone who is NOT a top-level manager, get from <a href="TheFifthDiscipline.html">TheFifthDiscipline</a> and <a href="TheFifthDisciplineFieldBook.html">TheFifthDisciplineFieldBook</a>? Would I be able to transform my organization into a learning one, if no-one reports to me or even listens to me? -- Just A Programmer

        Probably not. It is necessary for a <a href="LearningOrganization.html">LearningOrganization</a> that the commitment to learning be practiced Company Wide, not just by certain individuals. Inclusion of this commitment in the <a href="MissionStatement.html">MissionStatement</a> of an organization is desirable, if not required.

        <em>However, don't let that put you off reading the book. There's a lot in it that will change your approach to situations at work - and you </em>'can<em>' make your bit of the organisation better by using them. It's not necessary to have a company wide program to see improvement, and it's not necessary to be a senior manager to get benefit from the book. Recommended.</em>

        Whether or not you are an executive manager has very little bearing on the value of the book.  This book is a very good introduction to <a href="SystemsThinking.html">SystemsThinking</a> which can be applied to virtually anything you do.  It can take a macro or micro focus, and thinking through issues in terms of systems of interacting feedback loops can provide new and interesting insights into the nature of problems. <a href="SystemsThinking.html">SystemsThinking</a> is a relative of John Forrester's <a href="SystemDynamics.html">SystemDynamics</a> which provides for more detailed system models and simulation. -- <a href="SeanMcNamara.html">SeanMcNamara</a>
