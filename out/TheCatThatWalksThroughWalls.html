        The Cat That Walks Through Walls
      </h1>
      <p>
        A book by <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a> that has no story. Instead, it is more of an elaborate PracticalJoke on the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        It start with a sane semi-mystery plot. it follows this plot about halfway through the book before suddenly whisking the action away to a different universe and time period. A space station blows up for no apparent reason. The protagonist is killed and revived by <a href="DeusExMachina.html">DeusExMachina</a> in the space of 2 pages.  His whole reason for getting involved in this "story" is retroactively removed by time travel. And the whole thing ends in a TemporalParadox.

      <p>
        Amusing but not coherent.

        <em>I rather disagree.  I liked this book, but it takes some deep thinking to figure out its meaning, much like most of </em><a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a>'s other books.  -X<em></em>
