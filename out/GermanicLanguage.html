        "Scots" above refers to the language of Burns. This is influcenced by but quite different from Scots Gaelic.

      <p>
        English grammar is primarily derived from the Anglo-Saxon, and thus is
        Germanic, although much English vocabulary comes from the <a href="RomanceLanguage.html">RomanceLanguage</a><strong>'s (and others).</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Primarily is rather strong here.  The influence of Latin grammar is equal to or greater than that of Anglo-Saxon in modern English.  The Latin influence was especially strong in the 18th century because Latin was considered to be "superior" to the vernacular.

        <em>Am I right in thinking that Basque and Finnish are not even </em><a href="IndoEuropeanLanguage.html">IndoEuropeanLanguage</a>s, let alone Germanic or Romance?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems you are. <a href="http://www.sil.org/ethnologue/families/Uralic.html">http://www.sil.org/ethnologue/families/Uralic.html</a> identifies Finnish, Estonian and Hungarian (along with a <em>lot</em> of Siberian and Asian languages, some with very few surving speakers) as UralicLanguages. The Basque languages appear to be unrelated to any other known language.

        Actually there are those who have found parallels between BasqueLanguage and some <a href="IndoEuropeanLanguage.html">IndoEuropeanLanguage</a>s, but I'd <br/>
        say that's just a case of ancient fu'ivla<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Some say basque is related to Pictish, but since we don't know what any of those Pictish inscriptions say we'll probably never know.

        Aren't Danish and Norwegian essentially the same language?
