        Bounded Polymorphism
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BoundedPolymorphism.html">BoundedPolymorphism</a> is <a href="ParametricPolymorphism.html">ParametricPolymorphism</a> where a restriction on the set of types a class/function is polymorphic over can be specified; it is an error to try and use a polymorphic function/class with a type which it doesn't support.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JavaGenerics.html">JavaGenerics</a> support <a href="BoundedPolymorphism.html">BoundedPolymorphism</a> via JavaInterfaces; the definition of a generic in Java can specify an interface or class that the class parameter must implement/extend.  If no class or interface is specified, "extends Object" is assumed.  Only operations which are supported by the declared type are allowed in the body of a generic (at least not without a typecast; one can downcast a generic parameter in Java just like any other object reference).
      </p>
      <p>
        Attempting to instantiate a generic on a type not supported is immediately flagged by the compiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and generics won't work on intrinsic types (int, float, char, double, etc.).  However, the new <a href="BoxingConversions.html">BoxingConversions</a> feature in JDK 1.5 might make you forget about that little problem...
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a> generics are very similar.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, on the other hand, does not support bounded polymorphism (at least not directly); it uses <a href="LatentTyping.html">LatentTyping</a>.  When a template is instantiated, little error-checking is done to see if the type provided is consistent with the template's definition.  For example, one can write the following generic functor object in C++:
      </p>
      <code>
        template <class T> class OneAdder {<br/>
        T operator () (const T& t) {return t + 1;}<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Not very useful, but good enough for pedagogical purposes.  If you try and instantiate this object on a type that doesn't support addition (such as an abritrary structure), the compiler won't complain.... yet.
      </p>
      <code>
        struct Foo { int x; int y; };<br/>
        OneAdder<struct Foo> fooAdder; // not an error<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Only when you try and use an unsupported function, do you get an error.
      </p>
      <code>
        struct Foo foo;<br/>
        foo.x = 1; foo.y = 2;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        struct Foo fooPlusOne = fooAdder(foo); // ERROR; struct Foo does not have operator+<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the error message you do get may be rather bizarre and incomprehensible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some consider the C++ approach superior (Many C++ libraries use the laziness of the generic-checking to full advantage), others think it smells.  See <a href="LatentTypesSmell.html">LatentTypesSmell</a> for more on this.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ generics have the advantage of working on any C++ type; non-objects aren't second class in C++.  Whether or not this is a good thing is a longstanding <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>.
