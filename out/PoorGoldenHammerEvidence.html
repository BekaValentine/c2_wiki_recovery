        Poor Golden Hammer Evidence
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ways <em>not</em> to prove that your <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> is better:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           X can be written in terms of <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>; therefore, <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> is better. Problem: <a href="TuringEquivalency.html">TuringEquivalency</a> is rampant. Problem-2: Being better at mirroring other techniques may not extrapolate into being better for everything. Example: Many compilers and interpreters are written in C. However, this does not mean that C is best for everything.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> is more "elegant". Problem: Impossible to objectively measure.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "It's the rage". Problem: You cannot vote the world flat.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is based on a simple base or "atom" that is used to make everything else. Problem: simple parts has not been proven to always lead to simple results. (All else being equal, having simple bases is desirable, but we don't know if it is equal.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Toy examples show <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> solving problem X in fewer steps. Problem: Example may not be representative of real-world problems or all domains.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's better for this one little metric, and therefore it is summarily better. <a href="SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple.html">SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               But note that it's perfectly legit to say: "It's better for this one little metric, and therefore there is this one more little bit of objective evidence that it is better".  Enough such cases constitute a lot of evidence.
