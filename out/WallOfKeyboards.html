      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>JOEL</dt>
        <dd>Yeah, but it's a good way to make a lot of money without a big initial investment. </dd>

        <dd>*ahem, ahem* Okay. And now, Music From Some Guys In Space. Tonight on Music From Some Guys In Space, more fine, new, new-age music and sounds from super progressive Bay Area new age keyboardist Joel Robinson. Joel will be accompanied on the wall of keyboards by veteran minimalist, Crow T. Robot. We invite you to sit back and enjoy more repetitive new age music, as we cruise the spacewaves. Come along, fellow travelers, and enjoy Music ... From ... Some Guys ... In ... Space. </dd>

        I should add some context.  I'm not sure if it's still on, but there was an American public radio show named <em>Music from the Heart of Space</em>. [I'm not sure whether it was an NPR show or an APRN/PRI show.]  It specialized in new age music.  Of course, I think of that as NewAge music.  Rhymes with sewage.  --<a href="EricJablow.html">EricJablow</a>
