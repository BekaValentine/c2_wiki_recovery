        Core Xp Dependencies Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is a fundamental problem with <a href="CoreXpDependencies.html">CoreXpDependencies</a>. It's like taking apart a frog to see how it works. You can learn something, but it kills the frog.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I strongly disagree. </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is not mystical. It's about programming. If you can't explain <strong>why</strong> it works then you don't know if it's sheer luck, or a real solution! The basic problem is that <a href="CorrelationDoesNotImplyCausality.html">CorrelationDoesNotImplyCausality</a>. And, yes, a <em>lot</em> of frogs have been killed by taking them apart over the past few millennia, but as a result we now know a heck of a lot about how frogs work!<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        But we still can't build a frog. And we know a lot about how XP works, too. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think I said that XP is mystical. But it is a whole, and needs to be understood that way as well as in parts. There are many things in the world that I can't explain, yet they still work, and are still real. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And having experienced XP and written more words about it than any other living person, I can assure you with great confidence that there's more to it than deconstruction will ever find. I hope that one day you'll discover that truth for yourself. But don't get me wrong ... the analysis here is good. It's just not <strong>all</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(I think you're misunderstanding my intent -- I certainly DO believe that XP works.  However, I believe we can explain it, too...)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think I'm misunderstanding. You think XP is able to be explained by examining its details. I believe there are things about frogs that we'll never learn from dissection. There are many things we <em>will</em> learn ... but many that must be learned some other way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I do not believe that XP works, convince me.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Try it. Convince yourself.

        Is it just me, or do the XP Core Practices seem like a deck of <a href="MagicTheGathering.html">MagicTheGathering</a> cards?  You can't play <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> until <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a> has been played; <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> doubles the effectiveness of any Refactoring, <a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a>, or <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> cards you've played....
      </p>

        <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a> has built an XP card game that isn't <em>quite</em> that cool but is still pretty cool.
