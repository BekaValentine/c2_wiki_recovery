        BruceTate's book on up and coming languages and technologies which may (hopefully) eclipse Java.  The book has gotten a lot of attention and commentary within and from outside of the Java community, ranging from agreement and support from those of us who've been using better, more dynamic languages for years and have been waiting for the rest of the world to catch up, to hysterical flames from JavaWeenies who see their livelihoods threatened by anything newer and better.
