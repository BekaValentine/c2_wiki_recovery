        <strong>Wikipedia</strong> is a wiki-based encyclopedia project set up at <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/.">http://www.wikipedia.org/.</a> <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> has several sister projects, including Wiktonary, Wikispecies, Wikisource, Wikidata and many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wikipedia began as an offshoot project of <a href="NuPedia.html">NuPedia</a><strong>'s </strong><a href="OpenContent.html">OpenContent</a> encyclopedia project in January, 2001. There were 150,000 articles by August 2003, over 300,000 articles (in the various languages) by September 2003, and almost 600,000 articles by June 2005. In early 2006, the English edition reached the one million milestone. Several other language editions also have over 100,000 articles; though none is as large as the English edition.
      </p>
      <p>
        This success demonstrates the robustness of the wiki concept.

        You can follow Wikipedia's growth by this special page: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:Statistics.</a> There is also this section which shows much more detail: <a href="http://stats.wikimedia.org/,">http://stats.wikimedia.org/,</a> including tables and charts broken down by various methods.

        It looks like there was a sudden burst of visits in Sept 2003. I wonder if that's because of a change in the recording of stats, or if there was some sort of publicity that they received (such as possibly the CNN article (but that was in August) ). <em>Wikipedia was recently mentioned in </em><a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> forums a couple of times.<em></em>

        <strong>News and Important Developments</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It now appears that the comparison done by <em>Nature</em> magazine between Wikipedia and the Encyclopedia Britannica was completely bogus. <em>Nature</em> edited the Britannica articles, creating many of the errors that were found. See <a href="http://corporate.britannica.com/britannica_nature_response.pdf">http://corporate.britannica.com/britannica_nature_response.pdf</a> for Britannica's rebuttal.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Um, no. Try reading <em>Nature</em> 's rebuttal right back to Britannica. Most important point: Britannica took issue with less than half of <em>Nature</em>'s points. <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7084/full/440582b.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v440/n7084/full/440582b.html</a>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   In fairness, if anything approaching half of the errors cited by <em>Nature</em>'s reviewers were inappropriate, that's a pretty significant difference. According to <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/extref/438900a-s1.doc,">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v438/n7070/extref/438900a-s1.doc,</a> <em>Nature</em>'s reviewers identified 123 errors in Encyclopedia Britannica and 162 errors in Wikipedia, or about 1.32 errors in Wikipedia for every error in Britannica. Let's say Britannica took issue with 60 -- about half of those errors -- and then split the difference between Britannica and Nature's stories, so that 30 of the initial 123 are invalid. That leaves 93 errors in Britannica versus 162 in Wikipedia, suggesting 1.7 errors in Wikipedia for every error in Britannica. (If we assume Britannica is correct in asserting that about half the errors aren't actually errors, then the difference could be as large as 63:162 -- more than 2.5 errors in Wikipedia for every error in Britannica). If any significant fraction of the errors cited by Nature's editors are spurious then calling this selection of Wikipedia articles "about as accurate as" the Britannica ones seems generous. (At least at the time. I imagine the Wikipedia articles in question have improved more rapidly than the Britannica articles since this review was published.)
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       If you are going to adjust the numbers, you really should adjust it for both sides. If Nature produced 30 false positives out of 123, there were almost certainly quite a few false positives for Wikipedia as well.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                   Moreover, the point of Britannica's critique seems to be that they take issue with the very methodology used by Nature -- using excerpts instead of full articles, using "yearbook" and student encyclopedia articles instead of the actual Encyclopedia Britannica, creating wholly new articles by combining sections of multiple EB articles, relying on subjective reviewer opinions rather than peer review, etc. They rebut specific errors cited by Nature's reviewers, but more significantly they question the validity of the methodology. Objectively, I don't think it is fair to assert that the "most important point" is the number of errors Britannica's editors objected to.

        My question, to this esteemed Wiki community, is this: Do you think that a Wiki could successfully generate a useful encyclopedia? -- <a href="JimboWales.html">JimboWales</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, but in the end it wouldn't be an encyclopedia. It would be a wiki. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Depends on what you consider useful. It will always be a collection of opinions, more than facts. A summary of the current state of understanding, at best.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As far as it is possible to even think that there are such things as facts, Wikipedia has a much better shot at being a collection of facts than anything done by a closed community or a business. There, even the only stable configuration of recognizing differing opinions on a matter can be reached. And that actually is the only </em>NeutralPointOfView (NPOV). Only those who want to remove others' viewpoints need have their content refused. "Current state of understanding" sounds very good indeed and what would be better?<em></em>

           A cycle I call Sketch, Correct, Expand, Correct. Many pages seem to start as sketches, recollections of facts pulled from someone's noggin. The next round is where someone notices and corrects errors of fact. Then comes a round of expansion, as other people add their recollections. The expanding/correction cycle continues until all the interested parties are satisfied that the page is sufficient.

        Anyone else notice any differences? -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>

        <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> isn't quite useless, but it's certainly overloaded. I understand the software developers are working on a new implementation. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Wikipedia is now surprisingly good for some topics, though care is needed when reading, as sometimes articles manage to present the exact opposite of the truth. Updating can be a bit slow, though the Recent Changes page is usually very good, and can be used to check who else is editing/creating pages over a period of perhaps 3-6 hours. However, when the automated robots (e.g RamMans RamBot) get going, the changes page effectively becomes almost useless, as most of the changes are automated, and occur at a much higher rate than manual (and possibly more meaningful), changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The mass entries by (known and approved) bots are now filtered out of Recentchanges by default, and we're working on other options. In addition to the per-user Watchlist, one can make a category index list (like </em><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Topic_index_California)">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Topic_index_California)</a> and hit "Related changes" for a Recentchanges-like list of all linked pages.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to track different versions is also good - I thought it was done by CVS, though it may not be. Whether or not it is, it is a useful facility.

In some cases I have noticed specific texts get cloned from original sites at universities or labs onto wiki pages. And when that happens, each text loses part of its value.

The question isn't just one of authentication and accountability, though those are important, but something more subtle. A voice should be sensed as a whole. You have to have a chance to sense personality in order for language to have its full meaning. Personal Web pages do that, as do journals and books. Even Britannica has an editorial voice, which some people have criticized as being vaguely too "Dead White Men."</dd>

        Wikipedia is not a static canon. That is not why it is less reliable, it is why it is more reliable. I have edited a few entries in my subject (Ancient History), with care. In many ways, for brief reference, these are as likely as any other printed version to be accurate. I have seen so many errors in peer-reviewed articles that I don't see why we should assume a wide gap between Wikipedia entries and a lot of other more conventional materials...

        There will be a lot of changes necessary to perfect what is simultaneously a dubious, and superb, information source. Some of the brilliant prose on the wikipedia surpasses any other source on the topic. Other areas (almost any involving NPOV) contain a "consensus" bias. There is a legitimate worry that the wikipedia has taken more than one step down the path of an official POV, and has left objective reality out of the debate between the groupthink of the administrators, and the "fringe" views expressed by some newbies. -- Jack Lynch

        Wikipedia is as much a cult as an encyclopedia. The message of the cult is that falsehood is acceptable but that submission to the will of a self-described community is paramount.

        <em>Since so many of its adherents stomp on falsehood with great vigor and glee</em> - that's simply not true. The wikipedia community responds promptly and zealously to <em>point of view</em> material. False information is allowed on the condition that it is attributed to someone, and in most cases the same is required of true material, with the result that for many topics there is no practical distinction between the two. That was something the founders intended, to avoid having to decide what's true and what isn't.
      </p>

        I suspect, however, that the odd and particularly unwikilike nature of interactions on wikipedia stem mainly from the separation of content and discussion, which is exiled to talk pages. That the will of the community is so important and exclusionary comes from there being ground to battle over, which is not nearly so true in this and other wikis. If so, this suggests something important about how wikis work. Has anyone given such matters any thought?

        I'm well aware of wikipedia's strengths and limitations. My question was why it developed such generally different dynamics than at least most other wikis, and I'm wondering if the lack of discussion on the top level might be part of it. Note this wiki has never had the same need for consensus that wikipedia does constantly. Incidentally, voting and consensus are two very different things, and you would do well not to conflate them.

        My experiences with <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> have been generally good. However, certain individuals and cliques tend to try to enforce their own rules (often in "WikiProjects"). I proposed an article for a "Featured Article" and suddenly had "rules" thrust upon me (for which the article did not have and was not required under "Featured Article Requirements"). Most users are helpful, but a few tend to be almost "bullish", something which <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> would be good to stop. -- another anon contribution

        It's not false information to say that certain people make certain claims, even if the claims themselves are false. Wikipedia's guidelines state that the claims, along with any available evidence should be presented. No one looking at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonaid">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clonaid</a> or <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holocaust_denial</a> would come to the conclusion that the claims made by Clonaid or Holocaust deniers are true, even though Wikipedia presents their claims and evidence. These cases are quite clear-cut, however, because there is almost <em>no</em> supporting evidence to present. Are there any better examples you could show me?
      </p>
      <p>
        Subjects like <em>Conspiracy Theories</em> are a funny read in that respect. Concerning <em>Bilderberg</em> for example, they say in the article that there is definite evidence of existence...

        I think Wikipedia's departure from the classical wikis is because of its goal of producing an encyclopedia. The very nature of an encyclopedia is to provide a summary and overview of current knowledge. Wiki, on the other hand, isn't a reference text. Everyone here is trying to develop new knowledge, something that encyclopedia-building doesn't do. Wikipedia simply uses wiki software as a tool for collaborative writing; the wiki is a means to an end. As to your last question, I think the <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> folks have examined Wikipedia's dynamics a bit (WikiPediaIsNotTypical).

        <em>Wikipedia always reminds me of Asimov's "Foundation." Perhaps a hologram of </em><a href="JimmyWales.html">JimmyWales</a> will appear some years from now stating that Wikipedia's true purpose was never to actually produce an encyclopedia...<em></em>

        Wikipedia's strength is on subjects that are obscure. Its <em>great</em> weakness is on subjects that attract cranks. If you want to look up "fluegelhorn", chances are that coverage will be much better than a mainstream encyclopedia. If you want to look up "Friedrich Nietzsche" or "Atlantis" or the sexier kinds of physics, you'll have to wade through a great deal of ranting.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's <em>amazing</em> what kind of subjects draw cranks. Want to look up Foobart of Bazquuzshire, the 16th century author of <em>De Flatulationibus Animalium</em>? There's about a 7% chance that someone out there has seized on Foobart as the big answer to curing cancer or free energy or transgender rights or something and has completely taken over the article. Try to change it and you'll have an <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> of epic proportions on your hands. The best you can hope for is to rephrase all the lunacy in neutral language: "some scholars claim that Foobert..." The tendency for many articles is to become a smattering of useful information amidst a sea of neutral POV-ed hokum.

        My first exposure to wikis was Wikipedia - I was looking for information on 'net and I got referred to wikipedia. It has become the wiki I contribute most to since. From what I have sort of gathered from the discussion here, questions are being raised as to whether wiki encyclopedias work well and whether the sort of consensus/goal orientated behaviours of wikipedia are healthy/suitable for wikis. It seems a complaint is that wikis are innately subjective and hence a wiki encyclopedia trying to massage objectivity from subjective sources (its contributors) will supposedly fail. I think that issue may be less relevant than it seems - it can be side-stepped by considering that what people really want is knowledge of relative consistency; objectiveness is not truly necessary until they get new information that conflicts/is not consistent (ie. Told it's safe to look at the sun and then have their eyes burned). All knowledge from books, television and radios acts this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        What might be the concern is that certain people in the this discussion have come to consider "wiki" to be synonym of "subjectiveness". Considering wikis that way allows you harness a variety of capabilities, but subjectiveness is not why Wikipedia has become the "poster child" of the wiki movement. Wikis like Wikipedia have specific goals and these goals (like creating an encyclopedia) allow them to supersede (not eliminate) the subjective nature of wiki by providing some thing of more important value - in this case authoritative secondary information source. People deal with subjectiveness all the time in the offline world, such as one person loves a certain tv show, another person hates it. Paper encyclopedia have multiple contributors too. People's opinions are typically not atomic, hence a synergy/fusion of multiple of opinions is possible. That we have a stable diverse society relies on that fact. If you keeping looking for pure objectivism in a subjective world, you are going to be like Diogenes searching for truly honest man - an unnecessary chore since people are equipped to handle nuances of subjective reality as a matter of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki as a social concept is still growing; goal-orientated "unoffensive" (as one person put it) wikis like Wikipedia constitute one class of wikis, not the whole trend. Another issue to note is that having encyclopedia as "majority rule" opinion is to be expected and <em>important</em>. The goal is to make available stable knowledge on given topics. Now if you say that your minority opinion on a topic is correct and the majority opinion is false - so be it. As an encyclopedia is a secondary or tertiary source of information, it is <em>supposed</em> to represent the informed majority view on the topic - this makes it slower to changes but saves a lot more hassle for readers. If you consider your opinion correct, you present it as an appropriate primary source and more weight it gains in the suitable industry/field then more weight it gains in an consensus encyclopedia. Simple as that (or should be when things run smoothly). If your opinion for, say, pure air as a food, has problems against the majority opinion then either improve the case in the right places for debate or write in a different type of wiki as wikipedia needs to relatively NPOV in order to provide knowledge of some consistency to the reader.

        To finish on a slight harsh note: If some people are saying that Wikipedia isn't what a wiki should and nor should it be as successful as it is - <em></em><a href="GetOverIt.html">GetOverIt</a><em>. It is the choice of wikipedia contributors to contribute and they typically get immense satisfaction from doing so.

        I do not judge the quality of results by the quality of the process, rather the other way around. So here's a few things that I see: the whole series of articles related to communism are dubious, both in content (but this you can dispute) and in presentation - the quality of the language, the clarity and purpose of the exposition. They have been fought over ad-nauseam, subjected to "trials" and the trials themselves have a language reminding of Orwell and Kafka. If you assigned value to the time waisted and emotional energy involved from all parties, this is the most disastrously run project I've seen ever. This is what I see, and what leads me to believe that wikipedia has fostered the wrong culture, or, to put it more bluntly, has fostered a mob mentality.

           What happened was:
          <ul>
            <li>
               A few conspiracy theorists, which Wikipedia has lots of (sadly), posted the "suggestion" that the death was a suicide (and/or faked!) to the article.
            </li>
            <li>
               This nonsense was removed, and reverted, several times. (I say "nonsense" because there's no evidence for such a proposition. The thought crossed my mind, I'll admit -- but absent <em>some</em> evidence, such a theory has no business being in an encyclopedia).
            </li>
            <li>
               Eventually, the article stabilized; the current form of the article does not describe Lay's death as anything other than what the coroner sez -- a heart attack.
            </li>
            <li>
               A reporter goes through the edit history, notes the edits containing suicide claims, writes a story.

           This is a known issue with Wikipedia; and nothing new. Articles are often vandalized; including edits which insert incorrect or defamatory material. Those are typically reverted within seconds - between the vandal bots, the RC patrollers, and such, Wikipedia is quite good at protecting itself from vandalism. However, some critics consider WP unreliable due to the possibility that - for a few seconds - someone might have read that Ken Lay offed himself.

        The very limit of <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> is the fact that it pretends to be an encyclopedia, but it's doomed to fail. It's mainly a collection of informations that could be found elsewhere, and indeed the wikipedian-readers should not stop in <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> at all: <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> can be (not always!) a good starting point, not more.

        More over, it's biased towards arguments that call masses or mass-interests, or arguments that can have a <em>general</em> understanding by the masses. When something less-known is put, even with proper sources or as a work in progress, its future existence depends on the judgement (an opinion, not a NPOV fact!) of people who are not able to judge the sources and the reliability of the text at all! So very similar pages undergo different destiny depending on who's seen them and how many pros and cons people noticed the page (and voted when requested).
      </p>
      <p>
        Even things like "notability" can't have a neutral POV and the rules about this are far from being neutral and good (they reflect just someone else POV about the subject); the witless demand for sources killed very interesting pages (which, after the wiki idea, could have been improved by someone)... while other similar pages survived. Nonsensical things like the (invented) following one can happen:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           someone creates a page about C2, writing something like: «C2 is a content creation wiki whose focus is people, projects and patterns in software development» and dropping the link to this wiki
        </li>
        <li>
           someone asks for sources!! «This page lacks reliable sources» !! What?!
        </li>
        <li>

        It's a little worse than that. With few exceptions, all claims must have citations of <em>secondary references</em>, which mostly means newspaper and magazine articles, including some peer-reviewed scientific journals. Many articles on specialty subjects for which personal experience and training is readily available must be validated by popular articles written by untrained journalists who don't understand the subject! Notability must similarly be proven by coverage in the popular press! Oh, and anonymity is encouraged, so authors need not take personal responsibility for their edits. -- David Spector
