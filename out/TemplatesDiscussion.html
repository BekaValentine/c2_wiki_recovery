        Templates Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        One starting point for discussion of templates in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is <a href="TheDesignAndEvolutionOfCpp.html">TheDesignAndEvolutionOfCpp</a> where <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a> discusses in Chapter 15 the reasons why they were introduced.
      </p>

        As someone who is using templates, often adapting codes written by other people, I have found it helpful in both a practical way and also in understanding the approach which is being taken. I hope this page can be used to separate the how to elements on e.g. <a href="UsingTemplates.html">UsingTemplates</a> from the <em>why do it this way</em> discussion.

        Java will soon have templates too... In 1.5, so I hear.
        See <a href="http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr014/">http://java.sun.com/aboutJava/communityprocess/review/jsr014/</a> -- JSR-000014 Adding Generics to the Java Programming Language.

        <dd><em>It won't be the same. In order to maintain compatibility with the JVM, templates will be implemented on top of polymorphism. Vector<A> and Vector<B> will really be aliases for a single Vector<Object> class, and A and B will have to descend from Objects. You get the notational convenience, and you get the type safety, because the compiler will insert the appropriate typecasts from Object to A or Object to B. But you don't get the performance advantage. And what about specializations? As far as I know, they won't exist.</em> -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a></dd>

        What's with the template love fest? I hate templates. To me, they are a poor work around for the lack of a base class. I mean, I like C++ for the most part, but templates just infuriate me so much. I'm tempted to go create a class library with a base class every time I have to use templates. If I could change only one thing about C++, I'd chuck the templates and introduce a base class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You just don't understand templates fully. Templates are part of the next big thing. Spend some time with them - *one* alternative is a base class for *some* of the uses of templates.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ <em>has</em> a universal base class - it's called void*. These template aficionados are probably just hung up on type safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You can't have a type safe collection of a class with a generalized container.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not true: see <a href="StaticPolymorphism.html">StaticPolymorphism</a>. (why must everything be a collection of base?)

        Well, one place that templates really shine is in numerical work, where we can't afford the cost of vpointers. A good discussion of technique etc. can be found at the object oriented numerics page <a href="http://oonumerics.org/oon/.">http://oonumerics.org/oon/.</a>

        I am a big fan of templates because they help me to stick to the principle of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. I think that they are a great language feature. Unfortunately, template support wrt compilers and debuggers still has a way to go in my experience.

        Experienced C++ programmers should <strong>delight</strong> in templates. Newbies and weak journeymen should probably learn to use them without writing them. The syntax for writing templates is staggeringly complex for people who have really just mastered colon-initializer lists.

        A further recommendation: Teach code users to typedef their stl classes and iterators and work through the typedefs. They get to avoid the ?? syntax, and you get to replace poorly-thought-out template instantiations in one and only one location. -- <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a>

        Templates allow not only compile-time binding (hence run-time efficiency in terms of execution speed) but also extensive compile-time optimizations and even better, compile-time computation. This might not appeal to people whose applications are suited to Java or Smalltalk, but for those to whom execution time/memory footprint really matters, these things can save orders of magnitude of time and significant amounts of space at run-time. Books such as the <a href="GenerativeProgrammingBook.html">GenerativeProgrammingBook</a> (ISBN 0201309777) and <a href="ModernCeePlusPlusDesign.html">ModernCeePlusPlusDesign</a> (ISBN 0201704315) show quite well how much more than a "universal base class replacement" templates are, and I would suggest that nobody write off C++ templates until they've learnt what they can do. Templates are a turing-complete system in themselves, even if their syntax is pretty ugly (which is consistent with the rest of C++ syntax, let's face it). -- <a href="JamesDennett.html">JamesDennett</a>
