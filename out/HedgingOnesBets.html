        Technical issues are only one aspect of concurrent software development, which also entails testing, organisation, management, human factors, maintenance, tools and engineering discipline.  For an introduction to basic engineering methods that can be applied to both everyday programming and larger efforts, see:

        Humphrey, Watts. <em>A Discipline for Software Engineering</em>, Addison-Wesley, 1995.

        For a completely different perspective, see:

        Beck, Kent.  <em>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</em>, Addison-Wesley 1999.
