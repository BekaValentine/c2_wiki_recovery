        Well then let's try a little ProblemReformulation of our own: is a problem hard because of something about the underlying ontology it represents, or is it hard because the way it's represented is inefficient? ContraintProblemReformulation began with <a href="SaulAmarel.html">SaulAmarel</a>'s suggestion that it's the inefficiency of representation that makes problems hard. Specifically, Amarel has reformulated the problem so that it has become <a href="CombinatoriallyComplete.html">CombinatoriallyComplete</a>.

        In the limit, if we could reformulate all problems into simple combinatorial set theory, then all problems could be solved in a single step a la <a href="CannibalsAndMissionaries.html">CannibalsAndMissionaries</a>. But there are no known systematic generalizations of doing this ... and it may be that the problem of reformulation itself is <a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a>. Or worse.
