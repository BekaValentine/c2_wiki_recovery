        Build Meister
      </h1>
      <p>
        From somewhere on the net: "the person ultimately 'in charge of' getting things building and built.
        Someone who maintains the spec files, and makes sure everything keeps
        building."
      </p>
      <p>
        Shops with something to build, but without <a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a>s, need a BM to operate a build environment. This creates a system bottleneck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shops afflicted with an IDE-first toy like <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, if they did not grow their project at the same time as they grew console build scripts, may need to pay their BM, every few hours, to clickety-click click all over the VB IDE to produce their SporadicIntegration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shops without tests may appoint the BM role to perform <a href="CodeReview.html">CodeReview</a>s, to delay integration of bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The correct pattern grows a <a href="CommonBuildEnvironment.html">CommonBuildEnvironment</a> on every desktop, so that everyone can test & build anything or everything at whim, and so anyone can upgrade the build scripts.
