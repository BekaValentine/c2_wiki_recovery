        White Elephant

        What is this?  Specifically in the context of BearTrap and <a href="BoatAnchor.html">BoatAnchor</a>?

      <p>
        Google is your friend. Type
      </p>
      <code>
        define: "white elephant"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and google tells you
      </p>

        <dt>albinic Indian elephant; rare and sometimes venerated in east Asia</dt>

      <p>
        All of which is perfectly true (this is a common expression, at least in America, but since the India reference is the origin, I thought it started in the British empire)
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe it is also used to describe any perfectly useless object, expensive or not.
      </p>

        Compare "pink elephant", which is something that alcoholics are supposed to hallucinate in popular mythology.
