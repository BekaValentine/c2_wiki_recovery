        Windows Seven
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Microsoft <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>.  The official retail release was October 22, 2009, but it has been available to MSDN and Technet subscribers since August 6, 2009.  Since many people dislike <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a>, Microsoft decided to create <a href="WindowsSeven.html">WindowsSeven</a> as its successor.  <a href="WindowsSeven.html">WindowsSeven</a> is also to be more versatile, in that it will have versions that can run on smaller and less-powerful, portable machines such as <a href="NetBook.html">NetBook</a> computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a> was too power hungry to run well on most <a href="NetBook.html">NetBook</a>s, so the current solution has been to run WindowsXpHome.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumors in its early development has stated to include WinFs.

        Project known as Vienna, is the pre-release codename for the version of <a href="WindowsOs.html">WindowsOs</a> after <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a>. It was formerly known as "Blackcomb". Within the limitations of the pre-alpha-release crystal ball, it is due out in 2010-2012.

        In Windows 7 windows-explorer some sub-folders are not being listed (right list panel). If I navigate to them typing path-style, and then go up one (back), they are then temporarily listed. WTF?
      </p>

        A major feature of Vienna is that each application and the OS itself will house their own .dlls, eliminating "<a href="DllHell.html">DllHell</a>" found on all current Microsoft operating systems (dll/library version conflicts).

        Correct me if I am off base, but why is this a "feature"? I thought the entire purpose of dynamically-linked code was to share libraries between programs. Sure, it is still more modular than static linkage, but this seems more like a kludge than a real solution.

        "Application vskdlkj.exe wants to update your mtlksnf. Proceed? Y/N"

        That's really helpful.

        <em>Good.  I thought your mtlksnf was looking a bit tattered.</em>

        Well! You can just go mtlksnf yourself!

        <strong>Pop-Down Windows</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows 7 seems to have a general problem of "lost windows". New apps or messages open up or pop up, but are immediately pushed behind existing windows for unknown reasons. I've seen it on multiple installations. It happened with XP too, but much less frequently. Some forums blame it on McAfee.

        The GUI interface to the tasks scheduler is a confusing monstrosity. What the hell did they have in mind?
