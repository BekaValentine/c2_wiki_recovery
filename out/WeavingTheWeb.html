        [ISBN 0062515861] On the history of the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a> from his own (uniquely qualified) perspective, including comments on MarcAndreessen and <a href="NetScape.html">NetScape</a>, etc. He also talks about what he wants the Web to become in relation to society, and what the <a href="WorldWideWebConsortium.html">WorldWideWebConsortium</a> is doing to make progress in that direction. -- <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>

        One of the interesting things about the original Cern Web was that it was intended for collaborative editing; the browse-only thing only really took off with Mosaic. Hmmm. Sounds like the Wiki.

        Exactly right. In the book he articulates a two-part vision for the Web, the first part of which is "people-to-people communication through shared knowledge".  This is exactly what the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> facilitates - the "inter-creation", as he puts it, of a shared body of knowledge. In fact, I sent him an email message after reading his book, to call his attention to the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. -- <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>

        Hey, where else could I have left a question on the web 2-3 months back, have it answered only in the last last couple of days, but then for the key point about inter-creation to arise out of two people's interaction! The existence proof is with Wiki!

        Tim took a look at our Wiki clone around six months ago, asked a few questions and moved on. Do let me know what you hear back from him. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        I thought the first half of the book was a great read.  The second half, wherein he takes a more current and forward-looking perspective, I found less interesting. <a href="YourMileageMayVary.html">YourMileageMayVary</a>. -- <a href="PatrickCorcoran.html">PatrickCorcoran</a>
