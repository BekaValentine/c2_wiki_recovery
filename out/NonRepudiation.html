        Non Repudiation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Non-repudiation is the property of an information recording system to preserve the identity of the 
        originator of a communication. (Or something like that.) If a system supports non-repudiation, a 
        person can't claim that they didn't perform the communication (in the absence of a security 
        breach). 
      </p>

      <p>
        Non-repudiation requires a contract between the parties that a particular non-reversible transaction has taken place and some sort of signature that validates that contract. More elaborate schemes include trusted third-party witnesses to confirm that the parties were physically present to sign the contract.
      </p>
      <p>
        Computer equivalents follow the same reasoning.

        Trading banks have a particular interest in such activities since they will trade for customers by proxy. For example, I could ask a trader to 'buy 1 million <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> shares', then repudiate the deal if the share-price happened to drop. A non-repudiation safeguard avoids this sort of fraud, it also prevents the bank from claiming I had entered an order when I had not.
