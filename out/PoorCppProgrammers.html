        Poor Cpp Programmers
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are two kinds of <a href="PoorCppProgrammers.html">PoorCppProgrammers</a>: those that know that their environment is poor, but are forced to use it by their management, and those that don't think it is poor and resent these kinds of rants. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a third kind, those with mortgages.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>and a fourth - those that know their environment is poor, but still like the language and choose to build up the environment themselves (I can like C++, and still hate GCC, Visual C++, and the C++ Win32 API)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There isn't a C++ Win32 API. Win32 is and has always been a C API. It can be used in C++ merely due to C++'s backwards compatibility. For "real" C++ GUI toolkits, take a look at GTK--, wxWidgets, QT and others. And MFC if you absolutely have to... -- <a href="ArneVogel.html">ArneVogel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the signatures I'd say it's a Pascal API! But seriously, it isn't any kind of language API, it's just entry points in DLLs. You can call it from assembly, if you want. -- <a href="AndrewQueisser.html">AndrewQueisser</a>

        What development tools exist for C++ programmers that provide functionality like <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> or the <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        That's a hard question for Type II Cpp'ers ... we don't know what we are missing!
        What functionality do <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> and the <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> provide? -- Bill Weston

      <p>
        Global regular expression search, with easy access to results, and a good replace, suits me fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Back in the dark days of my C++ programming, I used Source Insight (</em><a href="http://www.sourcedyn.com/).">http://www.sourcedyn.com/).</a> It provides many of the features that I later found in Intellij (a <a href="RefactoringBrowserForJava.html">RefactoringBrowserForJava</a>). The most important feature is that it continually parses your code and lets you jump around in it (jump to declarations, search for all usages of an item, etc.) at will. -- <a href="JohnLindsey.html">JohnLindsey</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Visual C++ seems to meet the requirements for global search, easy access to results, and a replace feature. It has full regular expression search (and replace with tagged expressions). I don't know what qualifies as a "good" replace, so I'll leave that one hanging.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a plugin for Visual C++ called <a href="VisualAssist.html">VisualAssist</a> which does some magnificent things in the code completion/source browsing/etc realms. I've become more or less totally dependent on it.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I don't see anything in Source Insight that isn't already in Metrowerks <a href="CodeWarrior.html">CodeWarrior</a>... plus <a href="CodeWarrior.html">CodeWarrior</a> has a half-way decent class browser (not unlike a Smalltalk-80 class browser). No refactoring support yet.

        Who are the guys so poor as to think that C++ programmers are poor ? Just because it's not Smalltalk or Java or Python or whatever doesn't make C++ a bad language, and consequently doesn't make C++ programmers poor. But there is one category of poor C++ programmers, those who don't understand programming, and, of course, don't understand C++, and, of course, they whine about it. C++ has its limits, but is far more acceptable than other languages, especially lately, and whoever thinks <em>Oh, those poor C++ programmers. Oh, poor me, I have to program in C++ to make a living</em>, has my smile. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        <em>Exactly! That's why I added the fourth type above. There is a category of programmers like us that prefer </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> to Smalltalk, Java, Python and others, and is our *<a href="LanguageOfChoice.html">LanguageOfChoice</a>*. <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> has its bad reputation, in my opinion, because people used it from a C perspective and not from a MultiParadigm approach (see <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>'s outstanding book "MultiParadigm Design with C++"). Many people have simply not learned or used the language correctly. <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> coupled with the <a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a> and the Standard C++ library is a very powerful language able to handle a number of paradigms and abstractions better than most. <em> -- sg</em>

        I'm glad Costin is smiling at me. But the reason I feel sorry for <a href="PoorCppProgrammers.html">PoorCppProgrammers</a> is, to me, all too clear, and well expressed in

        <dd>Sunir, most of his criticisms were factually correct at the beginning of the rant (although I suspect he forgot an "or" in there somewhere. Either you rebuild the code and everything that links to it or you make sure not to change classes and member ordering). The rest is a matter of opinion and cannot be factually correct or incorrect. -- <a href="DaveFayram.html">DaveFayram</a></dd>

           That rant wasn't written by just any <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>; that was written by the infamous <a href="ErikNaggum.html">ErikNaggum</a> - widely considered one of the smuggest and most condescending. At any rate, any experienced C++ programmer knows how to avoid the problem that Naggum refers to - use the <a href="PimplIdiom.html">PimplIdiom</a> (or <a href="HandleBodyPattern.html">HandleBodyPattern</a> or <a href="BridgePattern.html">BridgePattern</a>, it has lots of names) to hide the implementation details of your classes in a private header file, and pass opaque pointers to that around. It's not a perfect solution, but it works. More techniques to effectively manage large C++ projects can be found in <a href="LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign.html">LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign</a>, an excellent (though somewhat outdated - it's based on ARM C++ and not ANSI C++) book.

        Well, it's an opinion, not fact. People who have mastered standard based <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> feel very differently. Let's not get into a <a href="LanguagePissingMatch.html">LanguagePissingMatch</a>. After using 17 different languages, including three years in Java, I prefer and use <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> as my number one language.

        Alain, I'm glad that you like Scheme and Lisp-like languages just like I do (alas in my rare spare time), and if you got to get paid for programming in something like ML you have my confessed envy. But if you think <em>oh those poor CPP programmers</em>, you really have my smile. I can demonstrate to you there are plenty of real life problems where absolutely nothing less than the power of CPP will do (Ok, maybe you can add ADA and Pascal into equation). As for the article, it has a couple of good points, a ton of rants, and in no way justifies <a href="PoorCppProgrammers.html">PoorCppProgrammers</a>. Otherwise, you can have my smile and I'll have yours. -- Costin

        Costin, that sounds like an excellent deal. I don't take pages like this one too seriously. I need no demonstration, I <strong>know</strong> there are domains in which you need something like C++. It's just that, by temperament, it drives me crazy. And yes, I have programmed professionally in it (a telco app). And yes, I am lucky enough that I now use common lisp at work, but the world is a big, scary place, our endeavor might fail, and I might be back in line in front of Sun CC... which would certainly make me, once again, one of the <a href="PoorCppProgrammers.html">PoorCppProgrammers</a>. -- Alain [Wondering if this whole page needs to be deleted...]

        I wonder about this. Are the principal authors of this page invalidating my professionalism? Instead, shouldn't we be invalidating theirs? -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        They're invalidating mine but hey, whatever. I don't get riled about this kind of stuff anymore. -- sg

        By the way, I made that response half-jokingly. One need only consider my ridiculing of Java programmers to see how hypocritical I am. Then again, I also realize that I have to stop pounding on them. Unfortunately, a Java programmer is born every minute. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I don't get this one. Is the implication supposed to be that C++ programming doesn't pay well? I guess that may depend on where one lives, the level of one's ability, and what domains one programs for. I, for one, don't feel particularly short changed financially. -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>
