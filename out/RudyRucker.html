        Rudy Rucker

      <p>
        A leading mathmetician, computer scientist, and <a href="CyberPunk.html">CyberPunk</a> pioneer, Rudy Rucker writes novels that surprise and delight with an effervescent mix of cutting-edge science, raucous social satire, and deeply informed speculation into the nature and fate of humanity.

        A grandfather of the <a href="CyberPunk.html">CyberPunk</a> movement, he published the landmark <a href="CyberPunk.html">CyberPunk</a> novel "Software" in 1982. This is probably my favorite <a href="CyberPunk.html">CyberPunk</a> book. He is delightfully irreverent. He writes in an easy to read style unlike Gibson's heady stuff.

        Interesting. I have one of his books, <em>Infinity and the Mind,</em> and didn't realize who he was. (Or that I should care what the byline was.) Indeed, the bit about <em>tetration</em> on <a href="ReallyBigNumbers.html">ReallyBigNumbers</a> I stole from <em>Infinity and the Mind.</em> -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        He is also a philosopher, as his ancestor <a href="GeorgWilhelmFriedrichHegel.html">GeorgWilhelmFriedrichHegel</a>.
