        A draft of his recent work, 
        <em>An Approach to Postmorta, Postparta & Post Project Reviews</em>,
        is now available in <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> [3] and PDF [<a href="http://c2.com/doc/ppm.pdf]">http://c2.com/doc/ppm.pdf]</a>

        From the abstract...
      </p>
      <p>
        A Postpartum is an activity where people come together to review a previous project.  The purpose from 
        this review is to reflect and learn from the past project to help improve the team's process on future 
        projects.  For some projects and some people this can be quite a stressful event.  It is an event, when
        executed poorly can do great damage.  However, when done well, it can yield vast improvements in the 
        team's process and productivity.  This work shares what I have learned.
