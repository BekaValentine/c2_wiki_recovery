        Supporting Unit Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        You find an error during <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>ing. Rather than just fix it, you:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pinpoint it in the code
        </li>
        <li>
           Write the unit test that doesn't run, but if it did you believe the functional error will be resolved
        </li>
        <li>
           Make the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> work
        </li>
        <li>
           Re-run the <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a> to be sure the error is resolved
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is better than simply fixing the <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>, because:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           You are more focused when fixing the defect. You have to make a specific, concrete hypothesis about the source of the error. You can't just go around adding one and negating until the functional test runs.
        </li>
        <li>
           You now have a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> (likely to be run more often than a <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>) that will blow up if the error recurs
        </li>
      </ol>
