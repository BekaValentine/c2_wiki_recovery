        An informal sister page to <a href="QuickQuestions.html">QuickQuestions</a>. Also a minor attempt at social engineering.

      <p>
        The purpose of this page is to so infuriate a <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a> so that he/she actually answers one of the <a href="QuickQuestions.html">QuickQuestions</a>. The author of this page fully expects it to be deleted, but hopefully after it has served its purpose. The author knows that he is in breach of <a href="WelcomeToWikiPleaseBePolite.html">WelcomeToWikiPleaseBePolite</a>.

        I hope you all know that this is completely tongue in cheek and not an attempt to change policy. It's born of a minor frustration that I think many people here will not reply to a change if they don't recognize the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> or IP. I asked the second unanswered question (though I timestamped it incorrectly) about novice/amateur programmers. The reason I asked it is that many novices, when contemplating asking a more advanced/professional person in the field a question, are afraid of the RTFM response. Also, a programmer busy with a commercial application is unlikely to have the time or patience to deal with someone who just wants to play around with something on his desktop.

        So ideally I would be looking for something between <a href="IwannaLearn.html">IwannaLearn</a> and the bulk of the content on this Wiki.

        About the other guy's question, I guessed that the only people who could help are the authors of <a href="WikiTermontography.html">WikiTermontography</a> or <a href="BusinessModeling.html">BusinessModeling</a>.

        To the <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> who will <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> all of this, apologies and thank you.

        <em>There is probably no dedicated site of the type you sought, but a novice's programming-related questions can be put on this site.</em>

        I do not see where to edit pics at.  Am I missing it somewhere?
