      <p>
        Each method should group these functional sections, separated by blank lines:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <strong>Arrange</strong> all necessary preconditions and inputs.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Act</strong> on the object or method under test.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Assert</strong> that the expected results have occurred.
        </li>
      </ol>

      <code>

        <strong><em>Benefits:</em></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Clearly separates what is being tested from the setup and verification steps.
        </li>
        <li>
           Clarifies and focuses attention on a historically successful and generally necessary set of test steps.
        </li>
        <li>
           Makes some TestSmells more obvious:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Assertions intermixed with "Act" code.
            </li>
            <li>
               Test methods that try to test too many different things at once.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

Arrange is variable declaration and initialization.  Act is invoking the code under test.  Assert is using the Assert.* methods to verify that expectations were met.  Following this pattern consistently makes it easy to revisit test code."</em>

        This does not apply so much to <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>.  Then you Specify your contract, Arrange, Act.  The DbC system will then fail the test if the contract is violated.

      <p>
        People tell me that Arrange-Act-Assert fails when using some <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a><a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a>s too, because some such frameworks typically require that you specify expected behavior before calling the code under test.  So <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> specs are given in the "Arrange" section, leaving "nothing" for the "Assert" section.  (<a href="EasyMock.html">EasyMock</a> fits this description but not Mockito.  Mockito differs in that it has a <em>verify</em> section at the end that meets the <em>Assert</em> requirement, although it refers to the pattern as given/when/then.)
      </p>
      <p>
        However, even when all contracts and specifications are given in the "Arrange" section, it's often necessary to put a single ".verify()" call after the production code "Act", so that the framework can verify that <strong>all</strong> the expected method calls were made.  (IE: That none were missed.)
      </p>
      <p>
        And even if we end up with tests lacking Arrange or Assert code occur, I don't find this to be a significant problem.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some tests lack an Arrange section because no setup is needed, or all necessary setup has been refactored out into the setUp method and/or field initializers.
        </li>
        <li>
           Some tests lack an Assert section because the intent of the test is to assert that the CodeUnderTest (in the Act section) does <strong>NOT</strong> throw an exception.
        </li>
      </ul>
