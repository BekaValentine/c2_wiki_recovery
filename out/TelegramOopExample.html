        Telegram Oop Example
      </h1>
      <p>
        There have been many calls for an OOP example.  Here is one:
      </p>
      <p>
        This example is called the <a href="TelegramProblem.html">TelegramProblem</a>.  There is a description of an inspiration to this example at <a href="LinesComposeThemselves.html">LinesComposeThemselves</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine you were to write a text editor, which required automatic word-wrap (first, let us consider the case with no hyphenation).
      </p>
      <p>
        An Oop Approach would consider each letter as a separate entity capable of sending and receiving messages and performing its own calculation.  So how would such entities act together to adjust their line lengths?  Let's look at the case where there are too many letters crammed into a line, so they'll want to move some words down.  (I will refer to the letters in the first person).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If I don't have enough room, tell my neighbor down the line.  And if I get a similar message from someone else, pass it on.
        </li>
        <li>
           If I'm at the end of the line, I'll ask my neighbor to the left if he can come with me.  When I get a yes response, I'll move.
        </li>
        <li>
           If I get a request to go to the next line, I'll pass it on, unless I'm the beginning of a word (next to a space), in which case I'll just say yes and move.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This model for the problem is easily modeled by objects interacting by passing messages.  Here is the procedural algorithm:
      </p>
      <code>
        for each letter in text<br/>
        if currentIndex > lineLength then<br/>
        endLine(lastSpace)<br/>
        moveToNextLine()<br/>
        backupTo(lastWordBeginning)<br/>
        else<br/>
        if it's a space then <br/>
        set lastSpace to currentIndex<br/>
        outputFromTo(lastWordBeginning, currentIndex)<br/>
        endif<br/>
        if it's a letter and lastSpace is currentIndex-1 then <br/>
        set lastWordBeginning to currentIndex<br/>
        endif<br/>
        next letter<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Ok, now the two can be compared.  First, the advantages of the OOP Approach:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The system is much easier to extend.  All I have to do is change the internals of the classes (how they process messages) and I can get completely different behavior, without modifying the code I have already written.  This is polymorphism and <a href="LateBinding.html">LateBinding</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is easily modeled by a bunch of people following his/her own simple set of rules and communicating with eachother.  This is encapsulation of process and messaging.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is resilient.  By defining higher-level abstractions (letters "clinging" to words, etc) it can work in situations I hadn't conceived of.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Downsides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Slower: all of those messages passing back and forth.
        </li>
        <li>
          Difficult to initially set up: all of those classes to code!
        </li>
        <li>
          Debugging may become complex: more interactions to look at if something goes wrong.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I used this example because I think it really gets at the heart of what object-oriented code is for me.  <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> meant for software systems to behave more like biological systems.  He used that analogy because multi-cellular systems can function with billions of cells, all working together.  If we are going to write bigger and bigger systems, this model might prove to work.  OOP, for me, is not mainly about structuring code into self-contained modules to make the code easier to read (although this is very useful).  OOP is about thinking of the problem in terms of small, autonomous entities all interacting in a complex system. --EricNormand
