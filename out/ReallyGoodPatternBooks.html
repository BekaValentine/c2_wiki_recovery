        Really Good Pattern Books

           Number one on this list has to be the works of <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> such as <a href="TheTimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TheTimelessWayOfBuilding</a> and A <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>.
        </li>

           Then comes <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> a.k.a. GOF (<a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a>) which also has a <a href="DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion.html">DesignPatternsSmalltalkCompanion</a>
        </li>

           <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s <a href="SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns.html">SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns</a> is a favorite, as much for the style as the content. Non-Smalltalkers can get a lot out of it too.

      <p>
        We've now seen published a few <a href="LandminesAroundLandmarkBooks.html">LandminesAroundLandmarkBooks</a>. Rather than enumerate the duds, we here take the positive approach and list the really good ones. Read this list carefully. If you find one to be just pretty good, go ahead and remove it.

        ...and after those, consider the other books in the <a href="PatternRelatedBookList.html">PatternRelatedBookList</a>.
