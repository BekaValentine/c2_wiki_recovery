        <strong>Background</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-
        organizing teams," argues the Agile Manifesto.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet the opposite principle is built into the corporate model of 
        collaboration: "someone has to be boss" - sometimes to the extent of 
        attempting to mandate self-organization! Self-organization cannot be 
        decreed from above, but conditions can be created which favor it; one 
        such condition is that team members have experience with and can 
        recognize self-organization. Drawing on lessons from the theatre, 
        this workshop will provide just such an experience, as well as  
        explore the conditions of self-organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Objectives</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants and presenters will
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           learn about the conditions under which self-organization can be expected
        </li>
        <li>
           experience achieving a purpose without the need for a leader's direction
        </li>
        <li>
           generalize and extract insights from their own and each other's experience
        </li>
        <li>
           have fun!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Submissions and participation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Workshop attendance is limited to 20 participants, on a first-come,
        first-served basis. To attend, simply list your name on the workshop
        Wiki, within that limit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Participants are invited to submit a position paper in the form of a 
        page on the workshop Wiki,  however this is not a requirement for 
        attendance. Our intent is to have the Wiki support a pre-workshop 
        conversation to identify issues of interest.
