        <strong>Problems</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How can you organise the content of your site for different classes of user?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Web sites will be used for multiple purposes by people with different requirements and backgrounds.  One structure will be suitable for one class of users but unsuitable for another.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Organise the content of the site in different ways for different users.  Each structure would represent a cross-section of the information on the site viewed from a particular perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Individual pages may be shared between cross-sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resultant Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Users can choose an organisation with which they feel familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Providing users with <a href="VisibleContext.html">VisibleContext</a> is more complex, since they may have arrived at a page through different cross-sections of the site.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Byrd Watcher site at <a href="http://ebni.com/byrds/index.html">http://ebni.com/byrds/index.html</a> is organised as <a href="MultipleCrossSections.html">MultipleCrossSections</a> through the same data: the history of the band is represented as intersecting strands from the perspective of each band member, by date, album, spin-off bands and so forth.

        On the hospital site, we had health information that would be organized in one order for parents, another way for physicians.
