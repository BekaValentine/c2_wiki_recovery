        Pattern Imposter
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> How do you on-line market your software to hoards of cynical developers?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> 
        Marketing guy at another software firm looking for more eyeballs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces: </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           People are learning to filter spam (and dross) from their email.
        </li>
        <li>
           You've just come across wiki and think there must be a way to exploit it.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you dress your commercial up as a pattern people in the pattern community might just read it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Write up the commercial as a pattern and dump it on wiki. Under solution, say "sorry, I don't have a general solution, but you can buy this..."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> <a href="ZootSoftware.html">ZootSoftware</a> (Sorry, I couldn't help it - Personally, I wouldn't have felt so bad about it if you'd just written it up as a commercial.)
      </p>
      <p>

        Maybe I'm just one of those cynical developers ;-) --

        Sounds like a special case of a more general advertising pattern, let's call it Imposter. I can already think of three examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ZootSoftware.html">ZootSoftware</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Infomercials
        </li>
        <li>
           Banner ads that mimic OS dialogs (see <a href="http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/02/index1a.html)">http://hotwired.lycos.com/webmonkey/00/02/index1a.html)</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
