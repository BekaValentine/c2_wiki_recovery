        [Dude:  We <em>really</em> don't need an article here.  A link to the Wikipedia article here is sufficient to avoid pointlessly violating <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> but it still maintains a destination for backlinks.  The <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> article on Copernicus is excellent; why excerpt it here?]

           <em>It's nice to use Wiki as Wiki was intended, and that is as one is reading, all one needs to do is to click on a </em><a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> to get a quick reminder of/who/what the important person was, instead of having to leave Wiki.  One always has that choice, to go to the net, but the power of Wiki is in the word "Quick".  Also the precident has already been set by pages for other important scientists, persons, etc.  A quick reminder is where the power is.  I did not start this page, but enjoyed the remembrance.<em></em>

           <em>It seems to me that one of the values of wiki is building up links, so that people who approach a topic from a number of different directions can all get to somewhere interesting, sometimes unexpected. I have used that thought to develop the links on the </em><a href="NicolausCopernicus.html">NicolausCopernicus</a> page in a number of ways, including categories.<em> -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
