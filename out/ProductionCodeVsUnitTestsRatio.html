        Production Code Vs Unit Tests Ratio
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>The reciprocal of </em><a href="UnitTestToCodeRatio.html">UnitTestToCodeRatio</a> <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is the ratio of number of lines of production code to the number of lines of test code a useful metric?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is a large value for "production / test" lines a bad sign?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is a large value for "production / test" lines with 100% production code coverage a bad sign?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is a low value for "production / test" lines a bad sign?
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming 100% production code coverage, would a small value for "production / test" lines indicate something good or bad about the tests? ...or the design of the production code?

        Maybe some metrics would be helpful here.
        How large is your project?
        What's the "production lines of code /divided by/ test lines of code" ratio?
        Do you have 100% code coverage?
        Was the code written <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One data point:
        I happen to have a small ant script that I happen to have written <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> style, using <a href="AntUnit.html">AntUnit</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           123 lines of production code
        </li>
        <li>
           261 lines of test code
        </li>
        <li>
           so slightly more than 1:2 of production to test code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And I'm "cheating" on the tests too:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           15 tests
        </li>
        <li>
           45 asserts
        </li>
        <li>
           giving an average of 3 asserts per test
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So I'd guess that if I restricted each test to doing only one assert
        (which some think is a good practice)
        I think I'd end up with something around a 1:5 ratio of production to test code lines.
      </p>
      <p>
        I kind of think that the range of "good ratios," if there is one, may depend on implementation language.
        For <a href="ApacheAnt.html">ApacheAnt</a>, being a <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> gives it expressive power within it's domain.
        But <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>s can be cumbersome and/or verbose outside their target domain,
        and being an XML <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> could tend to make that problem worse.

        A flavour of the code (design?) smell: as mentored by the <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, optinal ratio of <a href="ProductionCode.html">ProductionCode</a> vs. <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s lines of code is about 1:1. If it deviates at more than 2 or 3 times it's probably a sign of some code/design problem.

        <em>Sadly this page has turned into a pedantic and pointless argument, made largely by someone who has chosen not sign his name.

        Non-sense. The arguments to the contrary are not pointless, and not pedantic. If somebody's gonna define that by some <strong>essentially arbitrary</strong> criterion (indeed no argument whatsoever has been presented for the 1:1 ratio) large bodies of code can be seen to suffer from <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, the claim should either be defended by reasoned arguments, practical empirical evidents, etc, or deleted altogether. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It stands to reason that if there's any relevant criterion to judge/detect the adequacy of a set of tests, than that criterion is <strong>code coverage</strong>, see <a href="TddCodeCoverage.html">TddCodeCoverage</a> for example. Depending on so many particulars test can cover 100% of the code base in ratios of 1:100, 1:10, 1:2, 1:1, 2:1, 10:1, 100:1. Any prescribed ratio, is absolutely useless, unless someone is able to show a preponderence of evidence that the correlation between the ratio and the 100% code coverage (which <strong>is</strong> the real target) follows some normal distribution centered around 1:1 value. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If not, people who follow the advice on this page will follow a useless advice while measuring code coverage is almost trivial these days and is a way better measure of the adequacy of any tests.

        Do you have any better idea? Do you know any reason why it's wrong? I want to know how this ratio was measured and how do they know that is the right one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MaxIschenko.html">MaxIschenko</a>: I agree that "should be close" or "most probably" may be a bit strong here. But still, what's your arguments? As for how this ratio was measured: just count <a href="LinesOfCode.html">LinesOfCode</a> in production code and test modules. No? My statement about "ideal" or "proper" ratio is based on some TDD/XP figures.
        Non-authoritative, yes, but still reasonable. See, for example, <a href="http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/archive/2003/12/19/4680.aspx.">http://dotnetjunkies.com/WebLog/darrell.norton/archive/2003/12/19/4680.aspx.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not reasonable at all.Reasonable means based on reason, i.e. on logical arguments of some kind. Since you are making the strong claim here, it is you who should bring a supporting argument. 1 to 5 is not unreasonable. 1 to 10 is not unreasonable. If you refer strictly to <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> as in "TDD", as opposed to more gneral types of tests (like acceptance tests, etc) 0 to X is not unreasonable either. Just go about studying some <a href="SoftwareMasterpiece.html">SoftwareMasterpiece</a>s out there before you impart your invaluable wisdom on us.

        <em>Much of the above is </em>ContentFree (other than a few flames) and is need of <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a>.... at any rate, there is a good question posed on this page.  What <strong>is</strong> the appropriate ratio (and what tolerance)?  Obviously, the boundary conditions of 1 to 0 (no tests at all) or 0 to 2 (no product) aren't good; but what should the optimal ratio be?  I've no idea.  There is a data-point in support of 1 to 1; anyone have other datapoints?  Since this is a highly qualitative (and thus not falsifiable) argument, telling other parties to "prove it" is inappropriate--and the numerous <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> attacks seem unwarranted.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That was the point, that it <strong>is</strong> ContentFree with no improvement in sight. Demanding a "supporting argument" (which is distinct from proof -- therefore be mindful of who is flaming whom) is entirely appropriate in the case that somebody makes a strong claim. Your "obviously" doesn't bode well either for the content of this page. What the hell is so obvious ? 0 -- no <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s at all <strong>obviously</strong> cannot be qualified as "no good" since we have plenty counterexample in <a href="SoftwareMasterpiece.html">SoftwareMasterpiece</a>s. What is your data point and what claim does it support ? And what is your methodology for cherry-picking data-points ?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Easy, Costin... I wasn't the original poster.  At any rate, there is no need to be rude (which was the point I was trying to make).  As far as various </em><a href="SoftwareMasterpiece.html">SoftwareMasterpiece</a>s go... you don't seriously propose that these have gone untested?  While they may not come with a suite of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s all bundled up in the source tarball, each and every one of them has likely undergone rather thorough testing of some sort.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Whereas "testing of some sort" may not have any connection with current "fashionable" <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, which is what the strong claim on this page is about. Therefore the prudent conclusion remains that 0 lines of code of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> can be perfectly acceptable engineering practice, and no evidence or reasoned argument has been shown to the contrary.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Probably, the claim/question ought to be <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>ed:  "In an environment where <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are the primary or sole testing methodology (in other words, no separate QA department to bang on the thing, etc.), what is the appropriate ratio)?".  I would think that the answer is greater than 0 lines of unit test code--what it is I don't know.  
            </li>
            <li>
               Can you tell me what environment has <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> as sole testing methodology ? How about "primary" (-- meaning exactly ...)  ?
              <ul>
                <li>
                   I'm not aware of any.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               One would think that even in the strongest XP fiefdom acceptance (end to end) tests are much more important than unit tests, because you can have all the unit tests you want but if you don't meet requirements, they're useless. 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Of course, end-to-end tests often don't involve code--if they do, it's code that can also be used for unit-testing.  Customers generally don't write test cases in secret, in order to spring them upon unsuspecting developers at the last minute...
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           So let's rephrase the claim thusly: in an environment where developers are expected to write <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s or practice full blown TDD, ) 0 lines of unit tests is not a good thing. Claim to which I subscribe wholeheartedly. As to what regards the "golden ratio", the only prudent claim to be made is as follows:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Of course, <em>that</em> claim is vacuous, but I suspect you know that.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           In an environment in which the person(s) in charge think(s) that 1:1 is the golden ratio, 1:1 <strong>is</strong> the golden ratio. Furthermore, since (/ lines_of_unit_tests lines_of_production_code) is a function of modules of code and therefore not expected to be constant, we can claim that if the guys in charge expect a particular statistical distribution, than that particular distribution is desirable.

            <li>
               "What the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> thinks" is not an interesting question, nor is it at all scientific.

        I am not sure how to determine what a reasonable ratio of test code to production code would be.  On the one hand, when using a unit test framework, a single assert statement may be sufficient, but the amount of set up code can vary.  Also, the amount of stub code required can vary from zero to quite a bit.  Emotionally, I would start to be concerned if the quantity of test code were to be come equal to the production code, because it would appear that the test code may become a higher risk area than the code itself.  Has anyone done any measurements on what is being experienced?

        Only small fraction of projects are committed to serious unit tests. And among those, I believe open source ones are minority. I'd also want to make clear that "no unit tests" doesn't mean buggy likewise "100% unit tests" doesn't mean "buglessness". 
        Unit tests would (may?) yield other important benefits as well, like cleaner design, reduced development time, reduced time for system testing and deployment.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Ah, but what is the argument for the claim above. At 1:1 ratio, I'd suspect a lot of development time would be wasted in writing and validating unit tests. The cleanliness of the design has no logical link connection with how many tests one writes. Badly designed code passes unit tests as well as cleanly designed code.
        </li>

           Again, at that humonguous ration one need to be suspicious of the quality of the unit tests themselves. I'd also be suspicious that the rather extraordinary effort put into writing that many lines of unit tests detracted from focusing on the real issues of the code itself. One data point from my private project is that I achieved 100% code coverage with 1:5 ratio between lines of tests and lines of code, and that doesn't mean that the code is perfect or bug-free.

        I, for one, would be <strong>very</strong> sincerely interested in learning how production code can be effectively tested with tests that are only 1/5 the size, in lines of code, than the production code.

        So far, the above content seems to concentrate on <em>lines</em> of production code versus <em>lines</em> of unit test code.  I think this is a false measure.  What you ought to measure, instead, is <em>control flow points</em> in production code versus <em>function points</em> in unit test code.  You should have no less than one unit test <em>per production control-flow construct.</em>  In no uncertain terms, every <strong>if</strong> statement needs two unit tests (one each to exercise the consequent and alternate paths).  A <strong>case</strong> construct will need no less than <em>n</em> tests (where n equals the number of cases in the construct).  Etc.

        A ratio <em>close</em> to 1 should be the minimum to strive for.  You may not achieve exactly 1, because of Beck's rule, "Test only what can fail."  Some production code might not need unit testing, if you can prove it cannot fail (and there damn well better be proof-annotations in the production code to back your claims, too).  However, ratios significantly greater than 1 are clearly a red flag, clearly indicating that there exists significant quantities of branch points which have yet to be exercised.  (Use a code coverage tool, at this point, to determine precisely <em>what</em> needs to be exercised.)

        How does this affect <a href="SystemSizeMetrics.html">SystemSizeMetrics</a> ?

        WRT to "Is the ratio of number of lines of production code to the number of lines of test code a useful metric?"

        Here's the thing about metrics - be careful to measure the desired outcome, and not the mechanism that achieves that outcome.  In this case, I'm assuming that your goal is not really to have a certain test-to-target ratio for lines of code.  That's just a means to an end, which is likely to have a high-quality system, or a great user experience, something along those lines.

        What happens when you measure the mechanism instead of the desired outcome is that people will "game" the system.  They'll satisfy the metric, but often at the cost of the real goal.

        But let's say that you want to achieve a great user experience.  That's much more work to measure, isn't it?  And it seems a lot less scientific, but that's what you really want.  Organizations shy away from measuring the right thing because it's hard.  But it can be done.  A survey with numeric rating on various questions, for example, might measure what you want.  What's important isn't the absolute total, but how it changes over time.  Getting better?  Getting worse?

        You'll get what you measure.  Be sure you measure the right thing.
