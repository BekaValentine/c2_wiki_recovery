        Robin Lampert was a new Wiki user when she created this page in 2008.  Multiple wiki and edits later, she's back.  :-)
        She is interested in how people use software to collaborate.

        Welcome Robin.

        Wiki and other WikiLikeThings are excellent platforms upon which collaborative and cooperative work may be done. Its greatest stringth other than <a href="HyperLinking.html">HyperLinking</a>, is the flexibility of use, organizationally, structurally and geographically.

        In times past, collaborative work had a time-lag and expense-factors the result of the communication-methods and working-methods used. With wiki, many of these are moved into the realm of not-limiting-factors. Geography, Nationality, Language and other factors are manageable by Wiki-Technology. It matters little that collaborators are separated by great distances, and are separated by other factors. Wikis can be set up as local, intranet, or internet based and can be made to intercommunicate. New forms of wikis, like the <a href="SmallestFederatedWiki.html">SmallestFederatedWiki</a>, can make locale-versioning of pages, and reduce conflicts, particularly those involving personal or organizational idiosyncracies and preferences, by making pages having the same name resident locally to be different in some ways while similar or identical in many other ways is one of its greatest features.

        How do you see your use of wikis as beneficial to the work you are doing, or will be doing?
