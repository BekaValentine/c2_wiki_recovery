        <em>I did a lot of work with </em><a href="DirectAnimation.html">DirectAnimation</a> when I was at Microsoft back in 97-99.  My opinion, which was also shared by a lot of other people was that Direct Animation sucked, to put it bluntly. -- <a href="CurtisBartley.html">CurtisBartley</a><em></em>
