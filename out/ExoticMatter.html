        Exotic Matter
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ExoticMatter.html">ExoticMatter</a> is matter or equivalently, energy with negative mass hypothesized to exist as a result of solutions to Einstein's equations for <a href="GeneralRelativity.html">GeneralRelativity</a>. Evidence for its existence is seen in the <a href="CasimirEffect.html">CasimirEffect</a>. It would allow for traversable <a href="WormHole.html">WormHole</a>s, <a href="WarpDrive.html">WarpDrive</a>, <a href="TimeTravel.html">TimeTravel</a> etc. Not the same as <a href="AntiMatter.html">AntiMatter</a> although perhaps there is a way to transmute from one to the other (neo-alchemy?). For more details see

        <em>It is not equivalent to energy with negative mass, nor is it correct to refer to energy with mass of any sort in the first place. It is not even particularly related to the </em><a href="CasimirEffect.html">CasimirEffect</a> (which in itself has only small, not large, experimental support), let alone does the latter provide evidence for <a href="ExoticMatter.html">ExoticMatter</a>. It is not even a little bit related to <a href="AntiMatter.html">AntiMatter</a>, and it is about as meaningful to speculate about transmuting water to exotic matter: i.e. complete nonsense. <a href="AntiMatter.html">AntiMatter</a> may sound futuristic and cool and exotic, but all evidence is that it utterly normal in all regards except for its definition of inverted charge. There's no relationship to <a href="ExoticMatter.html">ExoticMatter</a>.<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>If </em><a href="ExoticMatter.html">ExoticMatter</a> turns out to exist, it <strong>might</strong> (not "would") allow for cool science-fictional uses of one sort or another, but then again, it might not. Most physicists would say probably not, even if it exists.<em></em>
