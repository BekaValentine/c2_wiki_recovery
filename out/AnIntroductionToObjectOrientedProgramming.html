        [ISBN: 0201760312] 3rd edition--other editions are available. Called <a href="ThePlatypusBook.html">ThePlatypusBook</a> due to the picture of the platypus on the cover). Quite good work on the subject of OOP, covering numerous OO languages and technologies.  Occupies a good middle-ground between academia and industry--the book is WellGrounded in theory and isn't tied to any particular tool or methodology (and although this book is not as comprehensive as <a href="ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction.html">ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction</a>, it has the advantage of being impartial--OOSC tends to read like an <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a> sales brochure at times).  On the other hand it is quite accessible and readable by industry programmers lacking advanced degrees in computer science.  Quotes <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> quite a bit.

        Q: How does it deal with topics such as the value of hierarchies and OO's relationship to databases?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: On the concept of "hierarchies"; the book discusses both hierarchical (<a href="SingleInheritance.html">SingleInheritance</a>) and non-hierarchical (<a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a>, structural subtyping aka <a href="DuckTyping.html">DuckTyping</a>) subtyping models.  The book does not consider databases at all (or any other <a href="PersistenceMechanism.html">PersistenceMechanism</a>).
