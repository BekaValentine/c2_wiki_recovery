        Why Do Dynamic Languages Need Nil
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am puzzled as to why dynamically-typed or type-free languages need a "nil". A dynamic language can use empty strings or "(nil)" or all kinds of stuff to represent nils and nulls from outside systems such as databases. It just adds problems such as 3-value logic expressions. I believe in the <a href="PowerOfPlainText.html">PowerOfPlainText</a>, and unprintable stuff is a violation of that, making debugging harder, etc.

        <em>Investigate nil-handling in </em><a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> here. <em>if 0</em> is the same as <em>if true</em>. <em>if nil</em> is the same as <em>if false</em>. Member variables not seen yet are default-nil. This allows absurdly brief and clear statements. For example, you can say <em>@member ||= slow_operation()</em> to assign the member once, just-in-time before using it. || doesn't evaluate its right argument if the left is true or not-nil, and then ||= assigns as a shortcut.<em></em>

        The problem is that there is frequently a different meaning of empty vs nil.  Empty means an empty value was given, whereas nil means no value has been given yet.  You might be able to convince me that using an empty string could be ok, but using any other string constant  such as "(nil)" can have demonstrably bad side effects and should be avoided.

        I like the Ruby approach.  It has nils, but nils are references to <a href="TheNilObject.html">TheNilObject</a>, not references to no object at all.  Since nil has methods, including to_s, to_i, etc., it avoids many of the 3-value logic issues.  For instance, i.to_s.empty? will return true for either a nill or a zero-length string.

           Which begs the question "When is the empty string not nil?". I do not see the distinction as explained by empty = empty value, and nil = no value given yet. Nil could mean "Once upon a time was not nil", and empty could mean "Value not known yet". I (personally) would like to see the both treated the same as much as possible. One change that would mean in Ruby is that both empty and nil would be false. Ruby treats empty as true, and nil as false. -- <a href="PeterLynch.html">PeterLynch</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           As I said, you might be able to convince me that a zero-length string is an acceptable nil substitute.  That does seem a little less explicit than nil, but I like your example about treating an empty string as false.

      </ul>

        Another cool Ruby trick; <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> helps you with irrelevant logic after reading a database. myField.blank? returns true if you have a blank string or a nil. So you can just use .blank? and keep going, without tangling code up with logic to detect the String object, detect its length, etc.
      </p>

        <em>I don't see how such is specific to Rails. It is just a default value to return if the DB gives a null, no? Or is it a Boolean flag that tells you if the DB returned a null? This is typical of a </em><a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a> or record management framework.<em></em>

        <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> also has the "undef" value, which is basically the same as Nil.  A common use is to create a subroutine that returns undef in case of a (minor) problem, but the empty string is a valid return.  E.g., looking up a value in a database where it is possible to have an empty field.  The subroutine would return undef if the key didn't exist, but could return an empty string.  
      </p>
      <p>
        You could argue that exceptions are a better way, but <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> only has eval/die, which is not a very good substitute for exceptions, either.

        I have to admit that I <em>really</em> prefer the approach taken by functional languages here.  E.g., there is no singular nil value, but rather, type-safe nils are used.  For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        data MyList a = EmtpyList | MyCons a (MyList a)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Notice that <strong></strong>EmptyList<strong> is the "nil" for the type that is </strong>MyList a<strong>.  By doing this, however, you end up in a situation where there are no true nil values; </strong>EmptyList, though <em>interpreted</em> as if it were a nil value, is really a constructor for a fixed, singleton object (since it takes no parameters, the compiler is free to optimize it to a singleton instance to save memory).  Under the hood, pointers to a <strong></strong>MyList<strong> instance of some kind would <em>never</em> have a null pointer.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to distinguish conveniently between an empty list from the lack of any list at all, this concept is easily extended:
      </p>
      <code>
        data MyList a = NoList | EmtpyList | MyCons a (MyList a)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, this allows you to cons together a datum with a <strong></strong>NoList<strong>.  This is a better solution (using Haskell's </strong>Maybe<strong> type here):</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        data Maybe a = Nothing | Just a -- already defined in Haskell's Prelude, but included here for completeness<br/>
        data MyList a = EmptyList | MyCons a (MyList a)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        type OptionalList a = Maybe (MyList a)<br/>
      </code>

        Seconded!  Actually, under-the-hood, pointers to 'MyList' <em>can</em> point to memory-address-zero.  It need only <em>semantically</em> be the 'EmptyList'.
