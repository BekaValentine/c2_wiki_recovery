        The unending drive to improve upon things.  "New and Improved" is on every product in the grocery store.  There is a drive within us to constantly strive toward perfection.

        "It may be the delight in Order, the pleasure of getting a thing just so -- as in dancing a minuet.  ...The Order of the Divine Mind, empodied in the Divine Law, is beautiful.

        I never enjoyed Ballet.  I've never been a perfectionist.  "Close enough" was always my motto.  But after reading Lewis' comments, I get it.  There <em>is</em> something in us that drives us to strive for perfection.  I can see why the ballerina pushes herself to get that move "just so."  I do the same in my job. -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>
