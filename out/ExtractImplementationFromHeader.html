        Extract Implementation From Header
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a C++ refactoring:
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a class that is implemented completely within its own header and you want to hide its implementation from its clients.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Move all the method bodies out of the header file and into a new implementation file. Move as many #includes out of the header file into the implementation file as possible, replacing them in the header with forward declarations.</em>
      </p>

           Copy the entire contents of the .h file to a new .cpp file
        </li>
        <li>
           Continue editing the .cpp file
          <ul>
            <li>
               Remove the <a href="IncludeGuard.html">IncludeGuard</a>.

            <li>
               #include the header as the first #include in the file (ensures standalone compilability of the file see: <a href="LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign.html">LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign</a>)
            </li>
            <li>
               Remove everything from the class definition except the definitions of the methods.
            </li>
            <li>
               Select all the method definitions and extend them one level (this should bring them flush with the left margin).
            </li>
            <li>
               Type the class name followed by double colons immediately preceding the first method name.
            </li>
            <li>
               Copy what you just typed to the clip board.
            </li>
            <li>
               Paste it to the beginning of all the method definitions so that they become correctly scoped.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Edit the .h file
          <ul>
            <li>
               Replace all the method bodies in the .h file from the close parenthesis of the declaration to the closing curly brace of the definition with a semicolon.
            </li>
            <li>
               Visit each #include in the header. For each one:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   If the #included class is ever used by value (declared as a member or passed by value to a method) skip to the next #include
                </li>
                <li>
                   If the #included class is used only by reference replace the #include with a forward reference.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Gather all the forward references together just after the #includes.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Recompile and retest.
