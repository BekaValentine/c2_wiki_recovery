        The Herd Of Kittens
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Herd of Kittens (<a href="http://www.thok.org/intranet/index.html)">http://www.thok.org/intranet/index.html)</a> is a small group of computer hobbyists in Eastern Massachusetts that specializes in the construction of Free Software, Chocolate, Defense Systems and Simulators, and Chinese Food.

        This quote, allegedly from <em>The Washington Post Magazine</em>, June 9, 1985, gives one of the oldest references I've found:

        <dd>"At Group L, Stoffel oversees six first-rate programmers, a managerial challenge roughly comparable to herding cats." </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Years later, and in many other professional areas, the sentiment still applies; management of gifted developers is still very much an art. Kittens are more easily distracted...
