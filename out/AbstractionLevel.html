        Abstraction Level
      </h1>
      <p>
        A class is an abstraction. A vision of the world. You only can see so far when you are standing on top of a class (or concept), that's why <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> likes to have so many objects and classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The more classes that are in the system, the more likely that you will have a better vision of how the system works.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, adding more classes and objects can simply be adding unneeded complexity, which makes the system more resistant to change. Consider a similar situation in statistics: by adding more parameters to a model, you can fit the existing data up to an arbitrary level of precision; but by doing this, you necessarily add bias which will make future predictions based on the model wrong.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstraction is about letting objects do what they are supposed to do (responsibility). Having class comments is good for this, even if it is in <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstraction is generally good, but for a different point of view see <a href="AllAbstractionsLie.html">AllAbstractionsLie</a>.
