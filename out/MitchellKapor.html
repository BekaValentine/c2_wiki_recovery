        He has assembled a team at the <a href="OpenSourceApplicationsFoundation.html">OpenSourceApplicationsFoundation</a> to build a <a href="PersonalInformationManager.html">PersonalInformationManager</a> - code name Chandler (see ChandlerProject at <a href="http://chandlerproject.org/)">http://chandlerproject.org/)</a> - which may incorporate Wiki characteristics.

        Has had something to do with Lotus, the <a href="ElectronicFrontierFoundation.html">ElectronicFrontierFoundation</a>, <a href="OpenSourceApplicationsFoundation.html">OpenSourceApplicationsFoundation</a> and something called the Clock of the <a href="LongNow.html">LongNow</a>.

        Maybe ON didn't take over the world, but they're doing just fine. We run into them all the time in our industry (wireless handheld devices).

        Kind of famous, too, except he's known as <a href="MitchKapor.html">MitchKapor</a> usually.

        <em>When I worked with him at ON, he much preferred to be called "Mitchell". His last name is also pronounced with the accent on the first syllable, like the food ("caper"), and not like an Indian name ("Kapoor").</em>
