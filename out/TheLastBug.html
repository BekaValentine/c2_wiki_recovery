        as others went home,<br/>

        The night became morning,<br/>
        the room became cluttered,<br/>

        of hunger and thirst.<br/>

        Face down, Nine edge first.<br/>

        accepted his fate.<br/>

        he's just working late."<br/>
      </code>

        And the last bug in sight,<br/>
        an ant passing by,<br/>
        saluted his tombstone,<br/>
        and whispered, "Nice try."<br/>
