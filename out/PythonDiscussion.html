        "Python is an excellent language for learning object orientation.  (It also happens to be my favorite OO scripting language.) ... All objects in Python are implemented as hash tables, unlike in Perl, in which you have to choose a representation (or looking at it more optimistically, where you are free to choose the optimal representation)."

        If you're interested in Python then take a look at <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> at <a href="http://www.zope.org.">http://www.zope.org.</a> It's built with Python and is the most complete Web application server/object management system I've come across. Oh and I nearly forgot, theres a Zope 'Product' (That's a pre-written application) called <a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a> which implements a wiki web in Zope. You can have a wiki web up and running in about an hour. - <a href="RichardMoon.html">RichardMoon</a>

        Python's big idea is that almost everything is a writable dictionary: dictionaries, classes, objects, stack frames, modules, etc.  It's a very elegant and flexible idea.

        I like <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> a lot: I think Python supports <a href="MultiParadigmProgramming.html">MultiParadigmProgramming</a> well, and that that's a good thing.  In <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> people seem to use <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>es to simulate <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>, which makes things a bit ugly both visually and conceptually.  Python seems happier to let you just use a functional style if that's more appropriate.  I think this supports beginning programmers by letting them start in a BASIC-like procedural fashion; and supports more advanced programmers by letting them choose an appropriate paradigm for a problem.  --<a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>

        (Java comment:  Hmmm...  From what I've seen, Java programmers use static functions for functional programming (see <strong>java.lang.Math</strong>), and use <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>es for callbacks.

        Another vote for <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>... I found it to be one of the most intuitive languages I've ever worked with -- you can often just guess the syntax and it works. Its other great strength is its scalability; it makes sense from command-line interaction all the way up to large-scale modular programs. The only thing some people find difficult is its syntax -- block structuring is done using indentation. There are no curly brackets so it's best to have an intelligent editor such as Emacs. Some people find it cleaner; some people hate it. --<a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a>

        Intuitive? Yes! When I started with Python, I could just read a lot of code and understood it immediately. Never experienced the same with any other language. -- <a href="MikaelHermansson.html">MikaelHermansson</a>

        It also does excellent support for all things Microsoft, and it's a nice way to lead VB folk out of the wilderness. And of course it can make full use of java classes, even derive from them, and can generate java bytecodes. All the power of perl with none of the cruft - no $@%_ - I like <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> better than any other language I know.

        A couple of years ago I went actively looking for a good scripting language, looking at things like Perl, various scheme implementations, etc.  Python was by far the best alternative I found.  Scripting languages as a class have a couple of things going for them -- automatic memory management, fast turn around times, and decent built-in resizable data structures.  They also tend to have terrible syntaxes (Perl is just bizarre, Scheme is simple and elegant <em>if you're a computer</em>).
        Python syntax falls more or less into the Algol camp (e.g. C/C++, Pascal, etc) which I still find to be the easiest to actually read.  The block structuring solely by indentation has never been a problem -- in C++ I almost never mess up the indentation, but I omit braces or insert extra ones all the time.  Python syntax is not quite as clean as it could be -- some functions are provided by functions, some are provided by methods, and the OO syntax is not quite as clean as it could be (but then, compare it to the OO syntax in 
        <em>Perl</em>).
        Then there is tuple support and <a href="ArraySlice.html">ArraySlice</a> notation, which is so cool I don't understand why other popular languages don't do it.  --<a href="CurtisBartley.html">CurtisBartley</a>

        I am actively developing one large system, which integrates E-mail, Web, RDMBs and other technologies to bring reports, information etc to user' desktops.  The beauty of the Web is that by the time the page has appeared on the User's desktop, they don't care where it came from, as long as it gets there fast enough.

        <em>That I think is why most people like Python.  Other scripting languages just aren't cut out for doing object oriented programming in the ways that Java or Smalltalk do, nor are other scripting languages as well suited as Python for writing full programs instead of glue code.</em> --Anonymous

        I'll protest on the above claim, and say that <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> is at least a clear competitor when comes to object oriented programming and writing full programs.  Python has an advantage in interpreter speed and availability of libraries, though.  --<a href="EivindEklund.html">EivindEklund</a>

        I love the identation of Python. I think it organizes things more clearly than curly brackets do. If I sound odd or out of place, just accept my opinion and ignore me. ( <em>I just don't quite courage to be bold with wikis yet</em>) -- Anonymous

        One thing I don't like about python is that it has too much magic in it.
        and it's not as consistent as I would like. for example. Why do I have to define '__len__' method for function 'len' to work?
        Why can't I just call x.len()? all the builtin function use these __xxx__ for magic behavior. That's is just plain ugly.
        I think ruby is more clean and elegant.

        <em>This thread explains the reasons <</em><a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&frame=right&th=d8d0f2a6041233a5&seekm=9dIdd.3712%24EL5.3057%40trndny09">http://groups.google.com/groups?hl=en&lr=&frame=right&th=d8d0f2a6041233a5&seekm=9dIdd.3712%24EL5.3057%40trndny09</a>>.  Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.  For me, ruby's "end" is ugly (I realise that there are reasons for it), and its semantic whitespace is truly hideous - far worse than the ugliest corners of standard Python.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        len(x) calling x.__len__() isn't magic -- it's the defined protocol (the duck-typed alternative to statically-typed Interfaces in Java) that things that have lengths implement. That isn't magic, that's you not reading the documentation. Just because you don't like functions with two leading and two trailing underscores being chosen to implement protocols doesn't make them magic. In five years of using Python, I've yet to find anything that's actually magical. I think anything that encourages monkey patching as The Way of doing things (or at least inadequately punishes it) immediately and irrevocably loses any claim to cleanliness or elegance. Period.
