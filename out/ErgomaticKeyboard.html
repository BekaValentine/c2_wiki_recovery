        Ergomatic Keyboard
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've found the Ergomatic (R) keyboard.  This seems to be the same design as the <a href="MaltronKeyboard.html">MaltronKeyboard</a> but at the much more accessible price of US$ 175.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also quite similar to the <a href="KinesisKeyboard.html">KinesisKeyboard</a>.

        Unfortunately, it looks like this keyboard is not being sold at this time.  January 8th, 2010.

        The price on this seemed like a really good deal, so I purchased one of these last week, and am currently typing on it.
        Compared to the <a href="KinesisKeyboard.html">KinesisKeyboard</a>, I much prefer the layout, real function keys, and center keypad.
      </p>

        But I'm unhappy with the quality compared to the Kinesis. The keys feel is sloppy, requiring more pressure and further key travel before contact is made. It *is* the same design as the <a href="MaltronKeyboard.html">MaltronKeyboard</a>, as they licensed the layout from Maltron for independent manufacture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will likely be returning the Ergomatic for a Maltron, but the Ergomatic may be a good buy if you aren't fussy, or are on a tight budget.

        <em>I don't know of anyone who has tried both an Ergomatic and a genuine Maltron so I don't know how they compare head-to-head, but I have a Maltron and it feels pretty cheap too. If I had it to do over again, I would probably buy an Ergomatic before buying a Maltron.</em> -- <a href="RobertChurch.html">RobertChurch</a>
