        I was pair programming the other week. I said that the code wants to go this way. Later, I said that the code wants to be refactored in a certain direction. After a few more references to the code voicing its wants, he turned to me and said, "You must have great ears, because I don't hear the code talking." That got me to thinking about this metaphor, "the code speaks".
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if it's just a convenient way to claim that what I want to do is the best thing to do. If I want to refactor the code a certain way, well, that's just my opinion. But if the code wants to be refactored in a certain way, that lends an air of objectivity to the decision. See, it's not my idea, it's the <em>code's</em> idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the code really <em>does</em> speak to me. Honest. Even when I take my drugs on time.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if your computer has no sound card? Can you still hear code speak? Or if code speaks and no-one is around to hear it, does it still make a sound?
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the sound of one line compiling?

        I had an idea. Code speaks the mind of its author like any work that can be imbued with style. However, this depends on the environment in which you work. On one hand, you have Perl which emphasizes writability and Unix humour (carp?). On the other hand, you have the sterile environment of Java, which is like reading a VCR manual.
      </p>
      <p>
        I get that too many cooks spoil the stew, so Java replaces the art of cookery with microwave TV dinners. But, gee, it's no fun. The best code speaks of the best minds. And whatever happened to the exuberance that <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> folk had of young programmers reading code listings like novels?

          -07-29: This page keeps getting onto <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> because everyone keeps saying when they found it, maybe if it stayed dead for a while it would disappear. -- <a href="PerryLorier.html">PerryLorier</a>

      <p>
        <em>Not necessarily - I found it once from </em><a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a>, and once through the <a href="WikiList.html">WikiList</a> -- 2002/07/29<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it should say that when you augment the count, you should mark the change as a <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a> (as I'm going to do) to keep it out of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. On the other hand, maybe the point of the experiment is to make it findable purely through Recent Changes. Maybe another interesting experiment would be to make a page like this that is always minor-edited, so the <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s never see it (although the RecentEditsJunkies would - man, are those guys crazy).
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmm. Maybe ... just maybe ... <em>such a page already exists</em>; how would we know if it did? There would be no inward links, and it would never show up on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> or <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>. <em>Maybe there's already an entire set of stealth pages, unreachable from the everyday wiki, cloaked as </em><a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s<em>. There could be an entire subculture of wiki, composed of RecentEditsJunkies reading and writing stealthed pages! Hmm; if they only see </em><a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>ed pages, it's possible that they aren't aware of the light side (ie our side) of the wiki at all. Two separate cultures sharing one space, a LightSide and a DarkSide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our course of action is obvious: <strong>we must strike first</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, since I'm submitting this as a <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>, they'll see this. Well, too bad. <strong>People of the </strong>DarkSide <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s-based wiki culture: prepare to be annihilated!<em></em>
