        We could begin with an explanation of the <a href="ExtremeValues.html">ExtremeValues</a> (and what <a href="AgileProcesses.html">AgileProcesses</a> are in general) and follow up with the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingPractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingPractices</a> and how they relate to the values. I agree with (I believe it was) <a href="JeanPhilippeBelanger.html">JeanPhilippeBelanger</a> who said that the presentation should be mostly <em>magistral</em>. Maybe a detailed look at any of the elements would be too much. I also have this feeling that the people who get the most out of presentations on XP (or any other methodology) are those who have a problem to solve. I think we need to reflect on how to <em>engage</em> the CRIM audience and what sort of realities they face in terms of development processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What about of having a comparison between RUP and XP?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with comparing them upfront might be that a neophyte could lose sight of the fundamental differences.  I may be offtrack on this, but explaining Java through C leads to static methods in large classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree with this. It's sort of the difference between telling somebody what to do and telling somebody what </em>'not<strong> to do. The two are not equivalent. </strong><a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> has just published a new paper (<a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/whatisxp.htm)">http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/whatisxp.htm)</a> describing XP that might be an interesting source of ideas for how to present the topic to the layman.<em></em>

        Shouldn't we try to get one of the extremos?  <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>, <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>, <a href="LaurieWilliams.html">LaurieWilliams</a>, etc...

        <em>I think that the purpose of the first presentation yto the CRIM would be to </em>'introduce<em>' XP to the attendees. Maybe getting an extremo to come would be a little like using an elephant gun on a flea. However, I noticed that there is an XP group in Ottawa - maybe we could pool our resources together next spring or something and fly an extremo up here.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I also noticed there is a <a href="TorontoXpUsersGroup.html">TorontoXpUsersGroup</a>! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the CRIM is a francophone organization that does not want to compete with anglophone services.  So unless
        <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> speaks french :).  I also think it might be overkill.

        Are we credible enough to make a presentation to the CRIM?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Will they let us? If they do, this seems to imply they believe we have something to say...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, you are right! Let's speak about that next meeting... -- jmh

        Don't make it more boring than it has to be.  You can <strong>show</strong> them the difference in the presentation itself.  Interacting with your audience (without freaking them out) should be more important than sticking to a given presentation format.  <em>Use the Force, Luke!</em>  <a href="AgileProcesses.html">AgileProcesses</a> like <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> got traction because they go against so-called recognized practices, and yet they deliver.  They require less setup and training and are easier to customize to your environment.  Your audience will need to understand that.  You need to sell them to the idea before you hit them with laundry lists.  :-)  -- <a href="JeanTessier.html">JeanTessier</a>

      <p>
        Excellent point:  sort of a <a href="TravelLight.html">TravelLight</a> approach, more of a guided presentation than a structured course.  This allows us the flexibility that we need to demonstrate:  we don't know (but we have an idea) where people are bugged.  But depending on the crowd we get, our expectations could be destroyed.
