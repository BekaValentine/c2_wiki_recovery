        Me question for the fine "scowlers" be, who came up with this pirate parlance? Our brethren of old on the salty sea? Hollywood? RobertLouisStevenson? -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>

        Talk Like a Pirate Day was invented in 1995 by John Baur ("Ol' Chum Bucket") and Mark Summers ("Cap'n Slappy"). DaveBarry popularized it in 2002.

        What I mean is, is this the way pirates really talked, or is this a literary invention? -- Eliz

        <dd><em>The West Country accent is probably most identified in </em><a href="AmericanEnglish.html">AmericanEnglish</a> as "pirate speech" -- cartoon-like "Ooh arr, me 'earties! Sploice the mainbrace!" talk is very similar. This may be a result of the strong seafaring and fisherman tradition of the West Country, both legal and outlaw. Edward Teach (Blackbeard) was a native of Bristol, and privateer and English hero Sir Francis Drake hailed from Tavistock in Devon. It has also been suggested that Westcountryman Robert Newton's performance in the 1950 Disney film Treasure Island may have influenced people's preconceptions of what accent a pirate "should" have.<em> -- </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country_dialects">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/West_Country_dialects</a></dd>

        So blame Hollywood! See also: <a href="http://www.flyinglab.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-5454.html">http://www.flyinglab.com/forums/archive/index.php?t-5454.html</a> for more on the vocab itself. -- EarleMartin <strong>In particular, the actor who played Long John Silver in the 1950s Disney adaptation of Treasure Island spoke that way, and so it came to be identified as "how pirates talk". Arrrr, mateys, that be how it is.</strong>

        I blame Hollywood for a lot of things. Indeed, those in the know blame Hollywood for "circling the wagons" in the American Old West, but that's another subject. Yes, I can imagine the pirate accent is a legitimate English accent. Yet I can't help wondering who comes up with expressions like "Shiver me timbers!" The flyinglab forum is informative. Thanks. -- Eliz

        <em>But when is Talk Like An International Pirate Day?</em>

        <strong>September 19th</strong>. I even heard a radio spot using pirate talk for no apparent reason, so it seems to be catching on beyond the <a href="BlogoSphere.html">BlogoSphere</a>...
