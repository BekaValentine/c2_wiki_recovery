        Mono Logue

      <p>
        <a href="MonoLogue.html">MonoLogue</a> is a bit of an ugly name. I am using this as a hook because it is an unfilled link on <a href="DonaldNoyesTalk.html">DonaldNoyesTalk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an interesting discussion going on here about the concept of a <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There has been recent developent of this but that was not the first suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
        On <a href="DonaldNoyesTalk.html">DonaldNoyesTalk</a> there is a reference to <a href="WikiPatterns.html">WikiPatterns</a> which has the following entry added in 2013:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="CreateTalkPages.html">CreateTalkPages</a>: A page should be curated by its creator towards perfection. Discussion is separate.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of the other things on <a href="WikiPatterns.html">WikiPatterns</a> are in the form of suggestions. This entry contains the word <em>should</em> and the implication that discussion should be on a separate page. I don't think that has been the usual practice on this wiki. Often comments are made on the page about, for example, a book. Some may be factual, e.g. there is a new edition, and others may be opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        My suggestion is that we are flexible here and not too rigid.
      </p>
