        Curried Object Violates Demeter
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have not looked at the paper, but a <a href="CurriedObject.html">CurriedObject</a> seems to be in pretty strong opposition to the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>. Thoughts? -- <a href="BillTrost.html">BillTrost</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see why it would ... LoD says that you don't rip the guts out of another object and send messages to them.  A <a href="CurriedObject.html">CurriedObject</a> is <em>bound</em> to the original, not to its guts.  Say more about this concern, please?  -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, the LoD says you're not supposed to call a method to get an object you then call methods on.  The part one might forget is that it's perfectly kosher to call a method to <em>create</em> an object you then call methods on.  (You can play with toys you made yourself.  How else are you going to make them than to call methods?  Inline assembly?)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's creating a local variable and using methods on it - perfectly within the rules of demeter, I don't think you've made you point very well, maybe a code sample?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Variables are not objects....
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        Creating a local variable is different from creating of an object.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <em>That's just not a logical statement.  In an OO langage, variables are most certainly objects.</em><br/>
        <em>An int/double/date/etc... are all objects, all with methods.</em><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        eg:<br/>
        myParent.printerList.createNewPrinter().print(myPage)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>That creates a new printer object without assigning it to a variable.  The demeter violation is myParent.printerList.createNewPrinter(), it's not the call to .print(myPage).  If that were just </em>PrinterFactory.CreateNewPrinter().Print(myPage), it would be fine.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        CurriedObjects seem like another way to look at <a href="FlyweightPattern.html">FlyweightPattern</a> to me...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Example of <a href="CurriedFunction.html">CurriedFunction</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        >sum a b = a + b<br/>
        sum: real * real -> real<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        >sum 1 2<br/>
        3<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        >sum 1<br/>
        anonymous: real -> real<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Therefore creating "sum 1" and then using it on the same method is exactly using the result of a message: sum method on 1 object. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, not exactly, because "sum 1" is a function (method) to be applied on object 2 (when saying sum 1 2), so it is the method that is generated on the fly. This doesn't break <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> as it is stated, because <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> doesn't even think that it is possible to generate new methods on the fly. It certainly looks messier than breaking <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>, but this is applied all the time in <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> with good results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Effectively <a href="CurriedObject.html">CurriedObject</a> violates <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree. The </em><a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> also allows you to call methods on objects given to you, and says nothing restrictive about passing along an object that was given to you, i.e. currying.  Because of this, currying is perfectly within the bounds of <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Mmmhh, so when all methods return brand new objects, you can type: 
      </p>
      <code>
        a.bee().cee().dee().ee().fee(); <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        instead of:
      </p>
      <code>
        a.beeCeeDeeEeFee();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I thought this was exactly what <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> was trying to avoid.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>I think your example is bad.  You're taking things too literal, you need to consider the spirit of demeter.  It's to reduce coupling and increase encapsulation, if you need to get to "fee" from "a" with a long chain of calls, that's a demeter violation, and it points to a bad model.  Don't just add a bunch of delegation methods to hide the call chain, change the model to eliminate the chain.  Demeter violations usually mean your design is bad.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, how can the code where that chain of calls exists guarentee that each of those methods always returns a new object? And still returns a new object today, and will also tomorrow? That is exactly the kind of coupling that Demeter is trying to avoid. But there is no currying in your example, so it doesn't seem to support or contradict the claim.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Very good point. In Haskell I could write:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        f 1 2 3 4 5 6<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and that would be equivalent to:
      </p>
      <code>
        (((((f 1) 2) 3) 4) 5) 6)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which is exactly like gathering a resulting function (method) and applying it on another object. Demeter prohibits calling methods on resulting objects, not calling resulting methods on given objects, so maybe <a href="CurriedFunction.html">CurriedFunction</a> does not violate Demeter. But please consider that a function is an object (at least in a <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a> sense), so maybe, just maybe, Demeter is a bit too strong. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The above example in Java:
      </p>
      <code>
        f( 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        it just violates the rule that says that no method should have more than 3 parameters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also this page is about <a href="CurriedObject.html">CurriedObject</a>s, not <a href="CurriedFunction.html">CurriedFunction</a>s. A <a href="CurriedObject.html">CurriedObject</a> is one that is half generated by the constructor and then it is built using several method calls.
