        In <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a>, a readout/printout/listing of a class language which has implementation details (method bodies, mainly) and private features excluded. Method signatures (including pre/post-conditions) and other interface details for exported features are the only things provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that in Eiffel; these are provided by the toolset.
      </p>
      <p>
        C++ has a similar concept, in that for many classes the implementation details are not given in the class definition (usually located in a .h file) and instead are given in a corresponding implementation (.cc, .cpp, .cxx, whatever) file. Difference in C++ is that the programmer must maintain both the interface definition and the implementation separately; they can get out of sync (though any good environment will catch this quickly).
      </p>

        <strong>no not really. Unless you go to the trouble of using the pImpl idiom lots of implementation detail is visible in a C++ class declaration ("the .h file").  </strong><a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a><strong></strong>
