        Ways To Get Around Wiki

        <em>What I'd really like to see here are "testimonials" of how individuals use Wiki - what functions you use to stay current, to explore, etc. - this would be the really basic stuff that you probably don't even think of explicitly any more. What is your typical path through the Wiki-sphere? Do you sign your entries? Do you erase any identifying trace - and if so, how? How much is your own device and how much is specifically supported by the code? That sort of thing? ...</em> -- <a href="TomAllison.html">TomAllison</a>

        This comes from work on Workplace Wikis which has served as an introduction to the <a href="WorldOfWikis.html">WorldOfWikis</a> for a number of folks ...

        <em>Some people display amazing adeptness at discovering new posts as quickly as I make them, but it's never clear to me how - so, when I want them to see something I usually still go leave them a message on their page or even email them - How are you monitoring Wiki? How much can I identify the source of edits?</em>

        By the way, I do understand the basic function of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> - I guess what I'm looking for is how you use it...

        Testimonial #1: Try <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> from the Header on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and you will see the most recent edits made posted with the most recent first, often just second or minutes in the past. You can change the display list length by specifying a time period after the Question Mark. Try this as one different way. [<em>Tip: make it your browser's 'home page'.</em>] Also, you might try <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a>, a page which lists the groups of categories. Select one that sounds interesting and then navigate through its pages. Also, you might try the page <a href="ReallyValuablePages.html">ReallyValuablePages</a>. Sign or don't sign - your choice.  -- <a href="MarkRogers.html">MarkRogers</a>

        Testimonial #2: January 2009 - I note this page was last edited in 2003.

      <ul>
        <li>
           How did I find this page? - <a href="TomAllison.html">TomAllison</a> had just edited and I followed the link to his home page and looked to see what else he had edited. So look to see WhatElseHasSomeoneDoneOnWiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           I often look at a page and think - what category would that go in, so that someone else can find it? Then I add it and look around and see what else makes sense. In the process of doing that I usually learn something I didn't know before.

           Refactoring a group of pages on the same topic does more or less the same thing.

        Typing common words or word fragments like 'car' <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=car">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=car</a> is an interesting way to get a semi-thematic selection of pages to read or edit.
