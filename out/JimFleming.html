        I am very interested in Patterns...especially
        the Patterns of HumanBehavior
        that keep popping up around the <a href="InterNet.html">InterNet</a>...
        and other good cruising grounds like the BritishVirginIslands
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="InterNet.html">InterNet</a> is a powerful tool for tracking these Patterns...
        and helps to feed the WebOmatic PatternProcessor...
        it is very similar to tracking HurricanePatterns...which, this season
        was a FullTimeJob
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for the interesting site...many of the Patterns of the past
        few years have now become more clear as a result of
        this site...the Patterns of HumanBehavior have been
        disappointing, but not unexpected...
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks again for the "input" to the WebOmatic
      </p>

        P.S. there is not much grass to cut around TechnoCat
        but there is still a lot of grass to cut in NaperVille
