        Using Ruby Dont Need Python

        Went from (perhaps) <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> to <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>; don't want to learn <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>.

           <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a> came to <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> via <a href="LuaLanguage.html">LuaLanguage</a> and <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a> (TCL). I haven't used <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> or <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> much at all. I use <a href="SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator.html">SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator</a> (SWIG) to link <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> to <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>.

               Despite the fact that EverybodysDoingIt (though, of course, probably partly <em>because</em> of it) & that I'm a sucker for trying just about any programming language I learn about, I continue to feel no need for <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>. It's kind of odd.

               I was <a href="HappyWithPerl.html">HappyWithPerl</a>. Then I was <a href="UsingRubyDontNeedPython.html">UsingRubyDontNeedPython</a>. But then I moved on to UsingSchemeDontNeedRuby. Except on machines that don't have a <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> installed, then I use <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. Except on machines that don't have <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> or <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> installed, then I use <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>. Except on machines that don't have <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> or <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> or <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> installed (tho' I can't think of one at the moment), then I use BashShell. I refuse to use a machine that doesn't have BashShell, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, or <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> installed. Well, almost. (^_^)

               <em>But,</em> I do <em>need</em> <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> as a user. There are a few programs I depend upon that were written in it.

               Came to Ruby from Perl and R. Still maintain a bunch of my old Perl code and still write new code in R, but I no longer write new code in Perl. I never learned Python or PHP or Javascript, and now that I have Ruby I don't see the need. To me, Ruby is the ideal "happy marriage" of Java and Perl.

               Did hobbyist <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> way back when, but have been doing <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>, VBA, and <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> for most of recent history.  Started learning <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> a while ago and mostly liked it, especially the ExplicitIsBetterThanImplicit philosophy (though that can contradict DRY), but started learning Ruby recently for <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>.  Ruby is a little more DRY  (but can be less explicit) than Python and lets you use the most appropriate and legible style for any given statement or procedure (# of statements on the line, how to indent, if ... vs ... if, if not ... vs unless ..., etc.).  It also maps better into templates (i.e. rhtml) than Python does.  There are still many languages I want to learn more about (Perl, Javascript, Ocaml, Nice), but right now, my heart belongs to Ruby.

               Worked with perl, played with Python, learning Ruby, 'cause Python don't have Rails.
