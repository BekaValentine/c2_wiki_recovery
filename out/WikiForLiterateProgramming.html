        Wiki For Literate Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        My vision: using a wiki for code documentation, <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a>, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe this needs to be a <a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea being that you would check out a source code tree from
        your version control tool - CVS or the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tree would contain source code files, *.c, *.h, *.cpp, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tree might also contain wiki text files, *.wiki.
        (Give them a suffix to live well with Windows tools;
        possibly give them a #! file type so that they can live well
        with UNIX tools.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Visiting a wiki text file with your web browser would format the wiki text,
        and provide editing abilities.
        <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> and free links using 
        the usual [[non-wiki-word link syntax using double brackets]]
        would link in the directory containing the page;
        relative pathnames could be specified, probably requiring the
        extended syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-browser based tools, e.g. a text editor, could be 
        used to manipulate the wiki text files.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wiki text files could link into the source files.
        Possibly might use an extended syntax to indicate grep or ctags/etags like mechanisms;
        possibly would allow anchors to be placed in comments in the text files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, the text files could contain similar wiki links,
        possibly in comments;
        possibly <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> linking on program names, classes, etc.
      </p>

        I.e. a basic functionality available to anyone who can use a browser 
        with file URLs. More functionality available to folks who have
        an IDE that can handle this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, in some ways what I want is a poor man's wiki based IDE.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        As I said above, 
        I believe this needs to be a <a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a>.
        That page discusses how it might be implemented.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It might also be pleasant to make this into a <a href="CvsBasedWiki.html">CvsBasedWiki</a>.
