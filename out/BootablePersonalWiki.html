        Bootable Personal Wiki

        <em>What would be the best standalone wiki on a bootable device?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Summary of solutions proposed:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Linux + A PHP/MYSQL/Apache combo that enables us to run a PHP and MYSQL program or a PHP program locally and also has an embedded Apache server <em>(examples?)</em> + a PHP wiki
        </li>
        <li>
           A personal wiki with a server that operates on Linux (e.g. JWiki(<a href="http://csis.pace.edu/~bergin/jwiki/index.html),">http://csis.pace.edu/~bergin/jwiki/index.html),</a> <a href="ErlangWiki.html">ErlangWiki</a>, Swiki (<a href="http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki),">http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki),</a> <a href="MiniRubyWiki.html">MiniRubyWiki</a>) + a Linux browser (e.g. Lynx)
        </li>
        <li>
           Linux, lynx + <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> (The problem is: EW is not written for Linux. It is written for Windows.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Pharlap's TNT API and a DOS 32 extender
        </li>
        <li>
           A bootable memory stick: The idea is to have a universal wiki that could transcend all operating systems very much like bootable floppies did in their time. It's known that some computers can boot from a USB key drive, and since 2GB key drives are available, they clearly win this contest as they can easily accommodate almost any OS, wiki and browser.
        </li>
        <li>
           A floppy with DOS and a small program written as a C for dos program written with an old C compiler (1988): This could clearly be the winner. Borland's Turbo C 2.O could kick butts! It makes executable C programs in no time and it's on less than 2 megs! However, you're still left with the difficulty of writing an HTTP server (to run on an appropriate TCP/IP stack) and a browser.
        </li>
        <li>
           Linux + Emacs in <a href="WikiMode.html">WikiMode</a> could also be a winner <em>but on what device?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PalmOsWikis.html">PalmOsWikis</a> on a <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           A Forth OS and a Forth wiki (+ a server, a browser) <em>(what?)</em>
        </li>
      </ol>

        I don't see what's so good about this solution compared to the others.

        <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> probably could be ported without Herculean effort - the <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> code doesn't use anything terribly Windows-specific that I recall, apart from the use of .INI files, which could be emulated for Linux or replaced by a cross-platform configuration file format - something XMLish, perhaps? -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        This might be a pretty good idea taking Google's new operative system into consideration. <a href="GoogleChromeOs.html">GoogleChromeOs</a> is supposed to run solely online, with Linux as its core. Having your own personal wiki as a feature wouldn't be a bad idea. -- <a href="CasperSchmidt.html">CasperSchmidt</a>
