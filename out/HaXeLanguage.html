        Ha Xe Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        haXe (pronounced as hex) is an open source programming language. See <a href="http://haxe.org/">http://haxe.org/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        While most other languages are bound to their own platform (Java to the JVM, C# to .Net, <a href="ActionScript.html">ActionScript</a> to the Flash Player), haXe is a multiplatform language.
      </p>
      <p>
        It means that you can use haXe to target the following platforms :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Javascript : You can compile a haXe program to a single .js file. You can access the typed browser DOM APIs with autocompletion support, and all the dependencies will be resolved at compilation time.
        </li>
        <li>
           Flash : You can compile a haXe program to a .swf file. haXe is compatible with Flash Players 6 to 10, with either "old" Flash 8 API or newest AS3/Flash9+ API. haXe offers very good performance and language features to develop Flash content.
        </li>
        <li>
           NekoVM : You can compile a haXe program to NekoVM bytecode. This can be used for server-side programming such as dynamic webpages (using mod_neko for Apache) and also for command-line or desktop applications, since NekoVM can be embedded and extended with some other DLL.
        </li>
        <li>
           PHP : You can compile a haXe program to .php files. This will enable you to use a high level strictly-typed language such as haXe while keeping full compatibility with your existing server platform and libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> : You can now generate C++ code from your haXe source code, with the required Makefiles. This is very useful for creating native applications, for instance in iPhone development.
        </li>
        <li>
           C# and Java targets are coming soon! (from @cwaneck)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The idea behind haXe is to let the developer choose the best platform for a given job. In general, this is not easy to do, because every new platform comes with its own programming language. What haXe provides you with is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a standardized language with many good features
        </li>
        <li>
           a standard library (including Date, Xml, Math...) that works the same on all platforms
        </li>
        <li>
           platform-specific libraries : the full APIs for a given platform are accessible from haXe
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        haXe is useful for many different reasons. You might be wondering why use haXe?
