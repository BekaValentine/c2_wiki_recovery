        Nick Simons
      </h1>
      <p>
        Nick has worked on a variety of <a href="LowCeremonyMethod.html">LowCeremonyMethod</a>s with a variety of Wiki thinkers such as <a href="MichaelJackson.html">MichaelJackson</a>, <a href="TomGilb.html">TomGilb</a> and <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a> since the 1980s.  Most of all he has the annoying habit of delivering working code, on time and within budget.  
      </p>
      <p>
        As Nick once famously remarked of some noted method colleagues as they expressed yet more disdain for the nastier details of programming: "They think it's <em>beneath</em> 
        them - in fact it's <em>beyond</em> them"
      </p>
      <p>
        Other one-liners from Nick that I have appreciated over the years include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "I'm not a pedant in the strict sense of the term"
        </li>
        <li>
           "Well done, you've taken a small simple problem and broken it down into a large number of more difficult ones"
        </li>
        <li>
           "So take your favourite ingredients from a number of methodologies, stir well and cook until half-baked"
        </li>
        <li>
           "Better a little increment than a lot of excrement"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And then there's the less polite ones ...
      </p>
