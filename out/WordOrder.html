        Word Order
      </h1>
      <p>
        Linguists use symbols such as <strong>SOV</strong> to describe the canonical word order in a language. The letters stand for <strong>S</strong>ubject, <strong>O</strong>bject, <strong>V</strong>erb, and the six possibilities are given below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>SVO</strong>: <em>I drink milk.</em> English, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>SOV</strong>: <em>I milk drink.</em> Japanese?
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>VSO</strong>: <em>Drink I milk.</em> eg, questions in German - and in English if the verb is to be.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And less often:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>OVS</strong>: <em>Milk drink I.</em> eg Klingon
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>OSV</strong>: <em>Milk I drink.</em> like Yoda when the verb is to be, otherwise Yoda uses VOSV(A) (<em>Drink milk I do, yes</em>)
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>VOS</strong>: <em>Drink milk I.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Languages differ in the flexibility of word order. In a given language more than one of the above possibilities may be observed, but one is usually more frequent than the others. Most Spanish sentences are <strong>SVO</strong> for example, but questions are usually <strong>VSO</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most programming languages are <strong>SVO</strong>. Forth and the like are either <strong>SOV</strong> or <strong>OSV</strong> depending on how you look at it. Lisp is <strong>VSO</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree.  Most programming languages do not distinguish between subject and object (as do not many natural languages), which points to a weakness in this whole taxonomy.  I'd say most OO languages are </em> <strong>SVO</strong>,<em> Forth is </em> <strong>OV</strong>,<em> Lisp is </em> <strong>VO</strong>.<em>  But some higher-order functions work like adverbials, so Lisp (map f list) is, in my opinion, </em> <strong>AVO</strong>.<em>  Yet in a deeper sense, pure functional languages do not have verbs, only descriptions -- f x does not read "do f to x" but only "f of x".</em>

        <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a> is ALL of these:
      </p>
      <code>
        SVO: I run home. (Normal)<br/>
        SOV: I, to home, run. (Poetic)<br/>
        VSO: Run I to home. (Poetic)<br/>
        OVS: To home run I. (Poetic)<br/>
        OSV: To home I run. (Poetic)<br/>
        VOS: Run home, I do. (Yoda)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Why must the direction "to" be added to all but SVO where direction is implied?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Home" doesn't seem to be an object; in fact, I don't think "run" is a transitive verb.  A better example would probably be where OSV is used in conversation for emphasis.  "That, I'd like to see." <em>Or, an actual as opposed to hypothetical usage: Southwards aye we fled, from the Rhyme of the ancient mariner.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Run isn't transitive, but it can take an indirect object, which is normally signified with "to".  I guess it's understood in the first example.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>English is really SVO, but it uses others for poetry and yoda as noted above. Yoda doesn't need a</em> to <em>either.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        IIRC, <a href="GermanLanguage.html">GermanLanguage</a> has this rule that most sentences are SVO, unless there's an adverb or a clause up front, in which case the verb cuts ahead of the subject:
      </p>
      <code>
        "Ich gehe heim."<br/>
        "Morgen gehe ich heim."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It probably helps that German declines nouns for case.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>German nouns are inflected for number. There are blanket declensions for case are Gentive (des Mann</em>'es<strong>) and Dative plural (von den Buecher</strong>n<strong>). A handful of nouns also have inflections for the Accusative but these are mainly historical accidents (fuer den Knabe</strong>n<em>').</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think German does that.  It declines articles for case, but that's not always enough to make a difference.  Also, OVS is also permitted in German sentences, just so long as the verb comes second.  At least the version we were taught.

        As a NativeSpeaker of the related <a href="DutchLanguage.html">DutchLanguage</a>, I'll try to help. Dutch is SOV, but is affected by what is called V2; in the main sentence, the flexed verb is moved to second position.

      <code>
        "... dat ik melk drink." (SOV)                     -> "Ik drink melk." (SV2O)                      = "I drink milk." (SVO)<br/>
        "... dat ik melk zal moeten kunnen drinken." (SOV) -> "Ik zal melk moeten kunnen drinken." (SV2OV) = "I will have to be able to drink milk." (SVO)<br/>
