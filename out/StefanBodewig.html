        I'm working for a company that describes itself as focussed on
        multimedia applications of all kinds. My main job is Java development (mostly web based applications) and trying to bring some <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practices into the company.
      </p>
      <p>
        In one of my other lifes I'm involved in a couple of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software projects, currently you can find me working on the JDBC driver of the FreeTds project (<a href="http://www.freetds.org/)">http://www.freetds.org/)</a> and the <a href="JakartaProject.html">JakartaProject</a>. I've been told that one can still find some traces of my work in <a href="GnuPlot.html">GnuPlot</a> (<a href="http://www.gnuplot.org/)">http://www.gnuplot.org/)</a> which I left around 1995. I'm a member of the
        <a href="ApacheSoftwareFoundation.html">ApacheSoftwareFoundation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of my current programming time in the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> world is devoted to <a href="ApacheAnt.html">ApacheAnt</a> - I'm the one who committed the first <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> testcases for Ant and one of the original authors of Ant's optional <junit> task.

        I <em>knew</em> that whoever was working on the Ant/JUnit integration had to be on the Wiki (and would reply to Kent's concerns in <a href="JakartaProject.html">JakartaProject</a>).

        <em> </em>'to be on Wiki<em>' would be too strong, I come here every now and then.</em>

        Interestingly, Stefan, I have used all of the software you mention above in the past month ! I'm quite impressed with FreeTds, which manages to be much more efficient in terms of memory management than Sybase's own JDBC driver.

        <em>To be honest, you can't really compare </em>FreeTDS and Sybase's own driver, FreeTDS is still in its infancy and maybe it doesn't use as much memory because of missing features or strange limitations.<em></em>
