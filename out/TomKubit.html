        A die-hard Mac and Smalltalk bigot, he has been applying object oriented techniques to multiple domains, from digital image analysis, to servo-motor control, to financial systems, in Smalltalk, C++, and now Java, since 1988.  Having been one of the <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> skeptics during development of the <a href="VcapsProject.html">VcapsProject</a> at Ford, his development life was changed by <a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a> (and other team members), and he is now a staunch advocate of everything <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.
      </p>

        He is currently available for XP consulting opportunities after previously being a lead team member on a very ambitious, large team (approx. 30 developers) XP project at Interface Systems in Ann Arbor, Michigan (Go Buckeyes!).  He is also the current President of the <a href="MichiganExtremeProgrammingEnthusiasts.html">MichiganExtremeProgrammingEnthusiasts</a> group.
