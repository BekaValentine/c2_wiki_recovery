        Rat Bag
      </h1>
      <p>
        Strine for "contagious eccentric to be shunned". The closest seppo equivalent is probably "communist". But then again seppoes are all <a href="RatBag.html">RatBag</a>(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More specifically, a </em><a href="RatBag.html">RatBag</a> is someone who isn't shut up when you say NoWorries.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RatBag.html">RatBag</a> can also be used semi-affectionately, just as "Bastard" has 18.5 shades of meaning.

        having no clue what this meant, altavista told me +strine +seppo was on <a href="http://members.tripod.com/~thisthat/slang.html">http://members.tripod.com/~thisthat/slang.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        it's an aussie slang reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        according to this document, seppo = American, strine = lots of aussie slang said at once, and ratbag = not a nice person.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        ("Strine" can be thought of as the word "Australian", pronounced with an Australian English accent, the first vowel and 'l' getting lost)
      </p>

        <em>Strictly speaking, only a </em><a href="RatBag.html">RatBag</a> would claim <a href="RatBag.html">RatBag</a>s are not nice. The rest of us would say, NoWorries, they're part of our way of life.<em></em>

        "seppo", of course, is rhyming slang. "Septic Tank" == "Yank".
      </p>

      <p>
        What about "blighter"?
      </p>
      <p>
        Likely from "Blighty" for UK, from Urdu "belaiti," European. Not a Strine word, but.
