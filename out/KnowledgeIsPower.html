        Knowledge Is Power

        Someone else can explain this philosophy better than I, but it goes something along the lines of...

        <strong>Easy provocative answer:</strong> Most of our accidental knowledge and ideas (say 99.9%) cannot be used by ourselves
        directly. But if we put some of 'em in a Wiki-system, there is a great chance that each participant gets more knowledge and ideas in his specific range of activities that s/he can use to their advantage (for a <em>fraction of the cost</em> of an alternative way of searching for that knowledge). And, by the way, transferring freely your accidental knowledge and ideas is a way to find new friends (<em>and make our fortune</em>:-) -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>
