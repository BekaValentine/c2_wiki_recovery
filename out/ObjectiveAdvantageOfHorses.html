        Objective Advantage Of Horses
      </h1>
      <p>
        The advantages of horses over cars:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ultimate all-terrain vehicle.  Horses go where hummers fear to tread.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Constant supply of fertilizer for your garden
        </li>
        <li>
           Safe to ride while you're drunk
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>uh, actually folks have been busted for driving a team while drunk. They tried to tell the court, "but the horses weren't drunk!" It didn't fly...</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           You can talk to your horse without people looking at you like you're crazy.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can thumb your nose at OPEC.  (So far, OHEC--the Organization of Hay Exporting Countries, has yet to ramp up the price of hay...)
        </li>
        <li>
           With careful planning, a horse can generate its own replacement. Try that with a car.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disadvantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Horses can't go 80MPH (130km/h) no matter how hard you ride 'em.  <em></em><a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a><em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Hard to put a clever bumpersticker on the back of a horse.
        </li>
        <li>
           No place to put a set of clubs
          <ul>
            <li>
               Aw, use your imagination!  You can ride a horse <em>and</em> juggle at the same time.  Try <em>that</em> in a car!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           No place to plug in your laptop--no place for a passenger to <em>put</em> a laptop, for that matter.
          <ul>
            <li>
               There is a place to plug in your laptop, but the horse won't like it very much.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The HorseCarImpedanceMismatch makes it hard to use horses in a car-dominated infrastructure.
        </li>
        <li>
           Horses don't like being tied to parking meters
        </li>
        <li>
           They shit everywhere
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Inappropriate comparison.  Culturally and logistically, the role of the horse has been supplanted by the motorcycle--right down to the independent, "bad boy" image associated with its rider. The horse-drawn carriage is what was replaced by the automobile, just as the farm wagon was replaced by the pickup truck.

        Has the transportation theme on Wiki now officially jumped the shark?
