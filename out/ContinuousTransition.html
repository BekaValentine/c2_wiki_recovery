        <strong>Problem:</strong> The traditional <a href="WimpInterface.html">WimpInterface</a> involves numerous magic events like clicking on an icon object, magically creating a window of some kind. It's difficult to learn and difficult to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> You have to represent complex or important transitions between states.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong> Human users are easily disoriented by abrupt or discontinuous transitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Make the representation of the transition, or the transition itself, continuous. Show every step along the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples:</strong> When you recall bookmarked locations in <a href="BlackAndWhite.html">BlackAndWhite</a>, the game merely moves the camera to that location for you, without teleportation or magic. Human interactions with physical reality are based around continuous transitions; eg, navigating a city.

        This also applies to <a href="ZoomableUserInterface.html">ZoomableUserInterface</a>s; instead of having sharp boundaries around the lens, use continuous zooming with a plateau around a focus.
