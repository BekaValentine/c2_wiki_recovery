        There Is No Reasonable
      </h1>
      <p>
        We often hear censors tell us that they will only prevent us from seeing "what would offend a reasonable person" or, worse because it's sexist, "what would offend a reasonable woman", or, worst, because it assumes all human intercourse must be acceptable to children, "what it is reasonable for a child to read".
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, <a href="ThereIsNoReasonable.html">ThereIsNoReasonable</a>. There's just signal and noise. The time-tested tried-and-true <a href="MakeSignalNotNoise.html">MakeSignalNotNoise</a> is the only true guide to what is <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> vs what is <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> on wiki. TheCostinWay and its inevitable ancillae are trying to tell us that pages like <a href="RulesOfGeelf.html">RulesOfGeelf</a> or <a href="MoviesToConsider.html">MoviesToConsider</a> should be deleted, but any page on MicrosoftsTenYearOldBuzzword is sacred and must stay. I don't think that's reasonable and you do? Then <a href="ThereIsNoReasonable.html">ThereIsNoReasonable</a>. There is only tolerance for views that differ from your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TolerateOffTopic.html">TolerateOffTopic</a> because <a href="ThereIsNoReasonable.html">ThereIsNoReasonable</a> and, except for noise instead of signal, there is no <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> either. --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

      <p>
        <em>What percent of wiki's problems would you say are related to off-topic content verus on-topic but disputed?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not a matter of problems due to <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, it's a matter of an opportunity to exercise WikiPower.  You may have noticed, even totally <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages have fallen victim to WikiPower.  People wait like vultures, waiting for the slightest excuse to pounce with either criticism or the almighty delete.  It can be quite comical if viewed from the correct perspective.  Better that there be plenty of <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> to draw the WikiPower abuser's wrath, instead of them pouncing on the <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> things as well.  There can not be peace, because of the way that Wiki gives power to all, to either use with wisdom or to abuse at will.

        <em>What's the distinction between reasonable and time-tested tried-and-true? Is it true </em><a href="ThereIsNoReasonable.html">ThereIsNoReasonable</a> way to distinguish signal from noise? -- <a href="MarkTilley.html">MarkTilley</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, that's easy. <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, or stuff that is <a href="ReFactorable.html">ReFactorable</a> to <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> (non-empty <a href="EigenPage.html">EigenPage</a>s), is signal. The rest is noise. -- Pete

      <p>
        <em>That sounds reasonable to me ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, so <a href="ThereIsaReasonable.html">ThereIsaReasonable</a> ...

        <em>Now Peter, I would appreciate if you put the effort to represent my position with the minimal degree of accuracy. I never claimed nor implied that either </em><a href="RulesOfGeelf.html">RulesOfGeelf</a> or <a href="MoviesToConsider.html">MoviesToConsider</a> should be deleted. And I believe that even you can make the elementary distinction between <a href="MoviesToConsider.html">MoviesToConsider</a> and SomeTrollNextPersonalSlander. -- Costin<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even I certainly can. If the troll's slanders were signal, I'd welcome them. His stuff isn't necessarily <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> - much of it is at least <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a> - but just noise. At least, to me. Then again no one has ever called me reasonable ...
