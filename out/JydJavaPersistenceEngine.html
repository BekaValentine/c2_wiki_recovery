        Jyd Java Persistence Engine
      </h1>
      <p>
        A simple, inexpensive Java based <a href="PersistenceEngine.html">PersistenceEngine</a> that supports <a href="AtomicConsistentIsolatedDurable.html">AtomicConsistentIsolatedDurable</a> transactions through MultiVersionConcurrencyControl.
      </p>
      <p>
        One drawback is that it requires that every persistent object to be derived from a single DBObject class AND every method must include one of two method calls: One method call indicates the method is read-only and the other indicates the method modifies the object's state somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
        To its advantage, Jyd provides an explicit mechanism to support schema evolution.
