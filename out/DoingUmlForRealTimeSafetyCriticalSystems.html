        Doing Uml For Real Time Safety Critical Systems

        Lockheed-Martin is using UML on the URET program (a strategic conflict detection program for the FAA). They are _not_ using a CASE tool to generate it; rather they use VISIO templates.

        This reminds me of an old Dilbert -- Wally, in a stunning example of code reuse, creates the new air traffic control system from the old payroll system. His advice to co-workers, "Just don't fly on payday."
