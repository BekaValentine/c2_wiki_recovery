        Monkey Kind Of Thing
      </h1>
      <p>
        This "Monkey Kind Of Thing" refers to the interaction between Howler monkeys and Spider monkeys.
      </p>
      <p>
        Howler monkeys are slow, methodical and dull creatures who spend their days eating leaves of certain trees.  Not much upsets them, and they seem to lack imagination and motivation for anything other then this simple "what they do".
      </p>
      <p>
        Spider monkeys are smaller, very fast, extremely active, and quite intelligent.  They spend their days zooming all through the tree tops roaming far and wide for all sorts of fruits that give them the high energy that they need.  Eat, sleep, zoom, play, investigate is what they do.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the favorite things for the Spider monkeys to do, is to bother the dull Howler monkeys.  They like to poke at them to see if they can get any kind of reaction at all, and it usually results in none.  They will steal a howler's baby and carefully play keep-away with it, but the howlers don't seem to notice or care much.  The Spider monkeys soon grow tired of the dull, listless, uninspired Howlers, and always gladly give the babies back to their seemingly uncaring owners.  But, they can't resist the temptation to do it all over again on another day.
