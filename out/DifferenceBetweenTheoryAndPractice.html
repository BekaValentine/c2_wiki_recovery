        That is based or misquoted from Aldos Huxley. The quote is:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"The great tragedy of science -- the slaying of a beautiful hypothesis by an ugly fact."</dd>

        <dd>-- Thomas Huxley</dd>

        The paraphrase is pretty pithy, though.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So is it Aldos or Thomas?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most likely it's Thomas, and it's "Aldous" Huxley <em>(</em><a href="AldousHuxley.html">AldousHuxley</a>)<em>, who was an author. Thomas Henry Huxley was an outspoken defender of Darwin's theory of evolution in the mid 1800's. See </em><a href="http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/thuxley.html">http://www.ucmp.berkeley.edu/history/thuxley.html</a> for Thomas Huxley bio information.

        I rather like RobertGrossblatt's variation: <em>theory and reality are only theoretically related.</em> It's vastly more succinct and far more pithy.

        Nonsense. If reality disagrees with theory, reality wins. Always. That's science.

        Some miscellaneous thoughts on theory and reality.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The purpose of theory is to predict future observations.
        </li>
        <li>
           Theory is validated by how well it explains past observations.
        </li>
        <li>
           The predictive nature of theory is dependent upon how well the future observations reflect the past data selected for validation. The more the future differs from the past, the greater uncertainty surrounds the prediction.
