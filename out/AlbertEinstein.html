           It is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute the truly religious attitude; in this sense, and in this sense alone, I am a truly religious man. I cannot conceive of a god who rewards and punishes his creatures, or as a will of the type of which we are conscious in ourselves.

           How can it be that mathematics, being after all a product of human thought independent of experience, is so admirably adapted to the objects of reality?

           The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious?. the fundamental emotion which stands at the cradle of true art and true science.

           That deep emotional conviction of the presence of a superior reasoning power, which is revealed in the incomprehensible universe, forms my idea of God.

           My religion consists of a humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble minds.

           It was the experience of mystery - even if mixed with fear - that engendered religion.

           I assert that the cosmic religious experience is the strongest and the noblest driving force behind scientific research.

        <a href="PeterSchickele.html">PeterSchickele</a> explains relativity as follows: e = mbcs, which means energy equals matzo balls in chicken soup. Dispensing with the bs, we have e = mc^2, the superscript 2 indicating that this constitutes a square meal.

        Frankly, I think EinsteinNameIsOverUsed. Many of the quotes here are apocryphal. Sure, the theory of relativity is a great achievement, but remember that at the same time, <a href="NielsBohr.html">NielsBohr</a>, <a href="ErwinSchroedinger.html">ErwinSchroedinger</a> and many others were working on <a href="QuantumTheory.html">QuantumTheory</a>, which have much more impact in our civilization, and is unknown to non-techie people (sigh in despair).
      </p>

        <em>Remind yourself what Einstein's Nobel prize was for (hint: quanta figure prominantly!)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I agree that his name is overused, I have to object to your reasoning. First off, relativity has had at least as large an impact, both on physics and the day-to-day world. Secondly, much of the work of Bohr, Heisenberg, Schroedinger, etc. was building on the early QM work of Einstein. Einstein didn't like the direction that QM was going, but he did play a part in its origin. Out of the group you mention, Einstein was certainly the most powerful theorist; however, the others do deserve some recognition (Heisenberg has at least some popular recognition, but only through his cat :) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Schroedinger through his cat, Heisenberg for an incorrect version of his principle.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I regret is the use of Einstein quotations (many apocryphal) about non-physics topics.
