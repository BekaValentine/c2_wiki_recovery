        The hypothesis, that the least recent common ancestor of all living human beings lived 2-5 thousand years ago. This was shown by a simulation of human migration and sexual reproduction behaviour in

        Um, least recent means longest ago. I propose that the longest-ago common ancestor of all ManKind is also the longest-ago common ancestor of plenty of other living life forms.
