        People outside the mainstream of society have always known that the personal is political. Being gay, being a woman, and being poor are all political. Software is a personal experience too, with its own classes of privileged vs unprivileged, mainstream vs marginal participants. It is eminently political.

        Write it in one way, and you get one set of winners and losers. Write it in another way, and you get a completely different set of them. And that's without even getting into the question of copyrights.
