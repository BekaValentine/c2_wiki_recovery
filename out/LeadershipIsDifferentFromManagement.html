        Leadership Is Different From Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Management is not something you <em>do</em> to other people.  You manage your inventory, your checkbook, your resources.  You can even manage yourself.  But you do not manage other human beings.  You manage <em>things</em>, you <em>lead</em> people." <a href="TheServant.html">TheServant</a>, p.28
      </p>
      <p>
        From <a href="OnBecomingaLeader.html">OnBecomingaLeader</a>, p.45:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The manager focuses on systems and structure; the leader focuses on people.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The manager relies on control; the leader inspires trust.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The manager administers; the leader innovates.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The manager accepts the status quo; the leader challenges it.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The manager does things right; the leader does the right things.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

        People much prefer being led than being managed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Leadership is about guidance and support, Management is about direction and control.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managers try to create the Thing; good Leaders create the Environment.

        Whoever glofifies this concept has never worked under a good leader who was a poor manager.
