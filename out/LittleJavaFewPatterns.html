        I just started reading this little book. And, if it is anything like the authors' previous efforts (<a href="TheLittleLisper.html">TheLittleLisper</a>, <a href="TheLittleSchemer.html">TheLittleSchemer</a>), then I am in for a fun ride.

        This book has a different audience than the previous <em>Little</em> books. Where they focused on non-programmers, this one expects some programming experience.
        The authors introduce a subset of Java (in order to demonstrate OO programming principles) and <em>pattern-directed program design</em>.

        I was able to pick it up at the McGraw-Hill book store here in NYC and a
        colleague was able to get it at the Barnes & Noble at 18th St. & 5th Ave.,
        also here in NY.

        It is a real brain-twister and I have thoroughly enjoyed it so far (about
        halfways through). Very different and very refreshing from the tidal wave
        of Java books out there. In particular, the authors' presentation of a
        functional style of programming for Java is very interesting; I've never
        seen something like it for a procedural language. -- <a href="NicholasJacobs.html">NicholasJacobs</a>

        I picked up this book because the title made me think of the Design Patterns book. If you are looking for a high-level Design Patterns for Java book, this is not it. While it does discuss some design patterns, that is not the primary purpose of the book. What this book offers is an introductory approach to learning Java through what the authors refer to as pattern-directed program design. Huh? What's that you might ask? It teaches Java and object-oriented programming by using the principles of functional design, how to translate input objects to output objects. It does NOT teach it textually. In other words, you cannot just pick up the book and start reading it anywhere. It presents its concepts in a question and answer style. The authors also recommend that you "Allow seven sittings, at least" to get through the book. For the right audience, this looks like a good book. I am not that audience. I might see this used in an introductory computer science class. Given that its from MIT Press, that doesn't surprise me.

        The major strength/weakness of this book (and their other books) is its "Socratic" style. They never really tell you how to do stuff, but they rely on the questions they pose to cause you to "get it." Some like it, some don't. The first time I "got it" while I was reading <a href="TheLittleSchemer.html">TheLittleSchemer</a>, it was a truly profound experience.
