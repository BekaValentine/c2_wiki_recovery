        Generic Programming Using Cee Macros
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many interpreters and compilers are written in the <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, instead of specialized grammars like EBNF.
      </p>
      <p>
        C requires considerable code redundancy.  This redundancy can be reduced by using macros and other <a href="CeePreprocessorStatements.html">CeePreprocessorStatements</a>.
      </p>
      <code>
        /* This example comes up often in interpreters */<br/>
        #define Func(name, OP) name(int a, int b) { return a OP b; }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        /* we can call the macros with very simple code */<br/>
        Func(add, +)<br/>
        Func(sub, -)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        /* It will expand to code like: */<br/>
        /* add(int a, int b) { return a + b); } <br/>
        sub(int a, int b) { return a - b); }<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          /
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is a <a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a> technique.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It reduces trivial code to an underlying pattern. 
        </li>
        <li>
           It is a different work-around for the code duplication mentioned in the first 2 "accepted ways to use <a href="CeePreprocessorStatements.html">CeePreprocessorStatements</a>".
        </li>
        <li>
           It may seem weird if you've never written an interpreter; but it is very handy for writing interpreters, and the alternative is not pretty, it's just ugly clutter.
        </li>
        <li>
           This technique will not be immediately clear to many C programmers.  It will cause problems for them.
        </li>
        <li>
           It may be easier for a maintenance programmer to grasp if it is done in the same file as it is used, not in a separate header file.
        </li>
        <li>
           It lets you implement <a href="GenericProgramming.html">GenericProgramming</a> in C, using the only real tool that C offers for <a href="GenericProgramming.html">GenericProgramming</a>. <a href="GenericProgramming.html">GenericProgramming</a> is widely considered to be one of the best parts of other languages, like C++ templates, Lisp macros, etc. 
        </li>
        <li>
           It dramatically shortens the code.  In some cases, 3000 lines of code can be boiled down to a 200 line file of trivial definitions.  
        </li>
        <li>
           It follows <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, and thereby simplifies code maintenance.
        </li>
        <li>
           This approach leads to <strong>better</strong> maintainability. The alternative (in C) is <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a>, where every function is identical except for one or two characters (the operator "-" or "*" etc).
        </li>
        <li>
           It makes it easy to add features.  A programmer can take an integer-only interpreter, and add <strong>working</strong> support for floating point by adding a single new 1-line macro (and of course some trivial data structures, <em>et cetera</em>). That's nothing to sneeze at.
        </li>
        <li>
           Similarly with other things here...they may be <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, but just as with gotos, there are <strong>times</strong> when it's the right thing to do.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Brian Kernighan wrote a paper about an awk to C translator he wrote(<a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/awkc++.ps).">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/awkc++.ps).</a> At one point he said "The thought of adding another type and another 75 functions to manage it was more than I could bear." This is the phenomenon that I'm claiming this macro approach solves (actually it turns out to be <a href="MetaMacro.html">MetaMacro</a>s and <a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a>, but I'll skip that for the moment). Using the approach I am advocating, he wouldn't have to manage another 75 functions, it would happen automatically.

      <p>
        One way to avoid using macros like this is to switch to a different language.  Interpreters and compilers can be written using special grammars.  One can express a grammar cleanly using a syntax specifically designed for that purpose, rather than define a new syntax via C macros.  EBNF (Extended <a href="BackusNaurForm.html">BackusNaurForm</a>) and the ANTLR (<a href="AntlrTranslatorGenerator.html">AntlrTranslatorGenerator</a>) meta-language are well documented.  The grammars and Java code are pretty and easy to understand.  Lots of folks know them.
