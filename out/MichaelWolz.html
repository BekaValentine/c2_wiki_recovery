        I'm a Wiki fan - it's been a while now. I've incorporated a personal Wiki into my work routines. I'm starting a list of some sites I like...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">http://en.wikipedia.org/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Are You There?  (November 2003)</em> ImHere (June 07) ... and again in September 2011

        <em>Mike, </em><a href="TheCollaborativeWikiNovel.html">TheCollaborativeWikiNovel</a> hasn't made any progress in over a year. Is it dead?<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe. Maybe not. I wasn't the only contributer, so I'm going to pass on declaring it dead or alive. However, perhaps WorkOnTheCollaborativeWikiNovel became a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>, and uses up resources. Perhaps it's time is past. <em></em><a href="MichaelWolz.html">MichaelWolz</a><em></em>

        Good stuff here (at <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>). E.g., <a href="BoyThisStuffMakesMeFeelStupid.html">BoyThisStuffMakesMeFeelStupid</a>.

        Regarding <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>, Wiki is an expanding opportunity space, as you have demonstrated by finding this note. My interest is: HowToNavigateWiki, that is, to create a mapping of it onto a string of text as a coherent conversation.

        WikiEconomics: I wonder if there's a real a physical limitation, or if, on the other hand, the creation of new Wiki sites plus the enlargement of physical facilities in existing sites continues to allow expansion to occur at the speed at which people are willing to contribute. I wonder what the cost/byte is? I wonder if there is an economy of scale.
