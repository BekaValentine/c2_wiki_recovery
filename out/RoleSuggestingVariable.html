        Role Suggesting Variable
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you see a variable you can ask several questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What is its scope?
        </li>
        <li>
           What is its lifetime?
        </li>
        <li>
           What is its type?
        </li>
        <li>
           What is its role?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a> is one approach to variable naming that packs answers to several of these questions into a very few characters. However, it results in names that are an acquired taste, at best.
      </p>
      <p>
        An analysis of the problem for Smalltalk reveals that several of the questions are answered by context.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What is its scope? There are only three scopes in common use- global, which is used only for classes; instance; and method. As long as methods are short, you can quickly and correctly distinguish temps from instance variables by whether they are declared in the current method or not.
        </li>
        <li>
           What is its lifetime? In Smalltalk, this is the same question as scope.
        </li>
        <li>
           What is its type? In Smalltalk, this can be tricky, but the information is often easily gleaned from context. Formal parameters are an exception, so they are named with TypeSuggestingVariable.
        </li>
        <li>
           What is its role? This leaves us with naming the variable exclusively after its role in the computation.
        </li>
      </ul>
