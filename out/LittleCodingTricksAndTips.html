        Little Coding Tricks And Tips
      </h1>
      <p>
        Miscellaneous coding tricks and tips for fun, profit, and ridicule......okay, skip the ridicule:

        This is usually more efficient resource-wise:
      </p>
      <code>
        upperCase(subString(targetString,...))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        than this:
      </p>
      <code>
        subString(upperCase(targetString),...)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        because the case conversion is applied to a shorter string.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <code>
        If (isBlank(aa) && isBlank(bb) && isBlank(cc)) ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        can be shortened to:
      </p>
      <code>
        If (isBlank(aa . bb . cc)) ...     // single dot is concatenate<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But ONLY if the language does not have "poison-pill" null strings. If the language does have poison-pill null strings, then one null turns the entire expression into a null expression even if one of the variables in the concatenate expression is not blank. It's a bad feature of a language in my opinion. Null strings themselves are a dumb idea. (Generally I make the "isBlank" function treat nulls as blanks if given a choice. And, efficiency is not commented on here.)

        An old one from my C days...
      </p>
      <p>
        The construct (x ? 1 : 0) can be used to "normalize" a number, reducing it to one or zero.  This can also be done as:
        (!!x)
      </p>
      <p>
        Also works on C++ objects that have an ! operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Careful not to make it too obscure. Sometimes a longer form is far more readable maintenance-wise.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In C99 or later and C++, a simple conversion to bool does the same without odd constructions. The bool type can only have the values 0 or 1. Note that this is not necessarily so for BOOL, Bool, Boolean, or other non-standard definitions inherited from older C versions.

        Which brings us to the next tip: STOP USING C89!
