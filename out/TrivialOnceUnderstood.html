        Trivial Once Understood
      </h1>
      <p>
        Once you understand something, it looks trivial.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know if this is generally the case, but it certainly is for me, and I have seen it in others. It seems to occur most often with math. Everything in math is <a href="TrivialOnceUnderstood.html">TrivialOnceUnderstood</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may even be used to check that somebody has understood something. If he thinks it is trivial, he probably has.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, some things are TrivialOnceMisunderstood.  This is often due to understanding a specific case, but not the general case or vice versa.

        An example from math: PeanoAxioms (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number#Peano_axioms)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_number#Peano_axioms)</a> are trivial in that they 'just' state what we all know about natural numbers. But formalizing this 'obvious' intuition is exactly the important part. -- .gz
