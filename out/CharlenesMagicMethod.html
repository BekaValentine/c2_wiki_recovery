        Charlenes Magic Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        The big problem with building the Child's Play window-builder was getting widgets in Smalltalk/V PM to move around the screen and dynamically resize without leaving "mouse tracks" or flickering.  We struggled with this problem for days.  Finally, <a href="CharleneBenson.html">CharleneBenson</a> solved the problem by writing a method that did some fairly obscene things to the low-level Presentation Manager libraries.  We found that changing even a parameter value or the order of the calls in the method would make it fail, thus the name "Charlene's Magic Method".
