      <p>
        A voluntary scheme for linking wikis should be implemented using a InterWikiStandard.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beginnings of a collaboration for this scheme which would only involve wikis wishing to participate and would require a minimum of changes to the server and would require no centralized resource index and could be put into working order in a minimum of time:
      </p>
      <p>
        The linkage (in page) would be by prefix to the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> as in c2:<a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The linkage (by means to be determined) to those pages on selected sites with the same page title. This would not mean that the content would be on the same topic, but rather that the name is the same. No prefix would be necessary for the linkage made at the page level, the assumption being that the page you wish to link to is the same name on the clicked logo.
      </p>
      <p>
        The in-page linkage is implemented in a number of wikis, and to see how the implementation is programmed in C++, you might refer to the source code in the beta version of <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> Version 1.1. A transparent scheme might be possible where a prefix is not required.

        I am also curious about this. Do we need to have every wiki site set up an InterwikiMap, or can we use some linking system so that only one wiki needs to be linked to (w/ mirrors) such as <a href="WorldWideWiki.html">WorldWideWiki</a>:OneBigWiki? Then, hopefully, this could work - <a href="WorldWideWiki.html">WorldWideWiki</a>:<a href="YpsilantiEyeball.html">YpsilantiEyeball</a>:<a href="MarkDilley.html">MarkDilley</a>
      </p>

        The thing that will make my suggestion work is that it will be voluntary and extremely easy to implement, not require a central registry, will work with any number of wikis, will seek only pages which exist (or the wiki list as existing), linkages can be separately configured, one may keep a list of all pages of interest on all wikis of interest and ignore all others. It also will allow the checking of what wikis have a page <a href="MarkDilley.html">MarkDilley</a> and will not generate a 404 because if the page does not exist on a given wiki, the wiki will not appear as a choice.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think because of the nature of those who frequent wikis and the reluctance to submit to some centralized access point, together with the fact that this system can be implemented, immediately upon two systems agreeing to the arrangement and can grow to any number. Each wiki can specify files, logo and prefix for all others to use in accessing its files.
        Just as wikis can have a robots.txt file, they could also implement an interwiki.txt file which would be those pages available for access.

        I hope <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> can be enhanced to use <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> links, especially <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, as it serves to enhance contents of this site, assuming it can be done non-obstructively and use non-<a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> entries. This complements the use of <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a> too. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
