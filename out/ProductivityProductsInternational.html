        Founded by <a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a> and <a href="TomLove.html">TomLove</a>. Also employed Kurt Schmucker and Geoff Pascoe among others.  PPI was the original bootstrapped and profitable software services company which earned enough to pay for the first few versions of <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> to be built.  When "professional management" arrived along with a venture capital investment, the company immediately started to loose money and tried to transform itself into a products company.  Tom ultimately left <a href="StepStone.html">StepStone</a> (the new name for PPI) because he wanted to radically lower the price for the Objective-C compiler and to return to profitability through generic object-oriented services.
