        Know The Rule
      </h1>
      <p>
        Often people break the rules because they don't know the rules.  G.K. Chesterton said that <em>If something is worth doing, it is worth doing badly.</em>
        which is very true since you have to do something not so well before you can do it well.  But to break the rules well you must do it with insight.  A skilled artist can break the rules in ways that go beyond the intention of the rules and achieve a new level of creativity.  This is what <a href="ColorOutsideTheLines.html">ColorOutsideTheLines</a> is all about.  If you don't know the rule to begin with, then you are like the <a href="SorcerersApprentice.html">SorcerersApprentice</a> and PlayingWithFire just to mix metaphors.  --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>
