        Ground Breaking Languages
      </h1>
      <p>
        One category of <a href="SoftwareExpertsIpersonallyRespect.html">SoftwareExpertsIpersonallyRespect</a> is inventors of truly new programming languages. This page lists a few languages and inventors. This page is part of the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>'s <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these are not languages anyone would want to ever use again, but they represented new ways of looking at how to interact with computers. Especially considered in historical context, each of the languages and language creators listed here had a unique insight that changed the way we thought about programming.

        <dd>Developed at RAND Corporation and the Carnegie Institute of Technology from about 1956. IPL included features intended to support programs that could perform general problem solving, including lists, associations, schemas (frames), dynamic memory allocation, data types, recursion, associative retrieval, functions as arguments, generators (streams), and cooperative multitasking. Newell had the role of language specifier/application programmer, Shaw was the system programmer and Simon took the role of application programmer/user. [Wikipedia]</dd>

[Note on "widely used": there is a thin line between a glorified assembler with a powerful macro processor, and a real programming language. Systems that allowed you to write Fortran-like expressions existed before. But they were always tied to a specific machine architecture: FORTRAN was the first language that really went beyond assembly in that it gave source-to-source compatibility between different platforms.] The main contribution of Fortran was that it could produce code as tight (or tighter) than that produced by hand, convincing the computing community of the practicality of high-level languages. </dd>

Traditional logical and relational expressions were recast into these new semantics; the traditional uses still work as in other languages, but broader and more versatile usage became possible.  The motivation for all of this was to produce a cleaner, more unified language with the string-processing power of SNOBOL [<a href="SnobolLanguage.html">SnobolLanguage</a>]; the result was a language that exposed the backtracking and goal-seeking behavior for use beyond string matching.

        <dd>	A language designed & mandated by the U.S. military. (Yes, Virginia, it's true.)  It was one of the first (the first? pls correct me...) with exception handling, generics, constraints,  multi-tasking (just try to do _that_ on MS-DOS!) plus a slew of other features that I forget. Ada is strongly typed.  It was hard as hell to write a govt "validated" Ada compiler and those programming teams who did actually achieve the coveted "MIL-STD 1815A Validated" title were talented indeed.  In the end Ada was just a stepping stone for other more mature (and better thought out) languages.  Ada pushed the art of compiler development significantly.  I'll also bet that Ada was one of the first compilers ever to be rated a "schedule B commodity" by the US, which meant it was a controlled piece of technology that couldn't be sent to Eastern bloc countries without special permission.  As for being groundbreaking, C++ borrows a lot from Ada, and Java might someday too.

        <dd>The original one (John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz) <em>(...from FORTRAN, claim some)</em> The first language to make strings as easy to handle as numbers, and for many programmers, their first language.  Remarkably easy to understand.</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Q:</strong> Did BASIC introduce the idea of mandatory line numbers? This had a dual effect - it lowered the entry barrier for GOTO oriented programming, since the labels were there already, and it allowed computed GOTOs and GOSUBs (though I don't think all linenumbered BASIC dialects supported those). <em>they did not, but there was also ON..GOSUB</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>A:</strong> IIRC, in the original Dartmouth BASIC destinations of GOTOs required numeric labels (as in Fortran). The line-number nastiness evolved with interactive time-sharing systems, which required that every line be numbered in order to facilitate editing. For example, on your first pass typing in a program, lines might be automatically numbered in increments of 10. Then, if you discovered you had to insert a statement between lines 100 and 110, you could type '105' into the system and, hey presto, whatever followed was inserted between lines 100 and 110. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               {The numbered line labels also made cross-platform editing easier because line numbers were used to indicate which line to replace. Users didn't have to learn a new input mechanism per brand.}

        <dt>Delphi/ Object Pascal (Anders Hejlsberg)</dt>
        <dd>In the mid 90s, Object Pascal and its overarching IDE, Delphi, inspired the world for a short time and founded many of the underlying design principles that would eventually surface in the subtantially more-popular C# programming language (also Anders Hejlsberg).</dd>

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Essentially an object oriented upgrade to Turbo Pascal with strong types, Object Pascal differed from its peers, such as Visual Basic, Paradox, Power Builder, and C++ which struggled to provide appropriate tools and class libraries for implementing modern GUI interfaces and database access. Rapid Application Development (RAD) was the buzz word of the time, and Delphi showed how strong types were essential to building large-scale applications quickly.  A truly compiled language requiring no run-time libraries or interpreters, it compiled in a fraction of the time of C or C++ compilers due to the modular design of its language.  It is currently in its 19th revision since Delphi 1.0 was released for Windows 3.1 and now supports Mac OSX, x64, and some open source cross platform variants have surfaced including Free Pascal and Lazarus.  Object Pascal introduced the "Property" keyword (which abstracts calls to getters and setters) and is still absent from C++ and Java.  Going beyond simple properties, Object Pascal introduced Indexed Properties which are abstracted arrays and supports multiple named indexers per class definition (which C# still does not support).  It also introduced "Published" level visibility for interacting with modern GUI design tools, and virtual constructors which make it easier to implement class factories.  Generics, Native Unicode strings, and operator overloading were implemented in later revisions, but many regard the language to be neglected/dead since it's chief architect, Anders Hejlsberg, was lured away, along with several other key developers from Borland, to join Microsoft in the late 90's.</dd>

        <dd>Question: Is Perl's so-called "<a href="AutoVivification.html">AutoVivification</a>" a Perl original?  If not, I'd definitely nominate whichever language did first have this feature.  (I'll add a page with an <a href="AutoVivification.html">AutoVivification</a> example.)  <em>Perl's emphasis on getting real-world tasks done with a minimum of effort, at the expense of elegance, feels to me like a real paradigm shift, but I am not that familiar with the history of programming languages.</em> Also, is it groundbreaking that the language is "idiomatic" -- that the syntax is so extremely flexible that you can try to map your thinking into Perl almost directly? For example, think about all the ways you can structure an if statement: with "if" or "unless", with the conditional before or after the expression. It felt a little groundbreaking when I realized the implications of that.  <em>First decent attempt at a context sensitive treatment of variables? First language to try to incorporate all language features known to mankind?  (At the time, most new languages took one new idea and thrashed it to death.  In fact, most of the languages being worshiped on this page just added one new feature then focused so hard on that as to be unusable for real work.  Whereas the work horse languages are shoved down here in the also-rans.  ;-)  And who says perl can't be elegant?  </em> Question: What about perl's influence on Regular Expressions? or having hashes as one of the three main primitive types? If visicalc is on the list for being the first spreadsheet language, perl should be on the list because pretty much every modern web language yanked features from perl or developed restrictions as a reaction to perl (like python).</dd>

        <dt>REBOL [<a href="RebolLanguage.html">RebolLanguage</a>] (<a href="CarlSassenrath.html">CarlSassenrath</a>)</dt>
        <dd>A multi-paradigm (symbolic, functional, OO) <em>messaging</em> language; designed for the semantic exchange of information between people and machines. Draws some concepts and features from other languages: Duality of code and data (Lisp), complete extensibility (Forth), raw usability and light syntax in a functional language (Logo). It is a meta-language like Forth, but with full reflective capabilities (it is a meta-circular language). Supports 40+ datatypes, including things like <em>email</em>, <em>url</em>, <em>money</em>, <em>pair</em>, and more. These are not classes or objects, they are native types recognized directly by their lexical form. In support of the messaging concept, REBOL contains a function called <em>parse</em> which you can use to build dialects (embedded languages). <em>Parse</em>, itself, uses a  BNF-like dialect to specify grammars and you can use any of REBOL's datatypes as tokens to be recognized. The concept of pseudo-types, different than inheritance, is unique as well (AFAIK).</dd>

SNOBOL was intended to be, among other things, a better COMIT (in a sense similar to that in which Stroustrup says C++ was intended to be a better C).</em></dd>

However, SQL was highly influent. It put relational "on the map". There is also QBE. <em>An interesting competitor to SQL near its birth was called Business System 12. It is reminiscent of functional programming in nature, making it easier to parse, dissect, and add to in manageable chunks IMO. See </em><a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a><em> </em>Given the near universal usage of SQL, it must have broken some ground... First language give primacy to data?

           Dr. Codd's query language precursor was called "Alpha". I don't know if there is a single relational query language that was by itself "groundbreaking". Alpha was rather mathematical in nature, with "Englishness" gradually being applied to subsequent experimental languages. It appears that it was an evolution, with Alpha, QUEL, ISBL, and <a href="BusinessSystemTwelve.html">BusinessSystemTwelve</a> influencing each other or later query languages until the industry settled on SQL (for good or bad).
