        Free As In Sex
      </h1>
      <p>
        Similar to <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a>, but more dangerous. Often loaded with viruses.
        Contrast with <a href="FreeAsInSpeech.html">FreeAsInSpeech</a>.

      <p>
        As sex involves the open exchange of (genetic) code it may well be considered the first example of <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        No one who has ever successfully exchanged genetic code would agree that there is anything "free" about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is little if any exchange of genetic code in sex. However there is mutual contribution to a (soon to be) third party.
