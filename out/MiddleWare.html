        Middleware is the <em>middle-man</em> that sits between two or more hulking systems which are used to being the center of attention.  The middleware takes data from one system, and gives it to the other system in a way it likes.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is more complicated than it first appears.

        Middleware can follow many different models.  You can have <a href="MessageOrientedMiddleware.html">MessageOrientedMiddleware</a>, <a href="ObjectBroker.html">ObjectBroker</a>, InterfaceEngine...  
      </p>
      <p>
        The leading middleware solution are <a href="TransactionProcessingMonitor.html">TransactionProcessingMonitor</a>s, with <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> <a href="CustomerInformationControlSystem.html">CustomerInformationControlSystem</a> taking up a third of that market share, followed by number 2 <a href="TuxedoMonitor.html">TuxedoMonitor</a> (12%), and Oracle is in the third place.

        In game development, <a href="MiddleWare.html">MiddleWare</a> refers to third party software libraries and modules which sit between the hardware's OS and the game programmers code. Until recently, <a href="MiddleWare.html">MiddleWare</a> was a dirty word in game development. But the popularity of <a href="MiddleWare.html">MiddleWare</a> libraries such as <a href="RenderWare.html">RenderWare</a>, MathEngine, Havok, and so on have changed things. <a href="MiddleWare.html">MiddleWare</a> usually includes tool sets that enable cross platform conversions from source data. <a href="MiddleWare.html">MiddleWare</a> is not usually used to describe operating system extensions such as DirectX for Windows or OpenGL for other operating systems.

        <em>I am not sure whether it is really </em><a href="DistributedComputing.html">DistributedComputing</a>. Probably a more appropriate term is CollaborativeComputing? The first term to me means designing a single application system that is distributed in implementation, but the <a href="MiddleWare.html">MiddleWare</a> as I know it is there more to get value from integrating information from existing applications that may be on different platforms and technologies<em>. An example is </em><a href="BizTalk.html">BizTalk</a> which is part of <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> <a href="DistributedInternetArchitecture.html">DistributedInternetArchitecture</a>, but as a product it was delivered later. <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a>
