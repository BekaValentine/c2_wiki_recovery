        If we scale the notion of cell function to the level of <a href="CityBlock.html">CityBlock</a> s, using Energy 
        and Material
        output as analogous to gdp, their might be some calculation that suggests
        constraining people to only work, go to school, marry, dine, etc within a 
        certain radius by scheduling groups to act as gateways at intersection, 
        allowing cars to speed through pedestrian lights etc will create micro-economies
        that Directors of each cell control and "trade" between them, will increase the 
        gdp. But if the trade-off is dissention, lower quality of life, decreased
        mobility, loss of industries and freedom generally because people can't get to 
        their old job outside the district, the simulations should at least be discussed in 
        Parliament/Congress. Keeping sections on the local transit for enebriates might 
        also have some merit, some Cinemas do have seat-numbers assigned to tickets,
        but the motives, costs and benefits should be subject to written 
        ConcurrentVersionSystem.

        Art owns colours really, though various traditions assign different connotations
        to them for instance the ChurchOfEngland shows Purple/Blue, Ireland refers to
        Orange (as does the Telecoms). In magazines such as <a href="ScientificAmerican.html">ScientificAmerican</a> December

        AIDS-Resistant Genes" shows the virus as above, this should not be taken literally
        as an analogy for Religion or SolarSystem structure. In the same tome "Buliding 
        Doors into Cells shows gateways into cells as multicoloured, this positive 
        structure could be likened to certain symbols for the FiveCelestialBuddhas. The 
        Ocean is many nuances of Blue; Sunset a kind of Purple/Orange. In ComputerGraphics 
        there are different ways to represent colours as a UnitCube, RGB being one of 
        them. Even in teh the Center of the Galaxy, there must be Art.

        "The speed ... of the price level in the face of an inflationary gap exceeds the 
        speed of the downward adjustment in a recessionary gap" suggests that 
        EconomicCurves are almost like a strand of thread floating in a vast 
        EconomicSpace, with properties like "elasticity" and "inertia". Manipulable by 
        ActionAtADistance with a DataGlove. If one was to  give them names and 
        Anthropomorphize them, associate them with say a cyber-technician friend wearing 
        <a href="BlueTooth.html">BlueTooth</a>, then any random movement might skew the "thread". If the virtual

        If evil aliens brainwashed a group of nations to secretly mass produce human 
        EmbryoClones in deep underground bases accessible only by ZeroPointEnergy authenticated by them,
        thinking each nation could have it's own planet, but it turned out to be
        a case of "To Serve Man"; then in the aftermath of coming to their senses,
        it would be right to go to the UnitedNations and Seti with the problem.
        To get rid of them, egress the base using the last tribute credits and pretend
        they never existed would be against the GenevaConvention. ZeroPointEnergy and 
        other advanced physics concepts would be the purview of other species, though
        they might be put off by the fact we had dealt with the evil aliens instead of 
        them. Retribution might seriously be the result of ignoring SpaceLaw.

        If one hires an employee that happens to look like one's former friend, then the employee starts acting strangely, one goes to TheJusticeLeageOfAmerica who then says "what what?", it turns out they probably sent the employee in the first place because of fore-knowledge of QuantumInventions. The employee is dismissed and one then deals with the FantasticFour - the JusticeLeague should then not be upset is one makes progess with one's QuantumOptical 3D invention. If other friends really do start communicating memetically through the movies abd ads, then large cranes mimic ExMen in front of one's habitues, unfortunate events then proliforaste you end up with SuperHeroes amok. This really does not serve Justice.

        cross oceans of time to get the real scoop. But if they then ascend to higher
        echelons to become almost famous, it might end up destabilizing society if there
        is no oversight. Propaganda controlling the media is not democratic. A business

        As technology progresses nations should manage the Earth as a grand enterprise.
        Each can have a sense of rulership regarding instances of Little Xs, Cafes and
        Embassies accross the globe, but if any particular one decided to really become
        the center of the spherical 'universe', the other collections might raise an
        objection. Monachies are kind of like the board, U.N. the executive, Presidents
        and PrimMinisters Manage.

        The interpretation of CellularAnalogues in which Chromosomes are isomorphic to Planets implies Titanic would match Mutations. Defining diffuseColor values for all the objects, one could Refactor the abstract Metaverse to look more like egg chambers in a Drosophila ovary, allowing heaven, hell, purgatory etc as well as reincarnation, orthogonal to the <a href="MultiVerse.html">MultiVerse</a>. Generally Olympic would be a regular Transposon, zooming closer.

        Watching the sunset from the GoldenGateBridge, hovering a QuarterCoin over the Presidio, we can imagine what if there really was a UnitedFederationOfPlanets, with legitimate ZeroPointEnergy.
        It could start small, like the GorbachevCenter. A corresponding locale in Paris,
        a room above or below a CoffeeShop. Crafts below and above ground could charge
        published rates according to:
      </p>
      <code>
        Air:    Q1 = 90-0.5*P1<br/>
        Sea:    Q2 = 35-0.25*P2<br/>
        Mantle: Q3 = 30-0.2*P3<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Permanent tunnels would be extra. The iPad shows:
      </p>
      <code>
        function air_charge_Q1($P1)<br/>
        {<br/>
        $r = 90-0.5*$P1;<br/>
        return $r;<br/>
        }<br/>

        A lot of people like PeanutButter. Though if they go to deal with 
        peanut-butter-vendors, they should not be run over by buses. Especially
        if they are invited to do the deal. Conversely, people should not jump out
        in front of peanut-butter-vendors should they invent new techniques and 
        <a href="IntellectualProperty.html">IntellectualProperty</a>, in order to create issues to interfere with bringing
        the invention to production (innovation). Posers sent as FlashMobs colour-coding

        allocation of sections of the local transit an issue) constitute

        light, causing them to go around into the path of a non-stopping bus is collusion 
        to commit "accidents". Just when one is following Directives. to May be that 
        AlienTechnology landed hard on the SuperHero infrastructure, but to then use those 
        tecniques for mass destruction, is not being like Oppenheimer and Turing, it is 
        like being what they were resisting. To promote chasing the inventors social 
        network and IP, while saying elsewhere the tech won't ever be used, in the same 
        breath promoting similar alien yet socially-negative tech, might end up breaking 
        down the
        Legal structure of society. 1984 essentially is a crituque on Stalinism and a 
        reflection on the conditions of WW2, to amplify such phenomena deliberately is to

        <em>Listening to a rehearsal of "Right makes Might", looking forward to returning to venues nearby serving exotic dishes while sitar-players strum in window-sills to the tinkle of wine-glasses; juxtaposed with the utter silence prior to arriving here; one revisits in ones mind the acoustics upstairs in the hotel-room, the last time one was in town. Having heard the strange communication making noises traversing in parallel from coordinates (10,10,20) as if it concurred with the lipid-reptilian hypothesis, then a close boom at (5,1,3), it seems, though it could have other interpretations, that they really did settle for taking a comet every 2 years _away_ from the Solar System.

        A PrologGraphConverter can take a <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a> of the form of php: 
      </p>
      <code>
        $G = "V={vert1(v1),vert2(v2),...} <br/>
        E={(v1,v2),...}"; <br/>

      <p>
        Converting it to <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a>:

      <code>
