        Common Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        A commonly found problem. (That was difficult, wasn't it?)
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="CommonProblem.html">CommonProblem</a> often masquerades as an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The giveaway is that in a <a href="CommonProblem.html">CommonProblem</a> the bad situation is described as the <em>problem</em>, in a true <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> it is described as the <em>supposed solution</em>

        <em>I would appreciate further expansion on this because I currently can see little of value in this page. Can you give some examples?</em>

      <p>
        I see some so-called <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s where the description is just a problem statement, and when I try to reformulate the description into the <a href="AntiPatternTemplate.html">AntiPatternTemplate</a> I'm really struggling, because they just don't seem to fit. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CornCob.html">CornCob</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="BoatAnchor.html">BoatAnchor</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TheGrandOldDukeOfYork.html">TheGrandOldDukeOfYork</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
