        Design By Analogy
      </h1>
      <p>
        Design By Analogy is the use of examples to spark ideas on what a solution to a problem might be. AnalogicalReasoning is often at work when people are being creative. This involves relating elements of the problem-at-hand to elements of solved problems and gaining insights into possible solutions from exising solutions in the same or dissimilar domains.

Being like Atoms AlienEntities would be like the PeriodicTable cubed, you could model it by transforming the existing ones to 6*3, though the way intelligent species relayte is probably civilized compared to treating species within our own plane.
