        Writing Faster Than Thinking

      <p>
        Usually caused by a <a href="ConditionedResponse.html">ConditionedResponse</a>, the author of such remarks has not really thought (his) response through.  It is not uncommon for such remarks to include a logical inconsistency, or at least a statement embarrassing to the author. Consider the following example from <a href="LecturingToIdiots.html">LecturingToIdiots</a>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>More likely the lecturer is an intolerant blowhard who accepts no ideas but his own. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>People are diverse. Get used to it. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Lecturer in the given context means any person attempting to pass information via words - i.e. the vast majority of people. 
        The following is based on (his) "logic":
        if A is the author of the remark,
        since A is a lecturer, A is most likely an intolerant blowhard who accepts no ideas but his own.
        This seems to be demonstrated by his last sentence - "Get used to it."
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>It seems unlikely that the author would purposely denigrate himself.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Note that the mantra "People are diverse." seems to fly in the face of the first sentence as well.
      </p>

        Upon discovery that one is <a href="WritingFasterThanThinking.html">WritingFasterThanThinking</a>, it is best to recant immediately and make apologies quickly.

        It would seem lecturer is too broad a term for variable A above. <a href="LecturingToIdiots.html">LecturingToIdiots</a> denotes a specific variety of lecturer - which specifically was the object of the assertion found in the <a href="WritingFasterThanThinking.html">WritingFasterThanThinking</a> in question.
