        A good book of little tricks for making fiction come alive. I like it because it simplifies writing- it tells me a bunch of things I don't have to do, and suggests a few new things that I can do in simple ways.

        For example, BeginInTheMiddle says to write the first two chapters, then switch them, fixing up whatever few words need it. As a reader this tends to jump you right into action, then quickly get the necessary background. As a writer, you don't worry about it, you just write the first two chapters.
