        Coding Cost Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am currently thinking that core to XP is their cost model of different ways of coding. Two people are looking at some code, and they think - that's not "good" enough, so they refactor to make it "better".  To pull that off, the people on the team need to have some concept of what is "better". Without a coding cost model, they would simply DTSSTCPW and leave it at that.  Why don't they leave it at that, and what do they decide to change it to?  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        <em>When you say "cost model", are you referring to the cost of making a change, or just to the model that lets us say X is better than Y?  --rj</em>

        "X is better than Y."  Thanks, Alistair

      <p>
        e.g.
      </p>
      <code>
        P a. P b. ->  P.c  where P.c = P a. P b.  (combine two calls into one)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        but what about
      </p>
      <code>
        [exp] ifTrue: [exp2] ifFalse: [exp3]   ?<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        are there some conditions where you refactor to polymorph?
        thanks.

        <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s tend to be high cost. Removing them is good.
