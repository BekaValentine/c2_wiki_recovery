        Java Distributed Transaction
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DistributedTransaction.html">DistributedTransaction</a> is hard. And <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is not easy either. Apparently sometimes, somewhere, someone felt it worthwhile to implement <a href="JavaDistributedTransaction.html">JavaDistributedTransaction</a>. I hope there will be some good stories coming through, for purposes of mutual education.

           Note being an outsider, I thought <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> and <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a> are synonyms of sorts. And I have not seen much Java mentioned in EnterpriseComputing outside of <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a>. Maybe some analogy with <a href="RestArchitecturalStyle.html">RestArchitecturalStyle</a> of <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>, something that is not well known (compared to SOAP), but does the job well?

      <p>
        <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> is a federation of several specifications, one of which is the JavaTransactionApi (JTA).  So you don't need EJB to do distributed transactions.    <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a> is a component model that also has implicit transaction demarcation.   You do need a JTA-based transaction coordinator, which usually comes with a J2EE server.  JTA doesn't re-invent the transaction wheel, it's just a binding to the XA standard model and re-uses CorbaIiop as one of the accepted wire protocols.
