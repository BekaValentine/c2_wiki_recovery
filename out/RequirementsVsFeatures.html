        Requirements Vs Features
      </h1>
      <p>
        In deciding what to do next, what the first step is, one must consider requirements in order to implement desired features. A feature is more or less encapsulated in a general statement meant to define what a user might expect. A requirement is a more specific and concrete statement to define what a programmer must consider in the coding of and actualization of the desired features.

        <em>This is part of the separation of </em><a href="CriticalSuccessFactor.html">CriticalSuccessFactor</a> requirements from "feature" requirements. If you know what the product absolutely <em>must</em> do in order to be successful then you can separate that from the "nice to have" features that won't make or break the product.<em></em>
