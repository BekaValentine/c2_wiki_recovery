        On Redundancy
      </h1>
      <p>
        You can look for <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> and you will see it appear in many pages.
        So why is this statement so powerfull? Cause of its <strong>redundancy</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In real life you see also a lot of redundancy; e.g. DNA/RNA is encoded in a very redundant way and just cause its redundancy it's stable  makes life possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also a lot of information in the internet is there in a rudundant way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even the same page will be stored in many many places(in cache)
        , again and again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks to redundancy errors can be repaired.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now the real question:
      </p>
      <p>
        What way can you make use of redundancy in programming code itself?
        What way can you make selfrepair happen? (e.g. you have a file mutulated file, what way can you nmake it repair itself)
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not know the answers, but I just want to drop the question.

        <em>Search google for "error correction".  There are many different error correction schemes.</em>
