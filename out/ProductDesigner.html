        Product Designer
      </h1>
      <p>
        The role of Product Designer is to make coherent the set of stories
        from a vast set of customers. This role is important when doing
        products where one in-house customer can not represent the target
        market.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, the Product Designer plays the role of Customer in XP.
        The Product Designer may, however, come from the customer's problem
        domain. Or, the Product Designer may be a design expert who steeps
        themselves in customer contact. The trade-off is which risk to take:
        teach a customer to design, or teach a designer about the customer
        needs. (This last point came from an <a href="InterviewWithKent.html">InterviewWithKent</a>).
