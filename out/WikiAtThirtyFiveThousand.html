           days after <a href="WikiAtThirtyThousand.html">WikiAtThirtyThousand</a> pages, we will have surpassed the 35,000 pages mark. During that period, a slow but steady rate of about 15 pages per week were created (net). During that period, we have seen the coming and going of hundreds if not thousands of participants.

        We in fact have no idea how many people read these pages. I have been active here now for a long time and I always in my editing try to bear in mind the needs of readers who may be able to find information through the richness of links. I often gain new knowledge while doing that and I am grateful to those who have shared their thoughts in the past.  -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        Perhaps we should be asking ourselves if the pages already here have more or less value than they did when the C2 was at 20K, 25K, or however many pages. I find that the Category Rant pages remain as useful or useless as they were a half dozen years ago, but other categories (documentation, process, operating systems, etc.) continue to gain value. It should be the aim of all Wikizens to increase value, whether by reduction, addition, or editing. Is it not so? -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>
