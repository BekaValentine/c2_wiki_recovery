        Grounding In Some Simple Concepts
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is more exploratorium or compendium than dictionary or encyclopedia. So it needs <em>grounding in some simple concepts</em> related to PatternsAndSoftwareDevelopment, to appeal to more people - even if it's a pain to more advanced participants. So let's not be 'hyper' about WikiIsNotADictionary links.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important to refrain from deluging <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> with links to irrelevant topics, but when discusing advanced or BleedingEdge topics, we need links to the more simple stuff. People who don't have much SoftwareExpertise or aren't as <a href="BuzzwordCompliant.html">BuzzwordCompliant</a> as the general <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> also visit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not every Wiki page should be a complete dissertation, aimed at a specific PeerGroup with advanced understanding of the jargon many of us take for granted. So why not create TutorialWords, semi-authoritative Wiki pages for less advanced readers striving for MoreData?
      </p>
      <p>
        The next time you create a page with information needed for grasping the whole picture and someone throws on a WikiIsNotADictionary, refer them here with something like:
        <em>Some of the links on this page and this page itself may be required by those requiring </em><a href="GroundingInSomeSimpleConcepts.html">GroundingInSomeSimpleConcepts</a><em></em>

        This Wiki is a community; communities, by definition, have their own jargon. It is not intended to appeal to a wide audience, and there is a certain expectation that community members will have the same tacit knowledge. A thoughtful new <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> will try to join the community by learning the community norms. A community *can* shift in response to change, but will always have "insiders" and "outsiders". After a while, the former outsiders may become insiders, at which point the jargon will be second nature - until the next newbie comes along. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        Precisely. The means for that learning can be provided easily - otherwise, <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> becomes a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>, accessible only to those with OlympicLevelExpertise. And I'm not suggesting that people create TutorialWords as a glossary, but that in the normal process of Wiki page creation some page components should be on their own pages, so that explanations occur <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This will speed up the process by which the "newbie" will become a "veteran" and contribute valuable pages for all of us to enjoy. I'd like to see participation at all levels, rather than a Community of Technical Exclusiveness. The entry bar should not be lowered all the way to the ground, but it shouldn't be set at Olympic levels either.
