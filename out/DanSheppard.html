      <p>
        <a href="DanSheppard.html">DanSheppard</a> is trying to contribute to <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> as his Computer Science PhD writeup allows. He thinks he's quite good at content, but is really crappy at spelling and punctuation, and doesn't mind being corrected as long as people don't accuse him of being lazy, or claim that spelling checkers are the answers to prayers.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment he's done some random edits and tried to start a page on the identity of the English Midlands, <a href="IdentityOfEnglishMidlands.html">IdentityOfEnglishMidlands</a> and on product colour and language <a href="ProductColourAsaConsumingJargon.html">ProductColourAsaConsumingJargon</a>, and <a href="WhyIamNotConscious.html">WhyIamNotConscious</a> which is kind of obvious, as is <a href="DoLanguagesChange.html">DoLanguagesChange</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        He'll keep a close watch on <a href="UniverseOfDiscourse.html">UniverseOfDiscourse</a> because it's to do with his work.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is also wondering why he is typing in the third person and wonders if it's to do with the phrase <em>edit </em><a href="DanSheppard.html">DanSheppard</a><em> with which this edit was heralded?</em>

        You can email me at <a href="mailto:dans@chiark.greenend.org.uk">mailto:dans@chiark.greenend.org.uk</a> if you like, as long as you're not trying to sell me something, or trying to make me rich quick.

        Thank you for writing
        <a href="ProductColourAsaConsumingJargon.html">ProductColourAsaConsumingJargon</a>
        . I found it interesting.
        I wonder how that relates to products that are typically entirely white
        (kitchen appliances, washing machines, etc) ?
        I wonder what it implies about people who dress entirely in black ?
