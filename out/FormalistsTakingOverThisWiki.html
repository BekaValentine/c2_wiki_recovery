        Formalists Taking Over This Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        This wiki originally seemed to be full of rebellious extreme programmers who rebelled against form, specifications, strong type systems, <a href="TopDown.html">TopDown</a>, <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> and all that <em>bad</em> stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        (The <a href="FormalistsTakingOverThisWiki.html">FormalistsTakingOverThisWiki</a> kind of reminds me when the <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>'s once kind of took over this wiki, who had not everything in common with the original community here.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, we see that a lot of the pure extreme programmers are not here - they've left, or they are busy, dormant, etc.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Other times, we see several (reasonable) people who seem to combine <em>both</em> form <em>and</em> other extreme programming methods into their development (form and inform?). i.e. people that see <a href="TheBestOfBothWorlds.html">TheBestOfBothWorlds</a> instead of being purely biased and purely rebellious.
      </p>
      <p>
        The sad issue is - some of the inform (can you even call it that) vs form wars is just partial <a href="ViolentAgreement.html">ViolentAgreement</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Formalists, should not be a <em>separate political party</em> from those other people (informal people?). A lot of the formalists do testing and experimentation, just as the extreme programmers do - and a lot of the extreme programmers do formal specifications indirectly (whether they like to believe it or not). 
      </p>
      <p>

        Wait a year or so and they will be replaced or superceded by a new and different zealot(s) that use similar discussion techniques and insist on <a href="OneTrueWay.html">OneTrueWay</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, I think you may be missing part of the point above. Formalists aren't zealots. A zealot is one who calls them a zealot just for mentioning the word Form as if it is a swear word (rebel! rebel! no form! no way!).</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Formalists</em>' who have a </strong>clue<strong> (and who are worth their salt) - are not using </strong><a href="OneTrueWay.html">OneTrueWay</a>. Your <a href="OneTrueWay.html">OneTrueWay</a> appears to be call everyone a zealot who uses more form, math, and science.  Consider your zealotry and hypocrisy.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Scientists and mathematicians that are formal do not use one true experiment or </em><a href="OneTrueWay.html">OneTrueWay</a>. Consider that formalists do not avoid testing (even that's what is claimed). Consider that they do experiments, in addition to <em>formal specifications</em>. They fill in values too. It's not just the non-formalists who test and experiment (i.e. extreme programmers, bottom up programmers).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Formalists do bottom up </em>'and<strong> top down programming, too - despite the myth and religious zealotry from people like </strong><a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> who think that <strong>only Lisp programmers</strong> and other similar <strong>weenies</strong> use <a href="BottomUp.html">BottomUp</a> techniques and testing. The people who are religiously and violently against the formal way, use <strong>formal techniques</strong> at some point too - such as programmer documentation, sentences and paragraphs (which have form), spell checkers (which also have form), etc.<em> </em>

        I often incorporate an isValid() method in my class that verifies the class meets its invariant. And I call it in the unit tests. Don't agile classes have invariants? Am I straying from The Agile Way? <a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a>
