        Product Description That Isa Commercial And Nota Description
      </h1>
      <p>
        Typical of software companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        A description that is intended to be a commercial and not really describe
        the thing. Such a description usually uses a lot of buzzwords designed specifically with the product in mind. It also uses buzzwords and catch phrases
        like "revolutionizes","enterprise", "production quality" and "best-of-breed". 
      </p>

        The biggest transgressor is probably Brockschmidts book Inside Ole,
        which runs something like a thousand pages and is one great big commercial for OLE.

        The term coined by John Tibbets is "marketecture". [Tibbets, John. <strong>"IBM Enterprise Architectures: A Comparison of Vendor Initiatives."</strong> <em>Trends in Technology,</em> 1995.]

        <dd><em>"Marketecture uses an architectural-looking diagram, but the arrangement of the pieces has no real technical significance.  Marketectural charts are like a set of shelves that display products, components and standards to the consumer but do not represent how the software works...."</em></dd>

        Example product names:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Honeywell "Ultimate" computer.  <em>(A mini that was a pain to reboot, as it could only boot from its 9-track tape, not its hard drive!)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        On the other hand, there have been some local names that were really honest:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Expensive Typewriter" = one of the first word processing programs.
        </li>
      </ul>
