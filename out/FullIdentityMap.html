        Full Identity Map
      </h1>
      <p>
        When using a full identity map, a reference is kept for all of the objects read in by all of the clients even after the reference is no longer needed. This can impose memory requirements on the server.  A possible solution to this problem is for the server system to periodically instruct <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> to flush the cache. This can be done on a per instance or class basis, or for the identity map as a whole.
