        I have known about this site for quite a while, but I was very juvenile when I first used it. Then I went into a non-technology hiatus for a time & now I am trying to learn more <a href="WebDesign.html">WebDesign</a> along with some interest in TeleCommunications / Networking. I'm also trying to know some <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> / <a href="MachineCode.html">MachineCode</a>. While I have those interests, I also have a very strong enjoyment for Political Science & Philosophy. I am from the Boston area (south of the city).

        To whomever is editing my user page: Why do you have to revert it to that old edit? While there may have been some things imperfect about my page, you should just leave a message here first & then maybe you could justify your changes. ~ <a href="SamDisanto.html">SamDisanto</a>

        <em>Your </em><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> was spoofed by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> at some point, and therefore the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> reverted it automatically.  Lucky I caught it this time and stopped it.  I suggest you delete your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie to prevent this in the future.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        Thank you, Dave. Is there a reason such bots exists? Because the old reversion of my page was much worse. ~ <a href="SamDisanto.html">SamDisanto</a>

        <em>The </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> exists to enforce a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> on banned individuals like <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>.  Spoofing your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> is a way that <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> has attempted to get around the <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So am I better off not using the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie from <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wikiOptions">http://c2.com/cgi/wikiOptions</a> and instead editing without it? (like I am now for this very message) ~ <a href="SamDisanto.html">SamDisanto</a>
