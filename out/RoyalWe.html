        The <a href="AbsentProxy.html">AbsentProxy</a> pattern, where the proxy is your boss.

      <p>
        The term "Royal 'we'" refers to the tradition where monarchs speak on behalf of their country (and cronies) by always saying "we", never "I". As in "we are not amused". Speaking with such a monarch, you can never tell if they refer to their private interests (perish the thought!), or to the consensus of their court, or to the will of their constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term is also used when abusing the first-person plural in a consulting/coaching situation. For example, when extending guidance to a remote colleague who might not yet recognize your grade, send them an e-mail telling them to do something, and CC both your and his boss.

        Whether this technique only serves to piss them off and incite rebellion remains to be seen.
