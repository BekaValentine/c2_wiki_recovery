        Lord Of The Rings Part One Criticisms

        They completely screwed up Lord of the Rings, corrupted the story, Peter Jackson is a JACKASS. He failed to read the book himself, he missed the art of Tolkein's story-telling and proceeded to make the movie into a comic book; he should be tarred and shot.

        It sucks, since when did Arwen rescue Frodo and carry him to Rivendell after he got stabbed by the ringwraith??

        And the hobbits' <strong>feet</strong>!  He got them so totally <em>wrong!</em>  In a display of total sloppiness and butchery, that hack Jackson thought that giving hobbits long feet would be "good enough".  But he even messed up <em>this important detail</em>, and thereby messed up the whole story!  On film, Frodo's feet appeared to be 18" long; when <em>anyone</em> who has bothered to read the book knows that they are 20" long!  Sheesh!  A budget of several hundred million dollars, and he can't even get <em>that</em> right?  <a href="PlanNineFromOuterSpace.html">PlanNineFromOuterSpace</a> was better than <em>this</em> dreck!

        I liked it, but I don't think Jackson realized the importance of Tom Bombadil wrt the character development of the ring. --dab
