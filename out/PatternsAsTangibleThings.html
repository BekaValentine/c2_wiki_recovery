        Patterns As Tangible Things
      </h1>
      <p>
        Maybe the Wiki community can help me out; I've run into somewhat of an interesting dilemma (at least, to me).
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been involved in a bit of 'scoping' lately, of tools and processes.  Being more development focused, sometimes the world of the "Big A" Technical Architect can baffle me to no end.  One of the interesing topics lately, as I've been playing with <a href="RationalRose.html">RationalRose</a> and <a href="TogetherControlCenter.html">TogetherControlCenter</a>, is the notion of <a href="PatternsAsTangibleThings.html">PatternsAsTangibleThings</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do I mean by this?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Having the Architect (and a few consultants) discuss 'catalouging patterns' that are used, and espousing the view of 'evolving your business around patterns'.
        </li>
        <li>
           The salesmen/consultants, etc. being fascinated by (and almost demanding) than any tool they use have "pattern support".  I toyed with implementing a <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> pattern by clicking a button in Together, and to be honest, I'm not sure how such tools would really help in application design.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In my own thinking, a pattern is a <em>strategy</em> for solving a common problem.  (For example, implementing a Factory pattern to allow access to multiple databases.)  A pattern (and the varied pattern resources) are not an 'end' to a means, but rather an idea to be developed toward a particular solution, defined at <em>development time</em> after deciding on general strategies for laying out the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        While sitting in on some of these conversations, the discussion of "applying patterns" floats around, everyone around the table nods intelligently, and I have to ask the question; "What is the actual problem we are trying to solve?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I usually get dirty looks at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I'm curious about:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What does the <a href="WikiMind.html">WikiMind</a> think about the use of <a href="PatternsAsTangibleThings.html">PatternsAsTangibleThings</a>, such as tool support?  Am I dismissing the idea a little too easily?
        </li>
        <li>
           How does the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> use patterns, particularly in scoping and designing applications?
        </li>
        <li>
           Am I far too jaded in my thinking about applying patterns?  Have I completely missed the point?
        </li>
        <li>
           And, am I crazy for sitting in some of these meetings thinking "What are you people actually talking about?"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've discovered that I can be a bit pragmatic and skeptical about such things.  The curse of being trained as a scientist first, I guess....
