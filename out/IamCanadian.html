        "I Am Canadian" a TV commercial campaign for the <em>Molson Canadian</em> brand of beer. Lately, one particular commercial has been extremely successful.

        The commercial pokes well-meaning fun at our neighbours to the south, and has become a huge hit almost overnight. It strongly irritates Canadians who prefer our traditional lack of blatant patriotism and Americans with no sense of humour.  <em>On first reading I parsed this as "irritates Canadians who prefer ... Americans with no sense of humour.</em>

        On a general scale of nationalist propaganda, I rate this a 3 out of 10. But, it came out during the NHL playoff season. Toronto Maple Leafs vs. the New Jersey Devils... Sold a lot of beer, I bet. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
