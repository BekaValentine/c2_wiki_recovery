        I guess the ones I read the most are <em>C/C++ Users' Journal</em> and <em>C Vu - The Journal of the ACCU</em>.  -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        The May/June 2003 issue of <a href="IeeeSoftware.html">IeeeSoftware</a> had a lot of rich content about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (I think because it seems to be affecting the world of the <a href="WaterfallModel.html">WaterfallModel</a> proponents). -- <a href="JohnSumsion.html">JohnSumsion</a>

        When I was a Mac sysadmin 5 years ago, I read some Mac magazines (mostly when travelling) for general information, I stopped when WWW began to have more - and more timely - information than print magazines. I have also read DDJ semi-regularly, since I first read about Tiny-C and other <em>interesting</em> stuff in DDJ at a technical library 15-20 years ago. Same with Byte. I think the most recent issue of DDJ I've bought was the May or April one. I noticed that it no longer had a squared back and seemed a lot thinner than usual. Times must be hard in the computer magazine business. I also read Unix Review (Randall Schwartz had a column IIRC), and was appalled when they printed more and more about integration with and migration to NT than about Unix. Finally they admitted to this and changed the name. I switched to <a href="SysAdmin.html">SysAdmin</a> and WebTechniques. WebTechniques became more and more business/marketing/"cool"/hype and less technique (when Lincoln Stein stopped as editor? When it became "new.architect"?), and I stopped. Software Development was fun when it was still Computer Language, and Journal of Object Oriented Programming is also missed. Currently, I buy the occasional <a href="SysAdmin.html">SysAdmin</a>, I have bought a couple of issues of Java Developers' Journal and XML Journal, but I find they contain far too much hype and far too little technical content, this seems to be general of the magazines available at Danish newsstands. Print magazines (be they US/UK/DE or even Danish) that I can find here in Denmark are generally worthless, it seems. Then of course there is CACM. The ACM library is far more useful to me, but CACM is OK. -- <a href="LasseHp.html">LasseHp</a>

        I enjoy the older publications, mostly from the 60s-80s. There's a lot of good stuff from conference proceedings and old editions of periodicals like CACM. I find new things to read from citations or links I see on the web, the <a href="LambdaTheUltimate.html">LambdaTheUltimate</a> site, or searches on <a href="CiteSeer.html">CiteSeer</a> and (when I had access) ACM's digital library. These are especially good sources if you pick up some interest in compilers, operating systems, programming languages, and that sort of thing. Truly a lifetime supply of interesting things to read on the bus to work. -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>

        ComputerLanguageMagazine, which sadly no longer exists. I believe it was purchased by <a href="DrDobbsJournal.html">DrDobbsJournal</a> and transmogrified into the much less interesting <a href="SoftwareDevelopmentMagazine.html">SoftwareDevelopmentMagazine</a>, probably to eliminate any semblance of competition. CLM's articles highlighted software development tools and techniques at a somewhat higher level of abstraction than DDJ's nuts-and-bolts bit twiddling. For a long time, CLM had a flagship series of articles on different programming languages, one in each issue. I especially liked these; it was a great way to see what other programming languages were out there and get a quick overview of their characteristics.

        I stuck with SDM for a while after the changeover, but found that fewer and fewer articles interested me. They tended to more about the development process and less about its tools.

        I think I have most of CLM's issues at home, although I wasn't quite a charter subscriber. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
