        Roomba Vacuum
      </h1>
      <p>
        Roomba is interesting because it's one of the first domestic house robots that approaches Jetson-style technology. It's AI in practice.

        My observations of a Roomba 440 robotic vacuum:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Doesn't seem to actually "map" the room, but rather use semi-random movement and multiple passes to be fairly thorough. Will miss some spots (but so do I when manual).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It should have an English readout in addition to beeps. Some of the beeps are ambiguous and the manual doesn't cover them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Gets stuck temporarily on up-ward "ramp" shapes. Doesn't seem to have a movement and/or tilt sensor beyond wheel movement.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Has a "stair" detector, but still gets confused by them sometimes, requiring intervention (makes "oh oh" sound). But yet to actually fall.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Not sure it's for a bigger family because it takes a while to complete its job. Somebody will likely need the target room in that time-frame for bigger families.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's a bit disconcerting how it bumps into things with an unpleasant thump. (Manual claims it has a scratch-free bumper.) I wonder if they could use laser triangulation to slow it down near obstacles. The bumping sometimes knocks over lightly-loaded garbage pails. Reading the web, some add felt strips to the edge.
        </li>
      </ul>
