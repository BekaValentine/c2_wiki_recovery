        The thing though about Free software projects is that sometimes they <em>don't</em> release often. I get irritated when I see <em>version 0.0.7pre48. Last Updated 12 May 1997</em> because the programmers want 0.0.8 to have every feature any piece of software could possibly have. -- <a href="GavinVanLelyveld.html">GavinVanLelyveld</a>
