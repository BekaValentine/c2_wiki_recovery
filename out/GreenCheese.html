        <strong>Okay.</strong> Guys, it <strong>is</strong> 2011, and the Green Cheese Wiki <strong>is</strong> completely dead.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An entry about it is here in <a href="WikiIndex.html">WikiIndex</a> <a href="http://wikiindex.org/GreenCheese">http://wikiindex.org/GreenCheese</a> where we never delete entries of wikis but keep them as part of <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a>. --<a href="ManorainjanHolzapfel.html">ManorainjanHolzapfel</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        May I suggest, then, that this page is a <a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a>? I know that <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a> is a favorite contributor around here, but he's more interested in getting his (somewhat insane) comic strip updated here than cleaning up messes like this.

        <a href="GreenCheese.html">GreenCheese</a> fans (fan?) if you're out there, we could use some assistance with hosting. Our present provider, zettai.net, while wonderfully accommodating and many thanks to 'em for their support over the years, are about to cease business. Zope freehosting is scarce these days and yours truly is reluctant to host from home due to archaic bandwidth costs and scarcity of string and tin cans in the land down under.

        So if you'd like to have a 124 meg bonsai wiki running on that box in the corner under the potplant, please do stick your hand up.

        wait a moment, what was that thing at the bottom of all these wiki pages? Is it an eye? Is it penny farthing? No, it was <a href="GreenCheese.html">GreenCheese</a>!

        Yes, <a href="GreenCheese.html">GreenCheese</a>, strange <a href="SisterSite.html">SisterSite</a> from outside the box. Most content by <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> and <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a> but anyone can play. Lots of whimsical stories and cartoons there, some of them allegedly true. After several long quiet evenings in, <a href="GreenCheese.html">GreenCheese</a> is back out on the town and looking for <strong>Fun</strong> -wink-.
