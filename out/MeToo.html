        On wiki, we prefer <a href="DissertationOverDiscourse.html">DissertationOverDiscourse</a>.  Each page should ideally read like a small essay on a topic (<a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>), with pertinent discussion following (<a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>).  The idea is that discussion from the <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> section can be refactored into the <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> section after some consensus has been achieved.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Avoid "cheerleading" (posting small comments like "Hey, that's really neat!") on pages that you like. When there's something here that exactly captures the essence, or expresses something particularly well, or even just says something you agree with, you may have the inclination to tag a line expressing your agreement. This urge may be especially strong if you come from <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> or other forums, where debates are often carried by the view with the most support; on those media if you don't add your weight then the sensible ideas, views or thoughts may get drowned. That tends not to happen here because of <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Such comments have no content themselves, so they don't contribute to the topic of the page.  They also won't cause anyone who disagrees with the real content to change their mind.  Cheerleading is sometimes perceived as a <a href="WikiFeint.html">WikiFeint</a>; a better way to call attention to a page you think is underappreciated is to add a <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a> to a related page, pointing people to the page you support.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We're not emotionless robots, and it's courteous to show appreciation for a job well done.  One good way to do this is to put a note on the <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> of the person who wrote the comments or page you like - <a href="WikiMail.html">WikiMail</a> - or even plain ol' email. This is sometimes complicated by the fact that many wikizens prefer to write anonymously, to keep ego, name-based prejudice, and hero-worship off wiki. Assume that if someone hasn't signed their work, they're fine with not getting credit or praise for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another good way to show appreciation is to add further information on the topic.  This indicates interest in the subject, provides a useful contribution to the discussion, and strengthens the point of the original contributor with further evidence instead of a simple "<a href="MeToo.html">MeToo</a>."  Also, it bumps the page up on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, inviting further comment.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If an idea has value it will remain.
        </li>
        <li>
           If an idea has no value it will be countered, discussed, and eventually removed.
        </li>

           <a href="SilenceImpliesConsent.html">SilenceImpliesConsent</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Agreement can also be signalized by adding:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           explanative material
        </li>
        <li>
           supportive arguments
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiBallotBox.html">WikiBallotBox</a>es, or votes to a ballot box  (The idea of adding votes and ballot boxes came from peer contributors.)
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        [Agreement by adding] is to be used judiciously, as shown by the self-congratulatory "<a href="MeToo.html">MeToo</a>" atmosphere that has developed in other on-line forums. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree.  Rather say why "<a href="MeToo.html">MeToo</a>" than just saying "<a href="MeToo.html">MeToo</a>". If all you want to say is "<a href="MeToo.html">MeToo</a>" use a ballot box. -- LourensCoetzer

        I completely agree. -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>
