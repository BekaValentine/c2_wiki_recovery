        Distributed Teams
      </h1>
      <p>
        A distributed (or "dispersed") team is a collection of individuals that work together on a project, each sitting in their own homes. The problems are not quite the same as outsourcing (where conventional teams are separated); or the kind of <a href="TeleCommuting.html">TeleCommuting</a> where an individual is working from home, but their colleagues are in an office.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a website about dispersed team patterns: <a href="http://www.fastnloose.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/dad">http://www.fastnloose.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl/dad</a> <em>[</em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 2006-10-05]<em>, and about a </em>'series of workshops<strong> on the topic.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The topic is also called "<a href="DispersedWorking.html">DispersedWorking</a>" (using "Dispersed" to distinguish separation of the programmers from separation of the target software).
