        Many advocate <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> as a means of avoiding code thrashing.  Speculation is the tool used to predict future growth.

        However, I've found that duplication is a better predictor than my intuition.  Any time I notice a teeny, tiny bit of a <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> violation, I make a note of it in my head.  Sure enough, those places are the most frequent places that get more duplicated until I do something about it.
