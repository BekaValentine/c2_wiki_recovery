        Removing items from an array the procedural way, you can't modify a list while iterating it. [Is this really <em>procedural</em>? Looks like there are objects in here.]
      </p>
      <code>
        var aList = getStuffFromWhereEver();<br/>
        var toRemove = new Array();<br/>
        for(var index=0;index<aList.length;index++)<br/>
        if(aList[index].someCondition) //someCondition is a function that you use to decide what to remove<br/>
        toRemove.push(aList[index]);<br/>
        for(var index=aList.length;index>0;index--)<br/>
        for(var index2=0;index2<toRemove.length;index2++)<br/>
        if(aList[index]==toRemove[index2])<br/>
        aList.remove(index);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        [NOTE: Simply reverse the order of the loop. Decrement through the loop and items can be removed (and added!) while iterating through it.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not true - because you're removing random items, you don't know which ones will match, so they aren't coming off the end.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        now, same thing but with higher order functions and first class function...
      </p>
      <code>
        var aList = remove(getStuffFromWhereEver(),function(each){<br/>
        return each.someCondition;<br/>
        });<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        OK, so remove is a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> that takes as its first argument, a list, and as its second argument, a <a href="FirstClassFunction.html">FirstClassFunction</a> that is a UnaryPredicate. With remove, you'll never repeat the loops from above again, it's <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> at a language level. There are many common things you do to collections, all of them can be put into <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> that takes functions as arguments to specialize them. There is no argument, this approach is objectively better than the procedural approach, and languages that don't support this approach, are crippled, period.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Just "mark" the items to be deleted, and then delete them as a second step, after the loop. If you have to use a more powerful data structure in order to have marks, such as say.......tables...... instead of arrays, then so be it. Showing how something better works with primitive structures is not a selling point to somebody who likes more modern structures. Even without tables, there are probably better implementations. Here is a </em><a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> version:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        use myTable<br/>
        scan<br/>
        if <someCondition><br/>
        delete<br/>
        endif<br/>
        endscan<br/>
        pack<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It is about the same number of tokens as your "improved" version. Thus, your "lead to less code" claim has been proven false, and I am confident the other claims will also (if you define them better). I don't claim <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> is the ideal language, but when it comes to "structure chomping", it can often take very little code. It is sometimes mistaken for pseudo-code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under some conditions, the above can even be shortened to:
      </p>
      <code>
        use myTable<br/>
        delete for <someCondition><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We don't need the "pack" command because if the config is set right, other commands automatically "respect" the built-in record deletion flag. However, eventually "pack" may be needed to clean up the space taken by deleted records. For temporary tables, such is usually not a concern, for the entire table eventually goes away (some dialects do it automatically if a table is declared temporary).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that if I want to make my example handle any table, any function, and any condition, I could do this:
      </p>
      <code>
        procedure foo<br/>
        parameters tableName, condition, processFunc<br/>
        use <strong>&tableName</strong><br/>
        scan<br/>
        do <strong>&processFunc</strong><br/>
        if <strong>&condition</strong><br/>
        delete<br/>
        endif<br/>
        endscan<br/>
        use<br/>
        return<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The "&" does run-time code substitution. In <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>, the called routine "inherits" the parent's scope, sort of closure-like behavior in a rough sense. (Ideally it would be nice if one could optionally switch this behavior off when not being used.) Pascal has a "static" version of this using "nested functions".
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The above could be simplified if "processFunc" also is responsible for evaluating the condition. One could pass an entire function call, parameters and all. At this point, I see advantage in the separation between the condition and function.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of the advantages of using string substitution (eval()-like) for "higher order functions" is that the function name can be stored outside the program, such as in a database. String substitution is part of what makes languages such as TCL great "glue" languages. Function names and all kinds of "meta stuff" can be passed around between different programs in different languages (and databases).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you understood how closures maintain their environment, and how that is taken advantage of by using recursion, then you'd understand why eval() isn't a substitution for a closure and why </em><a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> can't simply be replaced with an eval call to a function. Your statement that "inherits the parent's scope is sort of closure like" just shows you don't understand a closure.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It solves the problem at hand. If you are talking about other problems or mass generacy, then that is another sub-topic.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This entire digression about tables and <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> is moot. It misses the point badly. The idea here was to demonstrate that a simple task, like deletion from a list/table/structure/doohicky could be made smaller and easier to understand using <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a>. A showcase of their obvious strengths (and a case for why every modern language should include them).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> version of table deletion might have a slightly shorter definition, terrific. Yay for <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>. The issue at hand is that HOF constructs shorten code drastically and allow for reuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even without closures, they're powerful. For example, most structures in Ruby support a "collect" method. Collect takes a structure and returns another structure with all the entries that match a given criterion. The definition for such a method is simple, here is the trivial Array example:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Array<br/>
        def example_collect( &proc )<br/>
        temp = []<br/>
        self.each do |x|<br/>
        if proc.call( x )<br/>
        temp << x<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
        temp<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This example is slightly longer, symbolwise, than your <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> definition, but it is a great proof-of-concept of how HOFs make powerful and generic code. We can use this (trivially longer) definition a million times over, for many different uses. For instance, we could define our array rejection in terms of collect and another HOF:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Array<br/>
        def example_reject( &proc )<br/>
        self.example_collect { |item| !( proc.call( item ) ) }<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The magic of HOFs makes this possible. This is why we are ranting and raving about them. It's why we claim they're so obviously good as to be almost a no-brainer for modern language design. When we invoke them, we get such a huge savings in code (and brainspace, it's way easier to think of structure rejection atomically) that the feature speaks for itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor are these concepts limited to simple structure control. New conditionals can be made. New looping constructs are trivial. Note that we used self.each in the example_collect code. It's iteration across an arbitrary structure, and to us it's free. It's easy to imagine making something more complex, like a framework for cryptographically secure network communications, which uses <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> as a way to place your own protocol into the secure framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this make the original statements and code clearer?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think we are going to need a specific </em><a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> to settle this. It is not hard to make something like this with eval:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        newStructure = filteredCopy(oldStructure, filterCriteria)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Why do we need such a use case? HOFs are <em>similar</em> to eval in the sense that code gets conceptually moved around, but instead of moving strings you're moving actual functional units (which can entail a performance savings). HOFs are just a little cleaner (you don't need to worry as much about scope issues, either losing scope or gaining scope). In Lisp they play nicely together, and are used for different purposes. They really aren't in competition in most languages. Why exactly do we need to have some kind of showdown to compare them, since they're really meant for different things?
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: "HOFs are just a little cleaner".
      </p>
      <p>
        Note the word "little". This topic was motivated by claims such as "clearly better" and "great, not just good". If we are splitting hairs, then my original assertion that the bragging is way beyond the level of benefits is true. String-based meta-ing is simple because the language does not have to have HOF built-in, and string substitution can be used for ANYTHING, not just function substitution. Thus, it is more generic and wider reaching. It is a simpler concept that has more uses. Dedicated HOF may simplify a few things, but I find the need for them is not common enough to justify dedicated language features, especially when one uses tables instead of arrays. These array examples here are just reinventing queries from scratch. Rather than brag about making it easier to reinvent the wheel, reuse the goddam wheel instead. <a href="GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>. -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, it's really hard to say eval is "simpler" than anonymous functions, since anonymous functions will follow your language's scoping rules (which are very similar across most languages) and eval scoping rules vary based on implementation (Lisp loses context, you say </em><a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> keeps context, Ruby lets you keep OR discard context). Text-based substitution has a spotty history and is actually quite a bit more difficult, since you can accidently create malformed programs (as in syntactically invalid). In a language with real <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a>, you don't have to worry about that.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds like this is degenerating into another compiler-versus-interpreter type-checking battle. No need to repeat these kind of arguments here. I don't need Eval-like stuff often enough to worry about those so far. The boundary of abstraction difference often does not fall on the function-level anyhow in practice. There are often orthogonal factors such that a simple list of functions is an insufficient characteristic of the repetition pattern that is an abstraction factoring candidate. See <a href="EmployeeTypes.html">EmployeeTypes</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Further, </em><a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> can be combined more safely. You saw my example with the Ruby reject. Doing that in eval would be trickier. Ruby has both a powerful Eval and simple HOFs, and people use HOFs for that sort of thing every time because it's less confusing and safer. Going even <strong>further</strong>, higher-order functions allow you to compose logic at runtime. This is safer and easier than trying to nest code lexically and then calling eval. Eval is a kind of last-resort sort of thing in most languages, it is usually slow, inefficient, dangerous because of inadvertent text substitutions, and conceptually harder to deal with. <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> offer nearly all the benefits (and then some) with none of those penalties.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hence, we say they're superior, obviously good, and highly desirable.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Throw recursion into the mix, and <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> and <a href="AnonymousFunction.html">AnonymousFunction</a>/Closures are clearly enormously superior, because they carry their execution environment with them, something string based substitution can't do at all. Evaling a string is really no match for executing a <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> and passing it a closure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Again, I would like to see specific </em><a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a> of "enormously superior", not just <a href="BrochureTalk.html">BrochureTalk</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This isn't brochure talk. This is the real deal, Top. I gave you Ruby code showing a nice piece of code that used an previously defined, HOF-dependent function to do something different. Key to realizing its superiority to your own examples, notice that the original example_select was written without example_reject in mind. To properly make those in an eval scheme, you would need to adopt a specific style (in nearly every eval case I know of) and meticulously avoid name conflicts. It would be difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not fully sure what your Ruby code is doing, but can't one get a "reject" by simply putting a "NOT" before an "accept" criteria?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, consider the extended uses I suggested. New conditionals and looping constructs. This isn't brochure talk either, a simple look at the Ruby standard library will give you a wealth of examples. The Lisp standard libraries are more difficult to read (for most people), but they're rife with it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>TCL can make new block constructs using string substitution.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about how you would make an extensible cryptographically secure networking service (two components, client and server) that merely create a secure corridor for another protocol. You could use anonymous functions (or named functions called by anonymous functions) to process the data according to an arbitrary protocol without ever even <em>thinking</em> about that protocol, or coding in a specific scope-aware style. Oh, and make it fast enough to be used for real-time, low-latency communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not a systems programmer, and thus don't relate to network protocol examples very well. May I ask for custom business application examples? Thank You.

      </p>
      <p>
        The performance, syntax, and manipulation benefits of HOFs are obvious if you consider them, and we've given you several examples complete with reasoning. Past this point, you're on your own. We can't <strong>make</strong> you realize anything, Top. We can only give you the knowledge to make such realization possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your reasoning is often circular and your examples assume change needs which may be artificial. I cannot tell if they are artificial without looking at specific situations.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're so dead set on a <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a>, please name a case in which your table-oriented-eval-coupled example is superior, because thus far you have not (your High Level language example vs. C-like example pseudocode isn't really valid or compelling). I'm pretty sure the HOF version of any such case will be easier, faster, and cleaner. There are VERY few situations in which the use of Eval is necessary, outside of runtime code generation (which is what eval is for, specifically, so it's not really fair for HOFs to have to meet on that ground).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I never claimed they were objectively "superior". And, TOP is not the topic. Further, like I already stated, I don't use Eval that often in practice for reasons already given.

Higher abstractions, such as <a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a>, often require more horsepower. Databases can use RAM cache too, BTW. Not every RDBMS has to be bloated and formal like Oracle.

I don't dispute the power of your techniques for <strong>certain</strong> domains. Assembly and C also have places where they shine for hardware-friendly reasons, but a custom app developer may not be as affective under the hardware-friendly tradeoffs.

        Let's head that off then. Someone needs to write the code that lets you sort. HOFs in these languages make it easy. Incidentally, for a more application-level use of HOF-objects: I have an application that needs to process long blocks of weather data and calculate things like wind shear, atmospheric pressure, and interpolations between points. Instead of writing one function per task, I wrote one function that iterated across the data (two points at a time) and called a function object on each one. Now, I can write new operations (like calculating the Rise Rate of the weather balloon, a brand new requirement) in just a few simple lines of code without thinking about the iteration. That's the kind of savings we're talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: Perhaps the weather example needs to be moved to its own section or topic. It is scattered about.]
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>I would like to see a sample schema and some pseudo-code, if you don't mind. I don't see where weather balloons relate to interpolation. And, what are your "tasks"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, I'll be super clear, but this isn't a problem we used tables to solve (nor do I believe it would benefit from such a solution), so no schema, and the pseudo-code would not be helpful, so none for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Weather Balloon sends back data every 2 seconds (or so). This is a lot of data, and the client doesn't want to edit in this space. We interpolate between points that span a 100' boundary (dividing the data into 5000' boundaries). That's the first interpolation link. We are playing with a scheme, but right now it's linear. I might switch it to a Hermite curve if that's proven inadequate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next, the data the balloon sends back is sometimes bogus. These things are a product of the NAFTA treaty, they fail a bit all the time. So the guy who is going to say if the rocket-launch is okay needs a meteorologist to "correct" the data. They fill in holes (via linear interpolation across gaps) and an linearly or bi-linearly interpolate across arbitrary ranges.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, we need to calculate Wind Shear, Rise Rate, and Atmospheric Pressure from this data.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote one iteration function that takes a functor (HOF simulated in C++, common stuff found in the STL) and iterates across the set two points at a time, calling the functor. The functor can choose to alter the data in any way it desires as it iterates, or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I wrote Functor Objects for each operation I've described. The longest was was 10 lines, because I could program without worrying about any kind of iteration state (the iteration function provided most of it) or anything else. Just the task at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I've been able to non-trivially extend the system to calculate new data as I go, without cluttering the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is that detailed enough?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am still not fully relating to the example, but it seems like something that EVAL can handle:</em>

        while (complexIteration) {<br/>
        Eval(functName . stdParams);<br/>
        }<br/>

      <p>
        <em>The only complaint I can see is perhaps speed for super-large datasets.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That is something like it. It looks more like (please forgive the C++, it's what I get paid to work in, and this has been altered so I don't get sued for giving away LMCO code):
      </p>
      <code>
        void<br/>
        DataBlock::with_range( double start,<br/>
        double stop,<br/>
        PermuteFunctor& functor )<br/>
        {<br/>
        map<double,Record>::iterator point = _bData.lower_bound( start );<br/>
        map<double,Record>::iterator end = _bData.upper_bound( stop );<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        if( point == _bData.end() )<br/>
        {<br/>
        throw new no_such_record_exception();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // One argument version of functor invocation, for the first point.<br/>
        Record prev = functor( point->second );<br/>
        ++point;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Two argument version, for all subsequent points.<br/>
        while( point != end )<br/>
        {<br/>
        prev = functor( point->second, prev );<br/>
        ++point;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Functors are just objects with the operator() method overloaded for one and two argument versions. This version is actually pretty fast too. These datasets involve several million records (two seconds, for 150,000ft, it adds up fast).
      </p>
      <p>
        With this framework, I can write (and have written) diverse operations on the data without worrying about the ranges, the iteration, or even what's going on with the dataset.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A faster-executing solution is perhaps to use a case statement:
      </p>
      <code>
        function Iterate(funcName) {<br/>
        ....<br/>
        while (complexIteration) {<br/>
        process(funcName, otherParams)<br/>
        }<br/>
        ....<br/>
        }<br/>
        function process(funcName, otherParams) {<br/>
        select on funcName {<br/>
        case 'foo': {........}<br/>
        case 'bar': {........}<br/>
        case 'blah': {........}<br/>
        etc....<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Some people balk at long case statements, but frankly if they are well organized, I see no real problem with them. Blocks is blocks, but that is another battle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I would probably first try to create a "clean" data set that has all the interpolation and cleaning applied, and then process it. Otherwise the process of interpolating and cleaning the data is mixed together with processing, which I would rather separate. See <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Well, at least you're trying now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The processing and the "cleaning" are separate processes. They occur in separate places, as different functors. I get the side benefit of using the same iteration function for both, shrinking my code.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the rest, I thought of that too. I didn't do it because of composition. The user decides what calculations are done and which are not, this is a series of preferences. When they decide, I compose several functors into one larger functor. I sort the functors (sorting again!) based on a simple priority system (generate new points, interpolate old points, perform data calculations) so that I do things in the right order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since this composition can change on a whim (and it will evolve even more once our automatic data correction algorithms are complete) are more flexible solution than a case statement has to be put in to allow the code to grow. Already I'd have 13+ items in that caste statement, which is 130 lines of code for one case statement (roughly). That's bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, since these compositions are nearly arbitrary (it's a bunch of checkboxes), I didn't want to have to write one of the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A series of booleans in One Big Function. Even if I broke it up into a dispatch function to many small functions, that would have raised many questions about the architecture that were superfluous (where do these functions go? Like it or not, you need to address this concern in C++)
        </li>
        <li>
           One function for every permutation, this is just bad.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The anonymity of the functions works strongly to my advantage here.
      </p>

        <em>At this point I could not make a specific recommendation without knowing your users and requirements and change patterns. Eval may perhaps be too slow for some domains. I won't dispute that. Not everything is good everywhere. There are 3 approaches I have at my disposal:</em>

           Eval isn't an option in C++, but the composition part of it would be suitably nasty if it was, that I would still dismiss it. I do use Eval sometimes in Ruby and TCL, and I know how the code would drape in this situations. It would be a lot more trouble than a HOF solution.

            <li>
               <em>Please clarify "a lot more trouble".</em>

        <li>
           Case statements would be VERY long, and grow. It would be like this page, TooLongToEdit. A single function's caste statement extending over at least 130 lines (it's actually a bit more, 10 lines per op is the average) would be a maintenance nightmare
        </li>
        <li>
           Pre-clean the data. Impossible, since the human is the one deciding how to clean the data. This application IS the pre-cleaning application. The human expert (or the expert system) operates in this application to "QC" the data so that it reflects the weather. Then, another expert will use the data to calculate rocket thrust vectors. This will lean a launching rocket into wind (and alerts them of conditions that would render the launch too dangerous). I'm the one who has to give a meteorologist a palette of tools to fix the data. Think of it like photo touch-up in <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a>.

        Further, I don't think it is that likely to have several dozen functions in that Weather Example that <em>all</em> happen to be mutually-exclusive. After a bunch it would more likely be that some need/want execution for the same loop, requiring something more sophisticated or at least change the very nature of the problem altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, four conditions have to be in place <strong>at the same time</strong> for my suggestions not the work:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Eval" too slow for situation
        </li>
        <li>
           Case-statements too unwieldy (however "unwieldy" is defined)
        </li>
        <li>
           Can't simplify the loop setup code to reduce it to one or two lines (so that we can have loops inside the functions instead of the other way around).
        </li>
        <li>
           All functions are mutually exclusive per iteration
        </li>
        <li>
           Can't combine them before compiling
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I will agree that there may be an occasional <a href="PerfectStorm.html">PerfectStorm</a> where my suggestions don't work sufficiently, but the claim seems to be everyday improvements from your suggestions, not just for perfect storms. No language or paradigm does everything well. A perfect storm can probably be found for any approach. (But not being there, I cannot verify that it really is a perfect storm in the weather case, no pun intended.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe the original author of the weather example somewhere admitted that more details could not be provided due to a Non-Disclosure Agreement (a "shut-up" clause in an employment or project contract). Thus, it is insufficient for detailed probing and should thus not be used for further exploration or debate beyond those benefits normally allowed for a toy example.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>Non-Disclosure Agreement</strong> is another way of saying, "I can't provide thorough evidence here because I'd get sued if I did." Good, it's now clear that you CANNOT give thorough evidence here. You are essentially admitting you cannot present a full case and complete the job. QED.

        Other than possible speed complaints, I don't see what the problem is with Eval. As far as case statements being too long, split each case block off into a separate function.

        <em>Ahh top. Speed IS a consideration (even after reducing the record space to 100' boundaries, 120000 ft of data reduces to 1200 large records, and so far we've only talked about Wind. I also have to do stuff for the temperature domain, which is even more complex!</em>

        <em>But let's ignore speed considerations. Eval would mean mode code!

      </p>
      <p>
        I need a far more detailed description of your problem space here. I cannot make recommendations for code organization without knowing what is going on. If your context is that different (a new requirement not mentioned above), then perhaps an entirely different approach is needed. Maybe associative arrays or tables would server context management better. It hints that you are doing everything backasswards, but I cannot identify where without having more specifics in front of me. You are using code to define requirements instead of words, and that is just wrong if clean communication is desired.
      </p>
      <p>
        [ I already use associative arrays heavily. I can look up any record by height and time.

I rather like the design, since it leads me to a very declarative approach to coding the system (and the entire app is currently under 4k lines of code!

           All object-oriented languages can fake higher-order functions, by passing around objects instead; this is essentially the entire idea behind <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>. Unfortunately, common business-oriented languages have crippled higher-order function support. For example, the anonymous inner classes of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> are almost exactly like anonymous functions, except they're painfully verbose. However, Java's checked exceptions weaken a lot of common higher-order patterns such as the <a href="InternalIterator.html">InternalIterator</a> (anonymous inner classes also have semantics which seem to be specifically chosen so that true closures don't happen in Java), so higher-order patterns are used much more rarely in these languages. -DavidMcLean
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That depends on the language. Many dynamic languages let one dynamically declare variables anywhere within a function and they keep their scope until the routine terminates. If there is a lot of averaging, it would probably be better to simplify the loop and put it on the inside (which the author alleges cannot be done for unstated reasons) rather than put it on the outside of the individual functions/units.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This solution means that adding a new behavior, like averaging, requires modification of the loop. Using functors allows all sorts of behavior (the averaging is actually a really basic example) to be added without modification of the core loop. I have never seen an eval language that allowed the eval-ed code to maintain it's own namespace, if such a language exists, I suspect that it actually implements that kind of eval on top of HOFs, by compiling the evaled code as a closure. You can do this in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, for example - new Function("blah blah blah a string that becomes a function object here"). There's no "simplification of the loop", it's already as simple as it can get. Every operation that you would perform on the data is implemented as a single functor. It's a very clean solution, because the code for the individual operations is compartmentalized and doesn't involve any extra boilerplate code for iteration. It's very efficient. The advantage of not stepping on the global namespace is huge, as the complexity of the code grows and especially as other programmers get involved. It's an all round superior solution to using eval.

           <em>Without looking at specific examples, I couldn't say whether the eval's I know would work. As far as "polluting the global namespace", I tend to break programs down into relatively independent modules such that there is not a big global namespace to pollute. Further, I only need to use eval about once every 2,000 LOC on the average, so it is not like a bunch are bumping into each other. Beside, it may not be global. I've seen two approaches to getting the caller's scope: 1. the option of inheriting the caller's scope for a given routine, and 2. the stack-level scope indicators in Tcl's eval-like functions. -- top</em>

           Jesus. You're claiming that because you don't do this, his example isn't valid? You only write small applications, so approaches to reducing complexity in large ones are invalid? I'm not sure you even know what the scope and namespace problems involved in this case are. Every function that gets executed (remember, we're composing operations from sets of functions here, not hardcoding everything) needs to operate inside it's own scope so that it's locals don't end up stepping on the locals of other functions. But remember that it has to be a persistent scope, so you can store things like running totals, don't want a new scope every loop iteration. You cannot do this with any eval system I have ever seen, even TCLs. The only eval system I can think of that can do this is one that allows you compose new HOFs via eval (which I have seen), which is sort of missing the point. You don't want to execute in the *callers* scope, you want to execute in a unique, new scope. Modularity is *good*. Every operation is a unique module.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Put the running totals into a map array. Until the detailed requirements are public, this is moot anyhow. I am not going to chase your ghost unicorn example anymore ("hidden" via your org's NDA). Your requirements are suspicious, as already described.

        <em> It's not new. We touched on it earlier, but tabled it for a bit. I mentioned that Eval-ing code requires that the code be placed in the "Context" of the executing program.

        I am sorry, but I have not seen any problems or "bloat" with an Eval solution outside of speed (which I cannot test). I will give you credit for speed just to move beyond that annoying topic. But Moore's law is on my side in the long run. I am not sure what you mean by the second point of placing values in the eval string. Generally one just uses variables. The eval's and exec's I am familiar with are very similar to a run-time "include" statement. You can stick them just about anywhere. Maybe even the repeated loop statements can be executed that way rather than try to put the function inside the loop (I have never tried that, though). They "see" the context of where they are stuck just like the code actually stuck there. (<a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> does not have an Exec-like statement, but gets around that by having functions inherit caller scope. TCL has more powerful such tools, but <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>'s is usually good-enough.) If Lisp and Ruby lack contexted-based Eval's or Exec's, then they are crippled in that respect. At least make it an option. If we continue with this example, I would have to play "20 questions" to ascertain the specific requirements and relationships, which would probably end up violating your NDA, getting us both in the slammer.

           Why are only pairs used for interpolation? Don't some interpolation algorithms use more than pairs? <em>They could, but the pairing was a convenient number.

           I don't understand why the looping is so complicated? Having to put the functions "inside" a single loop instead of having each function have it's own loop complicates the design.

        Now let's try to bring this discussion to some closures. This discussion was supposed to prove what? That higher order functions is a language feature pretty much unrelated to relational model?

        [Of course you don't, because you've never worked with them, you have no experience in the matter, and don't appreciate the advantages offered over eval, due to that complete lack of experience.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Compile-time checking and perhaps speed advantages are about the only thing I see, and those are incremental things. Eval is simpler conceptually and applies to more than just functions. Why clutter a language with gimmicks unless a strong justification is shown?</em>

        I am taking your word for nothing. Show us code and CLEAR requirements.

        Iteration can be improved upon. Here's a Common Lisp example using a brief form of iteration.
      </p>
      <code>
        (coerce (loop for i across #(1 2 3 4 5) when (oddp i) collect i)<br/>
        'simple-vector)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        answer> #(1 3 5)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here, <em>#(1 2 3 4 5)</em> is syntax which denotes an array containing 1...5. It says that when an element is odd, collect it into some unnamed list, which will then be returned when <em>loop</em> is done. That list is then coerced into a "simple vector". (A kind of array without wizzy features like fill pointers.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally think this means two things.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Iteration needs to be improved in most languages to take care of common cases.
        </li>
        <li>
           Functional programming is vital as a guide to improving iteration. <em>--which was the entire point of the example, not that top noticed.--</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A <em>meta</em> lesson is that macros are good, since <em>loop</em> is just a macro some guy worked on. This means a language which supports macros well (with debugging features, etc) offers a way to extend the language, kind of like a patchless opensource. But of course that is a controversial conclusion. (Some people are worried what their coworkers will do with the power of macros. And I don't have the experience to know whether this is a true concern.)

        For thoroughness, here is an SQL-based example. I am assuming that complex processing or analysis of the "nodes" needs to take place before we know what is to be deleted. Otherwise we could just use:
      </p>
      <code>
        DELETE FROM foo WHERE blah blah"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Complex processing version in PHP-like syntax:
      </p>
      <code>
        $toBeDeleted = <em>;  // empty string list</em><br/>
        $rs = query("select * from Foo");<br/>
        while (getNext($rs)) {<br/>
        $someCondition = [complex processing here]....<br/>
        if ($someCondition) {<br/>
        listAppend($toBeDeleted, $rs['primaryID']);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        query("delete from Foo where primaryID in ($toBeDeleted)");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This assumes numeric ID's, but some dialects can handle quotes around numbers also if we wish to make it more generic. The default string delimiter is a comma. If you want a different delimiter, then use a call such as:
      </p>
      <code>
        listAppend($toBeDeleted, $rs['primaryID'],'|');<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (I am not necessarily using PHP's list function conventions here.) -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        And then consider what happens when you need to delete based on some other condition:
      </p>
      <code>
        $toBeDeleted = <em>;  // empty string list</em><br/>
        $rs = query("select * from Foo");<br/>
        while (getNext($rs)) {<br/>
        $someOtherCondition = [more complex processing here]....<br/>
        if ($someCondition) {<br/>
        listAppend($toBeDeleted, $rs['primaryID']);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        query("delete from Foo where primaryID in ($toBeDeleted)");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And then if you have to delete on another table on a different condition:
      </p>
      <code>
        $toBeDeleted = <em>;  // empty string list</em><br/>
        $rs = query("select * from Bar");<br/>
        while (getNext($rs)) {<br/>
        $someCondition = [more complex processing here]....<br/>
        if ($someCondition) {<br/>
        listAppend($toBeDeleted, $rs['primaryID']);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        query("delete from Bar where primaryID in ($toBeDeleted)");<br/>
      </code>

There's never a need for a complex parameter list, parameters are passed via lexical scope, i.e. closures, and don't need to be named, another one of those fancy features that you don't think we need.

        Looping over Eval's done on lists/tables could achieve something similar, but by itself is only a small portion of the sample app. It's also missing the UI. Your code appears to also be reinventing a very limited competitor to SQL. The sample is not really about how to roll-your-own query language, but rather more about <em>gluing together</em> different services and "interface" languages, such as HTML and SQL. In biz apps that's often what one does: glue together existing tools, services, DSL's, and API's into a usable unit for a specific purpose. -t

        The only thing I have not seen them do is create custom control structures. However, languages like TCL seem to do it by treating blocks as strings to be executed by the command call. The upLevel command allows it to execute a string (block) in the caller's scope. Yes, they are probably slower than HOF. I will give HOF the speed benefit. However, those kinds of things are not usually a bottleneck in my experience and domain. If they are too slow for massive weather data processing, so be it.

        I have suggested that functional "tricks" often don't save that much code because the vast majority of repeated loop setup code can be reduced to 2 lines or less, and my code averages about one loop every 15 lines or so. Thus, any savings in code from functional-based loop simplification will only be a few percent's worth most of the time, and this is only if there is a lot of regularity. Again, this is "good", but not "great", as some have claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general pattern for repeated loop setup is: <em>( And for comparison, how much work you can do with HOF lines. )</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        myMap1 = loopSetupFoo([local vars as parameters])	|  <em># Compared, three HOF lines can do many times more</em><br/>
        while (myMap2 = getNextFoo(myMap1)) {		 |  <em>myMap.each	{ |x, y| puts "#{x} => #{y}" } # print</em><br/>
        ....						|  <em>myMap.sort	{ |x, y| x > y }		# sort</em><br/>
        }							|  <em>myMap.reject! { |x,y| x.isNotSpecial }	# filter</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ("Eval" techniques may reduce it further, but are not considered here.) <em>{ And there goes your "Loop code is short" suggestion out the window. Of course, it totally missed the point to begin with... }</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This pattern follows the observation that we need one "initialization" call and one repeated call for loop iteration. Sometimes they can be combined, but in many interpreters/compilers this results in unnecessarily repeated execution per loop iteration.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not seen many situations where this two-line technique cannot reduce repeatedly-used looping patterns from several lines per instance to 2. In all likelihood, the above weather example can also be likewise reduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This solution is a common external iterator pattern. We see these all the time in the C++ </em><a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a>. They are falling out of style because, even with shortened loop setups, they are a pain for anything more complex than simple iteration. Your method would provide no savings, in the long run, with operations like collection or filtration. It is far easier to make "verb" methods like "collect", "filter", "reject", "sort" that accept logic and handle the gritty details themselves. Since these operations are called commonly, the net code savings over time is substantial.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your other eval solutions suggests it/'s safe to modify the local environment to set things up. This is really a rather scary operation to do. What if someone changes your environment? Implicit reassignments happen, things that someone else may not realize. It's all well and good to say, "Eval gets access to the enclosing scope, so I can create variables as needed." but it's dangerous. Lispers can do this too, with macros, but it's dangerous and people usually try to avoid such "</em>VariableCapture" because implicit behavior is unsafe and confusing in the long run.<em></em>

        <em>HOFs can do a lot of things. We've been focusing on common uses, such as simplifying and abstracting iterative tasks (like doing something for each item in a collection), for providing plug-and-play logic for common tasks (criterion for sorting, methods for printing), for providing dynamic callbacks for more complex systems (secure network protocol wrapper), or for providing a generic framework for arbitrary operations (such as the weather example above).</em>

        Actually Top, I'm bragging about being able to put database verbs on <strong>ANYTHING</strong>, even things that it might not normally make sense to do so on (each_line for a network socket, for instance). By building up such verbs, we can treat low-level structures at a higher level, without losing any control when we want it. It gives us more than that, but it's a start.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for your attempt at an example, it seems to be very poorly formed, like you're trying to do more than one thing at a time. Maybe you should think it through? Your need to reduce work so that one loop does more than one thing at a time. I assume you'd like to filter across a precomputed range. We could do this more elegantly if I had a bit more time, but here's a version does the same thing:
      </p>
      <code>
        shouldFilter = false<br/>
        my_map.reject! do |key,val|<br/>
        # ... do something to shouldFilter here, based on key or val, conditionally.<br/>
        shouldFilter # Returns shouldFilter<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You tried to make it look very complex, but all you're really doing is some additional logic to determine when to filter (and possibly take other actions, which is bad style in any paradigm, but is not ruled out here). Do you have anymore spurious examples for us to debunk?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am just trying to point out that in my observation, it is often tough to separate things because they tend to be inherently coupled to each other. It would indeed make life simpler if we knew all the filter conditions before entering a loop or block, but often we don't. (Often if the filtering is simple, the WHERE clause does the filtering.) And, often they interact such that there may be filter A and filter B, each of which is finally applied based on other information we collect in the process. If you disagree and claim there is more regularity than I see, then so be it. It is anecdote-versus-anecdote. -- top</em>

        What's really interesting is that <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s allow programming in a more declarative fashion using verbs like foreach, select, reject, detect, remove, inject, and collect, exactly the kind of thing you'd think top would actually prefer over hand rolled loops.

      <p>
        Close, see if I can clarify with some pseudocode showing both sides of the issue. First, we want reusable iterations over lists, of anything, even recordsets that come from databases, so, forEach
        takes any list, and a one arg function and applies it to each item in list, that's the <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>

      </p>
      <code>
        query("update Emps set salary = salary + $amt");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        [It can't if salary is a complex computation that involves much business logic, don't try and apply sql, it isn't applicable to the sample, and is rather silly to think I don't know how to do a simple update statement, or that an update statement is in any way comparable to the above sample.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Every time I suggest that your examples "assume too much regularity (simplicity)" to fit real problems, you get on my case. Now you are doing the same thing. -- top

      <p>
        [No, the whole point of that sample is to show you how to achieve regularity by avoiding parameter passing with implicit closures, enabling generic reuse of functions. I'm showing you that your objection, "assume too much regularity (simplicity)", is incorrect. It was not about doing a simple update to salary.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I mostly just see query language reinvention up there (<a href="ExpressionApiComplaints.html">ExpressionApiComplaints</a>). You seem to have difficulty finding an example that does not rely on arrays and does not reinvent query languages or databases. There seems to be a pattern to your choice of examples. -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        [Here, I fixed the context so you can grasp it without thinking about employees and saleries]
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the change will confuse readers because replies and code comments are based on the original example. Besides, examples are easier to relate to when they have something specific instead of Gloobs and Foos.
      </p>
      <p>
        [ now read it really slowly, until you figure out that the example is about how to pass paramaters to functions, without explicitly passing them.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I can do the same thing with languages that allow functions to inherit scope from the caller.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You seem to have dificulty reading code and understanding clear explanations. Look at the aGooble variable, see how it's used by the goobleGorp <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>, without being passed to it. You always complain about not being able to achieve uniformity, well this is how we do it. It's not about arrays, it's not about query languages; it's about how to do something that saves you a lot of work when programming, "Not passing variables".]
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that one can do something similar with Eval:
      </p>
      <code>
        function looper(theList, theExpression) {<br/>
        for i = getNext(theList) {<br/>
        eval(theExpression)<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Remember that some languages let a routine inherit the parent's scope, while others (TCL) have multiple kinds of Eval such that one can optionally execute the expression in the caller's scope. But again, in practice I don't find a practical need for such very often. The regularly to take advantage of it does not exist often enough. And it is often possible to simplify the loop if the loop is used often. That way one can put the loop inside the functions instead of the other way around. Your code-saving claims seem to assume wordy loops. Here is another psuedoc-doe version that makes scope inheritance optional:
      </p>
      <code>
        function looper(theList, theExpression, scopeLevel) {<br/>
        for i = getNext(theList) {<br/>
        evalOnStack(scopeLevel, theExpression)<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here the scopeLevel is the stack level, similar to the "upVar" TCL parameter. Zero is the current stack (inside of "looper"), 1 is one level up.

        One more point in favor of HOFs vrs eval - code executed by eval is a string, and as such isn't part of the semantic structure of the problem. I know that Top is interested in exposing program structure and abstract ("syntaxless") language structures - evaled code can't participate in these techniques. HOFs, as a language construct, are certainly superior in this regard.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>HOF's are just references. One can reference functions by name or by some internal pointer. Using an internal pointer is a violation of </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> if the name will suffice. Yeah I know, sometimes ugly pointers just run faster. -- top<em></em>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Social intimidation aside, I still have not heard a good written justification (outside of performance) for having both a name and a RAM pointer for a function. Why have two primary keys/IDs? That ain't KISS.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They are most certainly not just references. Many <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> are curried (partially-bound) functions, with some elements bound to the function and others left free. Many others, even if not curried, are defined only once and used only once at their place of definition - introducing names for these can be a big headache for programming in functional style. One could argue just as easily that use of a name violates <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>... or one could sidestep the whole silly argument by decoupling lookup with dereference.

        About using SQL query for deletion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Has anyone realize that the SQL DELETE, UPDATE, SELECT statement use a form of Higher order Function?
      </p>
      <code>
        DELETE from person<br/>
        where person.name = "john";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        is actually equivelant to lisp
      </p>
      <code>
        (DELETE :from 'person<br/>
        :where (lambda (person)(= (name person) "john"))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        where one could put in macro to make it
      </p>
      <code>
        (DELETE :from person<br/>
        :where (= (name person) "john")))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now Top, I want you to realize that the benefit of using DB is there because SQL syntax try to be familiar with the usage of Higher order function. However, SQL does not have the full power of HOF so it just provides you with fix capability to do it. That's why you cannot extends SQL to have
      </p>
      <code>
        INCREMENT age IN person WHERE person.name = "john"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You can use UPDATE for it, but thanks to Codds for that. Because Insert, Update, Delete is so universal (it's like the word "Do" "Act").
      </p>
      <p>
        Seeing this similarity I don't know why top hates too much about Higher order function, when he himself uses it all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine You don't have a SQL DELETE statement. What would you do to get the same terseness as SQL you have now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please clarify. I am not understanding your point. Use a stored procedural or function if you want an "increment" function. Add, change, and delete are fundamental building blocks, and that is why they are included. Arguing that we need HOF in case the SQL inventor skipped a beat is an odd argument. </em><a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a> did not create SQL, by the way. Nor is SQL the pinnacle of potential query languages. -- top<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        SQL is actually a functional language, in that a statement can't have side effects while it is processing. (An update statement modifies tables only after all other processing has completed.) Joining in another table to a query is very much like creating an anonymous function. For example (please forgive my syntax mistakes as I am neither a SQL nor lisp expert):
        UPDATE employee SET salary = basewage + 0.05*SUM(sales)
        FROM employee  JOIN orders ON employee.emp_id = orders.emp_id
        WHERE orders.qty > 1000
      </p>
      <p>
        This might be expressed in lisp like:
      </p>
      <code>
        (UPDATE :from 'employee :key 'salary<br/>
        (+ (base-wage employee)<br/>
        (lambda (emp-id-val)<br/>
        (SELECT (* 0.05 (sum (sales employee))) :from 'orders :where (and (= emp-id-val (emp-id employee)) (> (qty  orders) 1000)))<br/>
        (emp-id employee)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The  point here is that the join and SUM is effectively creating an anonymous function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps one should distinquish between saying a query language *is* a functional language and saying a query language can be implemented (or implemented better) in a function language. I am not sure the debate here is how best to implement a query language. However, things may change if query languages allow user-defined or DBA-defined functions. MS-Access will allow such when defined in VBA, IIRC, but they are not recognized in aggregate operations though.</em>

        If you want HOF to be better supported and used more in languages and applications that you may one day be maintaining, then it <strong>benefits you</strong> to promote the value of HOF to one of the largest domains: custom business applications. If you can demonstrate to other readers besides me in a semi-realistic coded example (and perhaps realistic change scenarios) how the code and/or maintenance steps are shorter/fewer, then the world will accept HOF's more and languages and tools and training materials will better support them such that HOF's will be more common in YOUR work world and the work of your colleagues.

One reason for doing this is to provide a simple, efficient, and effective way to support user-defined aggregate operators (in addition to the built-in SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) for use by the SUMMARIZE relational operator.  This is roughly equivalent to being able to define custom aggregate operators (in addition to the built-in SUM, COUNT, AVG, etc.) for GROUP BY queries in SQL.  A second reason is to provide an alternative to the EVALUATE mechanism -- which is a typical string-based "EVAL" implementation -- that is considerably more type-safe.  The value of these in "custom biz apps" should also be self-evident.  If it isn't, there's no point in continuing this debate.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That said, maybe the particular domain of "custom biz apps" you're developing do not require the level of customisation, re-use, and type safety typically provided by </em><a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        That is <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a>. I don't dispute the value of HOF there. And it's not that biz apps don't need re-use, it's that the re-use is more <strong>irregular</strong>. The kinds of influences on each variation is greater such that the boundaries are rougher and more unpredictable. It's hard to define stable <a href="GateKeeper.html">GateKeeper</a> interfaces up-front that work in new, unexpected situations without overhauling.

      </p>
      <p>
        My classification would depend on the details. If one had to know specifics of the innards of the database engine to write a custom aggregator, then I would call it <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a>. If it's designed such that it's more like a DBA defining a view, then I wouldn't. In the later case, the "objects" being referenced are the usual "visible" objects, such as tables, views, columns, indexes, etc. Of course, it may be in-between, and each DB engine may do it differently.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There's no reason why a custom aggregator should need to know the specifics of the innards of the database engine.  The objects being referenced would be tuples/rows, attributes/values, and relations/</em><a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s/tables.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And I'm not convinced that a HOF is the best way to define such, but would like to analyze a specific scenario if you can provide one. It could be defined something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        // Sample fizBin<br/>
        func aggr_fizBin(theValue, &collector) {<br/>
        if (! typeOf(theValue) in ["number","integer"]) {<br/>
        sys.throwStdError("this aggregator operator must be numeric");<br/>
        } else {<br/>
        collector = collector + sqrRoot(theValue);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>That's a reasonable definition.  Now imagine that some significant aspect of your aggregation function needs to change depending on row values, so that what you effectively need is n different functions, where n could vary between 1 and the quantity of rows in a given group of rows.  I'm sure you could do it without HOFs, but HOFs generally make it easier to express.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           What's a business scenario for such? We can envision call kinds of "lab" examples where such ability is "interesting", but I cannot turn it into common practice usage in the biz domain, either because it's not a common need, or I am not smart enough to envision such for the domain. The fact that other WiziZens have been unable to show such even though the challenge has been around for several years suggests to me that it's the former.

           <em>Sales forecasting often involves choosing from a variety of regression techniques that may vary depending on product sales history, product category sales history, arbitrary decision ("let's try this on product category <x>"), seasonality ("we only ever sell those shortly before Xmas"), the number of products in a group ("if there's only a few of them, don't bother", or "if there's less than ten, calculate it like <this>") or all of the above in some computed combination.  This is a scenario where selection or affectation of algorithm is something we may wish to perform inside an aggregate query, do it efficiently (there may be thousands of products with millions of historical records), effectively, and be able to re-use the code to deliver results quickly.

           That's arguably outside of "custom business application" and in the domain of "statistical analysis". Statisticians are usually hired (or borrowed) to work that kind of stuff at the places I've worked. And they tend to use pre-packaged tools such as SPSS, SAS, and "R". And "Eval" and other techniques have not been ruled out, except maybe for the "speed" issue. I suspect that each regression technique is too varied in terms of parameter quantity and output quantity/type to be manageable via simple uniform plug-ins anyhow, but I am not a stat expert such that I'm speculating a bit here. Swapability generally requires a uniform interface. -t

           I'll <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> if I'm being unreasonably narrow. For the sake of this discussion, how about I define it as a project in which a "generic" custom business developer would typically be a key part of the project if they need to hire/rent from the outside. If they are more likely to hire/rent those with domain-specific degrees, such as math/statistical degrees, then it wouldn't qualify. (Granted, a small org may use a biz developer, but they also wouldn't typically ask for a wide variety of regression techniques in that situation. If you want the Cadillac of statistics, including lots of regression approaches, instead of the Chevy, then you hire statisticians, not a "generic" biz developer.) -t

Sometimes the client was able to provide sufficiently detailed information that I could research the specialist knowledge and meet requirements on my own, sometimes I hired expertise.  This was all "custom business applications" because it was custom, it was for business, and the result was applications.  Would I have preferred using functional languages instead of xBase, C, C++, VBA, VB, PHP, Java and Delphi?  Absolutely.  Had sufficiently mature and cost-effective FP environments existed at the time, I would have used them in a heartbeat.  If I were to go back into custom business application development today, I would be evaluating Erlang, F# and Haskell from the start.  The control over side-effects and easy support for concurrency are alone worth the price of admission.</em>

           Well, that differs from my experience. I was asked to install SPSS for 4 statistical experts, for example. Most biz developers don't even remember their calculus unless fresh out of school. Anyhow, why do you have to turn to regression for an example? Why not something clearly more business-y?

Not much call for FP there, let alone HOFs; in terms of language, xBASE or COBOL would easily suffice. (Noting, of course, that SQL is a functional language!)  However, what if the requirements demanded a distributed G/L with graphical dashboards supporting arbitrary numbers of live-update end-user custom reports accessed via a Web interface, live update of Excel spreadsheets, and unlimited scalability?  Now we're soundly in the territory where functional programming could well be of benefit.  Old-skool xBASE or COBOL wouldn't begin to scratch the surface.</em>

           Sales people use road maps also, but that doesn't make road maps a business app. Why "should" they NOT use SPSS or SAS or R? That's what statisticians are trained to use. As far as the second, flesh out the detail specs and we'll see.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>A good reason for not using SPSS, SAS or R is that the sales forecasting often needs to integrate tightly with existing inventory or manufacturing production management systems, right down to having a seamless UI.  So, whilst prototyping may be done in SPSS, SAS or R, the prototype may wind up being re-implemented in C/C++/C#/Java/Delphi/VB/VBA/PHP/Python/Haskell/F#/whatever.

      <ul>
        <li>
           That's fine, but that also means that the statistical tests become <strong>mostly settled</strong> before general integration because there is a prototyping stage. HOF's only significantly help if a lot of tests come and go with frequency. Medium and large organizations generally have a management approval and sign-off stage because they are the ones using and responding to the reports.

               You are mixing up two different issues. And asking for an Eval version for that specific thing is like asking me to write SQL for a tool that expects Tutorial D. Of course it's not going to do well. It's a rigged test.

               <em>Sorry, not following you.  How is it rigged?  I wouldn't expect you to rewrite the AJAX library, just replace makeLoader() or change it to use eval().</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Why would I want to do that? What are you trying to achieve as far as satisfying a domain need? I don't understand the context of your spaghetti code here. Eval may not be the best replacement/alternative, but I cannot tell without knowing what you are attempting to achieve at the forest level, not just the tree level. What is a "collection of divisions"? Why do I need them? What business purpose do they serve?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Why would you want to do that?  Because you obviously have a problem with HOFs, and I thought you might want to show me how you could do it better or at least without HOFs.  The "collection of divisions" (I assume you know what HTML 'divisions' or <div>s are, yes?) is, as far as I know, part of a communications system that uses each div to show status of a user, but it might be the status of a device because there was mention of that in the discussion.  Maybe it's for both.  I don't know and it doesn't matter.  I was tasked to address the situation where a large number of divs need to be updated asynchronously using AJAX so neither the page nor some large portion thereof need to be bulk-reloaded, and that's what I came up with.

           <em>Why not put everything in one routine?  That means launching the AJAX transactions must run serially.  One delayed launch -- due to a network or server hiccup -- will delay all that follow it.  Anyway, it's merely one illustration of the facility of HOFs.</em>

            <li>
               You didn't state separation as a requirement. I cannot read your mind, dude. There will be overhead with separation of processes such it should not be a default assumption.

          <ul>
            <li>
               As far as timers, I'd probably make them more like an OS scheduler: a "list" (table) of "launch strings" along with attributes and time info. In short, a <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a>. And it has the advantage of mixing and matching languages/tools if we need. The <a href="PowerOfPlainText.html">PowerOfPlainText</a>. I know that's different than <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>'s design philosophy, but this is not a language shoot-out, is it?

               <em>Heavens.</em>

      <p>
        Also, generally for something custom, one doesn't have to worry about making it overly generic such that it can accept any type etc. It's for a specific purpose and type and the person paying you usually isn't asking for mass reuse-ability, but to solve a specific request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that in my many years in "the industry", I have never been asked for something like a custom aggregator. There are usually ways to compute such with existing tools, and they are probably too industry-specific to qualify as something generic. SQL's overly-large granularity often complicates such, but that's a debate over query languages, not HOF's.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Whether you're a developer who's never needed a custom aggregator, or a developer who creates them on a daily basis, could come down to the difference between (say) being a developer of financial reporting applications that mainly present summaries of historical data, vs being a developer of sales forecasting applications that frequently need one-off regression techniques.  In either case, the job is almost the same -- "custom biz app" developer -- but the requirements and what you focus on might be dramatically different.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, nothing should force you to use HOFs if you don't want to, but isn't it better to have a language with a specialised capability that you don't need than to want that capability and not have it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere there is a topic on the trade-offs of this. The more ways there are to do something, the more techniques a developer has to learn to work with in existing code. It increases recruiting and training costs, and is thus not a free lunch. Anyhow, I don't think this topic is really about what features to have in a programming language, but rather whether HOF's can "significantly simplify" typical custom biz apps, which is the primary claim being addressed if I am not mistaking. I don't dispute that once in a blue moon there may be a biz app they can simplify, but I just don't see evidence of ubiquitous improvement. It may exist, I just haven't seen it via inspect-able source code. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't know why providing HOFs in a language would increase recruiting or training costs.  Hiring and training Java developers didn't become more expensive when Java introduced anonymous inner classes.  Hiring and training C# developers didn't become more expensive when C# introduced lambdas.  These are language features that are handy, but not necessary -- at least, compared to (say) being able to evaluate expressions, which is absolutely necessary.  You can effectively use these languages without even being aware of such specialised features, and neither language had them in their earlier versions.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If developers start using such features fairly often, then the maintainer has to know more about them. Without some careful survey, it's hard to say for sure either way whether it increases training time. Yes, it's "good to know", but personal improvement is perhaps a different issue than the economics of it from a business owner's perspective.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If developers start using such features fairly often, clearly they're finding them to be of value, which makes them worth additional training time.  Of course, "training time" for programming is usually the time it takes to obtain a </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> degree, so one feature represents no more additional time or cost than any other.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's essentially the <a href="ArgumentFromPopularity.html">ArgumentFromPopularity</a> fallacy. Many techniques are used out of habit, familiarity, boredom (<a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>), resume padding, job security, fad chasing, peer pressure, catchy cutesy graphics, etc.

      </ul>

        <li>
           <em>That's pretty cynical.  Are you basing it on evidence, or is it your opinion?  I mean, have you </em>'really<em>' seen developers using anonymous inner classes in Java for any reason other than slightly simpler code, usually in event handlers?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If popularity is the main metric, then Windows (desktop) is better than Unix, and MS <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> is the best language/tool. As far as Java, "Eval" can be used for dynamic event handlers in dynamic languages, which Java is not.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I think you've misunderstood my point.  There are numerous features that developers use because they're effective and simplify code or make it conceptually easier to write.  I see no evidence this has anything to do with boredom, job security, peer pressure, or anything other than a desire to muscle out a few lines of code with less effort than some earlier version of the same language or environment.  Java's anonymous inner classes are a good example.  So are C#'s properties, or more recently, C# lambdas.  HOFs fall into the same category of features.</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           List some specific projects, and maybe we can find one that we both agree is a "core" custom biz app. If you've been there a while, you should have a bigger variety than those that lean toward the math-centric side, like your prior attempts.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Sure.

Inventory for a national optometrist firm.  Billing for a plumbing firm. Sales forecasting and e-commerce for a gardening seed company.  Job costing for a window manufacturer.

      <ul>
        <li>
           I wish to see <em>coded</em> scenarios demonstrating the "significant" improvement that HOF's would add, not a resume. There are already anecdotes of such; that's not the evidence bottleneck. People would like to see for themselves the kinds of code reduction or hand/mouse movements reduced (or whatever the metric is). That way we can actually see the improvement "live" in action with our very own beady little eyes rather than have to take somebody's word for it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

           That's just the first phase. Then you need to code up enough mock parts to create a coded scenario of HOF's making life noticeably better. I can't do that because I don't know where the betterment is (allegedly) taking place exactly and how the betterment is being measured. -t

           I don't think I can give the details without giving away company specifics. Perhaps I can strip out org-specific stuff if I think about it for a good long time, but I cannot make any promises at this time. I have some possible ideas for a fancier demonstration version of Challenge 6 such that SQL-knowledgeable power-users can define more reports without programming. But if you see no value in Challenge 6 as-is, I doubt you'd want that. We already have the campus, payroll, and challenge-6 examples fleshed out to varying degrees to play with and which are familiar to <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a>; is there nothing in those to demonstrate HOF's being "clearly better"?

           I'm not sure what you mean. What is "realistic calculation"? It has basic validation. I agree it's a "small shop" app that may not be bullet-proof, but often that's good enough, especially if the users are nearby such that they can ask you about something if it goes wrong. Often these kinds of things are used to prototype reports. A heavy-duty fancy-pants one would make for an example that's too big for most readers. But a simple one can still have a lot of use. Being simple also means it's easier to dig in the code to make custom modifications. There are commercial tools like <a href="CrystalReports.html">CrystalReports</a>, but one cannot change the source code of such. This, you can both because it's relatively short code-wise, and you have the source code.

           No, I'm talking about Challenge 6. I realize a "real" system is going to be a much larger code-base. However, such is probably too big to deal with as an example on this wiki.

           I don't dismiss the idea that it might be re-implementable with HOFs. That's not the issue. As far as the cross-check, one runs two payroll systems: the formal production system, and a simpler approximating system. If one system says Fred gets paid 5.2k and the other says Fred gets paid 2.8k, then one should investigate Fred's calculations closer.

You'll also typically have a level of logging (e.g., fatal only, errors + fatal, errors + fatal + warnings, etc.) that varies depending on some external value, such as a user privilege or verbosity setting.

Custom biz apps tend to be CRUD screens and reports; i.e., data in, data out, minimal transformation.  If that's what you're developing, HOFs may be rarely desired, though the tools you're using may internally employ them extensively.  As noted above, however, for the times when you do want them -- such as custom aggregation -- they're handy and effective and arguably simpler than the alternatives.</em>

           I'm not sure what your point is. They repeated the claim even <em>after</em> I asked about evidence for the biz domain. If they intended to modify the scope of their claim, I don't recall seeing it in writing. My interpretation was that the benefits are either universal, or if there were exceptions, they didn't apply to biz. Here's paraphrased version of how I interpreted the sequence:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Mr. X: "FP is clearly better. You just have to study it."
            </li>
            <li>
               Me: "Is it clearly better in the custom biz domain?"
            </li>
            <li>
               Mr. X: "Again, if you take the time to study it, FP is clearly better."
            </li>
            <li>
               Although not explicitly stated, it appears they are "endorsing" it for biz also. That's my honest interpretation. -t
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Do you mean HOFs?  The discussion here is about HOFs, not functional programming in general.  My interpretation is that here the implicit context is that HOFs are superior to not having HOFs in every case where HOFs may be warranted.  Which is unquestionably true -- they're certainly superior to constructing and passing strings to EVAL mechanisms, which almost invariably require awkward string juggling including painful delimiter escaping, cause awkward issues with scope, and almost inevitably preclude pre-runtime type checking.  HOFs give you all of the benefits of EVAL with none of the downsides; typically not even additional complexity because the code is substantially the same as that passed to an EVAL, but replace "EVAL" with some syntax that says "this is a higher-order function".</em>

           This sounds like part of the larger "compiled versus dynamic/scripty" debate. The issue of "type safety" is already pretty well covered by those other debates. If "safety" is the overriding concern, then use functions/methods. If dynamicy is the driving factor, then use Eval. Specific to Eval versus HOF's, Eval has at least two advantages over HOF's:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Off-code storage of expressions. I can put the expressions in a database, for example.

           Tutorial-D, ugh. The key though is cross-tool/language sharing and storage of expressions. You have to use a monolithic tool-set to achieve it.

        <li>
           For one, they'd have to toss their existing RDBMS. And how could the expressions be stored in Tutorial D but actually used (processed) in say Python or Java or Dot.Net?

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Same way as with any SQL DBMS, and they won't have to toss their existing RDBMS because I'm working on mechanisms to tie in existing DBMSs via JDBC.

If an AI or statistics expert is brought in, then that section no longer falls under the working definition.  An org still may have the typical biz developer do experiments, but for something that uses/applies mass HOF's, I suspect most will fall outside of that.

One does not need to "massively register" statistical sub-calculations over time. The need to often add/change/delete statistical sub-functions without having to modify anything else is just not likely to exist by experience.

           Incidentally, perquisite checking is similar to some of the "oddity detection" and "employee bonus computation" reporting systems I've worked with. The hardest part is to create a user interface(s) such that power-users can manage most of the verification rules without calling on programmers often. It may be good job security for the programmer to micro-manage such rules, but it's not economical for the organization.  Thus, a way eventually must be devised to encode the rules in such a way that power-users can create, change, and manage rules without writing app code. (There are still going to be hand-coded stuff, but we want to minimize the need for it. I try to make it part of the UI such that "Test X" may be hard-coded, but the user can find and reuse it in a drop-down box or the like to incorporate it into the existing Rule Manager.) The bottleneck is generally dealing with the <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> of a power-user-friendly UI, not so much the hard-coding of the rules (which we are trying to avoid).

           HOF's make it more difficult to store business logic in the database, as either expressions or declarative/attribute-based rules. If the logic doesn't change much over time, then HOF's are not going to make a difference compared to traditional "procedural" programming. If there are a lot of changes, then end-users are eventually going to be brought into the mix to help create and manage such rules, and HOF's don't help much with a <a href="BusinessRulesMetabase.html">BusinessRulesMetabase</a>. It's not going to be about programmers writing new HOF's, but creating interfaces for power users to a <a href="BusinessRulesMetabase.html">BusinessRulesMetabase</a>.

           <em>If you're replacing code with end-user programming, that's a different issue entirely.  Of course, you know what usually happens as well as I do:  After an initial honeymoon period, some end-user get tired of the awkwardness and limitations of your hybrid "code in database"+"code in software" solution and concocts a code-based solution of their own in VB or whatever.  That end-user eventually winds up in the IT department, if her solutions are good enough to gain notice -- and that's who creates the "</em><a href="BusinessRulesMetabase.html">BusinessRulesMetabase</a>"...  In conventional code.  Otherwise, someone else replaces the "code in database"+"code in software" solution with an Excel spreadsheet.  Either way, awkward "code-n-load" solutions are rarely sustained.  At least the superior integration of the relational model into programming languages (e.g., research/educational efforts like the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>) show promise in this direction, but current mainstream tools make this approach essentially unworthy of notice in the programming community.<em></em>

           I never said the entire solution was "code in the database", in fact, most of it is NOT. There are ways to provide a flexible <a href="RuleBuilderInterface.html">RuleBuilderInterface</a> without using direct "code in database". <a href="BusinessRulesMetabase.html">BusinessRulesMetabase</a> describes some of these. And you are correct in that such a tool cannot handle <em>every rule</em>, but it doesn't need to. Specialized programming will still be needed. It's a kind of <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a>: 80% of the rules are controlled by power users, and 20% by programmers. Ideally a programmer tries to integrate hand-programmed rules into the rule system so that they are composible with the rest of the rule-building kit. For example, a typical pull-down list of <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> operators may have some domain-specific operations added among the usual "standards" (equals, not equals, starts with, ends with, etc.). Or extra pull-down conditions at the bottom. The power-user can then optionally incorporate them into other rule sets or projects (if made semi-generic). <strong>You seem to want to optimize the system for programmers while I want to optimize it for power-users.</strong> -t

           <em>Your </em><a href="PayrollExample.html">PayrollExample</a> appears to suggest that the majority of the solution should be "code in the database".  I certainly have no objection to providing end-user customisation and code generation.  When the requirements warrant it and appropriate users have the ability to use it, it's an excellent thing.  However, such features are completely orthogonal to HOFs.  I know of no circumstance where a programmer's choice would be, "do we use HOFs, or do we use 'code in the database'?"  In fact, the two can be complementary.  If HOFs are used as in <a href="HofPattern.html">HofPattern</a> to inject functions into a predefined algorithm, it's entirely reasonable for those functions to be evaluating expressions or other code loaded from a database.<em></em>

           A fancier version of PE could use rule and/or expression builders. Most likely the variations will be in the database meta configurations, not the HOF's such that they don't provide anything significantly helpful. I doubt they'd change often such that a case/switch statement is plenty good. A case statement is insufficient only if there are mass additions and changes to the HOF's available but a relatively stable interface for them. I haven't seen any scenario that would have such.

Yes, such users exist, but also slow and dull users, and we must cater to them as well. In some ways more so, because if something is too simple, both the quick person and the dull person can still use it satisfactory.

        I don't know if biz apps have "minimal transformation". It depends on how you define "transformation". They do a lot of "routing" of information based on various business rules. Group "A" may see (or receive) data group X, group B see data group X and Y, group C see something else, etc. The trick is not only to manage and define all this "routing", but allow users to see, understand, and/or control much of the routing also. ("Routing" here includes both virtual viewpoint alteration and actual "movement" of data. As far as power-users "controlling" it, see <a href="CompilingVersusMetaDataAid.html">CompilingVersusMetaDataAid</a>.)
