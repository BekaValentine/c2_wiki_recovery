        I am a collector of information. I have been all my life. In fact it was beginning to become a consumer of space such that I had to rent additional storage space to keep it. It will not continue to be so, for I am in the process of turning much of the information into one of two forms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Processed and Digitized Information stored on the collection of drives I have ranging in sizes up into the hundreds of gigabytes and perhaps soon to become several terabytes. I have a present goal of making that information and the ability to process it into the order of tens of terabytes. I am already in the range of over a quarter a terabyte and have only been digitizing for a few weeks. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Scrap, trash or recycled or donated ( in the case of books, magazines, etc ) Some valued real media not scanned will be retained for sentimental reasons. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is a single enterprise effort. I have formed a limited partnership with a couple of other individuals to make this possible. Presently one of the pair is <strong>virtual</strong>. This does not mean he/she does not exist, it only means that he/she fills, or can fill, a personnel slot. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have already assembled a few processes which process this information. Some of them are Commercial products as well as a collection hardware, and of software including routines, processes and compiled programs to aid me.

        There are several ambitious online processes which will be referenced, indexed as well. These will be in a class of accessible public sources and will not be totally replicated locally:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PublicDomain.html">PublicDomain</a> bookRepositories, as well and onlineBooks and openInformationSources.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One envisioned process will accept a question and then will provide a list of links to ten to fifteen ranked possible answers, which will be browsable by clicking the link. All of this is to take place Locally, with or without internet connection, with or without referenced and indexed information. Links which are not reachable will cause information to be displayed with information about where to find (perhaps in a storageCache), including equipmentToEnable, disksToInsert, printMediaToConsult (including books, articles, oneNotes, library, volume, pages), etc.
