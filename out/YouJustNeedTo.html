        <a href="YouJustNeedTo.html">YouJustNeedTo</a> is a phrase that if heard at an estimation session should trigger <a href="AlarmBells.html">AlarmBells</a>.

      <p>
        I mean, estimating software projects is easy, right?

        <a href="YouJustNeedTo.html">YouJustNeedTo</a> break the the client's request into <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> and then break your <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> into <a href="DevelopmentTasks.html">DevelopmentTasks</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tasks should be easy enough to estimate, between you and your team-mates you've done it all before so generating a nice little ball park estimate should spit out painlessly to the delight of the <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a>, and the <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> should slip effortless into the <a href="ProductBacklog.html">ProductBacklog</a> where they will be ready for snapping up at a Sprint near you.

        Wo, wo, wo, wo wo ... Actually ... let's do a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... we don't know where the source code is.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... we found it, but it's using a dated framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... we upgraded it, but it doesn't build.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... we fixed the bugs, the site builds but we've found the strip on the bottom of the site is hard coded on every page.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... ok include sorted, but really we don't want to do this again so... better use some sort of get-Date method.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... and better write a test (before someone works out you didn't <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>)

      <p>
        ... no test harness huh?. Ok, install x unit.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... what? the x unit download site is blocked by a firewall.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... hmmmm... better get my own deck of cards... going to hold up the Jack of Diamonds when next asked about this one ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Going to let the client know it would be cheaper to do fresh build.
