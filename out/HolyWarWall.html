        What do you do when key decisions run up against irreconcilable <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Recognise this, say so, and make the decision anyway, being open about the fact that you were unable to resolve the </em><a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> issue, but that you needed to decide something to make progress.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose it was mostly a personal preference. For you, paradigm X makes you about 20 percent more productive than paradigm Y, but the other side wants Y perhaps because they are more productive with Y. It is a <a href="ZeroSum.html">ZeroSum</a> decision more or less. You might think, "with enough BS or exaggeration I can justify X and get my way." That might be less than angelic, but what if the other side is doing the same? Everybody wants to reshape the world according to their ideal or preference. That is a natural human tendancy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Still think the above approach applies. Acknowledge that this is a </em><a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>, decide on X or Y (flip a coin if you have to), accepting that the answer may prove to be non-optimal, and get on with things.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Something that may decide the tool or paradigm for you for the next 4 years is kind of psychologically hard to decide by the toss of a coin.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The standard algorithm for tossing a coin is to ask a manager to decide.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That'll do, too.
