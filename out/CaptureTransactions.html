        Capture Transactions
      </h1>
      <p>
        You have an old system you want to replace by <a href="TestInjection.html">TestInjection</a>. But no one wants to sit down and write the functional tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CaptureTransactions.html">CaptureTransactions</a> going in and coming out of the system. Automate that. Dump your database before and after. Let your testers label each bag of in/out transactions + associated dump with the intent of their use of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now automate re-running a bag of captured transactions. Congratulations, now no one has to sit down and write the functional tests. --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        Excellent idea; I can see how this would be very useful to me on a number of projects. Does anyone know of pre-existing software for doing this, or strategies?  I am imagining this as a strategy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           capturing a "before" database dump and an "after" database dump
        </li>
        <li>
           computing the differences and store in a YAML file
        </li>
        <li>
           Allow user to delete fields from the YAML file (e.g. transaction_date)
        </li>
        <li>
           Write script to verify records and fields present in YAML file
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Update:</strong> I now have the budget to write a tool if one doesn't already exist (for PostgreSQL specifically).  Anyone know of one?  If not, I'll post reference to it here.
