        How to create threaded behaviors in Java?
      </p>
      <p>
        Answer 1: Extend Thread (this is rarely used):
      </p>
      <code>
        class MyThread extends Thread {<br/>
        public void run() { <br/>
        // ... <br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (new MyThread()).start();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Answer 2: Implement Runnable:
      </p>
      <code>
        class MyRunnable implements Runnable {<br/>
        public void run() { <br/>
        // ... <br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (new Thread(new MyRunnable())).start();<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The second method should be preferred in almost all situations. Only subclass Thread if you intend to change its behaviour, implement Runnable to provide a run() method for the standard thread class. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Why? Both approaches work equally well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Runnable is more reusable than Thread. A Runnable interface just tells that a piece of code can be 'run'. So it may be reused, for example, as the result of an action performed on a menu item, a combo box and in a separate timer-invoked thread. If you extend Thread, it will be useful only in that context -- </em><a href="VhIndukumar.html">VhIndukumar</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't understand.  Why is Runnable more reusable than Thread?  Specializations of Thread can be reused in those contexts as easily as implementations of Runnable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Runnable is an interface.  Thread is a class.  If you want a runnable </em><a href="ComboBox.html">ComboBox</a>, you can get just that.  But you cannot inherit from Thread and <a href="ComboBox.html">ComboBox</a>.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        But you don't need a runnable <a href="ComboBox.html">ComboBox</a> for any of the situations listed above.  In fact, I've been programming in Java for 7 years and I've never needed a runnable <a href="ComboBox.html">ComboBox</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've only heard one convincing reason to use Runnable -- for integration with a threading library like <a href="DougLea.html">DougLea</a>'s util.concurrent. See <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html">http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/classes/EDU/oswego/cs/dl/util/concurrent/intro.html</a> for more information.

        It is also recommendable to name your threads. E.g.:
      </p>
      <code>
        new Thread(someRunnable, "someRunnable").start();<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It's worth pointing out that you can easily make threads to run arbitrary methods using inner classes.
      </p>
      <code>
        final SomeClass target=someObject;<br/>
        (new Thread() { public void run() { target.someMethod(); }).start();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This probably qualifies as reaching too deep into the bag of tricks. <em>Bah. Perhaps create the thread in a separate statement from starting it, with an eye to the </em><a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>, but otherwise the intent is clear & straightforward. It's as close as you can get to createThread(functionPtr) as you're going to get in Java.<em></em>
