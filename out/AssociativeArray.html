        Associative Array
      </h1>
      <p>
        a.k.a. Map, Hash, Dictionary, ... an array keyed by an object or reference type, rather than an ordinal type.

        Easy syntactical access and usage of associative arrays is one of the biggest productivity boosters in recent languages. It's one of the biggest difference-makers between pre-1990 scripting/dynamic languages and post 1990 languages (year is approximate). I imagine that earlier languages excluded them due to performance hits. Fast hardware gave us a really nice gift. Thank You, Santamoore (<a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a>). --top

        Easy syntactical access includes but is not limited to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Parameter lists being optionally accessible as an associative array (perhaps with sequential integers for the positional parameters.
        </li>
        <li>
           Usage of both "dot" syntax (or equiv.) and bracket syntax in the same language. Thus, foo.bar and foo['bar'] are the same thing. Brackets must be used if punctuation etc. is part of the key. (Older languages sometimes had API's, but "foo.bar" is a lot cleaner than "getArrayValue('foo', 'bar')").
        </li>
        <li>
           Being interchange-able or same as objects. In other words, the value can be or serve as a function pointer/reference/name.
        </li>
      </ul>
