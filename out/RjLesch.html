        Questions on my mind:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Is there a technical term for what happens when a person looks at a particular word long enough that the word loses meaning?  I had this happen once while driving through the North Shore in Minnesota, and seeing the word "cabin" on every billboard and property sign we passed.  After a while, the word dissociated from its meaning and became just an object in itself.  (Disturbingly, it happened to me again in this forum when I was browsing through the entries in <a href="CategoryEvil.html">CategoryEvil</a>.  Brrr.)  I'm sure some linguist or psychologist has come up with a name for this.  Anyone know what it is?

        <em>I don't know what the word is but drop me a line if you find out. I would say it's something like de-sensitization. The word ceases to have it's attributed meaning and becomes just a symbol through over-exposure to the symbol without the meaning. I find I can prompt it by repeating a word over and over about one or two hundred times. Not that I spend my days destroying the meaning of words but... -- </em><a href="IainLowe.html">IainLowe</a><em></em>

        The <a href="ShakerQuote.html">ShakerQuote</a> reminded me of this joke:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong>  How do you make a statue of an elephant?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>  Take a block of marble, and cut away everything that doesn't look like an elephant.
