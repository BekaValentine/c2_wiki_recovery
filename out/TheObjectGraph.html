        The Object Graph
      </h1>
      <p>
        The term object graph refers to a graph of object references; an edge <a href="LabelledDirectedGraph.html">LabelledDirectedGraph</a>. In an object oriented system, each component exports a singly-rooted object graph and all operations performed by a component are modeled as message sends starting from its root.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, an object graph is a <a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a> and so must follow the namespace ideals in order to be comprehensible to human beings.
      </p>
      <p>
        An object graph may have any number of additional features built into its fabric. For instance, edges may keep track of their history; when they were created, when they were last traversed, and so on. In an orthogonally secure system, object graphs have built in security features such as <a href="PermissionFlags.html">PermissionFlags</a> at every edge.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a coherent, uniform system, the object graph doesn't refer to what's exported by any particular component of the system. Rather, since components are bound together in a way indistinguishable from objects within a particular component, THE object graph refers to the entirety of all objects within the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a distributed system, the object graph refers to the entirety of all objects in the informational universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BlueAbyss.html">BlueAbyss</a> calls for a unique global object graph stretching from machine to machine across the planet, all parts of it navigable by sufficiently privileged users.
