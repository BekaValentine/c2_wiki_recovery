        Wiki Page Deletion Bot
      </h1>
      <p>
        A type of <a href="WikiBot.html">WikiBot</a> that tries to prevent a particular page, which the bot author doesn't like, from existing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Operation is simple. Periodically, if the page is found to exist by the script, the script deletes it. Most such scripts then <a href="DoubleDelete.html">DoubleDelete</a> it with a second IP, to keep it from being restored via <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>. (In addition, in the current Wiki implementation, this removes the page from <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>; <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s who are <a href="QuickChangesJunkie.html">QuickChangesJunkie</a>s might not know it is gone).
      </p>
      <p>
        A few defenses against <a href="WikiPageDeletionBot.html">WikiPageDeletionBot</a>s (that <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s can employ):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Keep an offline copy of the page around - <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> will expire after a while, and I wouldn't depend on Google's cache.
        </li>
        <li>
           Rename the page (or copy it to a new location with an obvious name). Chances are, the <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a> will notice this and modify the script accordingly. The good and bad of this:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Attempts to delete all copies are more likely to trip the <a href="SurgeProtector.html">SurgeProtector</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               However, there would be a bit more load on the servers.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
