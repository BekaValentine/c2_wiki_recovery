        South Facing Outdoors
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>'s patterns (pattern #105, page 513) that basically says people like to be in outdoor spaces that face South (no shade).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note the subtle northern-hemispheric bias.</em> Noted, is this a highly important point?
      </p>
      <p>
        As a patterns writer, I noticed it, because I was looking for how he handled conflicting contexts (N. vs. S. hemisphere, in this case, childless vs. large families in another case.).   He handles it in the context.  He also made it clear the driver was "no shade", not "south".  --Alistair
