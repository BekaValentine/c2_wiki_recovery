        EDS did a great commercial during the SuperBowl with a Western theme about <a href="HerdingCats.html">HerdingCats</a>. As a manager of programmers, the ad leaves me laughing every time I watch it. They followed it up next year with their "running of the squirrels" commercial, which is (almost) as funny.

        <em>It of course pre-dates Dilbert; a source as early as 1985 is given here: </em><a href="TheHerdOfKittens.html">TheHerdOfKittens</a>. And I would guess it's older than that.<em></em>

        I think I saw it in the Unix (BSD) fortune file around 1985 or 86.

        A senior manager in Siemens I worked for in the late 90s described my job to me (managing a team of programmers) as 'Herding irate kittens while wearing oven gloves'.
