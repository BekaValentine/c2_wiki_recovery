        Over the years, I've had the privilege of working with a lot of very productive teams.  Sometimes I even think I had something to do with their formation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some of the common good elements of those teams.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Technically sound.</strong>  They always had good people on them.  Not necessarily great people, but people who could do the job.  Great people help, of course.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Belief in the project.</strong>  The team usually believed more in what it was doing than in anything else around it.  They weren't just there to do a job, they were there to accomplish some higher goal.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Belief in the team.</strong>  The team was built on trust, very real trust.  They didn't have to agree, but they had to trust every member to do his or her job.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Belief in the process.</strong> The team believed that their way of doing things could and would result in success.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Introspective.</strong>  The team paid attention to what worked and what didn't, and changed in response to what it learned.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is a collection of practices that have worked over the years, for a number of people.  <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> has brought them together, but they have been part of successful projects for a very long time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The specific rules are helpful, but what is important are the values: Simplicity, Communication, Testing, Aggressiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a team is essentially healthy, you can find those values in it and reinforce them.  If it isn't ... well, I've never known a bunch of programmers who didn't want to be successful and have a good time ... and I hope I never do.
      </p>
      <p>
        More when I know more ... and please, help me.
