          -2008: working on trying to get my team to be more agile.  I've recently become <a href="TestInfected.html">TestInfected</a> though the condition doesn't appear to be spreading. <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> via <a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a> is working nicely; a few of us can really go on a tear when <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> but there are others that "clam up" or actively resist.

          : There's still heavy organizational resistance to both test automation and static analysis, and pairing is less resented but still seen only as a means to unblock a solo programmer.

        I am a believer in <a href="TransparentPersistence.html">TransparentPersistence</a>, and see <a href="PrevalenceLayer.html">PrevalenceLayer</a>s as an effective low-end solution to the problem.  I've written one or two to support oddball platforms; in my current work it's rare for the data set to exceed 5 MB in RAM, and usually produces snapshots under 20 kB on disk.

        The biggest complaints I get are that a number of other programmers just plain don't like designs based on <a href="LiberatingConstraint.html">LiberatingConstraint</a>s (for example, <a href="PrevalenceLayer.html">PrevalenceLayer</a> requires <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>), claiming that the use of design constraints breaks <a href="TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> for new requirements.
