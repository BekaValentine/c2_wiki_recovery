        <strong>Introduction</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am an internship student working in Mitel Corporation, Ottawa, Canada (<a href="http://www.mitel.com),">http://www.mitel.com),</a> I work in a Java project group which uses Java, <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a> and CORBA architecture extensively. I learn new knowledges constantly and get better working experiences throughout my internship, I appreciate my university (AcadiaUniversity) in providing this COOP/Internship program for all science students to work in companies prior their graduation.

        My major interests are designing interactive applications in Java, such as, video conferencing, computer-telephony intergrate applications, etc. I attended the SIGS Conference for Java Developers in Sept 7 till Sept 10, 97 as a Student Volunteer, as I could not afford to pay US 1300 by myself. I am still a poor student :(

      <p>
        In these 4-day conference, I attended several technical sessions, such as
