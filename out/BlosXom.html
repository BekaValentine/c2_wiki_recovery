        Blos Xom

      <p>
        Blosxom is a lightweight yet robust and featureful <a href="WebLog.html">WebLog</a> application written in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> with a <a href="LessIsMore.html">LessIsMore</a> approach to its own code and an architecture that allows for easy development of PlugIns to extend its functionality.

      </ul>
      <p>
        It's much more <a href="WabiSabi.html">WabiSabi</a> than something large like <a href="MovableType.html">MovableType</a>.

        <em></em><a href="BlosXom.html">BlosXom</a> is <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a>.  May I suggest BlosxomBlogger?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The name was picked deliberately - the "x" in "Blosxom" refers to <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> (properly spelt Mac OS X), for which it was originally developed. Also, BlosxomBlogger is redolent of blogger.com, which it is most definitely not.
