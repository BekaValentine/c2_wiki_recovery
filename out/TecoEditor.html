        <strong>TECO - Tape [later <em>text</em>] Editor/COrrector</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A combination text editor/really horrible <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>. To quote the paper "<a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>s don't use Pascal" (1983):

      <p>
        It has been observed that a TECO command sequence more closely resembles transmission line noise than readable text. One of the more entertaining games to play with TECO is to type your name in as a command line and try to guess what it does. Just about any possible typing error while talking with TECO will probably destroy your program, or even worse-- introduce subtle and mysterious bugs in a once working subroutine.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It should be noted that this quote is actually the biggest single mistake contained in the "Real Programmer" paper.  Real Programmers never needed to "type your name in as a {TECO} command line and try to guess what it does"; Real Programmers knew EXACTLY what the effect of their name would be to the text.  Only a Quiche-Eater would have to guess.]

        Some implementations of TECO were even more monstrous than most. I recall the version developed up at MIT for their PDP-10s (running under the
        <a href="IncompatibleTimeSharingSystem.html">IncompatibleTimeSharingSystem</a>) had upwards of 400 commands, most of them more or less random two- to four-letter combinations. Kind
        of like Unix, come to think of it. :-) -- <a href="GaryBisaga.html">GaryBisaga</a>

        <em>According to the </em><a href="JargonFile.html">JargonFile</a>'s entry for TECO (<a href="http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/TECO.html),">http://www.catb.org/~esr/jargon/html/T/TECO.html),</a> "It is literally the case that every string of characters is a valid TECO program (though probably not a useful one); one common game used to be mentally working out what the TECO commands corresponding to human names did."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Monstrous it may be, but I still prefer it to vi.   Incidentally, the
        <a href="IncompatibleTimeSharingSystem.html">IncompatibleTimeSharingSystem</a> version of TECO was used by <a href="RichardStallman.html">RichardStallman</a>
        to implement the original <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a> (Editor MACrosS), and Gosper implemented the <a href="GameOfLife.html">GameOfLife</a>
        in it. -- <a href="DonaldFisk.html">DonaldFisk</a>

        <em>Initially, if I remember correctly, EMACS was Eugene Ciccarelli's init file which made use of MIT TECO's ^R mode ("Realtime") that repainted the screen.  RMS started hacking on it around '76 I think and it kind of, um, grew."</em>

        To see what the syntax for TECO is like, look at <a href="http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/teco/TecoPocketGuide.html">http://www.avanthar.com/healyzh/teco/TecoPocketGuide.html</a> . Then weep.

        <em>TECO is/was an extraordinarily ugly macro language, but also very powerful. I once wrote an animation in ASCII graphics of a stick figure man juggling three balls, in TECO. As much as I like vi (well, vi clones), I wouldn't know how to begin to do such a thing in e.g. vim. It's obvious that it could be done in modern EMACS, but no one would want to.</em> Which doesn't seem to stop them. ;)

        TECO was written by Dan Murphy (<a href="http://www.opost.com/dlm/">http://www.opost.com/dlm/</a> ) and modern versions/ports of it are available at: Tom Almy's pages: <a href="http://almy.us/teco.html">http://almy.us/teco.html</a>

        Paul Cantrell has released a particularly interactive version of TECO called Video TECO.  <a href="http://videoteco.sourceforge.net/">http://videoteco.sourceforge.net/</a> has source available via CVS. A manual for this version is at <a href="http://www.copters.com/teco.html">http://www.copters.com/teco.html</a> .

        Once we had those glass teletypes running at really fast speeds - 1200 and even 2400 baud! - somebody did write a set of visual TECO macros to allow screen editing.  A quick glance suggests that Cantrell's work seems to be more oriented to allowing TECO syntax while doing screen display.
