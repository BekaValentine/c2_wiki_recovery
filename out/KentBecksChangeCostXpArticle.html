        <em>So true, they can't. Consider two new airframes. The one on the left has flown 10,000 hours of tests. At the beginning, it crashed a lot. Lately, it hasn't crashed at all. The one on the right hasn't been tested. You need to get home from this desert island. Which one will you ride in? Justify your answer. -- </em><a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a><em></em>

        Congratulations, <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and the XP team, on the article in <a href="CppReport.html">CppReport</a>. I was impressed by <a href="RobertMartin.html">RobertMartin</a>'s editorial comments: "...it may represent one of the most unique contributions to software development since <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>". I hope this leads to a new wave of pragmatic methodologies, and a return to the source. -- <a href="ScottJohnston.html">ScottJohnston</a>
