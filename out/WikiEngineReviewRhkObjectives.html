        Wiki Engine Review Rhk Objectives
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>My (rhkramer's) Wiki Objectives</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the reasons I want to choose / use / obtain a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> (or <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        My criteria for choosing a wiki are on <a href="WikiEngineReviewRhkCriteria.html">WikiEngineReviewRhkCriteria</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking for wikis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           to run on my own Linux computer (or possibly from a <a href="WikiFarm.html">WikiFarm</a>) for my own personal notes (replacing <a href="AskSam.html">AskSam</a> which I run on Windows)
        </li>
        <li>
            to use for the LVLUG (Lehigh Valley Linux Users Group), which would probably be run on their server
        </li>
        <li>
           to (potentially) provide discussion forums for Lyx (and KLyX), Linux, and C++, these would probably be on a <a href="WikiFarm.html">WikiFarm</a>. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I notice </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> has many pages on C++ that look helpful.  I may just contribute to their Wiki pages, although I don't know if they want to cover what I want to cover.  I am trying to learn (C and) C++ -- I want a Wiki to record my learnings in a way that will help the newbie, something like the few Linux pages I put on the CLUG.  See <a href="http://www.clug.org/cgi/wiki.cgi?UsingLinuxCommands.">http://www.clug.org/cgi/wiki.cgi?UsingLinuxCommands.</a>  -- rhk<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I also have some strange thoughts about trying to program or document programs using a Wiki (or at least something with hypertext links).  <em>Looks like Ward has already done this with his </em><a href="HyperPerl.html">HyperPerl</a>, see <a href="http:wikibase?HyperPerl.''">http:wikibase?HyperPerl.''</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You might want to take a look at </em><a href="http://leo.sourceforge.net/">http://leo.sourceforge.net/</a> -- <a href="RolandKaufmann.html">RolandKaufmann</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (A year ago I wrote a large program in Visual Basic in a "semi-literate" (ala Donald Knuth) style using Microsoft Word.  When I wanted to run the program I saved it as plain text and renamed it with the appropriate VB extension.  One advantage was that, in Word I could write extensive comments which were obvious and visible because they "wrapped".	When I  worked in the VB debugger the comments were less obtrusive because they did not wrap, they just extended to the right (to infinity ;-).  (And, they were in a different color.))
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I am a Linux newbie, I want to initially run my own wiki on a farm (or continue to use <a href="AskSam.html">AskSam</a>) until I manage to set up a wiki on my own machine.  One criteria is that it be simple to set up.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are more experienced people in the LVLUG, which means they can handle a more complicated wiki if it has advantages.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For the other public wikis, I expect to use a <a href="WikiFarm.html">WikiFarm</a>, because I don't have the resources to maintain my own server on the Web.  (Unless I find appropriate sponsors / hosts -- <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> would be a clear candidate.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be ideal if one <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> met all these needs.
