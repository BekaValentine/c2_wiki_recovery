        It's been quite a while since I last visited wiki and created this page. Now that I've actually written more than a <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> here, I guess I should put some real information here too.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tend to write in <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> and sign my contributions (blame my <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> experience), but feel free to consider my comments free game for editing even if they're not tagged with an <a href="OpenAuthor.html">OpenAuthor</a> badge.

        Given a choice, I prefer to write my programs in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, or in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> if a lower level approach is required.  At work I'm also learning to do <a href="JavaServlets.html">JavaServlets</a>, and I still remember 680x0 assembly even though it's been a while since I wrote any (and I still think of <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> as a convenient shorthand for assembly).
      </p>

        I have no experience of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> so far, but I'm trying to get things moving in that direction at work, mostly because it could hardly fail to be an improvement over the current situation. :-( I've been trying <a href="ExtremeProgrammingForOne.html">ExtremeProgrammingForOne</a> on a study-related Java project, and it seems to work great except when Java decides to be a PainInTheAss.

        Hello from another wiki.fi addict! What's the likelihood you like near Tornio? (I know: really, really small) -- <a href="ShaeErisson.html">ShaeErisson</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Approaching zero, unless you define Helsinki as being near Tornio.
      </p>

        Well, I keep wishing for local computer people -- se
