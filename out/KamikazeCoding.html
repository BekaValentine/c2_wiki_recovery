      <p>
        <a href="KamikazeCoding.html">KamikazeCoding</a> is what happens when you've got a huge change to make, and you decide to just fix it all at once without consulting your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s each step of the way. You just jump in and code! 
      </p>
      <p>
        You start tinkering around, and tinkering some more, and pretty soon your program is so far gone that it's almost a <a href="DeathMarch.html">DeathMarch</a> project just to get it working again.

        I used to do that, but I've seen the light! <a href="RefactoringIsPainless.html">RefactoringIsPainless</a>!

        It is folly to write a lot of code without running it frequently as you go, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s or no <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. But, it's not necessarily a <a href="DeathMarch.html">DeathMarch</a> to get it working again. It depends on you, your coding style, the problem at hand and the rest of the system.

      <p>
        If you have good source code control, you just delete the mess you made and revert back to the last known good version where all the tests passed.  You <em>are</em> using good version control, right?
