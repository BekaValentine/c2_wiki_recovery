        Overhauling Style Sheets
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="BradyBunchGridDiscussion.html">BradyBunchGridDiscussion</a>, a possible approach to replace style-sheets was hinted at. Here's an adjusted snippet:
      </p>
      <code>
        <attribset name=<strong>"atr"</strong>><br/>
        <attrib name="autorefresh" value="yes"/><br/>
        <attrib name="width"  value=200/><br/>
        <attrib name="height" value=200/><br/>
        <attrib name="float"  value="left"/><br/>
        <attrib name="autoscroll" value="yes"/><br/>
        <attrib name="border" value=1><br/>
        </attribset><br/>
        ...<br/>
        <div>  <!-- row 1 --><br/>
        <framediv attribs=<strong>"atr"</strong> interval=2.5 src="panel.php?x=1&y=1"/><br/>
        </div><br/>
        <div>  <!-- row 2 --><br/>
        <framediv attribs=<strong>"atr"</strong> interval=4.0 src="panel.php?x=1&y=2"/><br/>
        </div><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <a href="GuiMarkupProposal.html">GuiMarkupProposal</a> "Templating" offers another syntax possibility that is more compact:
      </p>
      <code>
        <template name="tp01" autorefresh="yes" width=200 height=200 float="left" autoscroll="yes" border=1><br/>
        ...<br/>
        <div>  <!-- row 1 --><br/>
        <framediv refTemplate="tp01" interval=2.5 src="panel.php?x=1&y=1"/><br/>
        </div><br/>
        <div>  <!-- row 2 --><br/>
        <framediv refTemplate="tp01" interval=4.0 src="panel.php?x=1&y=2"/><br/>
        </div><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Not sure I like the name "refTemplate", but this is just an illustration. And we could have a hierarchy such as "refTemplate='tp01,tp02,tp03'".
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, the idea that style-sheets are a separate "kind" of thing different from markup is tossed. The "inheritance" mechanism used for the markup (a GUI markup language in that case) could just as well be used for style-oriented elements. Thus, we don't have to reinvent the wheel twice for markup inheritance and style inheritance. (The borderline between what is semantic and what is "style" is blurry anyhow.)
      </p>
      <p>
        An improvement can be made by allowing <strong>multiple inheritance</strong>, similar to what the existing HTML "class" attribute can already do:
      </p>
      <code>
        <sampleTag attribs="atr,atr2,atr3"  etc="etc"/><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The first attribute set ("atr" in this case) receives priority if there is an overlap in attributes. (The HTML Class attribute uses spaces to separate class names. Commas are more readable in my opinion. But the specific syntax is not important at this point until somebody goes to implement it.
      </p>

        [What makes this better than CSS? It seems to be it'll just encourage mixing of markup and presentation, the avoidance of which is a major reason why stylesheets exist. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction is blurry in practice. This doesn't force mixing anyhow. And even if we do "separate" them, there's no reason to have them each in a different language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The distinction is only "blurry in practice" if you have failed to distinguish content (what is to be presented) from presentation style (how it is to be presented).  Whilst it is certainly possible for CSS to have been implemented using XML, it would have been overkill, because CSS is strictly about setting values of properties.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One can force a distinction, but often it's an arbitrary line in the sand. The customer says "make the page look like this", and they don't necessarily categorize what is what; they just want thing X in spot Y because they do and they call the shots. It's like yard landscaping: you can make recommendations and suggestions, but the house owner ultimately decides where stuff goes and how it looks. I cannot and am not paid to read their mind and so cannot classify their thinking into some idealistic categories. <a href="PrematureAbstraction.html">PrematureAbstraction</a>. (Perhaps complicated by a central "style cop" versus a department user with a sub-site.) And XML is perfectly capable of setting values on properties. If we want to classify by tag or attribute name for some unstated reason, we can have parsers that do that. I'm not sure what practical problem you are solving by treating them as very distinct things and using different languages for each.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is not "an arbitrary line in the sand", unless you do not understand the distinction.  HTML is a markup language.  CSS is a property-setting language.  Both are minimal syntax sufficient to implement their respective semantics.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You haven't said anything concrete or distinguishing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, I have.  Your apparent lack of recognition of this is telling.  Do you understand the distinction between content and presentation?  Do you understand the difference between a markup language and a property-setting language?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's look at something more concrete. Let's say we have a web page with one and only one little "panel" that the "customer" has asked to float to the right in the middle of the page with a picture and a little table of statistics. Whether floating to the right is semantics or a presentation style can be argued either way. It's the method chosen by the customer to present their idea/content. <strong>Presentation is communication</strong> (or at least can be). Whether the presentation contributes to communication of the idea or is "mere decoration" is difficult to pin down, especially for marketing-oriented stuff. And it's probably a philosophical question beyond the worth of having a developer/designer get overly concerned about. If the customer wants X red, make the damned thing red. It's a wasteful thing to obsess on the classification of the "red-ativity".
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Floating to the right is presentation. It helps that HTML doesn't actually have a way to specify floating-to-the-right, while CSS does, in narrowing that down. Making things red is also presentation. The correct thing to do, in fact, is ask <em>why</em> the thing is red and to encapsulate the en-reddening CSS into a semantically-descriptive class name; for instance, if the thing is red to draw attention to a fatal error, it should have a class "error", not a class "red" or inline CSS setting its colours. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
           In my experience such attempts at generalization often fail. (<a href="PrematureAbstraction.html">PrematureAbstraction</a>.) If we know up front we have a standard "error color", sure, make it a formal class. However, a good many things don't fall into neat categories or drift over time or the customer doesn't know what they want. If it's a one-off thing, it's best to embed the sucker near the originating object to avoid hoppity-hop maintenance steps. If a pattern grows over time, then one can refactor. Some <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> principle applies here also. In other words, wait until it really is a one-to-many relationship (or highly likely to be) before preparing for a one-to-many relationship. <strong>Don't force categorization or indirection before it's ready.</strong> -t

           [It's not actually generalisation. It's keeping markup semantic, instead of physical. The markup should say "this box is an error", never "this box is red"; it's a presentational issue that "errors are red". We actually don't need to know up-front that errors are red; we just need to know that there <em>are</em> errors, because if we only specify "errors are red" in the stylesheet once, we'll only need to replace it with orange once. -DavidMcLean]

           [If you're tasked with making something red, ask why it's red, then use a class name that describes the why instead of the what. It's not complex; all it requires is that your customer actually have a point behind making decisions. To quote you, 'it doesn't make a very good example/demo if you just say, "The customer told me to make it that way; I don't know why it has pink counter-rotating flowers that squirt lemonade."'. -DavidMcLean]

           For once you pay attention to what I write. I'm in shock! Sometimes the customer either doesn't really know or is not in a mood to tell. You ask, but they are not ready to answer, and you move on because one often has bigger fish to fry in the app/site. But if they told me such, then I would normally avoid using their specific request as an example here; but in this case the issue is about dealing with the existence of non-explanations during design and coding. Vagueness does happen often. Maybe later a pattern will emerge, but it takes time and patience.

           [Yes, it's certainly true that the customer won't always elaborate on particular points or mightn't be able to. That doesn't make mixed markup and presentation a <em>good</em> thing, though: It's still bad practice, just currently unavoidable bad practice. -DavidMcLean]

           That's probably moot because the current disability software products generally don't substitute style-sheets anyhow to extract needed info and could in theory perform the very same transformation operations on local styles. The computer cares even less about location than a code maintainer (as long as info is not lost in the process). But I'm not an ADA lawyer.

      <p>
        Second, it doesn't make much sense to use one language for describe it as a DIV or a unit and another for location info. Why the hell toggle between languages? I see no logic or rational. Doing it to "remind developer about separation" is weak, per above.
      </p>
      <p>
        The partitioning should be based on estimated likely <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a>s, not some <strong>goofy arbitrary philosophical distinction</strong>. Misguided idealism f8cked up the current practice and the CSS designers should be slapped with a large wet curly brace.
      </p>
      <p>
        [It's not arbitrary nor philosophical. Content and presentation are (quite obviously, really) different things. On the Web, content lives in HTML, and presentation lives in CSS. Both languages, as noted above, are the minimum syntax necessary to specify their respective semantics. Because presentation information does not require arbitrarily-nested markup, as HTML content does, CSS does not need to support those features; all it must do is associate properties with selectors, and it uses a simple yet effective syntax well-geared toward specifying the required selectors and properties. XML doesn't afford the same capability, because it's a way to encode <em>trees</em>, and CSS doesn't constitute a tree. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        CSS <strong>should</strong> allow for tree-ness (and can indirectly using class lists and other tricks). Defaults/inheritance can apply to styles also and we don't want to repeat or micromanage each element styling if possible. For example, we may want to make a special "error style" for some elements to highlight errors, but not all. If there is an error, we may want to put a red box around DIV's and buttons but <em>not</em> SPAN's (or vise verse). Thus, we want the SPAN style to default to a wider category if not explicitly overridden by error-centric CSS. Ideally we could address a general area or DIV as being under the "error" mode and elements designated to recognize error-ness style themselves differently than the default style, if given an error-style.

      <ul>
        <li>
           [None of that stuff you describe is tree-ness, but it pretty much is how CSS already works. What's it missing? -DavidMcLean]

        If the distinction between content and presentation is truly clear, I invite you to write the algorithm/steps in a clear way. Otherwise, I remember skeptical and so should readers.

        <li>
           [Content includes the actual text that will be displayed, coupled with the semantic metadata that HTML affords providing structure, such as "this is a paragraph", "this bit's an article", "this particular string of text happens to be a citation". Presentation includes exactly how all those structural elements are arranged and appear on the page, including colours, sizes, margins, locations, whether text is displayed in bold or italics or perhaps underlined, font sizes and families, what kind of bullets to show on an unordered list, and so on. -DavidMcLean]

        <li>
           Often there are exceptions to the rules or custom thingy-mobobs that have yet to be classified or fall into a clear pattern. For example, a certain style of ad that is still being worked out such it's premature to group them under one umbrella. Domain or shop conventions often arise organically.

           No! Again, separation can make one hop around a lot during maintenance and reading. Factor because there's a one-to-many relationship, but not "stretched" one-to-one relationships. Separation is nearly useless for one-to-one relationships. <strong>Cluttering up style-sheets with one-off styles makes for bloat and confusion. </strong>

           <em>No!  Separation eliminates the need to consider irrelevancies like colours, font, backgrounds and layout when developing presentation of content.

        <li>
           It's not a concern that goes away under either scenario, it's just a matter of how such things are managed. I've seen style sheets bloated up with one-off styles such that they were un-managable. Maybe if there was better coordination, it could be cleaner to read, but that takes high discipline. If the one-off styles are kept close to their object, then we generally don't have that particular problem.

        Further, it's illogical to have one default/inheritance technique for the markup and another different one for the styles. It should be uniform if possible so that one doesn't have to learn and remember two different ways to manage defaults/inheritance.

        A more powerful GUI markup language will best be served with some form of inheritance and/or templating. HTML is crippled in that regard, and is thus sometimes enhanced with SSI's, <a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a>, and other techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ah, okay, that does make sense. It's less "inheritance" you're finding HTML lacks and more the ability to define custom "subroutines", I think.

           Too many languages is one problem. Having to load bloated libraries for common typical GUI activities is another. HTML's lack of some factoring/referencing-based-reuse abilities is another. The jittery/clunky nature of DOM-centric GUI's is another.

           All else being equal, it's best to work in fewer language for a given project, wouldn't you agree? Solving the factoring problem with server-side scripting means that one solves the problem a different way for each app language. Giving HTML (or the equiv) this ability allows more standardization because we are not catering to different app languages. And if HTML had it, then it would be best if it used the same factoring approach(es) that CSS did so we don't don't have to remember multiple factoring techniques in different languages. Thus, fixing one problem exposes another problem that can be fixed by merging CSS and the markup (into a master markup) and giving them a common set of factoring techniques. It's factoring the factoring. -t

        <li>
           ["All else being equal", it's certainly better to work in fewer languages. But all else is not equal. HTML and CSS are domain-specific languages for describing markup and presentation, respectively. Disposing of either would necessitate adding complexity to one of the remaining two languages in the trifecta, as well as mixing that language's original purpose with some seriously unrelated concern. HTML can't readily use the same factoring approaches of CSS, simply because it doesn't do the same thing as CSS. There's nothing HTML specifies that it would make sense to "inherit" the way one does in CSS. Adding new tags to HTML, as AngularJS enables, is valuable, but as noted that's closer to subroutines than inheritance. -DavidMcLean]

        <strong>More Semantics versus Presentation Fuzz</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of a fuzzy boundary could be "kinds of ads" a company shows on its web pages. The "kind" may be defined by how they look, or what kind of content is present, or who "invented" the look or style or layout, or a combination. The "meaning" of their classifications may be very nebulous. The "types" may be just names given in an attempt to label a nebulus concept or set of concepts because a fuzzy name may be slightly better than no name, but is otherwise hard to pin down and may not be pin-down-able. Forced classification can be <a href="PrematureAbstraction.html">PrematureAbstraction</a>. Such domain abstractions often change in an organic and unpredictable way.

        We have pre-defined historical conventions in text such as "paragraph", "block quote", etc., but domain-specific things don't necessarily have a reliable history. And the semantics versus presentation-ness is hokey even in the established ones. A numbered list could be considered a presentation choice versus a bulleted list, for example. Even the concept of a "table" can be fuzzy. The choice to present a physical grid versus the following is also a presentation choice:

        Perhaps HTML should have one tag, the TAG tag, which specifies the nesting relationship only. Everything else is "presentation". Whether you want to read a list as a list or a single-column table or a comma-separated item paragraph is purely a <strong>display choice</strong>: do you want your pea soup in a bowl or in a cup or on your enemy's lap? It facilitates universal customization. You don't have to settle for BLOCKQUOTE, but you can have different kinds of blockq-uotes, such as one color/style for quotations from the good guy and another color/style for the bad guy: GOODYQUOTE, BADDYQUOTE. Why have one syntax for standardized text elements (P, BLOCKQUOTE, etc.) and something different for non-standardized domain-specific or stupid-wishy-washy-customer-specific ones? Reserve label names, fine, but <strong>don't force a different syntax between built-in and non-built-in</strong> textual abstractions.

           [Your arguments seem to presume that HTML implies presentation that it doesn't. You're correct that you can present a list as a bulleted-list or as a single-column table or as a comma-separated item paragraph, and you're also correct that those are all display choices. You're incorrect in assuming that HTML doesn't already work that way: The <ul> tag doesn't mean "a bulleted list". It means "a collection of items for which order is not of prime importance"; by default, this is displayed in bulleted-list form, but there's absolutely no reason you can't make it show up as a table or a paragraph with comma separation. As for your example of "different kinds of blockquotes", we <em>could</em> allow for unlimited totally arbitrary tags in HTML. We don't, because if we did so HTML would actually not have any semantics. The built-in set of tags all have a particular meaning; as noted, <ul> is "a collection of items for which order is not of prime importance", for example. If tag names were entirely arbitrary, HTML would have no meaning independent of a stylesheet, and since stylesheets only impose presentational meaning that eliminates all structural semantics from the HTML, which has obvious issues in, for instance, accessibility. -DavidMcLean]

      <ul>
        <li>
           "Of prime importance" is nebulous in terms of whether the "importance" is semantics or presentation. I assert that we should not try to force such a classification up front. I'd perhaps consider such a "default presentation" if we want a flexible UI. Thus, the distinction between ordered list and unordered list is perhaps a "style" choice and the tag should really be LIST, not OL and UL. A style attribute can then be something like defaultListStyle:<numbered,lettered,roman,none>.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Importance is relative, and what if we don't have the knowledge of whether it is of "semantic importance" or not? We cannot always probe the author so deeply, being that there are probably many more important questions to get to first. Ideally we should be able to imply the semantic importance is "unknown" (or nil) if we don't know. We only know the draft used numbers, and so we make that the default display. I agree it's probably a nitpicky issue in this case, but in general the developer/designer shouldn't be <strong>forced</strong> to over-specify intent (oh oh, there's that word again). If we do it right, we'd make the semantic intent be an optional attribute/setting, not a forced and up-front thing. It's like having a mandatory gender (male/female) selector field on a planet full of androgynous hermaphrodites. (You know, the planet where David Bowie, Annie Lennox, and Michael Jackson came from.)

        <li>
           Please clarify, I'm not clear on how examining the list produces certainty. A guess is still a guess. It some cases we can guess with high certainty, in some cases low certainty. It's usually the developer's/preparer's job to deliver a product, and <strong>not</strong> primarily to classify the domain objects. A "default style" is plenty sufficient to encode the best guess without having to make any iron-clad classification statements. If we have iron-clad info, yes it would be a nice BONUS to be able to encode such info, perhaps in an optional attribute, but it shouldn't be the primary or forced mechanism. You are essentially forcing the up-front choice of bag versus set when most textual tools and writing conventions don't make that distinction; and the question would probably confuse the author and get you a odd glance.

In the abstract, it's not really possible to quantify how one goes about examining a list to determine whether it's ordered or unordered (or a key-value situation, which calls for a <dl>). In specific cases, one might notice timestamping, or an implication of sequencing between instructions, or some such factor. If we're receiving content from clients directly, we generally assume its initial markup is semantically accurate; this may be flawed in situations where clients don't know their semantics, of course, which is why we sometimes must use our human heuristics to attempt to infer the intended semantics. However, devs don't just accept raw content from clients and slap it onto a page alone. The site's layout must be considered and constructed (partially with HTML, and partially with CSS); while doing this, we apply the various tags structurally as is suitable: <em>Anything</em> that works as an ordered list of elements should be represented as an <ol>, for example.

           Sorry, I'm not following. Who is "them", end user or content author?  The most common info we reliably have from the author is default preference, and not much else. We cannot and should not assume we can infer deeper or more than that about what the end user should be allowed to do with the list. As a developer/designer, I'm not going to hard-code guesses that are mere guesses. If the end-user has a browser that can re-sort lists or turn on or off numbering (versus bullets or whatnot), I'm not going to attempt to restrict such activity unless there is a stated or obvious business need. You keep skirting the issue that usually we don't know the author(s)' "semantic" intent beyond a guess.

Blog posts may be sorted meaningfully in various ways (date, topic, tags, number of comments); the very fact that there are meaningful orders possible for blog posts means that order is meaningful for blog posts, and therefore they should be represented in semantic HTML as an <ol> of <li>s. Whether the end-user's browser is capable of re-sorting lists or customising the displayed numbering is irrelevant (most are in fact capable of the latter using user-styles anyway), and the decision to use an <ol> of <li>s does not in any way inhibit doing either. -DavidMcLean]

           You seem to be agreeing that OL versus UL is simply a "default display preference", but I am not sure. I still believe the distinction between semantics and display is either vague, or the differences require having subtle information that is often not practical to obtain such that in practice our design should not make the distinction required info. <strong>Sorting has philosophical elements of BOTH semantics and presentation</strong> such that my "default display preference" approach is the better K.I.S.S. The same given information can often be displayed in many different ways: as trees, as lists, as tables, as 3D floating graph blobs (as seen in a Java demo), etc. We cannot practically probe the author to ask and encode whether all possible display ways make sense semantically, and our own guess is merely a guess. HAS-A is more flexible than IS-A when there is domain ambiguity, and a default presentation indicator is closer to HAS-A. (If we play ELIZA with the author to probe their mental map of the domain, they'll slap us silly or call the Loony Bin to come pick us up.) -t

           That particular example is generally clear-cut, however, I've given an example of something that is not, or at least it's not realistic to go out and obtain semantics. I'll restate the scenario in more specific terms. As a developer or web publisher, you are given a MS-Word document of the content to put on a web-site. List X within the document is a bulleted list of "goals". It doesn't state that the topmost item is more important than the bottom-most; it's just a list. You are told not to "bother the author" except for "critical reasons". We can safely say or assume that the author wants the default display of List X to not be numbered, based on the Word document. However, we CANNOT safety say that "order doesn't matter" or that "order is not important" in List X. We can only make a solid (default) presentation decision/classification, NOT a semantic one. <strong>Our choice to use UL is not (solidly) based on semantics.</strong> And I gave another example about ads.

Whilst <ol> and <ul> are also distinct -- by virtue of legacy, as noted -- through CSS they can be made identical.

I generally run a kind of simulation of the future in my head, considering the different possible paths and their likelihood using past experience, and use an informal version of the kind of calculations shown in <a href="DecisionMathAndYagni.html">DecisionMathAndYagni</a> to make such decisions on indirection/fan-out.

           The alternative is "it's good because I say so and I declare myself smart."  I do things for a reason, and I try to articulate my reasons as best I can.

I would prefer similar counter models and observations from those with apposing viewpoints over "I just say so". A consolation prize is better than no prize.

To have the viewpoint that one should either have an <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> OR nothing is extreme, in my opinion.

           We also want to remove repetition of learning other DB-like products and repetition of rewrites upon vendor swaps or changes in implementation due to improved technology. Similar for OS's. Standards are an attempt at reducing such repetition, and are thus a form of factoring.

           Maybe the first DB's did jumble these altogether. Over time the above components became their own topic such that algorithms were grouped and found under such labels and specialists specialized in aspects along these lines. Our "parts" formed their own working sub-language and became semi-off-the-shelf tools/algorithms for which we use to build new variations. If you make a new database, you grab the B-tree literature and/or C libraries because that "part" is mostly pre-made and road tested. Humans are lazy (or "economical"); we don't want to do more work if we can borrow others' work. It's kind of a "parts" culture that becomes a kind of standard. If you want to make a new gizmo, it's easier to walk into a hardware store to get pre-made components rather than hand-shape all your root parts from scratch from rocks and soil. Alien intelligences may partition their "standardized IT concepts" and databases quite differently. We only have one planet to observe, and its IT tools were largely formed and shaped by "western universities" and companies (US and Europe) between roughly the 1890's to 1970's, for good or bad.

      </ul>
      <ul>

           Note that I suspect our differentiation between file systems and databases is a historical accident, and things would have turned out better (single tool instead of 2) if the concepts merged early.

           Because I'm a lazy bastard who doesn't want to spend the time to reinvent the wheel (or different wheels). And if I make up or find too many new or different concepts, it's harder to find another maintainer. For example, if a comment says, "This is the hook to log parsing errors", the maintainer generally knows what's going on. However, if it said, "This is the blipniv to log traxurt errors", the maintainer is going to take longer to grok the code and either give up or charge more for his/her time.

           No, because we already have conventions and kits and samples and labels (for comments) for the necessary parts so we can save time/money by not reinventing the parts, including maintenance costs per those who know about the prior conventions. If it was a brand new kind of "thing" that had no precedent, then starting out as an undifferentiated blob of code and gradually factoring out commonality as it's encountered may be the way to go. But this doesn't go against my advice of not separating out 1-to-1 relationships without a clear reason. "The maintainers are used to having X separated from Y and get confused if it's not" may be a decent reason, unless maybe you feel it's time to break them of bad habits. But that's still a cost/benefit analysis where 2 paths are compared, a <a href="SimulationOfTheFuture.html">SimulationOfTheFuture</a>.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Whether they are pre-existing does matter. Reinventing parts from scratch is more resource-intensive than using off-the-shelf parts for both production costs and maintenance familiarity reasons.

           It's not just about purchasing, although that does come into play because if we cater to the way parts are sold or packaged (OSS), then we can later swap those parts out as needed. <a href="WhenInRome.html">WhenInRome</a>. If we use vocabulary and partitioning based on what maintainers are likely to be familiar with, then maintenance will generally be smoother. The maintainer will know what "parsing" is, but not zabniffing. Thus, we don't reinvent IT conventions unless we can identify a clear reason why they are not a decent fit.

        <li>
           For the second sentence, you'd need to better define "functionality". We know the value of separating out "parsing" from experience, for example, and it's a concept we can label (comments, variable names, etc.) to jog our future maintenance memory. It's a known IT meme, a "known language of parts". But for new things, or conflicting memes, I'd say <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> whether to split 1-to-1's or not.
        </li>

           <em>I have already identified functionality in the DBMS example above: "language parsing, query optimisation, query plan generation, data structure manipulation and file access".  This isn't a question of "whether to split 1-to-1's", whatever that is, but one of overall development strategy.  Once again: Do you consider it bad practice to separate or layer functionality in order to manage complexity?  That applies to new things as much as old, build or buy, and I don't know what you mean by "conflicting memes".</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In THIS case, probably "yes" (not having more details), for reasons already given. But that doesn't change my general <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> stance. A different app may have different considerations and/or the traditional IT conventions are not a good fit. As a general rule of thumb, I'd say it's best to partition on existing IT conventions, at least on the larger scale. But for one-off styles where the staff is not divided on style-versus-app, hard partitioning makes for more maintenance steps overall because one has to jump back and forth and match up to the <a href="MirrorModel.html">MirrorModel</a>. <a href="MirrorModel.html">MirrorModel</a>s add roughly 30% overhead compared to in-lining. Call it the <strong>indirection tax</strong>. Not only are the corresponding parts in separate files, but the matching has to be managed using match-names etc. One would not have the matching duty under in-lining, or at least it's less complicated because one does not have to worry about a global matching name-space. And it doesn't bloat up the "list" of global styles. The database scenario you gave doesn't create a mirror model so far as we know.

Concern "marking" is perhaps better than physical separation since we cannot separate all factors at the same time into different files (without making a big multi-indirection mess, the mother of all <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a>). Since they cannot all be split out, we must make decisions as to which to split out and which not to. If you are arguing "ALWAYS split concerns" (even if 1-to-1), then you are backing a rather extreme approach which almost no practitioner uses.

        Perhaps a compromise could be a local default style that is overridden by a "master style" set when available. This gives us a "self-contained thing", but also allows adapting to local customs (a shared sheet) if and when available. For example, the default font for all headings could be Arial when there is no master style sheet or if it's not ready yet.
