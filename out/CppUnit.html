        <strong>Philosophy of Test-Driven Development (TDD)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Assumption is the mother of all screw-ups; use TDD CASE software such as <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>.
        Don't <em>assume</em> that any part of your system works the way you <em>intend</em> it to -- be <strong>sure</strong> of it!
      </p>
      <p>
        Proper and diligent use of systems like <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> gives your code the kind of credibility that makes it truly useful. It can be counted on by yourself and others. It can be extended, modified, and distributed with confidence.

        <strong>Linking problem when using Helper macros ?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you create a project and write its unit test suites, the work is made easier through the use of the so-called helper macros : CPPUNIT_TEST_SUITE_NAMED_REGISTRATION, CPPUNIT_REGISTRY_ADD and CPPUNIT_REGISTRY_ADD_TO_DEFAULT.
        The problem is that if you use those macros in the source code file of a <a href="TestFixture.html">TestFixture</a> class (say MyTest as an example), and if you use a line like this one 
      </p>
      <code>
        runner.addTest( <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>::TestFactoryRegistry::getRegistry().makeTest() );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        in your main() function in file main.cpp, there will have no test run at all !
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason is simply that the link stage, one of the step of the build process, do not insert the object files (.obj or .o files) in the final executable if there is no undefined symbol in your main.cpp.
      </p>
      <p>
        That way, the object code which contains the AutoRegister static variables instantiation is not part of the final executable and is not able to insert oneself into the runner in the main() function.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have to create an undefined symbol in main.cpp so that the mytest.o file is integrated with main.o into the final executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Trick committed by Michel Nolard</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Could you explain more about that? I think I got the error you describe, but I don't know how to create undefine symbol.

        - With Visual Studio 6, you were able to add the DSPlugin.dll through the Add Macros menu option. In VS2003, it seem that you now do this through Tools->Add In Manager. There is information in the help regarding how to register the DLL so that will actually see the plugin. You'll find this under "Add in Registration" in the Visual Studio MSDN help. - JSprenger -

        I have been playing with <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> on SGI/IRIX systems. My company likes it. More importantly, I have played with Michael Feathers' enhancement where you can walk the inheritance tree and run tests as you go. I have run into a couple of problems with this. First, I would like to use friend declarations. That is, if I am performing unit tests of class Triangle, I would like to put a friend declaration in it for the test fixture that is exercising it. When I do that and also bolt in the tree-walk capability (following the BoardGame/Chess example), the compiler (SGI 7.3 compiler) complains about duplicate declarations of my test fixture. Why doesn't it like this?
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, in <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>::deleteContents(), it loops over a vector and deletes each pointer plus contents as it goes. I would get a coredump in here after adding the Treewalk logic. I was able to get rid of it by doing m_tests.clear() instead of the loop. Then, the coredump goes away. I inquired about our compiler or SGI implementation of the Standard Template Library on their machines to see if that was a problem. Have you guys experimented with this stuff without running into these problems?

        <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> for testing persistent objects
      </p>
      <p>
        How does one set up a test fixture to apply all tests to the same instance of the fixture object?
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem:    I was unsure how to use the STL map functionality (w.r.t. memory management) so I wanted to see how the map behaved as I added objects in different scopes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Constraint: For each test in a test fixture <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> creates a new test fixture object.  Thus for fixture <code>fixture1</code> containing tests <code>test1(), test2(), test3()</code>, <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> will create 3 instances of <code>fixture1</code> and call <code>test1()</code> on the first instance, <code>test2()</code> on the second instance etc...
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution:  Add a constructor to the <code>fixture1</code> class called <code>fixture1()</code>, insert all tests into the default constructor and add create an empty test <code>emptyTest()</code>.  
        The <code>emptyTest</code> should be the only test added to the fixture.  Thus when the <code>fixture1</code> object for the empty test is created the constructor runs all the necessary tests.

        I am considering using <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> in a VC++ environment and I had a few comments and questions:
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you have any recommendations on how to organize the unit tests and library?  Specifically:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do you unit-test your Release code?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do you put <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> subclasses in the same file as the tested class?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How do you separate test case classes from real classes?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I noticed that the projects are not set up to compile in Release mode. Debug builds fine, but the Release needs to have directories and linking information set.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, when you build Release mode, the sample test "testDivideByZero" does not show an error, but it works in Debug mode. I tracked the reason down to the optimization options. It turns out the entire test case is optimized away.  You would have to make changes to the fixture to make this work right in release mode, for instance storing the result in m_value1, or assert(result == 1). In this case you get a compiler warning about a "potential divide by zero", but the program works as expected.
      </p>

      <p>
        My guess for how you would use <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep your <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> subclasses in separate files in their own subdirectory.
        Have a separate project for the test code.
        Build and run your test project after each application code or test code change.
        At regular intervals (maybe every morning) build your application project and run the application.
        This way you can do debug or release builds of your application which contain no unit test code.

      </p>
      <p>
        ld complains that "relocations remain against allocatable but non-writable sections". This appears to be a direct effect of the ld being given the '-z text' option in the libtool provided with the distribution. This flag forces a fatal error in ld under the conditions complained about. This appears to be a related to references to external data (in libstdc++) from position dependent code (i.e. a dynamic object).  
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the Solaris 8 Linkers and Libraries Guide on sun.docs.com this can be eliminated by building position independent code (which I presume means building it as a static library) or by directing the linker to produce copy relocations when referencing external data (which, as of yet, I have been unable to get it to do successfully).  
      </p>

        p.s. I was able to successfully build cppunit 1.6.2 using the ld from the GNU binutils distribution.

        Suggestion: use some filenames in the cookbook, and at the end of the cookbook, show the complete contents of what your files should look like. Otherwise I have no idea what goes where, whether I'm missing some #includes somewhere ... Yes, your tests are supposed to fail first, but it shouldn't be because it fails to compile for want cppunit working in the first place...

        Does anyone know of a port to C# of either <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> or JUnit?  I don't like going back to "old school" techniques with a new environment and would like to have a CsharpUnit if it's out there.

        Does anybody have used <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> on HP-UX with HP C++ compiler?
        I am trying to compile but the compiler is complaining about all
        stdC++ functions as well as it is not in position to define

        did Anybody use TestSetUp class of <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> that provides decorator functionality i.e., to set up initial data using setUp and tearDown but I don't understand, how is this different from setUp and tearDown of <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> class?

        <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> contains both a <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> and <a href="TestFixture.html">TestFixture</a> class.  When should one be used instead of the other.  It appears that the only functional difference is that <a href="TestFixture.html">TestFixture</a> contains Setup() and Teardown() to allow for the creation of objects for use during the tests.   However, looking at the samples for <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> on sourceforge, there are numerous cases where <a href="TestFixture.html">TestFixture</a> was used, but Setup() and Teardown() were empty.

        Any hints on how to test template classes? Say I want to run a set of tests for a number of instantiations of that template class - can/should the whole <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> / <a href="TestFixture.html">TestFixture</a> class be templatized or should the test methods delegate to a number of instantiations of template functions doing the actual (generic) test?

        Bit of a newb question, perhaps, but how does one manage stubs/mock objects in a real application? My problem is that I need to stub out class A to test class B in one test, and then can't test class A because the stub definition stops me from linking in the real version. The solutions I've come up with are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Compile the tests as different programs
        </li>
        <li>
           Add a base class for class A and then inherit the stub from that.
          <ol>
            <li>
               results in lots of little test programs and no convenient way of running them all, while 2 involves unnecessarily introducing classes and modifying the code architecture, which I'm reluctant to do. 
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Any ideas?

        Are there any examples of how to use Properties?
