        Vpl Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        VPL is a <a href="GraphicalProgrammingLanguage.html">GraphicalProgrammingLanguage</a> and environment for interactive image processing.
      </p>
      <p>
        From 1991 paper <a href="http://www.camazotz.com/vplpaper">http://www.camazotz.com/vplpaper</a> :
      </p>
      <p>
        "VPL uses a novel system architecture which separates interaction and computation components in order to provide a highly interactive visual programming user interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        "VPL is based on a declarative, demand driven dataflow model of computation. It is a practical, usable visual programming system, integrating tools for browsing, inspecting and editing components and documentation. VPL also provides data persistence and data import / export mechanisms. The visual programming model supports both function extensibility and <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s, allowing users to build their own program dataflow structures within the VPL environment."

        <em>The demand-driven model is an interesting difference between VPL and other dataflow </em><a href="GraphicalProgrammingLanguages.html">GraphicalProgrammingLanguages</a>, most of which use data-driven or "push" dataflow. For example here is the description of the 'If' primitive from the above paper:<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The If component takes three inputs and produces one output. When demand is placed upon the output the If component is evaluated. The effect of the evaluation is as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If there is no value on the first input port then propagate demand for it.
        </li>
        <li>
           If the value of the first input is 'True' then propagate demand on the second input port and forward the value returned as the output of the component.
        </li>
        <li>
           If the value of the first input is not 'True' then propagate demand on the third input port and forward the value returned as the output of the component.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that this is a demand driven evaluation sequence; only if there is a need for the value of each individual input is demand propagated along that input link.
