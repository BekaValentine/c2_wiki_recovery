        Alternatives To Obtrusive Failures
      </h1>
      <p>
        Non-focus-stealing off-center dialogs:
      </p>
      <p>
        A failure message occurs in a non-modal window that opens in an unobtrusive location, and goes away by itself after a time-out.  In my prototype implementation, the dialog is canary in color, about 1/8" down from the top of the screen, just to the right of center, and fades out after about 5 seconds much like the new <a href="MicrosoftOutlook.html">MicrosoftOutlook</a> message notification window.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's still an unresolved issue about what happens when user actions in progress generate several failures in sequence before the first message can be seen.
