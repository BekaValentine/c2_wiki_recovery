           Computer-controlled yard sprinkler that uses one nozzle and thus doesn't need digging and piping. It occurred to me while watering from one end of my yard to the other that if a single hose with a focused nozzle can reach the entire yard (at least Calif. yards), then a computerized controller could use such to water the entire yard from one hose. If it can be made cheaper than digging and piping, it may catch on. (May not work well in windy areas.)
