        This is my home page. Welcome!
      </p>
      <p>
        My last name rhymes with <em>wiser.</em> Click my name to see some of the pages where I've written, or been written about.

        Currently I work for a software company in Jacksonville, Florida, writing database and data-entry tools in C# 4.0 and dot-Net 4.0. I am one of maybe seven or eight programmers at this company. I have also done a small amount of ASP.NET development for the company. The company maintains a gigantic e-catalog and contacts database, and has a data department of about fifteen people who use the tools I write (and other tools which I did not write) to maintain the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I have written <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> code (and a little Java) for telephony applications, doing everything from database stuff to <a href="DigitalSignalProcessing.html">DigitalSignalProcessing</a>.
      </p>

        For hobby programming, I wrote a sample-rate converter, available at <a href="http://sr-convert.sourceforge.net/.">http://sr-convert.sourceforge.net/.</a> It hasn't been maintained for a while. (I wrote a new version of it using the .NET Async CTP, and it supports multi-channel WAV files as well as 24-bit and 32-bit floating-point WAV files, but I have not released it yet. I had to uninstall the Async CTP to make room for SP1, which fixes some bugs related to the <a href="TextTemplateTransformationToolkit.html">TextTemplateTransformationToolkit</a>. I look forward to the refresh of the Async CTP, or C# 5, whichever comes first.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also written a 64-bit <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> implementation, using Gambit scheme and 32-bit assembly language, but I have not released it because it seems useless... which is to say, I cannot use it to build anything. One of the good things about it though was <a href="ForthAssistedHandAssembly.html">ForthAssistedHandAssembly</a>. I have recently come up with an idea for how to "fix" the Forth implementation, but it has been so long since I wrote it that all my programming tools have changed, so I will probably have to rewrite the whole thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have also written a "nearly" r4rs <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> interpreter in C#. The interpreter supports <a href="CallWithCurrentContinuation.html">CallWithCurrentContinuation</a> and its continuations have unlimited extent. It supports dynamic-wind and PartialContinuations, but those features make the implementation terribly complicated. It uses pre-treatment to speed up execution. I wrote an arbitrary-precision integer and rational number library for it (only to have the integers rendered obsolete by the new System.Numerics.<a href="BigInteger.html">BigInteger</a> class). The interpreter uses reflection to populate its initial environment, and that makes it highly extensible; however, it is not presently capable of interoperating with dot-Net directly. (It's now published, at <a href="http://swscheme.codeplex.com/)">http://swscheme.codeplex.com/)</a>

        I am interested in 3-D graphics, and I used to enjoy editing Classic Doom levels. Doom is quite old, now, and I still haven't written that level editor I wanted to write... on the other hand I can run the <a href="DoomEditingUtility.html">DoomEditingUtility</a> in <a href="DosBox.html">DosBox</a>. Of course now if I write my own editor I can easily add an embedded Scheme interpreter.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested in lexical analysis, parsing, and <a href="ReflectionEmit.html">ReflectionEmit</a>. (I'm also interested in JIT compilers, and I have seen <a href="LowLevelVirtualMachine.html">LowLevelVirtualMachine</a> (LLVM) used for that purpose, and I think it's awesome, but I haven't used LLVM.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also interested in functional languages like <a href="FsharpLanguage.html">FsharpLanguage</a>. I regard <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> and <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> as important also.
      </p>
      <p>
        I first discovered this Wiki in 1999 or so. I wrote a bunch of stuff about Scheme (and later Forth) which is still here, some signed and some not.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also write fantasy-horror stories and compose music with Reason. These are hobbies at this point.
