        Switched On Bach
      </h1>
      <p>
        Collection of short works by <a href="JohannSebastianBach.html">JohannSebastianBach</a> performed on the original Moog synthesizer. For some of us, it was our first introduction to the Master.
      </p>
      <p>
        Performed (if that's the best word) by Walter Carlos (as he was then); Wendy Carlos (as she is now). See also <a href="ClockworkOrange.html">ClockworkOrange</a>, whose score was made up of other Moog performances by Carlos.
