        <a href="CureForCancer.html">CureForCancer</a> is used sarcastically to refer to a software development language and/or methodology touted as a panacea.  The epithet tends to be applied to languages that are both big and popular.  The <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> may be popular, but because it's so terse, nobody really calls it a <a href="CureForCancer.html">CureForCancer</a> --- they just resent it.  <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, on the other hand, can get tagged.
