        Capability Maturity Model For Living
      </h1>
      <p>
        A high level according to the <a href="CapabilityMaturityModel.html">CapabilityMaturityModel</a> may be good for an industrial company.
      </p>
      <p>
        But a comment on <a href="CapabilityMaturityModel.html">CapabilityMaturityModel</a> made me think about it in a more general sense:
        What about your individual life? Is the <a href="CapabilityMaturityModel.html">CapabilityMaturityModel</a> useful in measuring your own life?
      </p>
      <p>
        Is a high level an indicator of mental balance? Does it help happyness?
        Should one strive for it?
      </p>
      <p>
        I can tell you, that I consider myself quite balanced, but do not have a very high level.
        But my wife manages her life and houshold on level 5 (has done planning and improving plans since school)!
        Though she did so to cope with problems in family and to forcefully regain stability in an unstable life.
