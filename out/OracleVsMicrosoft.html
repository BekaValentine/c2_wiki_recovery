        Oracle Vs Microsoft
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hi,  this is the place  to  debate about interconnections and interactions between Oracle and Microsoft technologies. 
        I won't place code here, check out <a href="http://oraclevsmicrosoft.blogspot.com/">http://oraclevsmicrosoft.blogspot.com/</a>  Last two entries are about :
      </p>
      <code>
        - A sample code for a mini web crawler<br/>
        - Oracle functions  <br/>

        last question (06/01/2005):
      </p>
      <p>
        There is many tools to generate connection code  for sql server database  around .Net platform. 
        For instance Microsoft promote something called Olymars, (that's a reference  to  the french soccer team <strong>Olympique de Marseille</strong>, never mind)
        <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/france/msdn/technologies/outils/olymars/default.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/france/msdn/technologies/outils/olymars/default.asp</a>
        This tool calls itself "SQL Server Centric". 
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is, what can be do to build  something like this for Oracle DB?
        I mean, a free and open tool.

        Last year question (12/15/04)
      </p>
      <p>
        PLSQL/Versus client side code ? 
      </p>
      <p>
        When  and why choose to implement logic into triggers and stored procedures and  not into the .Net application. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets consider  that you have a <a href="DataWarehouse.html">DataWarehouse</a> in an Oracle Database. There is a new entry point, a new source of informations in the company. The job is  to build a new application with its specific process to  fill in this. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer to this question  will be quite different depending on:
      </p>
      <p>
        - If you  use a Web client or a winform base application. 
      </p>
      <p>
        - The degree of integration of this new application into the existing information system. 
      </p>

        Why did I create this page? 
      </p>
      <p>
        A few weeks ago, I discover  wikiwiki and, maybe too enthusiastic, I put many links to my own weblog. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a> deleted the links  and post a comment on my blog. She explains me that  Wiki isn't an advertisement place. 
        She suggested that I should create  my own wiki page  on which I could put the links I would. 
        She is right! So this is <a href="OracleVsMicrosoft.html">OracleVsMicrosoft</a> Wiki page.
