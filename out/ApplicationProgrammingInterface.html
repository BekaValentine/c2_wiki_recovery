        Application Programming Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        An API is a <a href="PublishedInterface.html">PublishedInterface</a> to software-based functionality. It's needed because System Calls are often too dependent on machine architecture. APIs abstract system calls. Interestingly, the <a href="PosixStandard.html">PosixStandard</a> regulates APIs, not system calls. Hence even <a href="WindowsNt.html">WindowsNt</a> can be one of the POSIX-compliant <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some part of the API is also executed by the processor in User Mode, whereas system calls are in purely Kernel Mode.

        <a href="ApiDesign.html">ApiDesign</a> is an interesting topic, with somewhat different forces than other software design.

        What is an API, anyway? What does the abbreviation stand for? How about a <a href="WikiSingleVote.html">WikiSingleVote</a>:

        <li>
           [] Application Program Interface
        </li>
        <li>
           [x] Application Programming Interface
        </li>
        <li>
           [] Application Programmer Interface
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All three seem to be in use. Application Program Interface, for example, is defined at <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/reference/dictionary/terms/A/Application_Program_Interface.htm,">http://www.oreilly.com/reference/dictionary/terms/A/Application_Program_Interface.htm,</a> and <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a>s will return hits on the other two.

        Do all non-private methods of a type form an "API", or is that considered too small a granularity, such that they can only form part of a bigger API? Need every non-private method be considered part of an "API", or can there be non-private methods that aren't considered part of an "API"? Is there any significant difference between "API" and the "<a href="PublicInterface.html">PublicInterface</a>" or "public protocol" of a type?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The term "</em><a href="PublishedInterface.html">PublishedInterface</a>" covers this. "Published" is the next level above "public". I think of an API as a "surface" presented by many packages together. So strive to make the "layers" in your programs as much like APIs as possible, and the application objects between the layers not. -- PCP<em></em>

        The big problem with a lot of published APIs is that what you get is a list of method/procedure signatures and a bit of waffle about what each one itself does. This is sometimes be very useful, which is why <a href="OreillyAndAssociates.html">OreillyAndAssociates</a> make so much money. But often one needs more.

        Conversely, one strength of components (if used properly) is that they explicitly address the issues of environment and interaction: a complete specification of a component has to include the component's expectations of the environment within which it will be deployed: <em>both</em> the expectations that clients have of the component and that it has of them. The <a href="CatalysisMethodology.html">CatalysisMethodology</a> has much to say on this subject. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

        <em>It's commenting taken to another level; the purpose of comments isn't to explain what the code does - the code itself should be able to do that - but to explain why it does it the way it does or why it exists in the first place. In the same way, a list of method signatures and synopses isn't going to explain the "why" of an API.</em>
