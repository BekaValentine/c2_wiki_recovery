        Lush Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Lush is an object-oriented programming language designed for researchers, experimenters, and engineers interested in large-scale numerical and graphic applications. Lush is designed to be used in situations where one would want to combine the flexibility of a high-level, weakly-typed interpreted language, with the efficiency of a strongly-typed, natively-compiled language, and with the easy integration of code written in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, or other languages.

        There are in fact two different versions current, which can be installed together without interfering.

        This seems to combine <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a> into one language. <em>If you like that, you'l </em>love<em> </em>GoogleClosure<em></em>
