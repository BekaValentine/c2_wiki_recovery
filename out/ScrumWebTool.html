        Wishlist:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           allow addition of user-specific columns (to be used in site-specific metrics). Things like "Workorder Number" and "Feature type" (product or infrastructure) are things I have added to my own spreadsheet, for later correlation with other systems at my workplace. Being my first sprint, I've already added a dozen columns to help us measure the benefits of using Scrum vs. our other ways of working. Hopefully, they'll disappear over time... -- <a href="DebHartmann.html">DebHartmann</a> July 19, 2003
