        LyX (<a href="LyEks.html">LyEks</a>) is a document processor which uses LaTeX (<a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a>).

        KLyX is a related program which is a fork from an older version of LyX and no longer being developed, according to <a href="http://www.lyx.org/WhatAboutKLyX">http://www.lyx.org/WhatAboutKLyX</a>

        There are comments on LyX scattered around which are more helpful when brought together.

        It is really "LaTeX for the rest of us".  It's so much more simple and so much more concentration can go to the content, than to looking for that f....ing parenthesis. Use it and love it!

           LyX is a LaTeX editor with near WYSIWYG capability. The point is, however, that users are not encouraged to change the underlying stylesheet.  Therefore writing and layouting concerns continue to be separated.

        <li>
           LyX saves documents in plain LaTeX, so tools that can handle the markup can handle LyX documents just like any other document.

      </ul>

           The concept behind LyX is named WYSIWYM (What You See Is What You Mean)
