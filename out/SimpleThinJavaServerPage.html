        We use <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Studio to build <a href="JavaServerPages.html">JavaServerPages</a>.  We are told to use only PointAndClickNoJavascript techniques to develop our web pages.  We are not allowed to HandCodeJavaServerPage it.  This UtopianIdeaOfSeparatingTheTasks forces us to create SpartanInterfaces but that's ok, we've gotten used to it.  We try and keep to processing in the Java bean's getters as they're placed on the <a href="JavaServerPage.html">JavaServerPage</a>.  Also, we sometimes using <a href="LazyInitialization.html">LazyInitialization</a>, or what I call <a href="VirtuallyInitializedAccessors.html">VirtuallyInitializedAccessors</a>. Dio lazarone

        Let's be frank, they pay us Java guys plenty of dough, they'd like to be able to go back to their higher ups and say.... Yeah but, we've got a plan. The Java guys come in and build the nuts and bolts of the application, and the rest is maintained by non-programmer types. That way, we're controlling costs.
