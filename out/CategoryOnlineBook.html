        <a href="CategoryOnlineBook.html">CategoryOnlineBook</a> is used to mark <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s about books that are available online--meaning the entire text of the book can be read online or downloaded free of charge (but see note below).  Simply being for sale on <a href="http://www.amazon.com">http://www.amazon.com</a> or elsewhere doesn't count.

        Note that the online editions of many of these books come with use restrictions--such as non-commercial use only.  One even has a restriction that if you print the .pdf files, you owe the publisher US$.02 a page for each page printed or copy made.  (In all cases, you're pretty much on the honor system, I suppose.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In most cases, a print edition of the book is available, which Amazon or Powells or whoever else will be happy to sell you.  Some of the books are online-only; and some are "draft" versions of books still being authored/revised (and might become unavailable online once the completed book goes to press).
