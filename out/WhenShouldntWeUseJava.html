        <em>You go write a device driver in </em><a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> and then come back and talk to us. There are many, many, many situations where C++ is a fine choice of language, and a better choice than <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>. See <a href="WhenShouldWeUseCeePlusPlus.html">WhenShouldWeUseCeePlusPlus</a>.<em></em>

        How about you go do some string parsing in C++? Or accounting systems in Perl? Choosing a programming language always results in a compromise. Java does not excel in any particular area. Instead it delivers a very good compromise. That is why it gets selected often (popularity is a part of the equation).

        <em>I confess I seldom work in the language but it seems to me there are very few situations where </em><a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is an adequate choice. Inside Oracle ... wait, stored procs are faster. EJB ... maybe, if most of your target boxes aren't <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> ... unlikely in most deployments. Cross-platform ... yeah, if you can find two JVMs that work the same way twice ... good luck. Applets ... ROTFL.<em> </em>

        Who can verify the stored procedure speed comment above? I thought I had just read something citing the significant speed advantage of stored procedures in Java as compared to the same in PL/SQ.

        <em>Oracle is getting better at it.  Rumors are that Java is "arms length" from the engine in Oracle 8, but fully integrated in Oracle 9.  This makes Java </em>'SLOW<em>' in Oracle 8, but SUPER FAST in Oracle 9.  (...or so I hear.  I haven't measured it myself, or looked into it.)</em>

        I think that Java's strongest domain today is for the server side of an e-commerce site.  Jsp, servlets, and EJB's seem to be a very strong technology.  The technical recruiters I've talked to claim that demand for server-side Java people has been doubling every month for the last few months.

        Netpodium (<a href="http://www.netpodium.com/Products/faq.htm)">http://www.netpodium.com/Products/faq.htm)</a> uses applets for audience interaction.  I don't really know how many end-users that amounts to, but I think we had over 4000 total audience members when we did the Windows 2000 webcast.  That's a record for total attendees at one event, but on the other hand we generally do several events every week, so I'd expect the total number to be in the tens-of-thousands.  -- <a href="CurtisBartley.html">CurtisBartley</a>

        Applets will eventually be replaced by <a href="JavaWebStart.html">JavaWebStart</a>.

      <p>
        <em></em>WebStarted applications can not be embedded in HTML pages thus they will never be able to replace applets.<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>I'll bet $10 they'll be replaced with some .NET thing. You can't beat 90% market share.</em>

        Or Flash. Honest. Don't laugh, but I've actually seen extremely useful client-side web-apps programmed in Flash. Including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A tool that let you paint your own Nokia cell-phone faceplate, and send the resulting image file to an industrial painting machine.
        </li>
        <li>
           A tool that let you custom-design your own self-inking stamp, giving you fine-grained control over text content, font, orientation, location, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But pity the poor programmer who actually has to make these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've seen a demo of a web application with a Flash front end and a Java back end. Pretty slick.</em>

        You shouldn't use java when python, smalltalk or other higher-level good will run fast enough for your task.  The speed of Java compared to smalltalk or python is rarely of value (and when it is, probably C is faster still).

        You shouldn't use java and the JVM to do work that SQL and the database back end should be doing. In particular - iterating through collections to find the one item you want. An SQL database is not simply an ObjectRepository, it's a multidimensional <a href="ThingInItsOwnRight.html">ThingInItsOwnRight</a>. Misunderstanding this is a flaw with some <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> systems I have seen.
