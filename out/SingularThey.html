      <p>
        In contexts like "everyone should give their variables meaningful names" or "has anyone lost their pencil", "they" has been used by native speakers of English for centuries. To me, at least, it feels entirely natural in such sentences - more so than any other pronoun would. There are other contexts, usually when the gender of the pronoun's antecedent is not clear, where "they" does grate the ear, but does so less than alternatives such as "he" or "he or she".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You could say "everyone should give meaningful names to variables" and "has anyone lost a pencil", the possessive is extra fluff in these cases.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not to say that "they" can be used strictly as a singular pronoun (though it seems quite possible that it will be in a few centuries), but apparently singular uses of it do seem to be standard English in some cases. In any case, it seems like an oversimplification to treat <a href="SingularThey.html">SingularThey</a> as nothing more than a well-intentioned but incorrect innovation in usage. People do use <a href="SingularThey.html">SingularThey</a> to avoid gender specific language, but when they do, they are generalizing from uses of "they" that were already accepted.

        The use of the singular "they" is very frequent in England. I can say "Anyone wanting to come to the party should write their name on the list" and nobody will bat an eyelid. I could write "When the user sees a password verification window they should re-enter their password" and this would be acceptable in a user manual. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this usage is more acceptable in England because the grammar of plurals is different anyway, we use plural forms for collective nouns and organization names:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Chelsea <em>are</em> [not] the greatest football team.
        </li>
        <li>
           Selfridges <em>are</em> having a sale
        </li>
        <li>
           Help, police, a gang of hooligans <em>are</em> turning over my dustbin!

      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a><strong></strong>
        In those three examples, you are talking about the group as a whole, and so it is more correct to say "Selfridges is ..." etc. However, if you are talking about the behaviour of the group internally, you would use the plural form. So, "The Union is disagreeing" would mean they are united in their disagreement. "The Union are disagreeing" would mean they are fighting amongst one another internally. -- <a href="AnthonyLauder.html">AnthonyLauder</a>

        In the UK, "The Union are disagreeing" would be ambiguous. We would probably say "The Union are disagreeing amongst themselves" or ".. have internal disagreements", or "The Union are unanimous in disagreeing [with the management]"

        Ah, I bet they taught you not to split infinitives too. I remember such lessons well. It seems a strangely British thing that they teach grammar that is entirely different from that which you hear on the television, in books or in normal conversation. My sister is a teacher and assures me that this formal teaching of obsolete grammar no longer takes place. Donï¿½t forget "to end a sentence with a preposition is a practice up with which I will not put". <em>While we're at it, let's not forget that things differ from but are similar to. "Different to/than" implies that the speaker or writer is not a native English speaker.</em>

        Where language is used purely as a tool of communication, singular "they" is used without hesitation, when gender distinctions aren't the point of what's being communicated. Us educated types trip over grammatical "correctness" and forget that fitness to the purpose is the most important aspect of any tool. This is my favorite link to discussions of singular "they", in a forum devoted to one of the, um, great mistresses of language as a tool of communication: <a href="http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html.">http://www.crossmyt.com/hc/linghebr/austheir.html.</a> -- <a href="JudyHawkins.html">JudyHawkins</a>

        The problem also exists in German, despite the availability of three genders (masculine, feminine and neutral). For example, the word for student is "Student". But a female student is a "Studentin" (-in as suffix usually indicates feminine gender). When addressing or talking about a mixed group of students, it's necessary in German to say "Studenten und Studentinnen" (the plural forms of the nouns), or revert to the neologism "StudentInnen", which is about as attractive as s/he. This problem exists for most German nouns which refer to a profession or state: Arbeiter/Arbeiterin (worker), Politiker/Politikerin (politician); in English, at least we don't have this problem! -- <a href="JohnWebber.html">JohnWebber</a>

      <p>
        actor/actress yes we do, also I'd have thought it was less of a problem in a language were all nouns have a gender anyway.

        In Turkish, the word "O" is used for he/she/it. And "Onlar" is used for "they", which is hes/shes/its (-lar is plural postfix as -s in English). -- <a href="SavasAlparslan.html">SavasAlparslan</a>

      <p>
        <em>Chinese is similar; the word "keuih" is Cantonese for he/she/it (the closest English pronunciation would be "koi" like the fish, but even that isn't very close). Similarly, "keuihdeih" is they, the suffix -deih is used for plurals (though only with a few certain words; it isn't a general plural form). Mandarin Chinese has a similar construct.</em>

        "They" is simply a third person reference, and is perfectly appropriate when gender is unclear: for example, "Tell the next customer that they will have to wait until tomorrow for an appointment". -- <a href="AnthonyLauder.html">AnthonyLauder</a>

        <em>Beg to differ: "they" is not appropriate in third person singular. Use instead "he" or "she" but do not buy into PC speak on the grounds that you may violate someone's right not to be offended. There are languages having third-person-gender-neutral pronouns, English isn't one of them. Danish, for example, has "sin" for either "his" or "her" ('Hun tog sin hat og gik sin vej' = 'She took her hat and went her way,' while 'Han tog sin hat og gik sin vej' = 'He took his hat and went his way') allowing a sentence that English doesn't support: 'Man kan gaa sin vej i fred' = 'One may go his/her way in peace' -- English just doesn't have a his/her pronoun, and to usurp "their" to do the job is a grammatical error.</em> -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

        <strong>Not Singular, Not Plural</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The difficulty is in finding an appropriate pronoun for "one." "One" is a concept and does not have either a singular or plural. It is similar to "water," so the pronoun "it" might seem appropriate, except that "it" also has a connotation of being less than human. Thus the most grammatically correct option is rejected out of hand. This leaves the following alternatives.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           He - This probably has the most historical basis and is usually unnoticed by readers.
        </li>
        <li>
           S/He - This is an admirable attempt to create a new pronoun, except that it only works in written text.
        </li>
        <li>
           Alternate He and She (usually at a paragraph by paragraph level) - This also is usually unnoticed by readers, but requires a little more effort by authors. It can be time consuming to maintain when adding, deleting, or inserting paragraphs. It is also very difficult to keep track of in oral speech.
        </li>
        <li>
           They - This is usually unnoticed in oral speech but is found to be jarring in written text by some readers in certain contexts. In other contexts, it is unnoticed. For example, "They are spying on me." "Someone is spying on you?" would probably not raise objections.
        </li>
        <li>
           You - This has the advantage of being non-specific in terms of plurality versus singularity. Use of "you" as an indefinite third person pronoun is quite common in written text and oral speech. It has the disadvantage, though, of also being the second person pronoun and can cause a general statement to be interpreted as a personal attack. For example, compare "One should strive to use proper grammar." with "You should strive to use proper grammar." Of the various alternatives, this is the only one that I would strongly advise speakers and writers to avoid.
        </li>
        <li>
           We - This is sometimes used as an alternative to "you." The intent is to dull the personal implications of a statement by including the author as well. This can backfire, however, if the audience rejects the author as a member of the group.
