        Definition Of Meta
      </h1>
      <p>
        meta
        <philosophy> /me't*/ or /may't*/ or (Commonwealth) /mee't*/ A prefix meaning one level of description higher. If X is some concept then meta-X is data about, or processes operating on, X.
      </p>
      <p>
        A metasyntactic variable [<a href="http://www.nightflight.com/cgi-bin/foldoc.cgi?metasyntactic+variable]">http://www.nightflight.com/cgi-bin/foldoc.cgi?metasyntactic+variable]</a> (e.g. FOO) is a variable in notation used to describe syntax, and <a href="MetaLanguage.html">MetaLanguage</a> is a language used to describe language (e.g. BNF).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a metasyntax is syntax for specifying syntax, metalanguage is a language used to discuss language, meta-data is data about data, and meta-reasoning is reasoning about reasoning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MetaData.html">MetaData</a> is "data about data."
        IE: Data that the system uses to determine how other data is processed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is difficult to explain briefly, but much hacker humour turns on deliberate confusion between meta-levels.

        Some more down to earth examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          meta thinking is thinking about thinking
        </li>
        <li>
          a meta plan is a plan about planning
        </li>
        <li>
          a meta discussion is a discussion about discussion
        </li>
        <li>
          meta processing is processing of processes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hmm, writing this it looks to me, that this is rather the format "meta-X is X about X", not "meta-X is data about X". Either these are two readings of "meta" or the data must have a special quality or the candidates for X must be data.
