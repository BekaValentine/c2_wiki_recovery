        Managed Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        I wondered what <a href="MicrosoftManagedCode.html">MicrosoftManagedCode</a> is other than a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> where the <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> happens to be x86-code. But then realized that this seems to be a more or less new combination (even if it may be a step back).
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this really a new combination, or are there other OSes, that have <a href="SandBox.html">SandBox</a>es (most have more or less sensible process isolation), <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> (not that I know of; <a href="ErosOs.html">ErosOs</a> maybe?), ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Misconception: </em><a href="ManagedCode.html">ManagedCode</a> has nothing to do with the OS. It is simply Microsoft MarketingSpeak for <a href="SourceCode.html">SourceCode</a> intended to run on their <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be a misconception, but that's not it. It may be MarketingSpeak, but it names some feature. What is this feature? It cannot be '<a href="SourceCode.html">SourceCode</a>' as that is surely not run (=interpreted)on the CLR. And the CLR is surely an OS feature. Now what is <a href="ManagedCode.html">ManagedCode</a> else then I stated?

        I personally see <a href="ManagedCode.html">ManagedCode</a> as that code which executes in a runtime that provides type safety verification, <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, rich reflection, dynamic loading, and exceptions with readable stack traces; I would not consider security or process isolation to be prerequisites.  Both <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> and <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a> fit my description of <a href="ManagedCode.html">ManagedCode</a>. -- <a href="JeffreyHantin.html">JeffreyHantin</a>

      <p>
        <em>You mean </em><a href="ManagedCode.html">ManagedCode</a> is to <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> as <a href="MachineCode.html">MachineCode</a> is to CPU/RealMachine?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not necessarily.  ActiveOberonSystem would probably qualify as well, and it appears to be managed machine code; Microsoft's NGEN tool accomplishes much the same purpose.  The use of a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> is largely a means to provide simpler, more verifiable input code and allow for more extensive optimization by the runtime, possibly even <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a> of common cases. -jh

        <strong>managed code</strong> - that is, using a language in which memory management is automatic. Java and .NET languages do this with garbage collection; VB does this with reference counting; I don't care how you do it, just let me concatenate strings without thinking about where the new bigger string will go and I'll be happy.

        What does "managed code" mean to .NET programmers?
      </p>
      <p>
        Automatic memory management?
        A sandbox something like a "chroot jail" ?
        Something else entirely?
