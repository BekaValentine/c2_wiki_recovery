        <a href="BookStart.html">BookStart</a> is the thought that books can be used to start a discussion or interaction. Several people read the same or related books and use the information they gain as a starting point. The groups are sometimes called <a href="ReadersGroups.html">ReadersGroups</a>.

        I suggest people could put a link to <a href="BookStart.html">BookStart</a> on the pages of books which have helped them and say why. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        We could also have <a href="BookShelf.html">BookShelf</a> as a tag for books which people keep on the book shelf for reference.  -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
