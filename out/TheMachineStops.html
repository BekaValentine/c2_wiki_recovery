        The Machine Stops
      </h1>
      <p>
        Chillingly accurate description of how <a href="GamesEndLiteracy.html">GamesEndLiteracy</a> written by EmForster in 1908. <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> says "The Machine Stops" first appeared in <em>The Oxford and Cambridge Review</em> in November 1909, and was republished in Forster's <em>The Eternal Moment and Other Stories</em> in 1928.

        I disagree. Games don't figure very prominently in the story; to be honest, the Internet at large (including Wiki and Wiki-like sites especially) resembles Forster's Machine far more strongly than either a blanket category of "games" or a specific case of "multiplayer combat games".

        Incidentally, the reason you won't find it at <a href="ProjectGutenberg.html">ProjectGutenberg</a> is that it appears to be still under copyright. If the notations at the above site are correct, the story was written and published in 1909, but copyright was last asserted (or renewed) in 1947.  I'm neither a lawyer nor a copyright expert, but I <em>think</em> this puts it in the "95 years or 2048, whichever comes last" rule. -- <a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>

           In the U.S. "All works published in the United States before 1923 are in the public domain" (and as  an extra note of interest "works published before 1964 that were not renewed are public domain"), quoted from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_copyright_law#Duration_of_copyright">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_copyright_law#Duration_of_copyright</a>

           Therefore a copy of the edition published in 1909 is definitely out of copyright in the U.S. This is not necessarily exactly the same situation in e.g. the U.K. And it may be a different situation if the copy was from the 1947 edition, if it differs from the 1909 edition. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        I agree that the Machine is very <a href="InterNet.html">InterNet</a>-like. Nowadays we can use the internet for <a href="TeleCommuting.html">TeleCommuting</a> to work, to order food for delivery, to chat and share knowledge with others, and so on. Someone who is sufficiently nerdy seldom needs to leave home. The Machine enables you to never leave your own room, see other people in the flesh, or develop muscle tone. Oh... My volume containing the story mentions a 1956 copyright, so perhaps <a href="ProjectGutenberg.html">ProjectGutenberg</a> won't post it until 2051. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>
