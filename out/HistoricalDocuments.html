        Historical Documents

      <p>
        The "<a href="HistoricalDocuments.html">HistoricalDocuments</a>" is the name given by the aliens
        in <a href="GalaxyQuest.html">GalaxyQuest</a> to the episodes of the program by the same
        name.
      </p>
      <p>
        More specifically:  Within the context of the film, the aliens received television broadcasts of the original <a href="GalaxyQuest.html">GalaxyQuest</a> TV show, and assumed that they were real.  They were so inspired by the ideals of <a href="GalaxyQuest.html">GalaxyQuest</a> that they built their entire civilization around the TV show.
      </p>
      <p>
        The aliens then refer to the original broadcasts as the "<a href="HistoricalDocuments.html">HistoricalDocuments</a>."
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole concept of "Historical Documents" is an endemic problem in software development, as the <a href="UsualWayOfDoingThings.html">UsualWayOfDoingThings</a> has spawned many <a href="HistoricalDocuments.html">HistoricalDocuments</a> which are followed blindly, regardless of their actual value to the process.
