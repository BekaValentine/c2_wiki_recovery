        Blame Avoidance
      </h1>
      <p>
        The acts or cultural beast within an organization of making decisions or assigning tasks in a manner that mitigates anything being blamed on anyone.

      <p>
        <em>Collective crimes incriminate no-one.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be encouraged by organizational practices that look for someone to blame when something goes wrong, rather than looking for things to change to prevent the error in future.
