        Case Role
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <strong>case role</strong> is any of the spatially-distinguished parts of a process. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the sentence, "You do that?", the subject "you" has the <em>case role</em> of `agent` and the object "that" has the <em>case role</em> of `patient`.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meaningful case roles are dependent on the process. e.g.:
        : for process <em>crime</em>, case roles could be: `perpetrator` + `victim` + `evidence` + `modus operandi`; 
        : for process <em>burn</em>, case roles could be: `fuel`, `air`, `heat`
      </p>
      <p>
        The term is used in natural language processing, but has its origins in linguistics. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In practical terms for us, an instance of <a href="CaseRole.html">CaseRole</a> can be just about any type, from parts of speech (subject,object), participants in a process (agent,patient), or other relationship names (mother,father). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Analysis of <a href="CaseRole.html">CaseRole</a> from the general (subject) to the specific (my mother) may be performed by a reasoning engine. Conjecture of applicable CaseRoles may be formed by pattern matching (or other non-logical means), then proved (or disproved) by logic systems.
