        Reduced Instruction Set Computer

        What RISC stands for. A way of structuring microprocessors which lead to higher-performance designs than CISC (<a href="ComplexInstructionSetComputer.html">ComplexInstructionSetComputer</a>) was capable of. Back in the 80's and early 90's, a great RISC-vs-CISC war was waged in the industry, with numerous RISC architectures (early ARM, SPARC, MIPS, PowerPC) pitted against the two predominant CISC architectures (x86 <a href="ExEightySix.html">ExEightySix</a>, <a href="MotorolaSixtyEightKay.html">MotorolaSixtyEightKay</a>).

        In RISC (in theory), you have a set of simple instructions with simple addressing modes, large general-purpose register sets, and memory transfers are separated from arithmetic instructions. Originally, each instruction was a fixed length (aligned to a machine word) and executed in a fixed number of cycles. This a) allows you to minimize the <a href="CriticalPath.html">CriticalPath</a>, increasing the CPU frequency you can get; b) makes pipelining and superscalar design tractable, and c) greatly simplifies instruction decoding.

        Who won the <a href="RiscVsCisc.html">RiscVsCisc</a> battle? RISC, sort of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Intel x86, for all its warts, remains the dominant processor family for desktop computing, and serves as the basis for many servers as well these days.
          <ul>
            <li>
               However, much of this had to do with the fact that it's the processor (along with its clones) that runs <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>.  
            </li>
            <li>
               The x86 these days is fundamentally a RISC core with a layer on top that translates the horrid CISC x86 instructions into the RISC core. High-end x86 chips are as fast, or nearly so, as their RISC counterparts.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Of course, Intel has access to better IC processes than anyone save IBM.
                </li>
                <li>
                   That speed comes at a price in power consumption - Intel CPUs need huge heatsinks to run. You could probably kill someone with a Pentium 4 with its heatsink attached.
                </li>
                <li>
                   High-end Intel CPUs require a power supply capable of supplying <strong>125 AMPS</strong>. That ain't a typo. If the voltage were higher (12V vs 1.8V, or whatever voltage these things run off), you could jump-start a car with it.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       125 amps at 1.8v is 225 watts; does a P4 use all of this, or is that just peak capacity?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       The VW Polo I watched crank (in 1999?) was 330 amps.  Voltage will be around 12 volts, likely to dip sharply at that current.  This is 3300 - 3960 watts.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

           Most modern RISC-ish processors aren't anywhere near as pure as early versions. Many have variable-length instructions, optimized instructions/addressing modes for manipulating <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a>, doing tight loops, etc. Some even have string instructions. RISC processors designed for low-memory environments (like PDAs) have compressed instruction sets (i.e. ThumbCompression)

           The 68k is dead for most applications; though it lives on in <a href="EmbeddedSystem.html">EmbeddedSystem</a>s. Early Palm Pilots were based on a 68k derivative (the Motorola "DragonBall" family); however Motorola has migrated that product line to ARM.

           Modern CPUs now have enhanced <a href="DigitalSignalProcessor.html">DigitalSignalProcessor</a> functionality as well, often through vector processing units like <a href="AltiVec.html">AltiVec</a>, MMX/SSE, etc.
