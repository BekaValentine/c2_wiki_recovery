        There is a certain hour of the morning - about 4.30 am - when the scales drop from your eyes and you can see the world of men for what it is. The cares and woes that distract us from happiness appear as silhouettes, and we breathe a sigh of relief that, for just a moment, none of it is our problem.

        Apart from all that nonsense, somewhere out in the bay, there are dirty hairy lumpy guys hauling garbage and similar indelicacies from the spot ya pick up to da spot ya drop off. They're happy to be in work and off the streets. Maybe at the end of the day there's some ethanol to wash down the meat of a thousand cows and the preservatives of greatly extended shelf life.
