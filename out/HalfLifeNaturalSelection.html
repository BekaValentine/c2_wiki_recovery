        Half Life Natural Selection
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the first games/mods that puts the word rts right into your classic first person shooter.

        Marines vs The Karaa, these two teams battle for survival by building resource points to gain resources and spending them on defence and offence.
        This game is very addictive if you are a fps maniac that loves rts.
