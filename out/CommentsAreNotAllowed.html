        Comments Are Not Allowed
      </h1>
      <p>
        The new EJB QL (<a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a> <a href="QueryLanguage.html">QueryLanguage</a>) has a few restrictions (
        see <a href="http://www.onjava.com/lpt/a/onjava/2001/09/19/ejbql.html).">http://www.onjava.com/lpt/a/onjava/2001/09/19/ejbql.html).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of them is that <a href="CommentsAreNotAllowed.html">CommentsAreNotAllowed</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Why would you comment queries?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A: Optimizer hints are often done with comments.  Without support for comments, a common way of tuning SQL statements will be unavailable to you.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, EJB QL is not standard SQL and therefore optimizer hints have no place in EJB QL.  Furthermore, optimizer hints are very specific to database vendors.
      </p>
      <p>
        That as may be, but they are still needed in the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, optimiser hints are almost always a <a href="BadIdea.html">BadIdea</a>. They have builtin assumptions about the state of your data which may not remain true over time, perhaps leading to your query being less efficient than it would otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A2: Queries are code.  Code sometimes needs comments.</em> (<a href="CommentsAreCode.html">CommentsAreCode</a>.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Might I suggest that coded instructions to an optimizer are not comments?  They may use the comment syntax to separate them from normal code, but they are still code.
