        Freshpond Education is using this area to experiment with an internal conversation about knowledge management and experiment with the idea of using the wiki paradigm within our own web tool <a href="http://www.freshpond.net.">http://www.freshpond.net.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        We recognize the public nature of the wikiweb and we welcome your comments, but please, identify yourself if you are not a member of <a href="FreshPond.html">FreshPond</a>.

        We are reading the article "Knowledge Management in Education: Defining the Landscape" by Petrides and Nodine.

        <strong>Data, information, knowledge</strong> (pg 13)
      </p>
      <p>
        We should be using Take 5 and Freshpond.net to better manage the entire data, information, knowledge continuum.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Lessons fit into the "knowledge" part of the continuum, but there is much more we can do.
        </li>
        <li>
           Can we strengthen the link to student data? Maybe make it more overt in the curriculum challenge process?
        </li>
        <li>
           We need to do more overt training on how best to harness the power of Freshpond.net and our clients' own data systems.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I like the idea of our Design Teams being the agents of converting <strong>data</strong> from measuring student learning into <strong>information</strong> about what needs to be improved and using our Take 5 Process to generate lessons, reflections, and other <strong>knowledge</strong> about how to improve learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Maintain a focus on people and their needs</strong> (page 25)
      </p>
      <p>
        The article validates the need for collaboration and overt processes (i.e Take 5) for managing discussions (see page 9). People and their skills, culture, management process, interactions, etc. are the key to harnessing the power of the technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The strength of the Design Team Program is clearly the collegial reflective work that is part of the Take 5 process and the power of Freshpond.net to keeps teams focused and on task between meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have we emphasized enough the recruitment of excellent people and the support of less-than-excellent people. See graph on page 11.

        <strong>Start Small</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Article validates our pilot approach. I'm glad we are not in the CSR or "whole faculty" game.

        We could also organize our notes around the list on page 17

           Build on vocab and practices of the organizational context

           Improve student learning and outcomes: don't settle for procedural tinkering
        </li>
        <li>
           Expect an iterative process that endures over time
        </li>
