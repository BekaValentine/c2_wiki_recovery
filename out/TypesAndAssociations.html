        Types And Associations
      </h1>
      <p>
        Continued from <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguagesTwo.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguagesTwo</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Associated with" by itself doesn't tell us how many types can be "associated with" a variable/value, when the association occurs, when it goes away, and how we empirically test for its existence. In a tag-free language like CF, one could say the string "123" is "associated with numbers" because it can be "interpreted as" numeric, or can be said to have a value that belongs in the "set of numbers". And this could become actual implementation in that a lookup table of all possible numbers (within size/precision limits expected), as "numeric strings" (for lack of a better term), could be created. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By the usual rules of English language, "a variable is associated with a type" means a variable has one type, because of the phrase "</em>'a<em>' type" in which both "a" and "type" are singular.  If a variable could be associated with multiple types, it would be written as "a variable is associated with multiple types" or "a variable is associated with types".  Whilst it is not unreasonable to say that the string "123" is "associated with numbers", it's merely an awkward way of saying that "123" is a numeric string.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But writers are often sloppy with "a". It's best to be explicit and say "one" if you mean one. "a" by itself does not rule out others. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I think "a type" is obviously singular.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               It's possible for a typical dynamic language to have a "a='0';" statement in which "a" can "be" a string, number, and Boolean at the same time: 3 types. So it's NOT "obviously singular".
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Every value has a single type associated with its representation, necessary for the interpreter or compiler to recognise the representation.  See </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>.  This is independent of whatever values of different types may be encoded in the value.  For example, a value "0" is of type string, but it may encode a number and a boolean depending on how individual operators interpret the string.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               You are talking about a specific model. I'm talking about colloquial "type" related language and notions. When one is learning a model or reading a language manual, they often come in with the colloquial view, not a specific model's view. Remember, we are talking about how one may interpret "a variable is associated with a type". If you are assuming they read other material or rules first, please state that assumption(s) and justify it as a likely scenario.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>To the extent that how every popular imperative programming language handles values, variables and types is a "specific model", yes it is.  What I wrote is precisely the view that anyone learning programming should leave with, regardless what views they come in with.  Indeed, it doesn't matter what views they come in with.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Your "should" is dripping with idealism. If this gets back to our frequent re-debate about "typical knowledge of developers", then we might as well <a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a> and stick an impasse-flag into the soil here.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>If it's not expected that someone </em>'should<em>' gain an understanding from reading an explanation, what is the purpose of the explanation?</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Like I said before, existing writing on "types" has been crappy, likely because nobody has found a way to do it better and so they each just re-copy the crappy documentation conventions from the last guy's sucky docs. If you are paid to build a bridge in the pre-Roman era, and the technology of the day is such that 50% of them fall down within 20 years, you don't have much of a choice other than copy the existing plans and conventions because you know of nothing better. (It's similar to <a href="NobodyEverGotFiredForBuyingMicrosoft.html">NobodyEverGotFiredForBuyingMicrosoft</a>.) It's kind of like our traffic problems in big cities: yes we know cars suck and that the sky above is mostly wasted, but nobody has found a way to make practical flying cars. Thus, we build more cars and more freeways and wait in traffic like a bunch of dumbasses stuck with backward sucky technology that has outgrown its usefulness. Yet most people just accept it as-is because it's what everybody is used to. (Yes, there's public transportation, but it has the loss of privacy and you have to deal with occasional unwanted interactions with weirdos (who are often smelly and mumbling about type associations)).
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Could you show specifically where existing writing on "types" has been crappy?  I'm afraid a general indictment of writing style, on a general topic, does not help us improve it.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Didn't you agree that the PHP type docs were lacking?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>The online PHP manual is notoriously poor in numerous ways.  Therefore, I'm inclined to disregard it as characteristic of technical writing in general, or technical writing about types and language </em><a href="TypeSystems.html">TypeSystems</a> in particular.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               At least we agree that the PHP type doc is poor. What about the on-line <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> doc? Do you have an opinion on that?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Which on-line </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> doc?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Pick that which you find the "best".
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Were you not referring to a particular one?</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               I don't want you to bitch that I picked the "wrong one".
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Why don't you pick the one that </em>'you<em>' find clearest, but still flawed.  That way, we can meet half way.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And it's best to define "numeric string" before casually mentioning it.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>In a manual intended for beginners, that would be reasonable.  Here, I think it reasonable to assume readers know what a numeric string is.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           And the apparent contradiction should be explained (or cleaned up) since "numeric string" is TWO types, not one in colloquial-land. Why even have (or rely on) a vocabulary that does that? It's just asking for confusion.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>That's why my description at the top of </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> explains that values of different types can be encoded in each other.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           You don't explain specifically what "encoded" means and where (in XML) such "encoding" happens. Yes, typical developers may have a general fuzzy notion of "encoding", but it's not specific enough for explaining/modeling type-related subtleties.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I do explain what "encoded" means via examples at the top of </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>.  The XML only models variables and values, not operators.  Encoding, if any, is recognised by operators.  Thus, it is a characteristic of operators, not values.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Okay, but do notice that you are using examples to "explain" encode. That's fine with me as long as it's allowed on both sides and you are willing to clarify if asked for specifics (including a specific model that may not necessary mirror actual implementation, but still "works").
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I thought examples would be particularly resonant, given that programmers are inevitably familiar with the concept, whether they've known it by name or not.  As for "a specific model that may not necessary [sic] mirror actual implementation", I'm not interested in distorted reality or technical fiction.  </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> do not benefit from using lies as a substitute for understanding.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Like I said many time, the colloquial notions of types are usually fuzzy and overloaded. I know you disagree, but I'm basing my decisions on my view of reality, not yours. I disagree with the "mirror implementation" stance also. Implementations can change or vary for machine efficiency improvements or vendor choice and should not be the primary reference source for models used by programmers for apps if cleaner models are available even if they don't mirror actual implementation. A simpler <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> may be better than a complicated truth. Again, I'd settle for epicycles if they were simpler than Newton's equations if the primary goal was to mirror the position of the planets rather than explain underlying movement mechanisms. Programmers mostly care about I/O, not interpreter implementation. I know you disagree with that also. So be it.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>What's a "mirror implementation"?</em>  
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>It's true that a simpler </em><a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> may, in some cases, be preferable to a complicated truth.  It's not clear that this is one of those cases, nor is it clear how your "tag model" is simpler than the descriptions at the top of <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>.  Just going by the sheer volume of descriptive text on <a href="TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion.html">TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion</a> compared to <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>, the "tag model" seems more complex rather than simpler.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> is poor in my opinion. For one, it uses type-based polymorphism but does not model the mechanism for that type-based polymorphism. You <strong>dump one high-level issue onto another high-level issue</strong>. And, you have been in academics too long to judge "more complex" from the perspective of a non-academic. You think and write "funny". And volume of description is not necessarily a good measure of "complexity". Descriptions can be short and useless/confusing also. Anyhow, let both models exist and <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> which model they want to use. Done. No more bickering.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>"Type-based polymorphism" is described in the "operator invocation" section.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Not well. You need to show, not tell.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Whether it's done well or not is a matter of opinion, though it does include examples, so it does "show".  As such, it </em>'does<em>' "model the mechanism for that type-based polymorphism."  Your accusation is therefore unfounded.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           No it doesn't. It <em>uses</em> type polymorphism, it does not MODEL type polymorphism. You explain complexity using complexity.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>How would you "MODEL type polymorphism"?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Polymorphism is an operator-level implantation detail. It's below what a model has to directly implement.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Why do you think so?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Why <em>should</em> it be a requirement? That appears to be arbitrary to me. If you claim it's required, then justify that claim.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>What do you suggest as an alternative?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           In my model I leave that up to the model user. They can implement their model of a given operator as they please (assuming it matches actual language behavior). I see no reason to dictate that as a requirement. Algol existed before OOP did, I would note.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>This is not about implementation.  My descriptions are conceptional, not an implementation strategy.  Operators like '=' were semantically overloaded in Algol regardless what mechanism was used to implement it.</em> 
        </li>
        <li>
           The purpose of the model is to be able to build a <strong>runnable</strong> emulator of key parts of the language. You don't make/describe the leap between conceptual and runnable.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I suspect my descriptions are a lot closer to "runnable" -- especially as the process is detailed -- than your "leave that up to the model user".  Indeed, it is trivial to implement the type-based polymorphism that I've described.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           As an <em>implementation suggestion</em> for matching specific languages, that's perfectly fine. I give implementation examples. But to make that THE model is presumptuous.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Can you think of an imperative programming language that it doesn't fit?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Why does that matter? If there are 20 ways to do something, that fact that technique #13 can do it does not make #13 a canon or THE right way.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Whilst I make no claims that the "operator invocation" section is canonical per se (though the rest of </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> certainly is), until the "operator invocation" section is shown to be flawed -- i.e., does not accurately describe some popular imperative programming language -- I see no reason to remove it.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Canon-ness is the key issue here, not "flawed". I never claimed it "flawed" (although it may not handle complex "dispatching" well). Uniqueness is the subject of concern, not "broken". And you have given no evidence the other part is a canon. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>By "complex dispatching", do you mean </em><a href="PredicateDispatch.html">PredicateDispatch</a> or <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a>?  <a href="PredicateDispatch.html">PredicateDispatch</a> is indeed the generalisation, but it isn't used by popular imperative programming languages.  <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> can be handled by the approach.  As for the rest being canonical, I've given you links to <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>'s work, as it goes to particular effort to clarify the distinctions; other <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> texts will provide equivalent descriptions.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>As for "when the association occurs, when it goes away", your phrase "has a tag" or "is associated with a tag" offers no more information about that than "has a type".  The usual assumption about models is that unless stated otherwise, we can safely regard an association as existing in perpetuity unless stated otherwise.  For example, in a model that refers to a set V {a, b, c}, we can assume a, b, and c have been elements of V since the beginning and will always be elements of V, unless it is explicitly stated otherwise.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So if one wants to find that "otherwise" to answer a question, they have to go digging in pages and pages. Not good document design. (I don't expect the reader to rely on just words for the tag model.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>That's a documentation problem, sure.  I'm not clear how bad documentation is fixed by a "tag model".  As for relying on words, that's why we have diagrams.  Even better, that's why we have formal notations that eliminate ambiguity in both verbal descriptions and diagrams.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           The tag model solves such by using familiar data structures with known quantitative rules, and results in explicit algorithms for changing the data structures. <strong>It's more like machine language or BASIC than math</strong>, and thus very "mechanical" and explicit such as "check to see if attribute X contains character Y, and if it does, then change attribute Z to 'foo'". There's no abstract math or math symbols or reference-heavy vocabulary (definitions that depend on other definitions that depend on yet other definitions). I don't dispute that there are math-like notations that may be more accurate and compact than English alone, but most developers are not going to relate to those (either forgetting them since school or have never been sufficiently introduced to them). Familiar data structures plus explicit BASIC-like or machine-language-like data structure transformation rules are the best solution in those circumstances. <a href="KnowYourAudience.html">KnowYourAudience</a>. You will likely dispute this, but for the sake of argument even if most would be comfortable with a math-like explanation or an English-centric explanation, you couldn't realistically claim that ALL will be, and thus it's possible that 1% or so may just like the tag model better.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Where are your "familiar data structures" and "explicit algorithms" documented?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion.html">TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion</a> gives examples. If any are not clear enough to you, I've already agreed to refine them in terms of <a href="StepwiseRefinement.html">StepwiseRefinement</a>. (Remember, the exact algorithms for any language model depends on the specific language such that selected representative examples are given, but the details will depend on a given language.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I re-read </em><a href="TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion.html">TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion</a>, and I do find it unclear.  It's lacking introductory text to give the explanations context, and the explanations themselves appear disconnected.  They're mainly disjoint pseudocode examples with rambling discourse on their meaning, rather than presentation of a cohesive model.  I can find no "familiar data structures" or "explicit algorithms".  It appears the model exists in your mind, but hasn't yet made it into a written document.	<a href="TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion.html">TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion</a> appears to be the discussion and illustrations that would normally follow presentation of a model, but that presentation is absent.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           XML is not a "familiar data structure" to you? I agree it needs a better intro, but it would be repeats of stuff I've written already elsewhere, probably multiple times, and you'd likely launch the same complaints about it. If it's not clear to you, I'm not sure what to do. I don't know where the trains in your head are derailing because I cannot directly view your train yard.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>XML is a familiar markup language.  I've never heard XML described as a "data structure" before, familiar or otherwise.  Familiar data structures are binary trees, linked-lists, stacks, queues, doubly linked-lists and arrays.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Is "common data representation" sufficient?
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>As for an introduction to </em><a href="TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion.html">TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion</a> being "repeats of stuff I've written already elsewhere", it is precisely the lack of introduction <strong>and</strong> the need for the reader to self-assemble your model from multiple pages that makes it difficult to understand and impossible to appreciate.  If you were to describe it in <strong>one place in its entirety</strong> -- say, in <a href="TopsTagModel.html">TopsTagModel</a> -- even if there's duplication, at least we would have a definitive source to refer to.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I pretty much doubt that.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>You doubt that we would have a definitive source to refer to if you described your model in one place?  Huh?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           However, let's try this for now: Are the explanations/mini-models for the <em>specific</em> observations in <a href="TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion.html">TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion</a> clear to you?
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>No, I find them unclear.  I can understand what you're trying to say, but I find the descriptions awkward, overly-verbose, inclined to ramble, incorporate extraneous detail that is often unenlightening (the proliferation of W^s and R^s is baffling, for example), and ruminations on things like "how we get two 'types' at the same time" are gratingly contrary to what I consider simple, direct, and fairly obvious explanations.  Overall, the whole set of explanations (they are mini-models?  what's a "mini-model"?) lack the elegance and simplicity of a model, and instead seem like an arbitrary collection of disjoint observations that share only some coincidentally similar terminology, but are otherwise the result of misapplying art critique to elementary </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Redundancy is the least of our problems. In fact it can be argued that redundancy is sometimes good for explanations because presenting the same info in different ways may help it click and/or be reinforced in somebody's mind; somewhat comparable to studying the same physical object from different angles. Anyhow, let's put cleaning up redundancy as a low priority because so far the biggest bottleneck is clarity. Redundancy is an annoyance at best but lack of clarity is a show-stopper.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I didn't mention redundancy.</em> 
        </li>
        <li>
           So writing style aside, are they clear and if not where and which part is not clear? Where do reinforcements need to be added? And why are the W and R "pointers" a problem? I like those kinds of things in documentation because they help my <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> by labeling and pointing to things to make sure I'm looking at the right thing in terms of the description. Arrows with labels are usually a good thing in my book. And making it double clear what's being read versus what's being written to is also a good thing in my book. English is sometimes either ambiguous, or perhaps I have a language weakness in my head that makes it ambiguous to my <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, but I don't think I'm alone in that regard. Arrows with summarizing labels and attributes are things I prefer in most documentation. (Granted using ASCII limits our options, but we can still point and label to some extent.) If arrows irritate you (for reasons unknown to me), I'm sorry, but you are not the ideal reference specimen. Think of them kind of like the "program pointer" in machine language where the "current instruction" is identified via an address. The machine language description often specifies the specific address being read/changed at a given time and the rules/algorithm for changing the various bytes. It's more of a "mechanical" view of the processing rather than a linguistic one. We can apply <a href="StepwiseRefinement.html">StepwiseRefinement</a> on such rules/descriptions/algorithms to build an actual machine language interpreter if needed to fully illustrate/mirror/model the process in an unambiguous way because it's in C or Pascal or the like instead of English. <strong>If English was good enough, we wouldn't need Pascal, C, etc.</strong> (COBOL? :-)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Writing style aside, they are not clear.	I have no objection to defining a language, structures and operators in order to create a model.  That, in fact, would be excellent.  That is not what you've done.  Your "machine language description" is entirely unlike machine language.  Where are the operators?  What are their operands?  Etc.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Let me re-phrase that. It doesn't have to be a machine language, per se, it can be a pseudo-code snippet of an interpreter to process the target operator being modeled. An Algol-like pseudo-code notation that operates on model data structures/notations is familiar to most programmers and is usually pretty clear to them. Again, if English was good enough to explain processes, we wouldn't need computer languages. <strong>Computer languages were created for the very purpose of describing processes.</strong> Programmers have to know imperative algorithms and data data structures to do their jobs, but not necessarily have a strong grasp of English. Thus, it's not rational to lean toward an English-centric model. If your target audience was literature majors or lawyers, then an English-centric approach may be more fitting.

               <em>All fine, and that's why we have diagrams to supplement English text and notations to replace English text.  Indeed, a language or pseudo-code (which, if done right, is just a language without an implementation) can be an excellent notation for expressing the workings of a system or model.  However, I have not yet seen an indication of this in your "tag model" descriptions.  I've seen pseudo-code used for observations, but not for explanations, and certainly nothing that I would consider essential to being a model: parts and rules for combining the parts.  Your "Observation x Modelling" descriptions on </em><a href="TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion.html">TypeTagDifferenceDiscussion</a> consist only of XML illustrations with English descriptions and one pseudo-code assignment to a variable.  Describing these via a clearly-defined purpose-built language would be excellent.<em></em>

           And "why can we seemingly have multiple types at the same time" is a likely question a reader would have and should be addressed directly and clearly in my opinion. The apparent contradiction between typeName-like functions and is-type-X-like functions, for example, should be addressed and illustrated face on.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Sure, but it's trivially explained:  If a value has a type, then typeName-like functions return the type name whilst is-type-X-like functions examine the value to see if it encodes type-X.  Simple stuff.</em> 
        </li>
        <li>
           You haven't clarified the specific mechanism of "encode", and make sure its clearly separate from has-type-ness.
        </li>
        <li>
           {Why would we care about the specific mechanism? However, the separation is already clear. The language defines a type system. That type system determines what values are associated with what types. On the other hand, when you map values of one type to values of another type, that mapping is an encoding.}
        </li>
        <li>
           We need a specific model; otherwise it's English Fuzz. And, no the separation is NOT clear. Yes, I know the language defines the type system, but we have to model that type system (or relevant parts of it) SOMEHOW if we want to predict its behavior. There's no magic shortcut. And you have not defined/described what exactly is being mapped or even how we check to see if mapping took place. What exactly is being mapped to what and how do we empirically verify/see that? Yet another overloaded/vague word: map. We need another one of those like a hole in our cotton Jello Cloud.

            </li>
            <li>
               I'll leave the on-going debates about "simpler" out of this section. But it is possible that part of the big problem with type documentation is that the metaphorical <strong>car engineers are writing the "drivers manual"</strong>, and that's often a recipe for communication disasters. If you've ever seen end-user documentation written by tech master degree holders fresh out of college, you'll have some idea of what I mean. Implementation-centric viewpoints or assumptions leak into the interface-user side of things.

            <li>
               <em>Your speculation about documentation is noted.  My point still stands.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Catering the doc to the interpreter makers is relatively unimportant. Yes, such may create a communication "gap" between the two parties, but <strong>so what</strong>? Is that connection really that important that we have to make models more complex to keep that channel fully open? (Yes, I know you disagree that such a simple-versus-complex choice is actually here, but consider the hypothetical at least.) I'm not dismissing your concern, only saying it's the smaller of two evils.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>It isn't a matter of catering documentation to interpreter makers, but whether or not the simplified model is actually simplified, which it appears not to be.  What parts of your model are actually "simpler"?  And do you really expect your model to be adopted in favour of conventional explanations?</em>
            </li>
            <li>

            <li>
               <em>Why do </em>'you<em>' ignore the simplicity issue?  It appears to be crucial.

            </li>
            <li>
               I don't ignore it; your metric for "simplicity" is fucked up.

               <em>How so?</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Further, it's not just about simplicity, but leveraging existing communication knowledge/styles. Like I said above, imperative algorithms and data structures are already familiar to programmers (as a job requirement) such that if we can ride that train for our documentation, then communication will be better.  Your approach is too different from that requiring a potentially unfamiliar communication style. (Actually, I think it's garbage, but am entertaining the idea that it's clear only if one "gets it".)
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>But your model has no imperative algorithms and only one "data structure", a tuple shown using XML.  What algorithms and data structures do you mean?  Are you saying you think imperative language </em><a href="TypeSystems.html">TypeSystems</a> are garbage?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               I have too shown imperative algorithms. They are not just fleshed out very specifically yet (in progress). As far as the actual type systems that run most interpreters, like I said and justified many times, mirroring the actual mechanism is of secondary importance to grokkability by typical developers (or at least a subset who don't like the traditional verbal-oriented approach). If epicycles satisfy <em>those</em> goals/priorities better than Newton's work, I'll go with the epicycles. Most developers only need to predict the position of the planets, they DON'T need to explain them. Is that clear???!!! (Ideally languages should be defined by their I/O profile, not implementation anyhow.)
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>So you've "shown imperative algorithms" but they "are not just fleshed out", i.e., you haven't shown them.  I guess you've imagined them.  When you've shown them, then we'll see.  So far, it appears that for those aspects of language behaviour that your model accounts for, it's equivalent in complexity to the conventional explanations, but with odd terminology ("tag") and at least one outright error -- variables in dynamic languages do not have types, only values do, which is why dynamically-typed languages are sometimes called "value typed".  Note that despite the apparent intuitive observation of epicycles, they actually make it more complex to calculate planetary positions than Newtonian or classical mechanics.  Your defence of them is odd; why do you wish to defend flawed models?</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               I'll leave the objective existence of values debate to <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>. Also, I did not say that epicycles WERE better, but rather IF they were better. I was making the point that <strong>a model useful for a specific purpose CAN be better than general purpose model</strong> in some cases/uses. As general principle I think you will agree. Being closer to "reality" (implementation) is not necessarily the most important concern. A better actual example may be Newtonian physics versus Einsteinian physics. Technically, the latter is more accurate, but may be more difficult to use as a tool. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I don't disagree that a simplified model may be useful for a purpose.  We already simplify the conventional explanations by not talking about various optimisations.  However, you've yet to show that your "tag model" is better suited to its purpose or simpler than conventional explanations.  So far, the only evidence of "simpler" appears to be that it covers fewer cases.  How is it simpler at describing the same behaviours?  And we're not dealing with a significant difference in calculation complexity that are only significant (for most purposes) at highly particular endpoints of a system (i.e., where elements are very small and/or very fast) like we are with classical mechanics vs special relativity.  Your "tag model" appears to deviate from conventional explanations in such minor details that I find it difficult to justify any claim that it genuinely results in notably less effort to determine results or explain language behaviour.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Fewer cases? And it's "less effort" because it uses a communication technique already familiar to most developers because it <strong>uses communication techniques that are necessary for their job</strong>. You CANNOT make the same claim, because you rely on subtleties of language and verbal meaning. I believe it to be vague, but you insist it's clear. If it's "clear" I don't "get it" then, and many developers are not native English speakers such that their "get it" likelihood is even lower than mine. Thus, rational pro/con analysis dictates use what they have to know to get a pay check when designing explanations.

           I've already explained why matching actual interpreter implementation is of secondary importance to model simplicity, and won't repeat that argument yet again repeatedly multiple times redundantly. (It's almost the same as your model anyhow, but you just surround yours with confusing writing.) What I'm doing is (attempting to) leverage the <strong>existing knowledge and familiarity</strong> of typical developers: imperative algorithms and data structures (or XML), to create language- and operator-specific models.

        <li>
           I don't know why you are seemingly obsessed with that. It could be called a "plizzle" and the model would still work. The labeling of the parts of the model is a minor issue. If there were existing terms that were not overloaded and confusing or vague, I'd consider borrowing such, but so far have not found a better candidate(s), as we've discussed probably at least half a dozen times already.

We could call it the Twizzledoodle, and as long as it's consistently referred to by Twizzledoodle in the model (modeling kit), it doesn't really matter. The visual of a "tag" like you find on store shelve products or underwear happens to be a nice visual reference in my opinion (okay, maybe not the underwear), but that's just a bonus. "Types" is overloaded in colloquial-ville for typish-like behaviors often found in dynamic language land, "tag" is not.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>As long as you use "tag" where "type" is conventionally used (and, I would argue, obviously belongs), your model is going to cause confusion and be rejected here and elsewhere.  The so-called "typish-like behaviors" are almost inevitably types and should be identified as such.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm weighing one kind of confusion against another, and "type" loses for reasons already given multiple times repeatedly.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The reasons you've given can all be interpreted as your personal preference.  Do you have objective evidence of "type" being inherently confusing or overloaded in a manner that inevitably causes confusion?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           We've been over this "common notions" thing many times already. Neither side has anything other than anecdotes. Give it up, dude, it's a dead horse.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I've not asked you about "common notions".  I've asked you specifically to provide objective evidence that there is something confusing about the use of the term "type".  Can you show an example of a potential confusion, whether from overloading or otherwise?  For example, you should be able to identify sentences like, "Therefore, a set is not used effectively." and show that the sentence makes reasonable sense whether you interpret "set" to mean a noun (a collection of elements) or a verb (to alter a property) -- hence it is overloaded -- and it is therefore unclear which meaning is intended, and that this potential confusion happens frequently enough to matter.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           The cfArgument example was such an example, and so is the contradicting nature of typeName() versus isTypeX() functions, and the potential plurality of isTypeX() functions ("being" multiple types at the same time). In a general sense, dynamic languages let each operator determine what "type(s)" a thing is such that to say object X "has a type" Y is misleading because it's not the object that determines the "type", but the operator (if it can even be defined). However, the object X potentially has type-related info associated with it, and the operator may or may not use that. What I call the "tag" is not necessarily "THE" type, but rather provides type-related info that a given operator can use IF it wants to. There are multiple aspects "associated with" an object that may affect what "type" the operator sees in the object. The tag may "affect" what the operator sees as the type, but it is false that it always "is" the type that a given operator "sees". You might walk into my country with a police badge from your country and say the badge makes you a "peace officer". However, my country may choose to ignore that badge and instead check to see what kind of underwear you are wearing or who your dad is in order to qualify you as a "peace officer" in my country. Thus, to say you "are" a peace officer is misleading or wrong: it's relative to the country (operator). There is no universal "is".  And you may be "associated with" a badge, but that may be meaningless in a given country because that country may not use or care or recognize that "associated with". Your badge is ignored in some countries: it's existence on your shirt is meaningless. Thus the answer to whether object X "has" or "is" type Y <strong>is relative</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Again, you've identified the aspects to which you object, but have not identified an actual confusion.  For example, to sustain the argument that there is a "contradicting nature of typeName() versus isTypeX() functions", you'd have to show that there is an irresolvable contradiction, e.g., a case where "x == y" in one place and "x != y" in another.  That does not appear to be the case here.  Here, it's the case that typeName() always returns the name of the type associated with the value; isTypeX() returns true if the named type equals the type associated with the value or if a value of the named type is encoded in the value, otherwise it returns false.  That's not contradictory.  It's perhaps not particularly elegant, but that's a PHP quirk, not a problem with the term "type".</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Those are just words; they don't mean anything concrete to me. You might as well say, "typeName returns the zigs of the snoobs from the glibbles, while isTypeX() returns snorks from the grommit if it's Tuesday, otherwise returns the floog of the niff's gumple." They don't have to be contradictory to cause communication problems. They can cause problems by being too vague to mean anything concrete. In other words, "contradictory" is not the only possible problem they can have. As an extreme example, "Bakt alk asd asdfuehs asdf asdrra akbk;s" has NO known contradictions, but it's obviously not very useful in terms of conveying meaning and clarity (except maybe to you Orionoids).
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>What you call "just words" presumes you are familiar with fundamental </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> notions about programming languages: a literal (a string of characters) denotes a value, every value is of a type; every type has a name (e.g., 'string'); and every string (a value of 'string' type) can encode literals of various types.  E.g., "123.32" is a literal that denotes a value of the type named 'string', which encodes a literal -- 123.32 -- that denotes a value of a type named 'float'.  Thus, an operation like typeName() simply returns the name of the type of "123.32" ('string'), but an operation like isNumeric() parses the string "123.32" to see if it encodes a literal of some numeric type and returns true if it does.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               They are not well defined. "I know 'em when I see 'em" doesn't always cut it.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>But they are well defined.

Anyway, I should think terms like 'literal', 'character', 'parses', 'value', 'string', 'numeric', 'encodes', 'float', and 'denotes' would be self-evident, given their meanings here are consistent with their usual English use in general and <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> in particular.

It in turn, is derived from the formal semantics of logic, which has been successfully used since the 1930s. That came about because the informal semantics in use before then had proven to be insufficiently rigorous for mathematical use.}

And "been successfully used since 1967" strongly suggests it's an implementation model. Our <strong>head models don't have to match implementation</strong> any more than we should force ourselves to think in stacks; but stubborn professors may start pushing that very idea if somebody doesn't put an end to these phony cannon and HOF claptraps. They want to make themselves worth more by endorsing complexity and confusion. It's selfish greed. Fuck these <strong>professional convoluters</strong>, they are dangerous to the profession.

Furthermore, I'm not talking about implementations at all, so none of that matters here. We also aren't talking about HOFs here. So that also doesn't matter. As for canon, it is canon for the simple fact that they rarely use anything else (to the point that I've never seen them use anything else). Your final rant is borderline paranoid.

               As I read such texts, they ARE vague to me, as my mind processes and interprets English. In the past when we go over such text together and I point out multiple alternative interpretations (per everyday English usage), you say something along the lines of "if you read the fat stack of Computer Science books I have, then you'd JUST KNOW what they REALLY meant." Even IF that statement were true, for the sake of argument, it's not SELF STANDING ENGLISH as written per "regular" reader. It would be a <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a> disguised as a public language. Thus "has" may really mean "contained (nested) inside the data structure X", but the reader doesn't know that "has" is not really the ordinary "has" from everyday English, but rather an alias for the function tranformationFluxReductionRetainment33() or whatnot. It's like spy language where "it's raining at the house" really means, "Get your staff out of Stockholm immediately". Such books are then misleading, which underscores my original point that they are badly written (at least for non-MS/Phd's). If they are ONLY intended for academics, they should state so clearly up front. And still leaves no decent material/definitions for non-academics. Now you have TWO problems: lying and gaps. --top

The fact that you are trying to attach everyday meanings to words with technical definitions would certainly result in the confusion that you obviously suffer from. Texts written using the technical definitions aren't misleading, and their authors aren't lying to you. You simply don't have the background to understand them. That gap can be bridged by having the interested non-academic learn what the technical terms mean. We refer you to "the fat stack of Computer Science books" in order to bridge the very gap in your knowledge that you are complaining about here.

It is my assessment that type-related material in typical textbooks and manuals is a very weak spot of IT, especially when it comes to dynamic languages. I've dissected the English in samples on this and related pages and I believe I've demonstrated sufficiently to the reader the kinds of problems found in such statements. If you think it's all fine and shiny, go ahead and live with that false impression. I honestly believe your bias makes you read with a jaundice eye to project your favorite definition/view into any English you encounter such that you don't recognize ambiguities and potential alternative interpretations. It's somewhat similar to my "proofreading problem" described in <a href="DocumentationAnecdote.html">DocumentationAnecdote</a>: my mind projects my intent into what I am reading back such that I have a hard time reading it objectively.

In some languages, any kind of data can be stored in a variable while, in others, each variable is given a well defined type by the programmer and only data of the correct type may (or at least should) be stored in that location." You've already admitted to a flaw in the way you assess these things. You try to use the everyday meaning of English words when the technical meanings are the ones intended. That does result in a garbled account, but the problem is at your end, not with the us.

I don't know what "flaw" you are talking about, and from that point on your criticisms are not specific enough for me to know what the hell you are talking about. Yet more sloth on your part. Shape up or go away. Whenever you see something in a model you don't personally like, you label it as a "flaw", being the drama queen you are. Nothing is objectively broken. And how does one verify and measure "given" in "each variable is given...". Do you have a Give-O-Meter?

I don't see how that definition of "variable" contradicts my model. Besides I not even out to define "variable". The focus should be on types.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   {I didn't supply that definition to contradict your definition of variable. I supplied it as evidence for my claim about what the canonical definition was.}

                   I don't see how that follows from that example. Docs typically do not describe (or at least heavily rely on descriptions of) internal formats in terms of nesting, pointer relationships, internal data structures, etc. As long as the interpreter can <em>somehow</em> find the associated parts when needed (such as type indicator(s) and value representation(s)), the documentation doesn't have to directly focus on such. The downside is that IF somebody wants to construct a specific (computer runnable) model or implementation, the <strong>docs don't narrow choices</strong> among multiple ways to implement the same thing.  Anybody trying to glean specific implementations off of English words like "has" and "is" and "references" are in for a long night unless they accept that their interpretation is largely arbitrary. -t

                   <em>"As long as the interpreter can somehow find the associated parts when needed" is a good interpretation of the abstract definition.  It </em>'should<em>' be broad enough to encompass any possible implementation, without dictating an implementation approach.  It means any technical approach that (for example) associates a value representation with a type is sufficient to be a "value".  The association must exist, but how, where, and what is used to make it exist is up to the language designer and implementer.</em>

                   Exactly. There is no canon model/implementation. At best we can get occurrence measurements: 30% use technique X, 20% use technique Y, etc.

                   Bullshet, the tag model can model those languages just fine. "De facto canon", if that ain't an oxymoron, I don't know what is. Is that like "accidental intent"? Too much horse stuff in paragraph. And many of those languages were around before OOP was common. Thus, the parametric polymorphism of <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> is after their time.

                   <em>I'm sure the "tag model" can model those languages just fine, though it employs unfamiliar terminology and confusingly adds a type attribute to variables in </em><a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages which makes them look like <a href="StaticallyTyped.html">StaticallyTyped</a> variables, and no one has ever heard of it except you, me, and the other two or three people who have bothered to read the relevant pages.  "De facto canon" simply means it's the conventional explanation that has arisen organically over the last forty-odd years; there isn't a single definitive reference -- like there is for, say, the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>: Codd's "A Relational Model for Large Shared Databanks" -- or a specified informal standard like an RFC.

                   I will agree that the parametric polymorphism approach is <em>currently</em> the favored approach (or at least the "in-style" approach) to document much of dynamic typing (more on this later). However, the structure/relationships of "variables", values/representation, and type indicators does NOT reflect anything common. You are merely documenting your personal preference and/or implementer preference. It doesn't fit an magic fuzzy "semantics" canon. <strong>You are hallucinating its existence</strong>.  And almost all models have internal parts. Complaining about the internal parts of my model is like complaining about the gears in an orrery. Likewise, I found "representation" awkward in your model. It's all about trade-offs: <strong>real world usage is overloaded</strong>, but a specific model has to commit to certain names, forcing one to choose one specific interpretation/usage over another. Both models take a hit in a different spot to deal with that issue. I explained my naming decisions as carefully and detailed as I can. If you disagree, so be it. (Typically we have different goals and/or working assumptions about typical developer <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>. My choices are logical based on my stated goals and <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> assumptions.)

                       It describes a theoretical or conceptual model. I have no problem with that per se, but that does not make it a canon, nor says anything about <strong>runnable  models</strong>. We can pretend there is only one integer value "12" in the universe in a kind of existential sense (as described by the link), but it's usually not PRACTICAL for a runnable model to reference a single instance of that "12" in order to mirror this existential uniqueness. Your model doesn't do it nor does mine. Even IF one accepts the existential canon that there is one and only one value "12" in the universe, no practical model can mirror that conceptual view. Even YOU chose not to in your model, duplicating "12" if two more variables share the "same value" of 12. I'm not going to complicate my model to mirror an existential view either. You took the practical route for "12", but why won't you accept the same "reality/practicality adjustment" for the structuring of a "variable"? It appears to be hypocrisy at face value. -t

           Actually, the model discussions should split the "variable structure" issue from the operator decision/behavior aspect (polymorphism). They are generally orthogonal and one could swap that part. My model's operation/decision model is more general, as discussed in <a href="SignaturesAndSoftPolymorphism.html">SignaturesAndSoftPolymorphism</a>. I realize there is a trade-off in being more general, and we'll never agree about which trade-off is "right". Let both exist and <strong>let the reader apply</strong> them as needed. Contemplating the trade-offs of each is a good mental exercise for those studying types regardless of whether it's "in style" or not. Knowing why the industry uses X instead of Y requires studying Y. That's <strong>better than taking X on faith</strong>. (Modeling "what is" and modeling "should" are two different things.

           Like I have said multiple times, Mr. Forgetty, most don't dwell on it heavily, they <strong>spot fix problems</strong> where encountered. Similarly, I got by the same way for many years using fuzzy notions that were <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>. Curiosity eventually led me to explore predictive models. The fact that the Php manual and your "Boolean variables" source seemed to have "missed it up" (from your perspective) is some evidence that there's a general communication problem in dynamic land.

        <li>
           <em>Typographical errors are legion in documentation, so I wouldn't put any significance on the "Boolean variables" one.

           I'm not sure I agree it's "conventional". There is no documented canon or anything even close to a documented canon.  Your model also has terminology issues in my opinion. There's no free lunch, only the balancing of trade-offs. We have several pages arguing the merits of each model and I won't repeat those debate points here. And I'm not sure existing documentation can be improved withOUT introducing arbitrary model choices; the situation appears to be inherently suck with <a href="VagueOrArbitrary.html">VagueOrArbitrary</a>.

           How does it "evade types"? <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a> can be used on a <a href="StepwiseRefinement.html">StepwiseRefinement</a> basis. We can test a whole program, an expression, or a single operator. I never limited it to entire programs (although for testing purposes we typically need to package our code as "programs"). And you seem to be conflating behavior and semantics. I/O profile is a measure of behavior. Semantics is related to human thought patterns, and is harder to objectively analyze. And I don't know how you are measuring has-ness per "variable" complaint. It appears to be model favoritism rather than an objective or "official" trait of variables.

           "Tag" is short for "type tag". Whether it "is" a "type-reference" or not is a vocab issue, not really a model issue. "Type reference" is not that common in colloquial land such that using/applying it or not has small if any <em>practical</em> consequences.

        <li>
           <em>Even the use of "tag" instead of "type tag" seems to be an attempt to avoid mention of types.  It's true that "type reference" is not that common, because it's usually shorted to "type".  Why not say "type"?</em>

            <li>
               I wish to label a specific model part in a way that reduces chance of confusion with general overloaded colloquial terms. I'm pretty sure we've had this discussion before. There is no conspiracy to avoid saying "type". It's called a "type tag" up front and shortened to "tag" in areas of frequent use to make the text more concise. It's a common an accepted practice.

            It's "normal" English to talk about "numbers", "strings", "dates" etc. as stand-alone nouns. However, we don't normally say "Booleans" in the same way (although it's fairly common in face-to-face colloquial speak). The author thus had to put a noun in there to make it proper English. Why they rejected "type" over "variable", I don't know. We can only speculate. I would note the choice is consistent with the section title.

               Fine, it's fuzzy TO ME. I have a hard to time figuring it out beyond a vague notion. And my anecdotal experience talking to other developers is that they too mostly only work with fuzzy notions of "types" in dynamic languages. That's why I developed the tag model: to be able to model specific behavior of languages in a way that makes sense to most developers. I'm at a loss to explain why it's fuzzy in a way that satisfies you. Your explanations just seem to follow the "letter pattern" above. Your explanations seem to be tied to alien models in YOUR head, not something that is concrete to my world or way thinking.

It certainly is for those I know about.  But maybe some degree courses skip it entirely, which means students learn <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> or <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> with very different conceptual foundations from those that I assume.

               I believe that statement to be flat wrong. I don't know where you two guys work, but your notion of what typical developers know and do seems just plain devoid of reality. Yes, they teach a rough general "notion" of types, but it's the devilish details that matter here.

            <li>
               I don't meet many such prodigies. Perhaps your university gets the elite applicants whereas I encounter Average Joe programmers. Besides, one can program in those languages well if they know them well, but that's not necessarily the same as having a <strong>conscience mental model</strong> of how the <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a> works (or doesn't work). Experience will often give one "horse sense" in that they "feel" a certain programming pattern should or shouldn't be used for a given spot based on repeated training. But this is more like traditional neural-net "training" (essentially statistical frequency matching) and not necessarily a conscience plan or model.

               The inconsistency between Php's is_bool and is_numeric functions (and the fact that few really even care) shows that even language builders can be lackadaisical about such issues.

               It takes input and produces output. If you say "functions do X", you need to show that in terms of I/O. Your "type reference" can be part of a PARTICULAR model of I/O, but that doesn't make it a universal truth, only a part in a given model, which may be one of many different models that mirror/predict I/O. If you can logically prove that <strong>"ALL accurate models must have part X"</strong>, please do. Oops, I said "do". My bad.

               In terms of output, yes! Machine speed is not an issue when a developer is trying to predict/model type-related behavior. The key here is "in terms of". If we don't need to care about speed for a given goal, then we can perhaps simplify the model to achieve such by sacrificing speed. I stated my target goals and fit them. Speed was not a top goal. You agreed to not include caching etc. in your model for similar reasons, if I am not mistaking. (I don't know if those two sorts produce the same result for ties.)

           It looks to me like you are jumping back a step. You talk about an intermediate object, and then refer to the original after that ("literal"). Once you talk about the intermediate object, in my opinion, it's best to stick with that as your working verbal reference point unless there is a compelling reason to jump back. And IF you do jump back, make sure it's clear which object is being discussed.

           I don't know which "thing" is being referenced. The relationship of the nouns in the 2nd sentence to the first sentence is not explicit. Which "string"? Which "literal"? I suggested removing the "for each" approach and focus on one at a time to simplify references and context. For one, interpreters only have to process literals that the "program pointer" actually encounters. I realize a pre-parse is often done, but is not a necessary step for interpreters.

           It's an improvement. But your use of "of" in "of a specified type" is bothersome. It's as if you are mentioning a function called something like "isOfType()", but not defining what this of-ness function does (how it affects output or measurable activity). In colloquial speak, it's normal to say Php's is_numeric() function will "tell you if the operand is <em>of</em> a numeric type". But it's also acceptable to say "getType() will tell you if the operand is <em>of</em> a numeric type". So which pattern does "of" reflect, since each (colloquially legitimate) interpretation path produces a potentially different result: a given variable "has" or "references" TWO types at the same time. But your use of "a" in "has a reference to type" suggests there only be one type. The description does not answer this potential reader puzzle. Also, is_numeric works on non-strings (tag=int) such that the description seems incomplete or at least misleading, implying they only "work on" strings (tag=string). Otherwise, why mention strings? The reader may likely ask why strings are being mentioned at that spot. is_numeric's results do NOT by themselves confirm "contain a sequence of characters that represents a literal of a specified type" since we don't know if an Integer "contains a sequence of characters" based on what's given. Thus, (without constraints) it's a weak detector of the condition you describe such that perhaps it should not be mentioned, because otherwise it may be legitimately mistaken for the single and only test. Or perhaps word it as "function X can <em>help</em> determine if" rather than "function X determines if" (paraphrased). But then it begs the question of how full determination is done, which should then be given or linked to in good docs rather than leave the reader hanging with just one of the multiple "helper" functions necessary. In a medical book, you shouldn't say "a stethoscope determines if you have a bad heart" because it's not the end-all-be-all of heart tests. You could say "a stethoscope can <em>help</em> determine if you have a bad heart", but in that case fuller tests should be described or referenced. Otherwise, move or change around the whole thing.
        </li>
        <li>
           Further, it doesn't exclude the interpreter from checking in the "type reference" for "sequence of characters". As written, that's a valid interpretation, but it's not reflective of how Php behaves. That's why I try to explicitly label all parts and containers. Then I can say "looks inside of component X". And if component Y has been stated to be "in component X", then it's fair to assume Y is also looked at. Your description ("has") is nebulous about such relationships. If you say "value A has a reference to B" and you say "foo looks at/in A", <strong>it's not clear whether that "looks at" also includes B</strong>. "Has reference" does not hard-force one interpretation over the other. <strong>Both interpretations are valid in common English</strong>. That's an illustration of why English sucks for tech docs. I'd lean toward excluding B as written, but there is no solid rule that "at" or "in" excludes "reference following" in colloquial English. And the "reference" ITSELF may also have characters that apply even IF we exclude what is actually being pointed to. Thus, it could be looking at the URL even if it excludes the web page (HTML) at that URL. I think I know what you <em>meant</em> after all our haggling, but you cannot assume a new reader will also.

           <em>There's an inevitable point where the inherent ambiguity of human language makes further precision possible only by being painfully verbose, and a choice has to be made between a short, simple, but potentially somewhat ambiguous description and a long, complex, precise description.

           Yes, English is inherently ambiguous. That we can agree on. The issue is what to do about it. If written well, it could be <em>less</em> ambiguous than your English-centric attempt (or at least I am not particular fond of your writing style, but different <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> may see something else), and that may go for my written attempts also. We are probably not the best technical writers in the world and probably cannot rely heavily on English. Now, my solution is to use imperative computer algorithms (code or pseudo-code) and data-structure-like XML to give a predictive model of type-related behavior. Developers see these every week and thus they are likely to be quite familiar. Your set-oriented attempt below is perhaps another approach, but a good many developers are not going to absorb such quickly. This, we are proposing two different approaches toward a formal notation. I believe my approach is a better fit to the audience's <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> (as shaped by experience and filtered by the hiring process). The idea is to leverage what they already know <strong>well</strong>. But there's no harm in having two models so one can choose the better fit for themselves. Viva Variety. -t

           I still stand by the trade-off choices I made and gave what I feel are good reasons and won't repeat all that here. "Value" is vague, at least outside of the interpreter maker circle. You have very different beliefs about what <em>common</em> programmers know and how they think and read documentation, and thus you make different choices and recommendations based on that. My model design decisions are consistent with my assumptions about programmer <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> and listed goals. Neither of us has more than experience to model such <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> and thus <strong>we are stuck</strong> at a anecdote or <a href="TopsLaw.html">TopsLaw</a> impasse. If you expect more than this, please state why. You also seem to have an urge to punish common programmers for allegedly not thinking properly, and this I feel is making you biased against a model that does not follow academic tradition.  In the model/kit, I just focus on helping them with a specific issue rather than try to reshape society or IT culture in general.

There are ample opportunities to gain greater understanding of "value", "type", "variable", and any other fundamental concept in programming.  If they reject opportunities to learn, or are too apathetic to make an effort to learn, then you're right -- I am biased against them.  I have nothing but support, encouragement and time for programmers who seek greater knowledge and understanding in order to improve their craft.  I have no patience (or, as one of my colleagues likes to say, "Fucks given equals zero!") for "programmers" (and I use the term loosely) who have no interest in improvement.

The old stuff is not a Bible locked in stone. Granted, Grace's early attempts were not very good, but they helped pave the way to the Algol-style we benefit from today. Progress sometimes requires trying new things. I'm trying to do to type documentation what Grace did for programming languages.

It's a familiar model for how a wing works, and it's almost completely wrong.  If it was true, aeroplanes couldn't fly upside-down and symmetrical (including flat) wing profiles (which are used in some cases) wouldn't work.  In fact, the effect is real, but is typically only worth about 2% of overall lift.  98% of the lift is due to the angle of the wing relative to the direction of travel, i.e., the angle of attack.  Stick your hand out of the window of a moving car and angle it upward into the wind to experience the real effect.  So what is gained by the false explanation?  Absolutely nothing.

Furthermore, there is no "retrieve variable's type" or "store variable's type" operations, which would also be indicative of a variable being associated with a type.

Of course, a value is always associated with a type (i.e., has a type reference), but I presume transitive relationships are not at issue here, because you're arguing that a PHP scalar variable has a (semantically) explicit 'type reference' attribute, aren't you?

That would require a notion of a "typed variable" in PHP, but you'd quickly discover that for every semantic operation involving a 'typeless value', there is a corresponding semantic operation involving a 'valueless type'.  Thus, it seems parsimonious to combine the 'typeless value' and 'valueless type' into a single semantic construct: a value (of a type).  Of course, that's exactly what popular imperative programming language semantics -- which again go back to a beginning knowledge of </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> -- do.

           [Given that it's wrong, declaring it so seems an eminently reasonable response. Again, gettype() does not take a variable as its parameter; it's trivially observable that it can accept any expression, including things like gettype(f()), and that it always returns a string describing the type of the value passed to it. PHP's documentation sucks. We all know this. Note that the documentation for the equivalent operators in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> ( <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof">https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/typeof</a> ), Python ( <a href="https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#type">https://docs.python.org/2/library/functions.html#type</a> ), and Ruby ( <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Object.html#method-i-class">http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.1.3/Object.html#method-i-class</a> ) does not conflate variables and values in this way. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
        <li>
           I agree it should say "variable or expression" or just "expression". However, settype says "Set the type of a variable" and is observationally accurate since you cannot set the type of an expression (at least be able to see the effects). "Values" are a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> <strong>in the head</strong> and don't actually correspond to anything objectively observable in Php, such as syntax "objects" or patterns or I/O. You've failed <a href="ValueExistenceProof.html">ValueExistenceProof</a> because you have no proof. You claim if one reads enough books on types and languages they'll "just know" that values objectively exist (and contain types). "Just know" is weak, anti-scientific, and shameful. <strong>You mistake tradition and/or your personal head model for objective truth.</strong> Straiten up and fly right; you are getting academically sloppy.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>If you read the explanation for settype(), you'll see it's typical PHP misnamed bodgery.  Settype doesn't set the type of a variable, it converts the variable's value from one type to another.  Whilst "values" don't have a syntactic construct (aside from literals, which denote them), they are unquestionably a semantic construct.  The semantics of popular imperative programming languages require reference to values.  Informally, we speak of "the value in a variable" or "the value this expression evaluates to".  It's difficult (and pointless) to speak of language semantics without values.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Where does one "see" this exactly? You have not scientifically measured "semantics", you just invent properties of it out of your arse. And I already agreed that values are a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>, but that does not make them objective.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>It appears in the semantics of elementary arithmetic expressions, and is covered almost every introductory programming textbook in </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>.  As for values being a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>, that's not quite true.  At a <a href="ComputerArchitecture.html">ComputerArchitecture</a> level, a 'value' is the generic term given to the state of a register, stack location, and/or memory address.  We say "<x> contains the value 3", for example -- which means it holds a particular string of bits, bytes, words, whatever -- and at a machine-language level we (typically) infer the type (which we <strong>must</strong> do, so that we know the value is a 3 and not a character, a pointer, the exponent of a floating-point value, etc.) by context, such as what machine language operation will use the value (or the address/register containing it) as an operand.  Once we move to a higher level language, the notion of registers and memory addresses become abstracted away, but the notion of a "value" remains in the context of variables, what functions return, what expressions evaluate to, and what literals denote.<em></em>

        <li>
           If we view program code as math, we don't need such.

           <em>Sorry, I don't follow you.  If we view program code as math, we don't need what?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           However, for the sake of argument, implementations typically do indeed need something value-like, whether it's called data, content, values, registers, etc.; and our collective experience of doing such by hand in math class gives us a general rough common impression of "value". However, the nature of such "guts" can be very open-ended because it is an implementation detail and there are usually multiple ways to implement the same thing. Note we can objectively all "see" the literal "3", but whether that represents a "value" is purely an internal head choice, at least in terms of the details about using and representing that "value". Again, "value" is merely a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> and the details about using "values" is NOT canonized. (I agree implementations are semi-canonized, but we shouldn't necessary define languages by implementation because it's subject to change and has a lot of efficiency-related artifacts that the language user doesn't need to be concerned with.)  -t
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Implementations certainly need something value-like, and we can call that something data, content, values, etc. (but not registers -- they're containers of values) if we like, but in </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> we call it a "value".  It's the term <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> uses to collectively describe what variables (and registers and memory addresses) contain, what functions return, what expressions evaluate to, and what literals denote.  Individual programmers' usage may deviate from this terminology, and some language documentation may deviate from this terminology, but the science that underpins programming -- <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> -- is consistent in its terminology.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           If by "consistent" you mean common patterns by implementers, I may agree to some extent. But that's not the same as a canon. It's not logical to define non-implementation terms by implementation because implementation is swappable. The exact nature/terminology of "types" and how "types" are associated with "values" and "variables", in particular, is ambiguous, as some of the examples in this and related pages illustrate. And terminology is typically determined by usage, <strong>NOT by "computer scientist high priests"</strong>. Besides, there is no central authority in CS in the Catholic sense even if they <em>were</em> given such authority. It strongly appears as if you are forcing canons where there are none.

           <em>There are "common patterns by implementers", but that's not what I meant by "consistent".

        <li>
           As written, they do not define EXACTLY what a "type" is and EXACTLY how it relates to "value", especially in dynamic languages. I've invited you many time give an UNAMBIGUOUS definitions of "type" and "value" and UNAMBIGUOUSLY describe the relationship between them. You seem to waffle between claiming English is not sufficient to claiming it is. <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> human_languages_26 appears to be where you were in your "English (as usually used) is insufficient" mode, but above appears to be flippage. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>A type is a set of values and zero or more associated operators.  A value is a representation (see </em><a href="ComputerArchitecture.html">ComputerArchitecture</a>) and a reference to a type.  A variable is a time-varying reference to a value (plus a static reference to a type, if the language is <a href="StaticallyTyped.html">StaticallyTyped</a>.)  A constant is a static reference to a value.  An operator is a function (see mathematics) that accepts zero or more value operands and returns a value.  A literal is a sequence of symbols that denotes a value.  Have I missed anything?  At this point, if you have sufficient exposure to programming languages, we normally illustrate these definitions by showing how they apply to an assortment of popular programming languages.  If you lack that experience, we normally illustrate it using the language you're being taught.  If you're unhappy with those informal, introductory <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> definitions, then the next step toward rigour and unambiguity are formal definitions using formal notations.  That's what human_languages_26 suggests.  Of course, then it's no longer introductory <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, it's intermediate <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>.  For understanding types more formally, the Cardelli papers are a good start.<em> </em>

           Sigh. We've been over these already. "Associated" is not Boolean (except maybe beyond the light-speed event horizon of the universe). Those definitions <strong>are fuzzy</strong>, and Cardelli does NOT offer clear definitions, only models (which also are not canonical, by the way). I'm tired of debating willfully stubborn anti-scientific people.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Yup, we've been over those already.  Those are the introductory definitions, lacking only the usual bucket of code examples.  They're not fuzzy to me, or to my colleagues, or to the others who occasionally weigh in on these threads.  If you don't get it, you don't get it.  Though I've never encountered the like before.

Do you think loads of code examples and exercises, like we go through with the students, would help?<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Arrrrg! They are "not fuzzy to [you]" because you inject your personal head model into them and pull out a mirror of your personal interpretation. It's a <strong>Rorschach chart</strong> to you: your head shapes any vagueness into your pet preference model as I have discovered by probing you.  (And I cannot sample your colleagues to verify your match claim). If there was truly clear definition, then it would be refined into an algorithm-like device, math formula, rule set etc. to test objective objects against the definition to say "yes, X is a Y" and more importantly, "no, X is NOT a Y, per rule 38". You don't even begin to approach such rigor, not even on the same planet as such a test.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>It </em>'is<em>' that easy to test against the definitions, as can be trivially demonstrated by identifying variables, values, types, operators, associations between operators and types, and constants in the syntax and semantics of any popular imperative programming language.  Automating it with an "algorithm-like" device is straightforward, too -- in fact, we do it all the time, and we call that "algorithm-like" device an "interpreter" or a "compiler".</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Yeah, and there are multiple <strong>different</strong> ways to run/emulate/model the same language (<a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>), like the tag model and the <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> interpreter writer you had a run-in with for putting the type tag "in" the variable. You should have anticipated I'd point out such by now, we've burned like 7 pages on it. Are you forgetful or do you just like repetition?

            <li>
               Addendum: <strong>I didn't invent the "variable" modeling</strong> approach in my model; I copied the idea from another system I once saw on a VAX minicomputer (the details of which escape me). I found it a clever and parsimonious metaphor/technique for modeling the guts of an interpreter.

           <em>Sure, there are multiple </em>possible<em> ways to present the same thing, but </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> has converged on one -- the one I described -- which is also, perhaps, the simplest.  If I describe your tag model using text isomorphic to that which I used above, I get: "A type is a tag <otherwise undefined>.  A value is string of bits.  A variable is a time-varying reference to a value and a tag (plus a static tag, if the language is <a href="StaticallyTyped.html">StaticallyTyped</a>.)  A constant is a static reference to a value and a tag.  An operator is a function (see mathematics) that accepts zero or more value-and-a-tag operands and returns a value and a tag.  A literal is a sequence of symbols that denotes a value and a tag."  Essentially, that's the same as the "standard model" (if we can call it that) with a bit more complexity surrounding variables (two type/tag references?), and a "value and a tag" that shows up so consistently that it begs for a single term. It also relies on nuanced definitions of "value" and "type/tag", which makes it a <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a>.  That's fine if you can convince others to share your <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a>, but given there are already well-established terms in this area, it's going to take some work.<em></em>

        <li>
           That there may be academic tendencies I don't dispute; however the frequencies are not tagged and documented nor officially "blessed" by any standards body. Any tendencies found are <strong>soft tendencies</strong> such that it's not worth trying to force them into a standard. It's not something to get one's undies in a knot about. Live with the fuzz. And optimizing such for 1) human language (English), 2) actual implementations, and 3) emulation/experimentation/prototyping models probably involve selecting different trade-offs among each such that no one choice set will make all 3 happiest at the same time (or be personal design preferences). I do suspect much of the literature is optimized for the #2 because it is written by those who work on #2 as a job.

           Language designers get to define and/or implement the terms how they see fit for their language. But their views on that only live in their own language (or at least their docs), not the entire universe. For an analogy, if I make my own Star Trek game, then my stories, look, and characters would reflect MY OWN VIEW of the Star Trek universe, and would not "be" the official canon. I would be <strong>projecting my personal view</strong> of Star Trek into my virtual universe (game). Interpreters are similarly a "personal universe" that "implement" one person's/group's view of various existing notions.

Regular English is just too vague, and more formal approaches appear to be selecting one model out from multiple possible models that "do the same thing".

           I'll agree that <em>syntactic</em> elements in common languages have a lot of congruence, but "values" and "types" are either not them or do not have direct syntactical elements, or vary more widely than the others. There is no syntactic equivalence of "value" in Php and JS, for example. Literals often represent what we call "values", but there are other things/situations that are called "values" that have no objective/visible literal associated with them. We can make objective statements about syntax and syntax-based definitions [1], but not "hidden" parts.

               Your mechanical analogy is largely inappropriate to interpreters/compilers in the same way we don't talk about stacks when talking about expression evaluation even though many of them use stacks "under the hood". Re: "we don't measure semantics...", yeah that's your problem. That such languages have a similar <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>, I don't dispute, but that's not a sufficient proxy for "semantics".
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>My mechanical analogy is intended only to illustrate that semantics aren't "in the head".  The "semantics" of an engine -- what pistons, valves, cams, crankshafts, compression, exhaust, power stroke, etc. mean or do, and noting that "compression" isn't part of an engine, just like values aren't part of language syntax -- is independent of our interpretation.  Interpretation of semantics is "in the head", but semantics themselves are what the parts of a language do by design.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Why you chose "compression" as a comparison to "values" escapes me. It's an odd analogy for the topic. Compression can be objectively measured with instruments anyhow. I still reject your claim that semantics are objective (at this point in history).

            <li>
               <em>I chose "compression" because it's not an engine part, but it's fundamental to the working of an internal combustion engine.  Likewise, "value" isn't a syntactical part, but it's fundamental to the working of a popular imperative programming language.  As for rejecting my claim that semantics are objective, feel free to reject all you like.  That doesn't make you correct, and it certainly doesn't present any evidence in favour of your opinion.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               It's not objective by default. Even if I got hit by a bus, you still have no evidence it's objective. We can measure compression, we cannot measure "values" in any consistent way, unless an arbitrary model is selected.

           And I have agreed above that the Php doc on "gettype" is wrong, but not necessarily for "settype". Perhaps they wrote the description of "settype" first, and then copied it over to "gettype" and modified it without thinking.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Perhaps.  Though confusing values with variables appears throughout the manual.</em>
        </li>

           <em>Per example #1 on </em><a href="http://php.net/manual/en/function.settype.php">http://php.net/manual/en/function.settype.php</a> it changes the value. Note that the value in $foo has changed from "5bar" to 5; clearly a change in value according to the standard model.  The name is perhaps derived from what is called a "typecast", "type conversion", or "coercion" in various programming languages, which converts a value of type <x> to a nominally corresponding value of type <y>.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           A "change in value" is not necessarily mutually exclusive with a "change in variable". Thus, the first happening does not automatically preclude the second from happening. Thus, your logic is flawed. I suggest you take a basic course in Logic. You appear to be weak in that area. A a skillful logician would have caught and/or addressed the mutual-exclusive assumption themselves. It would be almost a reflex to test it first.

        <li>
           Why is "required" required? I don't understand the purpose of the question. Actually, I don't understand the question, period. Different models can match the same behavior; I never claimed there was one model.

           Also, the vocab of the <strong>guts of interpreters is arbitrary</strong>. In the future, interpreters may be implemented differently than they are today (assuming your description of their construction is accurate).

           It talks about byte-level "encoding" of information. And sometimes it also uses "data representation" instead. We don't need to model at that level for the stated goals.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>That's exactly what the representation is -- a byte-level "encoding" of information -- and "data representation" is a synonym.  We don't need to model its specifics, but its presence is necessary in every language.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           But colloquially among programmers, it's quite often called a "value", far more often than "representation" in my experience. This is largely because programmers rarely see ACTUAL "representation" inside the machine/chips. They see the I/O. Even debuggers often don't show hex or binary versions, at least not without explicit commands/modes; and that can all change in different versions/vendors; which is why I don't define languages by specific implementations of internal "representations".
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Colloquially among programmers, values are called values.  A value's representation (remember, a value is modelled as pair consisting of a representation and a type) is generally not considered, since for most purposes it doesn't matter, though it's perhaps most likely to come up in conversation about floating point, where "float" is the type and IEEE 754 defines its representation.  And strings, too.  It's mentioned in discussion about strings, such as whether they're represented as ASCII bytes or UNICODE, or whether they're null-terminated or length-preceded.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           That's often called "encoding" in developer circles. But generally it's not a concern for most type-related issues. I don't want to drag bit-diddling into the model except as a last resort.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, "encoding" is another synonym for "representation".  It's true that you can generally ignore it, but if you want to model a value, you either need to show that it has a representation or encoding, or you'll eventually have to do some </em><a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> about it.<em></em>

        An "association" then exists similar to what one would find in a relational schema. Then if the code "executes" a function such as isNumeric, CF would do a lookup in such tables. Granted, it's not a resource-efficient way to implement isNumeric and similar operations, but technically would work. <strong>Look-ups (set membership) can often be traded for computation (such as parsing)</strong> and vice verse in implementations such that it's not a distinguishing feature, or at least not a reliable feature to tie models and language descriptions/manuals to. Relationships can be "stored" or calculated/computed as needed and the decision of choice is often a matter of resource efficiency, not a feature of what the I/O looks like (observable behavior to the programmer).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That is true.  As implementation strategies, the above are certainly feasible, and you're right that parsing is not a distinguishing feature.</em>
      </p>

        And that kind of "associated with" (parsing like) often behaves different than the tag kind of "associated with", and <strong>"associated with" alone does not distinguish between the two</strong>. For one, there is one and only one association in the tag flavor with the variable, and the model makes that clear via a data structure (XML) that makes quantity limits clear and instantly perceptible to the reader. 
      </p>

        <em>In the phrase "x is associated with y", it means that given x, you know y or can answer questions about y.  If the relational model appeals to you, imagine that x is the primary key and y is an attribute value.  Whether y (meaning a type, in this case) is "parsing like" or "the tag kind" (?) is irrelevant, except where explicitly stated as I have done in </em><a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If the phrase "a variable is associated with a type" is used, you can safely assume that any distinction between "parsed" vs "tagged" or whatever is irrelevant, and the only important factor is that a variable is -- somehow, and we don't care how -- associated with a type.</em>

        By "instantly perceptible", I mean they don't have to remember that rule from 20 pages back; it's still there, visually presented in the key data structure(s) of the model. If one has a photographic memory, than such "rules" stated in English are sufficient. But a good many developers don't have photographic memories such that a quantity rule like that is best represented in something more visual or easier to remember than a buried English rule. My model is to be human-friendly, not machine friendly. Your brain may easily store and catalog bunches of verbal rules like "all zogs are floogs except if the zog has a nib on Thursdays that correspond to gliggs...", but you cannot extrapolate that ability to all humans. A diagram or data structure in a familiar format (XML, relational, etc.) simplifies the absorption and recall of such rules, associations, scope ties, and quantity limitations.

        [1] An example of an objective statement about terminology and syntax could resemble, "Out of the top 100 most popular languages, 85% call the following syntactic pattern [insert <a href="RegEx.html">RegEx</a> here] a 'foo', per their published syntax diagrams."

        In rough sense, above the level of the our disputed areas, I agree.
