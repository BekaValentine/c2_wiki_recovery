        Data Manipulation
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a> is the Manipulation of Data. ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        That's obvious, of course.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to perform <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a> presupposes that you have Data to Manipulate, meaning you must have a <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to delegate and/or automate the task of <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a>, you must have the ability to express, through either imperative or declarative statements, the precise manipulations you wish to perform. Any such expression is necessarily part of a language. A language designed specifically for the domain of <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a> is called a DataManipulationLanguage. The most popular of such languages is the <a href="StructuredQueryLanguage.html">StructuredQueryLanguage</a> (SQL) which is used for many <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>s, but there are many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(</em>DataManipulationLanguage (DML) is generally considered a subset of <a href="StructuredQueryLanguage.html">StructuredQueryLanguage</a> (SQL).  The "other part" of SQL would be DataDefinitionLanguage (DDL) -- including CREATE, DROP, GRANT, REVOKE and ALTER statments.)<em> - agreed, and that's not even counting the parts for concurrency management and transaction support.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is some confusion inherent in common terminology. Conceptually speaking, <strong>querying</strong> something should not involve <strong>manipulating</strong> it <em>(and though Heisenburg would call that </em><a href="WishfulThinking.html">WishfulThinking</a> in general, it's actually doable for Data)<em>.  A </em>'query<strong> to a database is a request for useful information regarding which you desire a response. A </strong>manipulation<strong> over a database is the performance of some alteration to it - the addition or deletion of data items (datums?).   A perhaps more appropriate term would be 'Database Manipulation Language', but </strong><a href="CestLaVie.html">CestLaVie</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>manipulation</em> portion of SQL consists of its 'Insert', 'Update', 'Merge', 'Truncate', and 'Delete' operators. Only SQL's 'Select' operator is used for querying. (Other portions of SQL are for concurrency control, security, data definition, etc.)

        <strong>On the Purpose of Data Manipulation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        (From a discussion in <a href="DataSpace.html">DataSpace</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also limits in purpose for <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a>: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Any open-world manipulation must (by definition) be performed from outside the closed system associated with the <a href="DataSpace.html">DataSpace</a>, and thus will be based on the reason the <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a> exists. This reason will involve either or both of: 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Reflection</strong> -- making sure that the information in the <a href="DataSpace.html">DataSpace</a> is consistent with some external world
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Projection</strong> -- where the data defines the world, albeit a virtual or simulated one, so updating the data updates the world  
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Any closed-world manipulation will have a purpose grounded in computational costs because one may neither gain nor lose real <em>information</em> and continue calling the manipulation <em>closed-world</em>, and thus will be either or both of:
          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Inference</strong> -- creates more value from existing data.  One might use induction or deduction to obtain valuable information from less-valuable data (e.g. in response to a query), or attempt to shift anticipated computational costs from a time when they are more expensive to a time when they are less expensive (e.g. in anticipation of a query).  The latter could include performing induction or deduction ahead of time, but also includes such things as indexing, which is a form of inference in the sense that it adds a data-object (in particular a meta-data-object, the index) to the database.
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Maintenance</strong> -- where <em>unneeded</em> facts are removed, generally with the intent to reduce computational costs associated (usually space and search-time). Data items are <em>unneeded</em> when they may be derived from other facts in the <a href="DataSpace.html">DataSpace</a> or when they will never be relevant to any future queries.  
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Query</strong> -- In a sense, <strong>Inference</strong> always <em>grows</em> the data set while <strong>Maintenance</strong> always <em>shrinks</em> it.  However, not all inference needs to add to the <em>persistent</em> data set.  Making a volatile inference logically rolls inference and maintenance into one action - you derive new facts, fire those off to whomever requested them, then immediately remove those facts as unnecessary to future queries. This sort of volatile inference most closely corresponds to the notion of a <em>query</em> response.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don't believe I'm missing anything, there. Reflection and Projection are conceptual duals (Projection casts an internal world of facts into an external one; Reflection collects an external world of facts into an internal one), as are Inference and Maintenance (Inference 'learns' and Maintenance 'forgets', both to increase the value of the database), and as are open-world and closed-world (open-world can add or removes information; closed-world cannot), so these provably cover all possible purposes for <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a>.

        <em>I have </em>'lots<strong> of data that isn't held hostage by a </strong><a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>.  I have data in CVS, for instance.<em></em>
      </p>

        Do you mean <a href="ConcurrentVersionsSystem.html">ConcurrentVersionsSystem</a> (CVS) or <a href="CommaSeparatedValues.html">CommaSeparatedValues</a> (CSV)?  Not that it matters much.    I'd question what you mean by "not held hostage by a database" [note: above statement since changed to '<a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>'], since even a CSV or XSL file <em>is</em> (at least by many <a href="DatabaseDefinition.html">DatabaseDefinition</a>s, including <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>) a <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a>.  It just isn't a DBMS.  And the basic reasons for <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a> upon it do not change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="ConcurrentVersionsSystem.html">ConcurrentVersionsSystem</a> (CVS) doesn't respond well to SQL queries.  But it does contain lots of data I find quite valuable.  "Who changed this file last month?" could be useful information.  And "Who calls this method?" could also be useful information.  Attempting to get this data with SQL queries could be... interesting.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced query support in any <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> or <a href="IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.html">IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment</a> would be very useful indeed... you'd almost expect it to be state-of-the-art by now.
