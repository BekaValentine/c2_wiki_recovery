        <a href="ArtificialNeuralNetwork.html">ArtificialNeuralNetwork</a>s are an effective tool for classification of patterns (well, vectors). However, one disadvantage of neural net modeling is that the knowledge acquired by neural nets is hard to extract. FuzzyNeuralNetwork<strong>'s can use </strong>BackPropagation to identify and express input-output relationships in the form of fuzzy rules. This leads to the possibility of human knowledge extraction.

        <em>Could you explain what it is about fuzziness that enables FNNs to "use back-propagation to identify and express input-output relationships in the form of fuzzy rules"? Why can't you do basically the same thing (whatever exactly it is) with ordinary neural networks?</em>

        Formerly stated as: <em>A </em>NeuralNet that uses <a href="FuzzyLogic.html">FuzzyLogic</a> weightings instead of discrete number weightings.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A neural net does not necessarily use discrete numbered weightings unless it is on a finite <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>. Similarly with FNNs. This is because it is impossible to represent a number with infinite precision on a finite <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>. The "finite" refers to the size of the store.

        I read about one that was used to control a helicopter in high winds.  In a book on <a href="FuzzyLogic.html">FuzzyLogic</a>, I can't remember which.

      <p>
        "This chapter concerns combined backpropagation and genetic training of fuzzy neural nets whose weights and signals are given as real or triangular fuzzy numbers. The proposed fuzzy neural network with backpropagation and genetic-based learning system is used on problems which map a fuzzy or real input to a fuzzy or real output based on interval arithmetic operations. Experimental results demonstrating characteristics of various non-linear mappings are discussed. "

        Can't talk about Fuzzy anything without mentioning its hero Bart Kosko . His books "Fuzzy Logic" and "Fuzzy Engineering" are great. The latter discusses FNN's and adaptive non-linear mapping.

        It was while browsing <a href="FuzzyThinking.html">FuzzyThinking</a> by BartKosko that I came up with the idea of a FuzzyCommunity. -- PaulMillar
