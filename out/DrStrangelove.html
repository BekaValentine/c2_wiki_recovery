        One of the great movies. It's a black comedy about the cold war, and it is filled with numerous memorable scenes and characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PeterSellers.html">PeterSellers</a> plays three different characters: the eponymous Dr. Strangelove (a satirical version of <a href="WernherVonBraun.html">WernherVonBraun</a>); Colonel Mandrake (the very proper English officer who initially discovers the 'accidental' declaration of war), and the AdlaiStevenson-esque President Merkin Muffley.  He was also the original choice for Major "King" Kong, but experienced problems when trying to develop a Texas accent for the character. After Sellers coincidentally broke his leg, Kubrick was forced to find another actor.

        Here's a good quote next time one of your programs has a small bug: "I don't think it's quite fair to condemn a whole program because of a single slip-up." -- General "Buck" Turgidson

      <p>
        "Gentlemen, you can't fight in here! This is the War Room." -- President Muffley (after an argument breaks out therein)

        Keep an eye out for a very young JamesEarlJones in one of his first films. He's one of the airmen in the SlimPickens' runaway bomber. Makes up for missing out on the part in ToKillaMockingbird.
