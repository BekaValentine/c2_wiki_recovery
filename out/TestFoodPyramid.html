        <a href="AutomatedTesting.html">AutomatedTesting</a> helps a software project by connecting user needs to code abilities. <a href="ExecutableSpecifications.html">ExecutableSpecifications</a> come in several forms, corresponding to aspects of the project lifecycle. The foundation of all testing is the <a href="DeveloperTest.html">DeveloperTest</a>, commonly called the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>. Most tests in a project should be written via <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, as developers add code abilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developers put these abilities together with <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s, merge a program end-to-end with <a href="IntegrationTest.html">IntegrationTest</a>s, and prevent old problems from coming back with <a href="RegressionTesting.html">RegressionTesting</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the higher levels, a team should write <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s and <a href="CustomerTest.html">CustomerTest</a>s, using a <a href="FrameworkForIntegratedTest.html">FrameworkForIntegratedTest</a>ing. They should use a <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> to represent requirements as a kind of <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a>. These tests match features that user populations expect.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the highest level, tests represent the program's quality to the marketplace. <a href="LoadTesting.html">LoadTesting</a>, <a href="MutationTesting.html">MutationTesting</a>, and <a href="SoftwareMetrics.html">SoftwareMetrics</a> exploit the project's test batch to rate its health and lay odds on its success.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each line of code gets constraints from a stack of testage, up to the peak.

        <em>Hmmm...</em>
        The text above suggestes that <a href="DeveloperTest.html">DeveloperTest</a>ing is <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing.
        But then goes on to say that Developers also do <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s and <a href="IntegrationTest.html">IntegrationTest</a>s --
        so DeveloperTesting is <strong><em>NOT</em></strong> limited to <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing.

      <p>
        The failure of a "Unit level test" implicates only one unit. You only need to search one unit to find the bug. That's a QA concept; Developers doing <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> don't care which unit failed, so long as most of their tests truly are unit-level, and so long as they can also search their most recent edit. Or revert it!
      </p>
      <p>
        So...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DeveloperTest.html">DeveloperTest</a> - tests not written by customers
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> - (casually) tests addressing units
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="IntegrationTest.html">IntegrationTest</a> - written by developers, usually within the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> rig
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a> - apparently typically written in a <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>, such as a <a href="BehaviorDrivenDevelopment.html">BehaviorDrivenDevelopment</a> system
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CustomerTest.html">CustomerTest</a> - criteria written by the <a href="CustomerTeam.html">CustomerTeam</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All those definitions freely overlap. A given test could be a member of almost all of them.
