        <em>Each section below (bounded by horizontal lines) contains a single work-in-progress.  You can start a new limerick with any line, part of a line, rhyme, or idea that you want to get across (expressed in prose, even).  You can work on limericks by adding to unfinished ones.  You can create variants of finished works or works-in-progress by making a fresh copy with the changes.  The only rule is that everything in a single horizontal tier should be about the same limerick.</em>
