        Wiki Is Not Wiki

        <em>Ce ci n'est pas une Wiki</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        You are reading one <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> (of around thirty thousand) on the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a>'s <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. It is also known as <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, "the c2.com wiki" or just "the wiki".
      </p>
      <p>
        It's called <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> because "Cunningham & Cunningham, Inc." bought an Internet domain and set up a Web server, and <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> installed some software to serve up these pages.  He wrote the software too, with some help from various people - this is always the way when you are the first.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite being called "the wiki", <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> isn't the only wiki site on the Internet, it was merely the first.  There is a big list of other <a href="PublicWikiForums.html">PublicWikiForums</a> which cover other topics ranging from artificial intelligence through juggling and sailing to <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> isn't even the only wiki site on this Web server (c2.com).  There are some others tucked away which discuss <a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a> software, <a href="FrameworkForIntegratedTest.html">FrameworkForIntegratedTest</a> software, etc.  <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is more general, and while there is a stated purpose for the site and a definition of what is <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> here, we tend to digress into discussions of the finer points of <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>ship and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible you are reading this because somebody told you that you are <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a>.  This is a term that may offend some people - we don't mean to offend, we just haven't thought of a better name.  All we're saying is that if you want to make wiki pages about food recipes (for example), then they would be better placed on a <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a> dedicated to food and cooking.  We are just trying to be tidy.  We are the sort of people who put our books on book shelves, and when we see them in the cutlery drawer we feel compelled to tidy up!
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Another way of saying the same thing</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is one of many <a href="PublicWikiForums.html">PublicWikiForums</a>, which in turn is a type of <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a> (the opposite of course being <a href="NonPublicWikiForums.html">NonPublicWikiForums</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a>s are served up by <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a>, which are in turn "hosted" on a Web server somewhere.  Another name for a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> is <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> - many different types of <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> have been made, but they all copy the original idea of this particular <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>.  <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>s enjoy <a href="ReinventingTheWheel.html">ReinventingTheWheel</a>, even though they complain that it is wasteful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course this is all very confusing, because now we have several different things all named "wiki": pieces of software, Web sites, this part of a Web site (there are other things on <a href="http://www.c2.com">http://www.c2.com</a> you know), even the abstract concept of wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why I say that <a href="WikiIsNotWiki.html">WikiIsNotWiki</a>.  The word has so many meanings, all closely linked, that you will have to look at the context to decide what is being said - and this can be tricky if you're new to wiki (in any of its meanings). We will have to be more careful what we say, I think.

        <em>Now I think I've got this straight, but since I'm trying to be pedantic in order to reduce </em><a href="WikiNewbie.html">WikiNewbie</a>s' confusion I'll stand corrected if someone corrects me! -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a><em></em>

        Is this page here just because someone is jealous of Ward dreaming it up before they did?
