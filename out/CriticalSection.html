        Critical Section
      </h1>
      <p>
        Whenever two processes/threads are reading and writing the same variables in a language with <a href="SharedStateConcurrency.html">SharedStateConcurrency</a>, it is possible that one process will interfere with the other -- a <a href="RaceCondition.html">RaceCondition</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose that both processes are trying to increment the same variable. They both have the line
      </p>
      <code>
        x := x + 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        in them. One way for each process to execute this statement is for it to read the variable, then add one to the value, then write it back. Suppose the value of x was 3. If both processes read x at the same time, they would get the same value 3. If they then both added 1 to it, they would both have the value 4. They would then both write 4 back to x. The result is that both processes incremented x, but its value is only 4, instead of 5.
      </p>
      <p>
        For these processes to execute properly, they must ensure that only one of them is executing the statement at a time. A set of statements that can have only one process executing it at a time is a <em>critical section</em>. Another way of saying this is that processes need mutually exclusive access to the critical section.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several ways to implement a critical section. If you have a single processor running all the processes that might enter the critical section, you can DisableInterrupts while a process is in the critical section. If you have multiple processors and the critical section doesn't take long to execute, you should use <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>. If the critical section is long or if you might have interrupts during the critical section then you should use <a href="SemaphoresForMutualExclusion.html">SemaphoresForMutualExclusion</a>. If you are very clever then you might be able to think up an AlternativeToCriticalSection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Critical sections are very easy to spot in many <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s, because these tend to tag explicitly non-pure state changes which are almost always critical sections.
