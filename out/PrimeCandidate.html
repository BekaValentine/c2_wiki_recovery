        Prime Candidate

        <a href="PrimeCandidate.html">PrimeCandidate</a> is what you would call the most likely choice to fit within an existing idea. Realizing that something is a <a href="PrimeCandidate.html">PrimeCandidate</a> is usually an <a href="AhHa.html">AhHa</a> moment for most of us.

        For instance, 211 is a <a href="PrimeCandidate.html">PrimeCandidate</a> by inspection (obviously, since 211=2*3*5*7 + 1). It turns out that it <strong>is</strong> actually prime, but it might not have been.

        <em>It's a tough choice for what to have my computers do in their spare time: SETI@home, to search for aliens; or GIMPS, to search for </em><a href="PrimeNumber.html">PrimeNumber</a>s (since they don't wiki by themselves).<em></em>
