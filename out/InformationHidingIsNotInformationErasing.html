        Information Hiding Is Not Information Erasing
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hide the fact that you using a SuperHashedArrayList by exposing the only the List interface.  Don't sweat the fact the somebody could find out it's a SuperHashedArrayList and use it as such.  If you didn't expose it, your freed from your obligation to support it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, if you absolutely 'know' the List that object returns is really a SuperHashedArrayList, be careful in how you use that information; the day may come when it becomes a QuantomTunneledHyperArrayList.  If they didn't expose it, you've just taken on the responsibility of supporting it.
