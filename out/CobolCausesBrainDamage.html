        Cobol Causes Brain Damage
      </h1>
      <p>
        Back in the summer of '58, the US government, emboldened by its continuing success on the world stage, decided to define a computer language. It gathered all the luminaries that Captain <a href="GraceHopper.html">GraceHopper</a> could locate and invited all the computer companies to a massive confab in Washington DC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their plan was straightforward: the computer industry would standardize on one language. All the greatest language theorists were gathered into one group that would produce a spec for this ultimate language within 3 years. All the application experts and what passed for software engineers in those days were gathered into a second group that would concentrate on a universal data model or "data-base". 
      </p>
      <p>
        As an afterthought, a bunch of file clerks and administrative assistants were tasked to survey then-current languages in order to produce a bureaucratic structure for managing the language long term.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a good plan, a far-sighted initiative. It might even have worked. But three months later the Honeywell company, experimenting with a marketing strategy perfected by <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> three decades later, tossed a grenade into the process. It championed a new language of its own: <a href="ComTran.html">ComTran</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ComTran.html">ComTran</a> was a nice little language. By today's standards it may not hold up very well, but the US government was worried. <a href="ComTran.html">ComTran</a> seemed likely to gain broad acceptance, and then there would be no single standard language. Confusion would reign as vendors and researchers fought political wars over dialect and idiom in a <a href="PatternOfBabel.html">PatternOfBabel</a> that would seriously hinder national productivity. This is just what <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a> was intended to prevent.
      </p>
      <p>
        A decision had to be made, and it had to be made fast. The language definition group were a bunch of long-hairs who would never be able to move quickly enough. The "data-base" guys, CODASYL, were so deeply entrenched in inscrutable but obviously important definition work - later released in the form of enough woodpulp to denude Nebraska - they could never switch gears in time. So it was the short-term committee, that noble band of file clerks and administrative assistants, to whom befell the task of saving the free world from chaos.
      </p>
      <p>
        These guys might not have understood languages, but they knew paperwork, deadlines, and politics. They were given six months. They took just four. And so COBOL-59 was born. The government immediately announced it would accept no other language in its contracts. The industry rallied around. The long-hairs, now tasked with producing a language backward-compatible with drivel, presented a tombstone to their leader and disbanded. <a href="ComTran.html">ComTran</a> was last seen slumped over a shotglass in a bar in Jersey. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So you see, not only does COBOL cause brain damage; brain damage causes COBOL.

        I heard the "clerks" largely borrowed from Grace's earlier compilers/assemblers such that COBOL generally resembled those earlier works. They copied what was proven to at least work.

        I'm not entirely convinced by this...makes for a good story but <a href="ComTran.html">ComTran</a> was invented by Bob Bemer while he worked for IBM and was a straight-assembly precursor to COBOL at best.  Also, reportedly, the long-range committee for COBOL was never even formed and the "data-base" guys were never given a go-ahead.  There doesn't seem to be much record of any "scandalous coup" by Honeywell or even evidence of the possibility.
