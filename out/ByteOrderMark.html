        Byte Order Mark
      </h1>
      <p>
        A way of distinguishing between different <a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a> encodings, and determining endianality for those encodings (UTF-16 and UTF-32) for which it matters.
      </p>
      <p>
        The world has been slowly migrating to <a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a>; but one issue is how to store Unicode text files.  Several different representations have been chosen; the two most common are UTF-8 (<a href="UtfEight.html">UtfEight</a>) and UTF-16 (<a href="UtfSixteen.html">UtfSixteen</a>).  The Unix world has selected UTF-8, the Windows world seems to prefer UTF-16.
      </p>
      <p>
        UTF-8 is arguably more backwards-compatible (all <a href="AsciiCode.html">AsciiCode</a> files are valid UTF-8 files without modification), and it doesn't suffer from the same nasty endian problems as UTF-16.  (
        In UTF-16, on the other hand, endianness is a big problem; do you transmit the LSB or MSB of each 16-bit word first?  One solution to this problem, found widely in the Windows universe, is the "FFFE cookie".  
      </p>
      <p>
        Each file encoded in UTF16 begins with the "Zero width, non-breaking space", which is at code point uFEFF.  The endian reversial of this code is uFFFE, which is an invalid <a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a> character.  Thus, if one opens a file and sees "FF FE" as the first two bytes, it is a <a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> file; if one sees FE FF it is a <a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        UTF-32 is seldom used; however its <a href="ByteOrderMark.html">ByteOrderMark</a> is either 00 00 FE FF (<a href="BigEndian.html">BigEndian</a>), or FF FE 00 00 (<a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a>).  
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="ByteOrderMark.html">ByteOrderMark</a> exists for UTF-8 (EF BB BF), however it isn't really needed to distinguish byte order.
