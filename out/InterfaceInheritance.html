        Interface Inheritance
      </h1>
      <p>
        The class inherits an interface - a set of member function prototypes defining its externally visible usage. It does not inherit any data members or code for those member functions. It also doesn't inherit any construction or destruction code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The class is required to implement all the member functions defined in order to become concrete.

      <p>
        No; it is common for a class to inherit an interface and provide only a partial implementation. Such a class is abstract (as opposed to concrete), but certainly will compile. (In <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and its kin, trying to instantiate such a class won't compile, however...) -- <a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>
