        Wiki As Software Support Tool
      </h1>
      <p>
        Wikis seems well-suited to replacing certain newsgroups that primarily enable inexperienced software users or developers to find answers to their questions.  I see the following benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You can edit out wrong answers
        </li>
        <li>
           Connecting related threads will be a little more seamless
        </li>
        <li>
           The ability to look up a topic or phrase and getting a page list with matches
        </li>
        <li>
           The advantage being in the "Wiki Now" with hyperlinked external related material available with a click  
        </li>
        <li>
           You can adapt the script (or scripts, depending on what clone you start with) to do all manner of neat things. <a href="AutoTracker.html">AutoTracker</a> is one example.
        </li>
        <li>
           There is no obstacle to contributing (like logins, etc.), so everyone is both a reader and a potential contributor, and are likely to do so
        </li>
      </ul>

        I'm finding it difficult to get people to use wiki. It's just different enough to put them off :-(
      </p>

        <em>I've found it hard to get people to start using a sparsely populated wiki. Unless some people get immediate value, they won't come back. If you can start with a small number of people who "get it," work with them to populate the wiki, and then bring others in. If people see immediate value, getting them to the next step--where they see the value of actively participating--is a lot easier. --  </em><a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a><em></em>

        <em>Also see </em><a href="CoreContributorFoundation.html">CoreContributorFoundation</a><em>.  After the initial work has been put in, then it becomes self-sustaining, especially if you allow </em><a href="WikiHomePage.html">WikiHomePage</a>s.  People will identify more with Wiki because a small part of it is "theirs".  My $0.02.  I fully agree with the above-mentioned advantages of Wiki.<em> -- </em><a href="CarlosNsRodrigues.html">CarlosNsRodrigues</a>
