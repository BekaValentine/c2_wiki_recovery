        The Stream Module System
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> library I'm working on that takes a certain approach to handling asynchronous behavior.  Mainly, don't try to make it synchronous in any meaningful way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic concept the library is built on is a StreamModule which represents a processing element in a stream.  A StreamModule has 'sides' (each of which fill a protocol role in what that StreamModule does) and plugs which can plug into other StreamModules.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, this risks becoming a page to document my work, so I'll stop now.  I would greatly appreciate any comments or observations.
