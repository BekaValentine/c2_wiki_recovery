        <a href="PalmSource.html">PalmSource</a> has acquired much of the <a href="BeOs.html">BeOs</a> company and talked about providing an application layer for <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a> PDAs.

        PalmSolutions bought out HandSpring, the maker of <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> Phones and PDA in summer 2003. In Dec 2004, PalmSolutions acquired the former HandSpring for its Treo line of <a href="SmartPhone.html">SmartPhone</a>s and changed its name to <a href="PalmOne.html">PalmOne</a>.
