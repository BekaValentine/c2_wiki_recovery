        I just read JackHarich's response to the <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a> article 
        (<a href="http://smile.jcon.org/soft/info/process/xp/BowlingGame.html).">http://smile.jcon.org/soft/info/process/xp/BowlingGame.html).</a>
        He made two assertions that I take issue with.  First, he says that with his approach, the original design didn't change like it did for <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a>.  Thus his design was better.  Second, he says that his code is higher quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first issue is a <a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>: the <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a> came up with a design and then coded it test-first, with lots of discussion and refactoring.  JackHarich just coded his design, filling in gaps as he encountered them.  It doesn't look like he tried to change his design during the coding process... so of course, it didn't change!
      </p>
      <p>
        The quality issue is more interesting.  Jack says that the <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a> code "produced no artifacts and was uncommented."  Later, he says, "Note the high quality of this code compared to [<a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a>'s]."
      </p>
      <p>
        Well... let's look at that, shall we?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a> code:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Statements: 40
        </li>
        <li>
           Methods: 13
        </li>
        <li>
           Conditionals: 7
        </li>
        <li>
           Loops: 1
        </li>
        <li>
           Tests: 10
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>JackHarich code:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Statements: 72
        </li>
        <li>
           Methods: 18
        </li>
        <li>
           Conditionals: 24
        </li>
        <li>
           Loops: 3
        </li>
        <li>
           Tests: 1
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Jack's code is larger, employs <em>much</em> more branching, and has fewer tests.  By my standards, the <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a> code is higher quality.  Also, Jack's non-code artifact, his class diagram, is out of date.  It displayed many more classes than are actually coded, and doesn't include all of the methods that were coded.
      </p>
      <p>
        This experiment matches my experiences: up-front design will produce working code, but it's code that's more complex than it needs to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        A quick note about the metrics: I counted statements by hand.  Only <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> statements were counted.  Class, method, and variable declarations were not counted.  The keyword 'else' was not counted.  The 'if' and 'for' statements were counted separately from their body.  (Thus, single-line 'if' statements counted as two statements.)
      </p>
      <p>
        JackHarich's code includes a number of GuardConditions that throw <a href="RuntimeException.html">RuntimeException</a>s, as well as a boilerplate print() method.  Since the <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a> code didn't include these, I left them out of the Jack's final count.

        This was my attempt at the bowling game in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>.  I had read the whole Java dialog, so I had some idea on the algorithm that would work.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I tried a little experiment.  Basically, I wanted to put myself in a bit of a hole when you make the complexity jump from spares to strikes.  When you just have spares in your tests, then you can have an algorithm where you basically score as you go, and when you see that you've completed a frame with a spare, you just make a little note to go back and update last frame's score on the next ball.  Unfortunately, the code is not shown here, but it was pretty simple and all the "spare" tests passed.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew, though, that the strikes would make this approach really cumbersome, so I basically had to bail out on the approach, and load up all the rolls into an array beforehand, so that I could just do a double lookahead on the strikes.  It turned out to be not so bad. I basically was able to take my add() method and rename it to revisit(), then I added the array of rolls, which hadn't been there before, then I refactored the spares to use the lookahead (while on the greenbar), then I proceeded with the strikes tests. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is the final code:
      </p>
      <code>
        require 'test/unit'<br/>

      <code>

        Here's a <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> solution that uses recursion in what I find to be a straightforward way. It wasn't the first way I thought of solving it, but I prefer it to some of the other solutions on this page because I find the logic to be easy to understand. It fits a standard pattern for recursive functions, and is fairly close to the informal way that you might explain scoring to a person. It could probably do with some more polishing, and testing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I must admit part of what made this difficult for me is that it's not easy to find out the exact rules for scoring bowling, and I had to infer them from examples and test cases I found elsewhere on the web. Plus, being Canadian, I've mainly done 5-pin bowling, which has 3 balls per frame, and I don't even remember how to keep score for that!

        <em>Very nice. Yes, I think that there is a case to be made for rewriting the methods for calculating score in a functional style, given that they are pure, stateless</em> calculation <em>which FP is naturally good at. Hmm...I think I'll just leave a little [untested, might be totally wrong] Haskell implementation here...</em>
