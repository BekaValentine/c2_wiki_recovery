        My research interest is investigating the value of <a href="FormalSystem.html">FormalSystem</a>s to describe ChaoticSystems like the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>, especially to address <a href="TheTroubleWithConsensus.html">TheTroubleWithConsensus</a>.

        I have been working on <a href="WebArchitecture.html">WebArchitecture</a> since 1991; I edited the <a href="HyperTextMarkupLanguage.html">HyperTextMarkupLanguage</a> 2.0 spec and helped start <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a>.

        In Feb 2001, as we start the <a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a> activity (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/),">http://www.w3.org/2001/sw/),</a> I'm <a href="ChoosingaWiki.html">ChoosingaWiki</a> for use at W3C.

        My Feb 2002 experiment (<a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/pywiki?WebArchitecture)">http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/pywiki?WebArchitecture)</a> didn't fly.

        This March 2003 experiment (<a href="http://esw.w3.org/topic/DanConnolly)">http://esw.w3.org/topic/DanConnolly)</a> seems to have critical mass.

        Affectionately, the CoCo. My first <a href="FormalSystem.html">FormalSystem</a> was <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a>'s Basic; then 6809 assembly. I discovered recursion without being told about it; I was writing a program to visualize molecules and I implemented it with GOSUB and stacks in arrays.
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned 6809E assembly by disassembling the interpreter. I remember asking "Where are the variables?"

        I met <a href="TimBernersLee.html">TimBernersLee</a> and <a href="DougEngelbart.html">DougEngelbart</a> at the 1991 HypertextConference in AustinTexas. I was living in DallasTexas, working for ConvexComputers, at the time, but I met the gal who's now my wife that weekend, so I moved to AustinTexas to be with her in 1992. That was my first exposure to a LifeInStartupCompanies. It was great, in a way: I wrote 30,000 lines of code in one year and worked with some great engineers who taught me about <a href="ModulaThree.html">ModulaThree</a>.
