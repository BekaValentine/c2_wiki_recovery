        Best Things First
      </h1>
      <p>
        A practice found in <a href="WorryDrivenDevelopment.html">WorryDrivenDevelopment</a>. If you do the riskiest, hardest things first, you'll miss early commitments, and people will think your development schedule is out of control. Therefore, do the things that are slam-dunks, that you can deliver on-time or early, putting off the more difficult, risky features until later.
