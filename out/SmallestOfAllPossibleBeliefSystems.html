        Smallest Of All Possible Belief Systems
      </h1>
      <p>
        The talk about using a tautology as a "belief system" below demonstrates that this page needs a definition.

        <em>Should it in fact be moved to </em><a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a> when we move ReligiousWar, as we've been threatening in a peaceful kind of way to do since the original move of pages? (I originally created this page in 2000 as a result of a comment in ReligiousWar, as explained below.) -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>
      </p>

        Richard: I this page is general, not religious - but inquisitive, including not only theological but also scientific and philosophical. It could also be extended to include programming philosophy, extreme programming, and patterns.

        Depends on your beliefs :)

      <code>
        I am god - move it at your whim.<br/>
        Nihilism - delete it.<br/>
        Science - experiement with it.<br/>
        Abelief - do nothing.<br/>
        Do what works - do what you normally do.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        "Science" and "Do what works" seem to be general principles, that need more concrete sub-principles and patterns to be useful.  Candidate sub-principles are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            On wiki, the further the topic of a page is away from software and patterns, the more authoratative (quoting published sources), summarized, unemotional, and reference-y the page should be.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Using this principle, summarize this page in about five lines, and point to a rambling discussion on Why.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, if we are industrious, we can do some research to find the original/top level belief systems "behind" verious software languages, software methodologies, and the pattern movement.

        <em>This text is built around the observation that programming languages are based on three fundamental concepts: </em>

      <code>
        Abstraction and generalization <br/>
        Data and data structuring <br/>
        Computational models <br/>

        <em>Theory is approached intuitively and motivated with prototypical examples. Three approaches </em>

        Scientific: collect data, construct theories <br/>
        Popular culture: survey <br/>

        Describe <a href="SmallestOfAllPossibleBeliefSystems.html">SmallestOfAllPossibleBeliefSystems</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, please do.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="SmallestOfAllPossibleBeliefSystems.html">SmallestOfAllPossibleBeliefSystems</a> is Solipsism: "I am God".
        Those three words pretty sum up all there is to say to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Very fair. But I was hoping for light to be shed on the claim that science is the smallest of all possible belief systems, made in </em>ReligiousWar.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nihilism is very small too.  I see no point in saying anything about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder whether the <a href="SmallestOfAllPossibleBeliefSystems.html">SmallestOfAllPossibleBeliefSystems</a> is the most objective of belief systems, or the most subjective of belief systems?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What do you mean with "objective"? If you mean "its truth can be objectively verified", then it is not a belief system, but a scientific theory.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        A scientific theory <em>is</em> a BeliefSystem; just one with particular
        properties like verifiability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I nominate a tautology, e.g.: "If A, then A", or "A or not A",
        to be the most objective belief system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presumably, implicit in the title is something like "covering everything
        we care about". So a particular scientific theory would be a "partial
        belief system" or something; I suppose the claim this page was originally
        discussing could be tightened up to yield something like "The minimal
        belief system covering everything we care about is scientific in the
        sense that it apportions no more belief to anything than is warranted
        by the empirical evidence". Of course, this is still hopelessly sloppy
        because "everything we care about" isn't defined. I suspect that
        saying "science is the smallest of all possible belief systems"
        amounts (at least partly) to declaring a lack of interest in a
        whole bunch of common human concerns. :-)
