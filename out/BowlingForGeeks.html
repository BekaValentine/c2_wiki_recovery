        Bowling For Geeks
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bowling has the potential to do for geeks what golf does for management types. It's an opportunity to talk shop in a relaxed setting. For geeks, bowling presents these advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Not physically demanding, so the fact that you sit at a desk staring at a computer screen all day is not a serious handicap, as in basketball or tennis.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em> Actually, if you become a real addict - it is demanding. I started out bowling 2 to 3 games during my lunch hour. There was something about bowling that served as an antidote to the whole </em><a href="MonitorZombie.html">MonitorZombie</a> thing. However, now that I'm out of work, I'll bowl 6 to 12 games at a time. It's great therapy and definitely works up a sweat!<em> -- </em><a href="RachelStruthers.html">RachelStruthers</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Played indoors, curtailing pesky sunburns and squinting. In fact, the lighting at bowling alleys tends to be the same flickery fluorescent light that we have in our cubes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Scored by computers, facilitating discussions of various possible approaches to implementing bowling scoring software, like <a href="ObjectMentorBowlingGame.html">ObjectMentorBowlingGame</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Then do you end up with a StrikeSolution?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Goes great with beer!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Leaves plenty of time for people to sit around and talk geek stuff.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Good exercise for wrists. Strong wrists prevent <a href="CarpalTunnelSyndrome.html">CarpalTunnelSyndrome</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Much like software development, bowling is team oriented. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Bowling shirts are very retro. Just the thing for the fashionable geek (oxymoron?!?)
        </li>
      </ul>

        Several of the items on this list suggest that the bowling environment is a lot like the work environment. I think this makes it <em>unsuitable</em> as a fun, relaxed, social activity. The major attraction of golf for suits is that it gets people out of the office (see <a href="GettingOut.html">GettingOut</a>). But maybe I'm just not enough of a geek anymore to appreciate the joys of sitting under fluorescent lights. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        <em>It is very suitable. I bowl with a group of people who aren't geeks which is a nice change of pace. I also </em>BowlAlone. The advantage of the BowlAlone thing is that you get into the <a href="ZenOfBowling.html">ZenOfBowling</a>. All that matters is throwing the ball. You forget about things like <a href="PointyHairedBosses.html">PointyHairedBosses</a> and <a href="MicromanagingSadist.html">MicromanagingSadist</a>s. -- <a href="RachelStruthers.html">RachelStruthers</a><em></em>

        How ever, unlike Golf (<a href="GolfForGeeks.html">GolfForGeeks</a>?) or Geelf(<a href="RulesOfGeelf.html">RulesOfGeelf</a>), Bowling still makes us geeks look like vampires. Until we have more outdoor bowling lanes, I think I'll try and find other forms of geeky fun.
