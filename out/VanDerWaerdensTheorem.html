        Van Der Waerdens Theorem
      </h1>
      <p>
        Named for Dutch mathematician B. L. van der Waerden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let numbers <em>C</em> and <em>N</em> be given.  There is some number  <em>V</em>(<em>C</em>, <em>N</em>) such that if you take <em>V</em>(<em>C</em>, <em>N</em>) evenly-spaced
        fence posts, and paint each post in one of <em>C</em> different colors, then
        there are at least <em>N</em> evenly-spaced posts of the same color. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, when <em>C</em>=2, you have two colors of paint.  <em>V</em>(2, 3) is bigger than 8, because you can color 8 posts like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        B R R B B R R B <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and no three posts of the same color are evenly spaced.  But you can't add a ninth post to the end without having three evenly-spaced posts of the same color.  If you add a red post, you get
      </p>
      <code>
        B R <strong>R</strong> B B <strong>R</strong> R B <strong>R</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and if you add a blue post you get
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>B</strong> R R B <strong>B</strong> R R B <strong>B</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There might, of course, be some way of painting the 9 posts so that there <em>aren't</em> three evenly-spaced posts of the same color.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, you might wonder what the values of <em>V</em>(<em>C</em>, <em>N</em>) are for various
        <em>C</em> and <em>N</em>.  And in fact the proof of the theorem provides
        an upper bound.  For the case of <em>C</em>=2 and <em>N</em>=3, for example, the theorem
        says that if you paint 325 fence posts red and blue, there will be
        three evenly-spaced red posts or three evenly-spaced blue posts.  But actually,
        you don't need 325 posts; you only need 9.  Any coloring of the 9 posts will have three evenly spaced posts of one color.
      </p>
      <p>
        For <em>C</em>=3 and <em>N</em>=3, the theorem says that if you paint 7*(2*3^7+1)*(2*3^(2*3^7+1)+1) posts red, green, or blue, there must be three evenly-spaced posts of the same color. But actually, you don't need 1.56e1012 posts; you only need 27. (It is possible to paint 26 posts so that no three evenly-spaced posts are the same color.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who can reduce the general lower bound to <em>any</em> 'reasonable' function can win a large cash prize.
