        Started out as a director of music promo videos.  He did this:

        for Bjork and directed some videos for <a href="AphexTwin.html">AphexTwin</a>, including his amazing debut, <em>Come to Daddy</em> and the bizarre <em>Windowlicker</em>.

        Brilliant. I wish I had that kind of vision. Then again, maybe I don't. The nightmares alone would be worse than an Ed Grimly childhood. I recommend watching <em>Come to Daddy</em>, his debut music video, done for <a href="AphexTwin.html">AphexTwin</a>. Disturbing. Or <em>Afrika Shox</em> done for Leftfield. I don't recommend <em>Frozen</em> done for Madonna, or <em>Windowlicker</em> for <a href="AphexTwin.html">AphexTwin</a> again, which was just bizarre. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        <em>Why not? I thought that Frozen was very visually appealing. the sparse black-and-white look was perfect for the stark electronic sounds of the song.</em>
