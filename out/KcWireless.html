        A community dedicated to bringing free wireless internet access to the Kansas City region. If you're interested in accessing a node, setting one up, or just curious about what's going on, we're here to help any way we can.

        We're using 802.11b "<a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a>?" network hardware, which operates in the 2.4GHz range. Most nodes have antennas offering coverage for a few blocks around a home or business, but with directional antennas and good line-of-sight, 802.11b can transmit many miles. 
      </p>
      <p>
        None of our nodes are directly connected to one another now, but that's likely as the network grows.
