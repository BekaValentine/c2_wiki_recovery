        Perforce Jam
      </h1>
      <p>
        Perforce provides a freely available build
        tool alternative to 'make' called Jam.  It features a raw C
        implementation, conditional compilation to cover a range of file
        systems, and a funky declarative syntax that smooches all the
        write-only shell hacks 'make' leans on bye-bye.  Definitely worth a
        look if you are starting a project and need something smarter than
        'make' backing up your <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>.

        I have looked at Jam in past and had difficulties to get it to work in
        directory hierarchies with languages different than C.  The problem
        was that all targets share a flat name space.  This means, that the
        same name used in different directories could cause troubles.  <em>Jam</em>
        attaches  tokens to targets to make them unique but this mechanism
        is not part of the base calculus but added later. Otherwise I was
        pretty impressed by Jam because it allows a much better re-use of
        rules than <em>Make</em>.

        You need to look into using Jam's explicit grist. This solves the problem of same named file.
