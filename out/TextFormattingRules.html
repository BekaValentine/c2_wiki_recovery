        Text Formatting Rules
      </h1>
      <p>
        For some examples of how these rules are used, see <a href="TextFormattingExamples.html">TextFormattingExamples</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To experiment with these rules, please try editing the <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a>. Please, do not experiment with this page because that is extraordinarily bad form.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Paragraphs</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do not indent paragraphs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Words wrap to window width and fill as needed. (Emphasis fails to work if you insert end of line by hand!)
        </li>
        <li>
           Use blank lines as separators.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Horizontal Lines</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Four or more hyphens (----) at the beginning of a line make a horizontal rule.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Lists</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           asterisk in column one for bullet item
          <ul>
            <li>
               use more asterisks for deeper indenting
              <ul>
                <li>
                   old format using tabs and numbered lists (lines starting with <tab(s)>number) is discouraged because of on-going problems some people have with tabs in browsers in general.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Fonts</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Indent with one or more spaces to use a monospace font:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        This is text in a monospaced font indented with a space.<br/>
        This is indented with a tab stop.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is not.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        You can generate vertical whitespace by using multiple newlines after a monospaced line, but doing so to create more than one blank line is discouraged.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Indented Paragraphs</strong>
        <em>(Quotes)</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           tab space colon tab -- often used (with emphasis) for quotations. (See <a href="SimulatingQuoteBlocks.html">SimulatingQuoteBlocks</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sample:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>This is quoted. (When a quoted line wraps, it too is indented maintaining an indented block.) If the text continues for a bit then the feature will be demonstrated nicely. You will see that each successive line is indented.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        This isn't.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you are going to <a href="ConvertSpacesToTabs.html">ConvertSpacesToTabs</a>, you need to type nine spaces, a colon, and then three spaces before the text. (See <a href="SimulatingQuoteBlocks.html">SimulatingQuoteBlocks</a>.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Definitions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Indented paragraphs are actually a special case of definitions. For example, to define a gnu, we would use
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           tab Gnu colon tab -- and then the definition. This looks like this:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt>Gnu</dt>
        <dd> A furry animal.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        You may use bold (see next paragraph), then it looks like this:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Gnu</strong></dt>
        <dd> A furry animal.</dd>
      </dl>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Emphasis</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use doubled single-quotes for emphasis (usually <em>italics</em>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Use tripled single-quotes for strong emphasis (usually <strong>bold</strong>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Use five single-quotes, or triples within doubles, for some other kind of emphasis (<strong><em>Bold Italic</em></strong>), but be careful about the bugs in the Wiki emphasis logic... (for example, text within doubled single-quotes followed immediately by text within tripled single-quotes is processed incorrectly)<em>double</em><strong>triple</strong>  Q:<em>has this bug been fixed?</em> No, but the overlapped tags produced are accepted by some browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
           Emphasis can be used multiple times within a line, but cannot span across line boundaries.
        </li>
        <li>
           Is there a simple way to do strike-throughs? perhaps ---three hyphens before and after--- ala ' ' ' for bold? [<a href="MichaelMuller.html">MichaelMuller</a> 9/22/2004]  <em></em><a href="NotOnThisWiki.html">NotOnThisWiki</a><em></em>

        <strong>Links</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="JoinCapitalizedWords.html">JoinCapitalizedWords</a> to make links to Wiki pages.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use <a href="SixSingleQuotes.html">SixSingleQuotes</a> to separate capitalized prefixes (like 'Prefixed') from Prefixed<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, or to AvoidMakingLinksToWikiName, or to separate suffixes (like 's') from <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s. Put the six quotes after the prefix and before the first capitalized letter of the Prefixed<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> (for example Non<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> equals Non ' ' ' ' ' ' <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>), or before a lowercase letter to avoid links in the entire word (for example AvoidMakingLinksToWikiName equals A ' ' ' ' ' ' voidMakingLinksToWikiName), or after the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> and before the suffix (for example <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s equals <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> ' ' ' ' ' ' s).
        </li>
        <li>
           Precede URLs with "http:", "ftp:", "gopher:", "mailto:", or "news:" to create links automatically as in: <a href="http://www.c2.com/.">http://www.c2.com/.</a> For a url containing an apostrophe, use %27 instead of the apostrophe.
        </li>
        <li>
           URLs ending with .gif, .jpg, .jpeg or .png are inlined. (URLs ending with .jpe should be handled the same way, but aren't.) <em> </em>'Note<em>' This approach means that image URLs with query parameters will not render as an image unless you add an extra "dummy" parameter ending with .gif, .jpg, .jpeg or .png at the end. Thankfully the need for such tricks is rare.</em> (Bug: those image extensions must be <em>lower-case</em>).
        </li>
        <li>
           Links to books specified by ISBN are treated specially. E.g., ISBN: 0-13-748310-4 links to a bookseller. (The pattern is: "ISBN", optional colon, space, ten digits with optional hyphens, the whole thing optionally in square brackets. The last digit can be an "X".)

      <ul>
        <li>
           When a rule says "tab," it wants a tab character without extra spaces around it. See <a href="TipForTypingTab.html">TipForTypingTab</a> if you have trouble entering tabs.
        </li>
        <li>
           The actual <a href="TextFormattingRegularExpressions.html">TextFormattingRegularExpressions</a> that implement these rules are available for those who can read them.

        <li>
           I've been able to see what's going on by opening the edit window as a new window in the browser. That way, I can link (in my mind) the text formatting rules with what finally gets displayed. Not that the rules are difficult!

           Inserting lines with the <a href="LynxBrowser.html">LynxBrowser</a> presents a special challenge. For help with that, see <a href="UsingWikiWithLynx.html">UsingWikiWithLynx</a>.
        </li>

        <em>Q: Why not include into Wiki abilities to make tables? I think, it's one of the most important thing when discussing mathematics, for example.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Serviceable tables can be done with preformatted text, e.g. the table at the bottom of <a href="TextFormattingExamples.html">TextFormattingExamples</a>. Many other <a href="WikiImplementations.html">WikiImplementations</a> do implement <a href="WikiTables.html">WikiTables</a>, including Ward's own <a href="QuickiWiki.html">QuickiWiki</a>.

        <em>I find myself wanting to add a link from a page here on </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> to a page on a <a href="SisterSite.html">SisterSite</a>. What's the best way to do that? (a) Directly include the full URI; (b) use the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> to a stub page here, then put the full URI on that stub page; or (c) some other method? -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no established convention. One method would be Meatball:<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, which links to a page from which you can click on the meatball logo to get to the proper page. There's no need to create the page on this wiki if it doesn't already exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at the bottom of this page (<a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>). You see those convenient little pictures that link to <a href="SisterSite.html">SisterSite</a>s? Do those automatically show up when sister sites have pages with the same name? Does Ward manually stick those in somehow? Or is there something I/you can do to make those show up? (I mean, they *already* show up on this page; how do I make them show up on *other* pages?)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They will be shown in due course - the process is automatic, but not necessarily immediate.</em>

        So how, without using HTML character entities, do I type a character which is not on my keyboard? -- DamianYerrick
      </p>
      <p>
        Copy and paste from somewhere else (such as <a href="UtfEightValuesForUmlauts.html">UtfEightValuesForUmlauts</a>), or, in <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>, hold down the Alt key, then, using the numeric pad, type 0 followed by the character's 3-digit ANSI (decimal) code (up to 255). (The second method doesn't work for the tab character in some browsers.) -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Inserting raw character codes (which is what ALT+number does) is not portable. It is specific to that platform, and the character set you're using. I will see something different. On the other hand, HTML character entities are, per the standard, portable. So that isn't a good solution. -- <a href="BenScott.html">BenScott</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Use </em>'Unicode<strong> (And set your browser to UTF-8). You can enter Unicode characters on Windows/</strong>MacOSX/X11 using Ctrl+Shift+CODE (Hold down Ctrl, hold down Shift and type in the code in hexadecimal).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But there's still a portability issue for the <strong>readers</strong> of the text, who may not be viewing it as Unicode, eh? So at minimum you also need to tell everyone on every platform using every conceivable version of every conceivable browser how to make sure their tool displays Unicode (and how to get the font needed, if Unicode characters are used that are outside the font set provided by default on the platform/tool in question.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>However, as of May 2006, this wiki reports its encoding as </em><a href="UtfEight.html">UtfEight</a>, so that is the encoding to use.<em></em>

            <li>
               A: Nope.

        <li>

      <p>
        Q: Is there no way to do inline monospace text? It's useful to distinguish commands from surrounding text.

      <p>
        A: Inline, no.  Only in its own block, by indenting at least one space.
