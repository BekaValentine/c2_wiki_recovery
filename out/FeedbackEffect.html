        Feedback Effect
      </h1>
      <p>
        The situation in which outputs feed into the inputs, either directly (positive feedback), creating either too much output or a corrupted output, or in opposition (negative feedback), which can be used to regulate and stabilize a system.

        This is also observed in closed groups, where an idea is fed into the group and circulates to the point where alternate ideas are ignored. This is the cause of a lot of 'expert discussions' (screaming matches) on the internet, where individuals from self-supporting groups clash.

        Also a means of controlling output where measurements of changes in output are compared to changes in input to the controlling elements.
