        Non Intrusive Methods
      </h1>
      <p>
        See <a href="AgileMethods.html">AgileMethods</a>. The idea behind <a href="NonIntrusiveMethods.html">NonIntrusiveMethods</a> was methods that did not intrude on a programmers daily work. Instead it should support the programmer so that he/she would be able to deliver value to his/her customers. The idea came about because <a href="EirikMangseth.html">EirikMangseth</a> was growing tired of noting that to use a method/methodology you (often) had to accept a big overhead and a lot of bureaucracy just to get going. The alternative wasn't much better either. So there had to be a better way and that way was coined <a href="NonIntrusiveMethods.html">NonIntrusiveMethods</a>.

        <em>So should we just look at the pages </em><a href="AgileMethods.html">AgileMethods</a> and <a href="AgileProcesses.html">AgileProcesses</a>, or is there something further to say here that is different than over there?<em></em>

        Don't think there's more to say at the moment. Added this page as part of the Agile-lore.
