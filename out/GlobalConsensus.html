        Global Consensus
      </h1>
      <p>
        Global consensus is the need for all processes/nodes in a concurrent/distributed system to have agreement about some aspect of the state of the system.  For example, a distributed <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a> would need to know that all processes in a system contain no live references to an object before freeing that object--asking each process this question serially might fail (as a sole reference to such an object might be migrated from one process A to another B, after it is determined that B contains no such references and before A is queried).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also a tricky problem in real-life--where we live with the fact that global consensus is impossible in many situations.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a practical example, consider taking the (physical) inventory of a factory as part of a year-end closing of the books (this is standard accounting practice).  A physical inventory is necessary, using computer records won't suffice.  All the raw materials, work-in-progress, finished goods, and tools and equipment must be accounted for.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, consider that the factory is producing a very successful product and is running 24/7 in production--doing the inventory at night is not an answer.  You might be able to take parts of the factory offline to do a count; but you cannot take the whole factory off-line.  And material may flow between areas counted and areas not counted (and thus might get counted twice, or not at all).

        "One can solve obstruction-free consensus using only read/write registers" -- but we would prefer to gain consensus not merely <em>obstruction-free</em>, but at least <em>lock-free</em> (<a href="LockFreeSynchronization.html">LockFreeSynchronization</a>), and preferably <em>wait-free</em> (<a href="WaitFreeSynchronization.html">WaitFreeSynchronization</a>). See <a href="SynchronizationStrategies.html">SynchronizationStrategies</a>.

        "Wait Free Synchronization"
        Lecture 2
        CS380D Distributed Computing I
        <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/F03/notes/12-4.pdf">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/lorenzo/corsi/cs380d/F03/notes/12-4.pdf</a>
        is a good summary of
        "Wait-Free Synchronization"
        by Maurice Herlihy (1993)
        <a href="http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/herlihy93waitfree.html">http://citeseer.ist.psu.edu/herlihy93waitfree.html</a>

        Maurice Herlihy
        mathematically proves that that
        "It is impossible to construct
        a wait-free implementation
        of any object with a consensus number greater than 1
        using atomic read/write registers." (or point-to-point FIFO message channels).
      </p>
      <p>
        Maurice Herlihy also proves that
        <em>test&set</em> and <em>fetch&add</em> [and <em>unconditional swap between register and memory</em>],
        can synchronize 2 threads, but no more.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Nevertheless ...
        there do exist simple universal objects
        from which one can construct
        a wait-free implementation
        of any sequential object."
      </p>
      <p>
        Any one of these "universal objects" are sufficient to synchronize any number of processes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           an atomic <em>compare&swap</em> instruction.
        </li>
        <li>
           sticky byte
        </li>
        <li>
           The augmented queue: with "enqueue", "dequeue", and "peek at first item in queue" instructions.
        </li>
        <li>
           "fetch&cons": atomically thread an item onto the front of a linked list.
        </li>
        <li>
           memory-to-memory move
        </li>
        <li>
           memory-to-memory swap
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One universal object Herlihy implies but does not list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           augmented stack with "peek at bottom of stack"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any of these "universal objects" can be used to implement any other "universal object".
        None of these "universal objects" can be implemented by "weaker" synchronization primitives.
