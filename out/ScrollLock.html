      <p>
        Possibly the most useless key ever.  WaltMossberg is among those who want to get rid of it completely.  What is it used for?  Was it ever really used for anything?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are actually a few programs that make use of the Scroll Lock key:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           MESS (<a href="http://mess.emuverse.com/)">http://mess.emuverse.com/)</a> -- uses it to enable/disable keys that control the emulation, for computers that have their own uses for the F1 key.
        </li>
        <li>
           Microsoft Agent uses it as a push-to-talk button.
        </li>
        <li>
           Some UNIX systems use it to enable hardware scrollback on text consoles (temporarily suspending text output).
        </li>
        <li>
           Microsoft Excel uses it to, um, lock scrolling. Go figure, eh.
        </li>
        <li>
           A lot of UNIX users remapped the key to something more useful. Before keyboards with windows keys were wide spread, defining <a href="ScrollLock.html">ScrollLock</a> as the CompositeKey was quite usual.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Scroll Lock light could conceivably be used as some other kind of status indicator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not nearly as annoying as <a href="CapsLock.html">CapsLock</a>.
