                </li>
                <li>
                   I don't claim <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> is without purpose. I claimed it is imaginary. There's a difference.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>It runs on biological CPU's, just not artificial ones yet :-) Why does one make it "imaginary" but not the other?</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   An imaginary language is one without an implementation. It requires imagination to "run" the code because it won't run any other way.

                <li>
                   So? You appear to suggest <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> has validity as a language despite not existing. That is reasonable if <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> exists to illustrate significant concepts. <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, for example, pre-dated implementations in order to illustrate the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> and show what <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>'s abstract <strong>D</strong> specification could look like if implemented. What significant concept(s) does <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> illustrate?
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>See </em><a href="TqlDesignGoals.html">TqlDesignGoals</a>. I'm sure you will disagree with the priorities it optimizes for, but I expected that.<em></em>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       <em>Further, Tutorial D served as a </em>'training language<em>' for some time before it was implemented. Are you dismissing this period of time?</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Absolutely.  Similarly, I will dismiss <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> as mere fantasy until it's executable.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <em>Let me get this clear. You are saying it was a bad idea for C. J. Date to use Tutorial D as a training language or syntax until it was machine executable? If so, is algebra also useless until students can actually "execute" it on an artifical machine? -t</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Are you claiming <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> is a teaching language, despite putting it here on a page of comparisons to other usable, executable languages?  Are you claiming it represents a theoretical foundation so significant that it's on equal footing with algebra?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <em>Yes, in the sense it "illustrates concepts". Further, being a teaching tool does not preclude it from being a potential production notation either. It can be both. Pascal started out as a "teaching language", I would note.</em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       What concepts does it illustrate?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       See <a href="TqlDesignGoals.html">TqlDesignGoals</a>.
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                   Those are language design goals, the things that presumably make it of value once implemented; they are not a description of the concepts that an unimplemented <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> illustrates.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>I disagree: they illustrate at least one approach to achieving them.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   You mean <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> syntax illustrates at least one approach for achieving <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> syntax? That's hardly a conceptual illustration.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>No. You misread something.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   What I mean is that your goals are primarily syntactic. Essentially, they are tweaks to what SQL already does rather than being conceptually distinct. A language that is strictly adherent to the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> is conceptually distinct from SQL. A language that allows column selections to be specified via a table is not.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>My main goal is indeed to improve "expressiveness" and less about achieving "purity", which I see best treated as an option, not dictated, in order to better fit the messy real world and existing databases. We keep coming back to this same disagreement and are not likely to settle it. You seem to downplay the importance of expressiveness. Few would want to use a "pure" relational assembler language (at least outside of </em><a href="SystemProgramming.html">SystemProgramming</a>). - t<em></em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   If your goal is to improve "expressiveness", then I take back my point above that "I don't claim <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> is without purpose." I now claim it is <em>mainly</em> without purpose until it is implemented, because merely demonstrating improved expressiveness is meaningless without an implementation. This has nothing to do with "purity" or lack thereof, and everything to do with whether or not your imaginary language serves any purpose.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>Please elaborate on "demonstrating improved expressiveness is meaningless without an implementation". I'm sure most language designers drafted their language on paper and mentally executed examples and scenarios before hitting the keyboard. In fact, </em>'mathematical algorithms<em>' existed only on paper and were quite useful WITHOUT the computer being invented yet. Most creators and users of math notation didn't even conceive of the existence of computers yet. Sure, it's nice to have a computer implementation, but lack of does not make a notation "useless". You protest too much. - t</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   Mathematical algorithms and novel language designs are of value on paper because they illustrate something new. What is new in <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a>?
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>Hogwash. 100% novelty is not necessary to study a notation for usability/grokkability. In fact, it was foolish to start to implement Rel and related languages without first bouncing around the paper notation to wider parties. I've gotten very useful comments from others looking at the draft of </em><a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a>.<em></em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   Of course, 100% novelty is not necessary. What I'm asking about is <em>any</em> novelty. As for <em>Rel</em> and related languages, these have been bounced around to various parties in three editions of <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>, an article also entitled <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> dating back to 1995, Date's <em>An Introduction to Database Systems</em> text, and Date, Darwen, and Lorentzos's <em>Temporal Data and the Relational Model</em> book. At least. There are also various articles, dissertations, etc., based on this work. I'm sure you have received useful comments -- on <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> syntax itself. <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a>, however, does not illustrate any new concepts or approaches. It merely demonstrates the concepts of SQL in a slightly different syntax from SQL. In terms of conceptual illustration, SQL will do.
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>Sorry, I disagree. It appears you are more interested in purity than expressiveness and thus weigh such issues much heavier than expressiveness. That's fine, but your priorities are not the center of the universe. You've yet to prove that purity will save the world from asteroids, cure cancer, and rescue kittens from trees without any downsides. I haven't either, but at least I don't claim my personal priorities magically trump yours.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>And I disagree with "slightly different". It has standard and re-compos-able atoms where SQL doesn't (other than a mishmash of keywords). It's almost like </em>'Lisp versus COBOL<em>'.</em>
