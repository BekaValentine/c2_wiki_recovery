        Labelled Directed Graph
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <em>Labelled Directed Graph</em> is, as the name suggests, a <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a> whose arrows have labels on them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More precisely that is an edge-labelled directed graph. </em><a href="LabelledDirectedGraph.html">LabelledDirectedGraph</a> more often refers to labelling of vertices.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, an edge-labelled directed graph is an obvious way of representing a <a href="FiniteStateMachine.html">FiniteStateMachine</a>, or a graph of references between objects.
