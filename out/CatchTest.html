        <em>"I would also humbly submit that CATCH (</em><a href="http://catch-lib.net)">http://catch-lib.net)</a> has a place too. It, too, is header-only, using modern C++ (but not *too* modern) and with no external dependencies (beyond C++98's stdlib). It has a number of other features that differentiate it - such as it's natural expression syntax, isolated sections (that reduce, or eliminate, the need for sections) and free form test naming."<em> -- </em>PhilNash [quoted from <a href="LinkedIn.html">LinkedIn</a> comments by <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>]
