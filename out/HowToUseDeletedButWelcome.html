        How To Use Deleted But Welcome
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is only one of our many <a href="DeletionConventions.html">DeletionConventions</a>. Please read those as well.

      <p>
        <strong>Best Practice for DeletedButWelcome</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           If the page seems like a new-user test page, use the DeletedButWelcome tag. Different rules apply to a <a href="WikiHomePage.html">WikiHomePage</a> though; see <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> instead for our current best-practice.
        </li>
        <li>
           If a page was deleted with the DeletedButWelcome tag, wait a day before seconding the deletion.
        </li>
        <li>
           When you visit a DeletedButWelcome page, please check the diff to decide if the original deleter had a valid claim. There are three options:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Second the deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
               Restore the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>. (check it by clicking on the last edit date)
            </li>
            <li>
               Leave DeletedButWelcome intact for someone else to delete.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Beware of changing a page from 'deleted' to 'DeletedButWelcome'. This <em>will</em> delete the page for good, instead of simply making the deletion tag more friendly.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Moved from the list above, where it says "Beware of changing a page from 'deleted' to 'DeletedButWelcome'":</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way to handle the this case would be to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Restore the original page using the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>. Save the page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Replace the page with the <a href="DeletedButWelcome.html">DeletedButWelcome</a> tag.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>Unfortunately, that won't work. Wiki regards consecutive edits by a single author as a single edit, so the restoration will be washed away by the second step, which will be taken as a "confirm delete" by wiki.</em>

        How about being able to set expiry dates on wiki pages? Then the new user could arrange for their test page to automatically delete itself. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        I think a day may not be long enough for the original writer to see the <a href="DeletedButWelcome.html">DeletedButWelcome</a> tag. How about a week? They may not be in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> anymore, but one can check the backlinks from <a href="DeletedButWelcome.html">DeletedButWelcome</a> to find pages that need to be seconded. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>
