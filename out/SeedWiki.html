           Just got an email today (Aug. 12th 2009) that <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> is closing on Sept. 12th 2009. -AE
        </li>
        <li>
           Provides Free Accounts with limitations, or more fully featured and robust features for a monthly fee. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Seed Wiki is now a wiki meta-farm. It can support "virtual" roots so that collections of wikis can run as separate "farms". Individual wikis and virtual roots can be given their own "look and feel".
        </li>
        <li>
           Seed Wiki has changed to a "square bracket" wikipedia style of coding for page names and widgets.
        </li>
        <li>
           Only a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> is required to start a wiki. Everything else on the start form is optional, although you may also want to create yourself a code word so you can download future backups of your wiki content. *note: everyone can download your material if you download using a widget. All they need to do is click on it.*
        </li>
        <li>
           All wikis by default are public. You have preferences to both lock and hide your wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> is <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>. It doesn't mention this on the official site, but see <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/seedwiki/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/seedwiki/</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> now supports a growing collection of widgets (ways to add functionality to a wiki page).
        </li>
        <li>
           The functionality gets added in by writing a text command unto a page. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Text editing can now be done using a WYSIWYG editor (which still accepts <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s as a way of creating pages), for users of <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 6, Netscape 7.1, Mozilla 1.5, or Opera 7.11.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> has its first commercial user and is being looked at for a couple of other projects
        </li>
        <li>
           Supports passworded wikis (for a small fee) and "mirror" wikis that let visitors view and comment on the pages in the passworded wikis [now, Feb.'03 it's 10USD/month, and very well worth it. Great people to work with.]
        </li>
        <li>
           Wiki pages can include content from other wiki pages or from html files.
        </li>
        <li>
           Free accounts are no longer deactivated after a period of inactivity, but are restricted to a maximum of 50 pages.

        Please: DATE your comments. :-)
        Otherwise they are often usless or even misleading.
        A comment like "server down 10 times this week" means different things if the date is recent than if the date was 2 years ago!)

           I was loving <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> until this evening, when I find the server down:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        The server encountered an internal error and was unable to complete your request. <br/>
        Could not connect to JRun Server."<br/>
        Over and over. <br/>

           Disappointing after spending several days pestering people to make use of my new wiki, and putting a lot of work into it. Does anyone know if this happens frequently? Thanks.

          Seed Wiki is having teething problems as it grows. I'm in the process of switching databases and switching application servers. Can't promise all the problems will go away, but I'm taking the best steps I can find to fix them. -- KennethTyler

           <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> is having lots of problems, like being very slow to load up editing on a ISDN 64kbps, almost unusable (my HW/SW should not be a problem Athlon 3.9+ 512ram, w2k, Mozilla).
        </li>
        <li>
           I dislike it much.
        </li>
        <li>
           I've noticed a lot of downtime and error pages (20-24th Aug) recently. Generally though if they can sort this out then I think they're onto a winner because the site is clean and easy to use

           I agree with the positive and the negative comments just made. <em>In principle</em> <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> offers a very nice, reasonable flexible and powerful wiki space, but users who spend time setting up their wikis here will be find it disappointing and counterproductive if the servers continue to be plagued by errors. In my case, I've set up wikis for three college classes I teach. Until <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a>'s problems go away, I cannot accomplish what I had hoped to do with wikis in my classes. <em>Or I could find another place to host my wikis.</em> :-( (<em></em><a href="http://www.riters.com'')">http://www.riters.com'')</a>

           I just made a free account with <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a>, just to test it out (and if I like it I'm thinking about buying a RED membership to make my MMORPG site a wiki). Anyway, it looks really nice so far. There's not a lot of customization with the free version, but apparently with payed membership you get total page customization, which is pretty sweet. Anyway, I'll edit back when I've had it for a few days. This hasn't been abandoned.

        the entry on the <a href="WikiFarms.html">WikiFarms</a> page used to say:

        <li>
           <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> (<a href="http://www.seedwiki.com)">http://www.seedwiki.com)</a> is a free (or pay for more) wiki farm. Part of an effort to use wikis as an underlayer for developing business applications (Wikis With Widgets). Running now on an <a href="AllaireColdFusion.html">AllaireColdFusion</a> Wiki Clone. Allows custom headers, menus and footers. Now using a <a href="WysiWyg.html">WysiWyg</a> ed;itor for entering pages that removes the need for any wiki conventions except for <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> (square brackets instead of camel case) for creating pages - (but it's still backward-compatible, you can turn off the WYSIWYG editor, and you can still use the standard wiki conventions). Lets the wiki-owner download a text backup file of his/her wiki. Friendly owners, very responsive. <a href="WysiWyg.html">WysiWyg</a> doesn't work with Opera or any flavor of Mac editor, but HTML still works. Requires <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. Their free version does have some light caveats: your wiki may only have 50 pages at any time. If you want more you have to pay a monthly fee. For this user that worked great - the service was good and when my wiki got large enough and active enough I had no qualms about paying the fee. The owner (Kenneth Tyler) really is great to work with - how many administrators have their cell phone number (that they answer readily) on their website?!? <strong>The free version no longer has a page limit but has Google ads on the page.</strong>
