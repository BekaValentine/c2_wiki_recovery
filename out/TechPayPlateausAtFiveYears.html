        Tech Pay Plateaus At Five Years
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an observation that in general technology worker pay tends to plateau at about 5 years worth of experience. It is not that it doesn't go higher, but the rate of increase significantly drops at about the 5 year level. That is unless one goes into management or quasi-management (which is not "tech pay" anymore).

      <p>
        ("Plateau" may be the wrong word, but it is hard to breifly describe a curve with a kink at 5.)

        It could be <a href="SoftwareAgeism.html">SoftwareAgeism</a>, or it could just be that experience itself is not heavily valued, regardless of the worker's age. I suspect it is a combination of:

           ToolOrientedHiering - If pay is based on knowledge of a given tool(s), then more than 5 years is not going to make significant difference. (Only C++ takes more than 5 years to master :-)
        </li>
        <li>
           Experience is difficult to varify or only shows up in subtle ways.

           Domain knowledge is not valued either - <a href="WhyIsDomainKnowledgeNotValued.html">WhyIsDomainKnowledgeNotValued</a>
