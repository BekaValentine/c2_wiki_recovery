        Half Bit
      </h1>
      <p>
        A bit is either 1 or 0, but a digital wire can express 3 states: power, ground, and high-impedance/floating (high-Z).
      </p>
      <p>
        A half-bit carries less information, most commonly either 1 or high-Z.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a few of you know, the interrupt line is implemented as a single line with a resistor tying it to ground (putting a 0 on the line). If a device wants to request interrupt, it un-blocks its tristate on the pin and puts a 1 on the line.
      </p>
      <p>
        A high-impedance detector may be built with two diodes and two resistors.  The circuit returns 1,1 if the input is 1; 0, 0 if the input is 0; and 0,1 if the input is floating.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My understanding of "high-impedance detector" is that it converts a tristate output to a bistate output by mapping high-Z to 1 or 0.  Therefore, where do your "1,1" and "0,1" outputs come from?  I presume by "un-blocks its tristate on the pin and puts a 1 on the line", you mean the output switches from high-Z to 1?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By the way, I've removed some extraneous material like sizes of resistors ("large" -- how big is large?) and reference to circuits burning up.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The high-impedance detector I described has two bits of output because it is also the decoder for expressing the three distinct signal values to traditional circuits.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By "traditional circuits", do you mean bistate logic?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you mean the following truth table?</em>
      </p>
