        Ben Richards works for AG Communication Systems in Phoenix, AZ, and was
        illuminated by <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> at a Pattern Writing Workshop that he and <a href="BobHanmer.html">BobHanmer</a>
        consented to put on here.  I work in the General Processor Unit group
        which worries itself about GTE's cash register.  That is, we handle billing
        data that is generated by the GTD-5 EAX central office telephone switch.  <a href="DonOlson.html">DonOlson</a>
        runs around here somewhere, and made quite an impact with his <a href="HandsInView.html">HandsInView</a> pattern.

        I graduated from the University of Illinois at CU (BA '91, MS '94), but never
        had the fortune to work with <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> while there.  I was lucky enough to
        attend his Patterns course during ISSS this year, and gained another perspective
        on patterns that's not quite as wacky (wiki?) as Cope's.
