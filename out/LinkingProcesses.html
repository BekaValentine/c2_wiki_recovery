        Linking Processes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Information which is connected via Hyperlinks, can be described as involving two aspects:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Models
          <ul>
            <li>
               MarkupLanguages
            </li>
            <li>
               RelationshipsAndConnections
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Processes
          <ul>
            <li>
               Accessors
            </li>
            <li>
               Implementors
            </li>
            <li>
               ReferentialMethods
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In thinking about how in the future, information can be related and connected, regardless of where it is and however temporary or permanent it may be, one must employ strategies and tools which employ and occupy the organized intelligence of the user and which reside within the managed spaces of the user of that information. To that end, it seems that these two aspects need an AutomatedAndMentalInformationProcessingEngine. One which employs Organizational models and processes which combines the automation which can be programmed with the intellect which can be applied to information. One which involves both assembly and disassembly, addition and division, where automation provides classification, categorization, and presentation of likely candidates for linking while the choices to accept the linkages or to provide alternate candidates or inventions should be made possible by the user's mental and structural efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is assumed that if one piece of information can be reinforced, enhanced or clarified by another piece of known information, then Hyperlinkages and storage positions should be made so that the initial information as well as the linked information may be viewed, used directly as well as used to create additional relationships.
