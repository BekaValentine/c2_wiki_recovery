        Cherry Picking
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="CherryPicking.html">CherryPicking</a> in the context of revision control is to merge only very specific changes from one branch to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, If you have several branches, and one of the uber-unstable and utterly wacky development trees gets a very important fix, a VCS with good <a href="CherryPicking.html">CherryPicking</a> support will let you move only that change to your stable branch quite easily. A VCS without such support will probably mean you'll have to do it manually, thus losing the <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> semantics of that patch's history, as well as creating future conflicts if the development tree is wholly merged into the stable one at some later point in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DavidsAdvancedRevisionControlSystem.html">DavidsAdvancedRevisionControlSystem</a> is a VCS with excellent <a href="CherryPicking.html">CherryPicking</a> support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any RCS based on patchsets rather than files or directories will be able to do this. <a href="BitKeeper.html">BitKeeper</a> and <a href="GitVersionControl.html">GitVersionControl</a> are good examples.

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>... given 2 branches where you want to bring in single changes without regard to surrounding history, Darcs lets you do this</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>... what I understand from bzr folk is that the way Darcs handles patches internally it's possible to reorder patches such that older versions of the project cannot be reconstructed</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>... if what I've heard is correct and we're understanding this correctly, this is a serious failing in a version control system</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>... so (c) Darcs may have some theoretical and practical serious issues</dd>

        He also provides solutions for how he advises to perform the <a href="CherryPicking.html">CherryPicking</a> in Mercurial, and this should be also applicable to other <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> systems which are "history-oriented" [<a href="http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.mercurial.general/5037]:">http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.version-control.mercurial.general/5037]:</a>

        <dd>There are a bunch of subtly but critically different things that get called cherry-picking. One is "import just a few changesets from a source one time", another is "regularly pick some subset of changes from a source and remember which things we didn't want".</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The first can be solved to varying degrees with export+import [of patches], transplant [plugin], etc. This changes ids because you have a different history.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The second, much trickier one is maybe best solved by merge+backout. You can think of it as "cherry-winnowing" (pick all the cherries, then throw some rotten ones out).</dd>
