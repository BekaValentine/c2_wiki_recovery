        How To Learn
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Step one:</strong> Realize the truth: you do not know.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step two:</strong> Do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step three:</strong> Recall the event and try to distinguish between what you wanted to do, and what you actually did.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Step four:</strong> Repeat steps one through four 'til you want to learn something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember to embrace error. Error is as natural as success. Often, what you thought was error was more successful than you could have imagined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Step one is often the hardest part.

           Do what?

        <em>It. Which of course means whatever it is that you don't know and thus can't do.</em>

      <p>
        For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.

        Also, do I detect some recursion here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, but it's tail-recursive. Also, there is a termination clause. Or did you mean the </em>do it<em> part?</em>
