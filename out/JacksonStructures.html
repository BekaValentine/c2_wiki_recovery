        Jackson Structures
      </h1>
      <p>
        Jackson Structures (from Jackson Structured Programming)are a neat diagrammtic way of showing sequence, optionality and iteration of data items and processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The structures are read from top to bottom and left to right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Iteration is denoted by an asterisk and optionality by an "o"
      </p>
      <p>
        Its hard to show it in a textual editor.
      </p>
      <code>
        ---MAIN PROCESS---<br/>
        |        |       |     <br/>
        |        |       |<br/>
        Proc1    Proc2     Proc3<br/>
        |               |    |<br/>
        ----repeat*--    opt1(0)  opt2(0)<br/>
        |     |     |<br/>
        step1 step2 step3<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Which describes entry into the Main Process.
        The first thing to be executed is Proc1.
        Which contains a repeat loop (zero, once or many times).
        The loop contains step1, step2, step3
        When the repeat loop is completed Proc3 is executed.
        Following Proc3 either opt1 or opt2 is executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some rules to be followed:
        All boxes hanging from a parent must be of the same type.
        All iteration boxes must have a sequence or a selection box immediately above them.
        All selection boxes must have a structured box (neither iteration or selection) above them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible to quit from one part of the structure and resume in another, but often it is better to rework the diagram to avoid these!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am sure there are others out there who are more familiar with this notation so please update this page as you see fit.
      </p>

        SSADM makes great use of Jackson structures for describing processing, interfaces and entity life histories (state transition type diagrams in UML).
