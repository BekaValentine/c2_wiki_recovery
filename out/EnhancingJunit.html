        Enhancing Junit
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page is intended for discussion of possible enhancements/fixes to JUnit (whose <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> is <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>). Implemented enhancements should be added to the <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> page.

        If you're testing web applications, you could try <a href="ServletTesting.html">ServletTesting</a>, perhaps using some tips about <a href="ServletUnit.html">ServletUnit</a>. Or, you could test the web server response directly with <a href="HttpUnit.html">HttpUnit</a>.

        Maybe there's some way that JUnit itself could be enhanced to help with <a href="JournallingPattern.html">JournallingPattern</a> testing. -- DavidPinn

        I have just struggled through the issues concerning the testing of abstract classes and their subclasses. I am wondering if a software tool, perhaps delivered as an enhancement to JUnit, could ease the way a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        In part, the complexity arises because of polymorphism. Consider abstract class Telephone. I would write a trivial subclass of Telephone that does not override any of its methods, and use it to test all the non-abstract methods of Telephone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now consider MobilePhone, a concrete subclass of Telephone. In addition to testing all the methods in MobilePhone, I also need to retest any methods of Telephone that polymorphically call methods of MobilePhone. Keeping track of which superclass methods to retest takes some brain energy. The problem is exacerbated when the inheritance tree is several levels deep. I'm wondering if a program could do the work for me: give me a list of the methods that I need to test. In so doing, the program would help with the more generic problem of determining test coverage. Could it be activated by a button in JUnit's <a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a>? -- DavidPinn
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Here's another enhancement that would be good. Two years ago, back before Erich and Kent wrote JUnit, I stole all of the good ideas that were in Kent's original Smalltalk testing framework and helped one of my customers build a Java version of the same thing. A cool feature they added on their own was a tree-view (built using Swing) that showed a composite test "split out" into its pieces. You could see results or failures at any level that way. You could also choose to re-run tests at any level in the tree. Sigh... too many ideas, not enough time...

        In the version of JUnit2 that I have, the constructor of <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> that takes a class uses getDeclaredMethods to look for the list of test methods (using the naming scheme above). By changing to getMethods, one can get the list of matching test methods not just in the current class, but in any superclass. By building a test class hierarchy that mirrors your class hierarchy, you can now test your entire hierarchy without rewriting a lot of tests. Kent and Erich and everyone else, what are your thoughts on this? -- <a href="HankRoark.html">HankRoark</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Erich and I were talking about this today. There is a danger in using getMethods() that you'll accidentally pick up stuff you don't want. But you can't have abstract test case classes with concrete test cases in them. We'll probably default to the version with inheritance, but offer the current behavior in a separately named static <a href="FactoryMethod.html">FactoryMethod</a>. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        I have written extension to JUnit that allows tests written for <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> to be run by the JUnit user interface. It has a code generator that turns your <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> test into a shared library that can be loaded into a JUnit ui via a Java class that is also generated. All you have to do is write your tests, run the generator, and compile.

        I need a set of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s that consist of two phases that have to be executed in separate Java VMs. (This is to test some persistence stuff.) Although I can figure out a way to do this, I'd be interested if anybody else has already done this before. After all, I'm a lazy person. If not, I'll publish my code when it's less buggy than now. -- <a href="HaskoHeinecke.html">HaskoHeinecke</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe I'm just missing something here, but what I'd like to do is build a test suite that runs several test suites (e.g. I want to run tests on every class in a particular package at one shot). What I've got is a "master" test suite TestAll. In TestAll, I add each <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> suite (one for each class being tested).
      </p>
      <p>
        public class TestAll extends <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> {
      </p>
      <code>
        public TestAll(String name) {<br/>
        super(name);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public static Test suite() {<br/>
        <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> suite= new <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>();<br/>
        suite.addTest(CurrencyTest.suite());<br/>
        suite.addTest(EntryTest.suite());<br/>
        return suite;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue with this approach is that the compiler forces me to have the .suite() operation on each <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> class defined apriori in order for TestAll.suite() to compile. The result is that I don't get to use the nifty reflection based identification of test methods that are prefixed with "test" in each test class, but rather I must maintain the .suite() operation to add each test case operation when it is added to the class. I think I'm looking for an operation like <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>.addSuite() that will do all of the nifty reflection work and dynamically build those .suite() operations on the fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Am I missing something, or am I asking for more features in JUnit release 2.x or 3? :-) Other than that, I am loving JUnit! -- <a href="JohnGoodsen.html">JohnGoodsen</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You just add a method
      </p>
      <code>
        public static Test suite() {<br/>
        return new <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>(CurrencyTest.class);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        to the CurrencyTest class, and similar for all test cases. This constructor of <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> does the nifty reflection work for you. You then just add a testXYZ() method, and it is automatically recognized and included. -- <a href="MarnixKlooster.html">MarnixKlooster</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or you could change your suite method to
      </p>
      <code>
        ...suite.addTest(new <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>(EntryTest.class));...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and avoid the need for the subsidiary suite() methods entirely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, both approaches have to be used in order to get tests to run that are embedded in suites that are themselves inside of suites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example code that solves both problems:
      </p>
      <p>
        public class TestAll extends <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> {
      </p>
      <code>
        public TestAll(String name) {<br/>
        super(name);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public static Test suite() {<br/>
        <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> suite= new <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>(TestAll.class); //Put in this class<br/>
        suite.addTest(CurrencyTest.suite());<br/>
        suite.addTest(EntryTest.suite());<br/>
        return suite;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        If the this.suite() always adds the current class in the <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> constructor, then all local test methods are added dynamically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing
      </p>
      <code>
        suite.addTest(new <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>(CurrencyTest.class);<br/>
        suite.addTest(new <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>(EntryTest.class);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        fails to add any addTest's in the suite methods of EntyTest and CurrencyTest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is the logic here solid?

        While talking about enhancing junit, has anyone noticed that the 3.x TestCaseClassLoader makes a questionable use of the <em>available</em> method in its loadClass method?
        It probably gets away with it, as it loads from disk, but this method says it returns the number bytes it can read <strong>without blocking</strong> - if you disk was busy this might not give you all the bytes you need right? -- <a href="TimMackinnon.html">TimMackinnon</a>

        Here are a few items from my JUnit wish-list.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Load test cases using a java.net.URLClassLoader, so that tests can be put into JAR files.
        </li>
        <li>
           A much smaller user interface to the test runner -- about the size of a desktop icon (32x32 or 48x48) -- so that I can always keep it visible on the desktop and click it to run the tests. I envisage a small window, with no window-manager decorations, containing a circular facial display: happy and green when all tests run ok :-), sad and red when tests have failed :-(. Clicking the face will start tests running: the face goes "neutral": :-| and grey. Progress is shown by filling the face pie-chart style, with green as tests pass, red as soon as one has failed. Test parameters can be set by popping up dialog boxes from an option menu. The class-path can be built up by dragging directories or JAR files and dropping them onto a list box, in which they can be reordered or deleted. If tests fail, detailed reports can be popped up from the option menu, or by a control-click or double-click mouse action.
        </li>
        <li>
           Clicking lines in the stack trace of a test failure report will display the reported line of the source file in my favorite editor.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If I get the time, I may implement them myself...

        I've hacked a version of junit.textui.<a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a> to create junit.servlet.<a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a> for those of us who want to be able to run our tests through a browser.

The source is at <a href="http://www.mcbreen.ab.ca/pete/TestRunner.java.">http://www.mcbreen.ab.ca/pete/TestRunner.java.</a> A more complete implementation would use the swingui as a starting point since it is a pain to have to restart the webserver just to get the next version of a class loaded. -- <a href="PeteMcBreen.html">PeteMcBreen</a>

        The LoadingTestRunner seems to be too eager to reload classes, even if they didn't change. This becomes a problem especially with static attributes, which get reseted. Look at this example classes, which fail if I use a LoadingTestRunner, but work fine with a simple <a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a>.

        import junit.swingui.LoadingTestRunner;<br/>

        Main.counter = 10;<br/>
        LoadingTestRunner.main(new String[] {"StaticMemberTest"});<br/>
        }<br/>
        public static int counter = 0;<br/>

        It doesn't help to create an object of Main in the beginning with "Main obj = new Main();". Even though there is a reference to an object after that, the class still gets reloaded.

        I wrote a general class "UnitTestGenerator.java" that you can point at a directory tree of java source, and it will traverse the tree and generate a unit test class [ stub - assert(String, FALSE); ] for every Java source file (that doesn't end in "Test.java"!), and a PackageTest.java for every package, and a top-level <a href="SystemTest.html">SystemTest</a>.java that calls the tests from every package.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've found it useful, especially under an environment like JBuilder, where I can right-click on any test and run it, or run on an entire package, or across the whole system.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not perfect, but it is documented, and it works well.
        My question is - where can I put it for others to access?

        I have the same question. I've written 3 additions. A <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> that creates a <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> from every class in its package (and nested packages) that extend <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>, a <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> that makes testing MT-safety a little easier in JUnit (since calling fail () in a non-main thread doesn't do a lot) and and a fix that stops JUnit swallowing exceptions from <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> constructors.

        Hi there,
      </p>
      <p>
        About 18 months ago, I started an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> project called "simscomputing.Test Bed" (<a href="http://testbed.simscomputing.com)">http://testbed.simscomputing.com)</a> with the same goals as JUnit. Sometime in the summer of 1999, I discovered JUnit. I had not previously known about JUnit. At the time, I felt that my GUI and APIs were, frankly, better, and I kept developing the Test Bed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then, I think the JUnit APIs have caught up and perhaps passed Test Bed. But I tried the JUnit GUI yesterday, and Test Bed's GUI is still much better.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I wanted to talk to you guys about a merger. It'd be nice if my GUI ran JUnit unit tests. And it'd be nice that if you were a Java programmer, you could write unit tests that ran in either testing framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        What would you think about abstracting out the JUnit and Test Bed APIs and create a small set of interfaces? Then Junit can implement those interfaces and so can the Test Bed. Then my GUI would work with both JUnit and Test Bed unit tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we could simply agree on a few interfaces, then I think the whole Java unit testing community wins.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I'd like to open a dialog and see if we can come to some kind of merger agreement where we take the best of both frameworks and avoid our duplication of effort. I'd also like to move simscomputing.Test Bed to sourceforge.net for a more open development process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks,

        For the last couple of years, I've been using a piece of code taken from <a href="JavaWorld.html">JavaWorld</a> (I think) which takes a directory name, loads all java classes from that directory, then runs a test for any class which implements <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>. In this way, I've not had to create any suites or explicitly call any <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would seem sensible for this functionality to be included in JUnit itself, particularly since JUnit already uses Reflection to determine test cases within a particular class - this would just determine them within a particular class hierarchy.
