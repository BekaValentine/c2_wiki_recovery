        Magnolia Workstation

        It wasn't long after <a href="RogerBates.html">RogerBates</a> joined <a href="TekLabs.html">TekLabs</a> that the
        Magnolia project got started.  RickLefaivre believed that
        we needed serious desktop computing power if we were to 
        have any idea how to plan for what would surely be the
        environment of the future.

        Roger and <a href="ChipSchnarel.html">ChipSchnarel</a> and others build about 60 of the
        dual processor 68000 machines.  The second processor was
        a display processor which was helped with a little bit-slice
        engine well on its way around the <a href="CircleOfReincarnation.html">CircleOfReincarnation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Roger wrote the windowing software that ran on the display
        processor and knocked off a nice drafting program that
        talked to it from a unix process running on the other cpu.
        Many other projects were started but only <a href="AllenWirfsBrock.html">AllenWirfsBrock</a>'s
        Smalltalk had any impact.

        I'm not sure who picked the name Magnolia.  
        I've heard it was MayerSchwartz who had seen the previous
        workstation effort, code name Beaver, go down.
        In the south the Magnolia is also known as the Beaver Tree.

        <a href="RandalSchwartz.html">RandalSchwartz</a> played with one of these while he was waiting for TekECS to get organized, learned the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, then later convinced JasonPenney at ServioLogic that
        Smalltalk was the "right language".  The rest is history.
