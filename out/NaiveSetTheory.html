      <p>
        At 104 pages, this <a href="SkinnyBook.html">SkinnyBook</a> is rather outrageously expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Books are priced by demand, not by weight. Furthermore, much of the value in this book is not in the words themselves, but in the experience of </em>learning<em> set theory by proving for oneself all of the statements that Halmos doesn't prove ("exercises for the reader", most of them not labeled as such).</em>
