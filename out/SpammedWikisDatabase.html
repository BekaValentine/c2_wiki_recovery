        The Wiki admin of <a href="ProjectGalacticGuide.html">ProjectGalacticGuide</a> took my <a href="WikiSpamBlocker.html">WikiSpamBlocker</a>, modified it for his site and is now blocking 99.99% of incoming spam!! Good work <a href="ProjectGalacticGuide.html">ProjectGalacticGuide</a>!

        <em>I've just tried to edit </em><a href="ProjectGalacticGuide.html">ProjectGalacticGuide</a> as you ask, but after spending 5 minutes trying to find an appropriate earlier revision and edit it, I gave up. Make it easy to fix or it will die.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What is this <a href="ProjectGalacticGuide.html">ProjectGalacticGuide</a> anyway? I just clicked on a few pages on its recent changes, and most of them look like crap with or without the spam. We C2 users have enough problems without dealing with other people's garbage. Sound selfish? Yup -- deal with it. <a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a> (emphasis on <strong>your</strong>).

        Thanks  :-). I just want to make clear that this idea of listing Wikis to despam was started by someone else (no idea who). That person should receive the credit for what I think is a fine idea. I found the original list on <a href="WikiSpam.html">WikiSpam</a> in a <strong>Help wanted</strong> section and moved it here because the <a href="WikiSpam.html">WikiSpam</a> page was constantly being reverted to various revisions. My main contribution was to put the information in an easy-to-read tabular form.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I did, but then I switched to this page: <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/SpamBusters">http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/SpamBusters</a> and now the best wiki for anti-spam fighters to use is at <a href="http://wiki.chongqed.org/">http://wiki.chongqed.org/</a> although they have turned off editing over the holidays (too bad spammers didn't also take a holiday break).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>See </em><a href="http://www.galactic-guide.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=browse&id=HomePage&revision=316.">http://www.galactic-guide.com/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?action=browse&id=HomePage&revision=316.</a> However, this wiki seems to be abandoned and is now marked as hopeless. It looks like there has been an attempt to prevent spam. When you edit you are presented with a check box titled "Tick this if you are human".  If you don't check the box, your edit is rejected.  However, this does not seem to have stopped spammers. Perhaps a lot of the spamming is performed manually?<em></em>

        <em>If I try to save a good revision of the home page (mentioned above), I get the following error page:</em>

        One of <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a>'s "features" is that only a certain number of page revisions are kept. Sadly, this makes it very easy to destroy all the content with multiple overwrites. I found some stuff to restore via web.archive.org, but that was a lot of effort for not much of a result. I'm starting to suspect that <a href="ProjectGalacticGuide.html">ProjectGalacticGuide</a> is a lost cause. :(

        <em>Why not recover all the valid material you can, and then choose a wiki with access authority? Make it easy to get on, and then start afresh. And use a better wiki.</em>

        I've just tried working on <a href="SmallLinuxWiki.html">SmallLinuxWiki</a>. A lot of the pages were clean. The pages with spam were marked as "read only" - wonder what's up with that. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OpenWiki.html">OpenWiki</a> seems to be ok. I don't see any spam. 
        [<a href="http://www.2-dollar-wiki.com">http://www.2-dollar-wiki.com</a> 2DollarWiki] seems to be ok. I don't see any spam.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I've been posting "good spam". I'm weeding some of the "wiki gardens" out there and leaving my calling card as I go for my <a href="WikiGardeningService.html">WikiGardeningService</a>. My absolutely free service can help prevent wiki spam in the first place. All I ask for in return is good vibes and possibly job references sent my way.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, see my work at <a href="EcotoneWiki.html">EcotoneWiki</a>. I did this all by hand. All they need is a simple patch to prevent this from happening. I've left notes on the pages that I've despammed to contact me - but haven't had a response yet.

      <p>
        <a href="JoisWiki.html">JoisWiki</a> has a notice that it has been disabled and moved elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MozdevWiki.html">MozdevWiki</a> has spam but the pages I checked are marked as "read only" - so I can't do anything.

          Every page on this wiki is spammed, and there is no way to know what should be there.  I did just now edit the front page, so the editing function does work.  I did a few more pages.  I will leave all the rest of the fun to someone else: <a href="http://www.orbtech.com/wiki/TitelIndex">http://www.orbtech.com/wiki/TitelIndex</a>
