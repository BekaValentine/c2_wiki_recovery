        I started programming in 1965 on a CDC 3100 with 16K of real core memory. I've been having a blast ever since. Now I do genealogy software for consumers in VC++ and MFC.

        I have observed that the biggest obstacle to success and prosperity in software development is the proliferation of product interfaces that discourage customers from buying. People only have so much time on their hands, and learning your neat new creation ain't high on their priority list.

        I did tech support for a hardware vendor, and met all sorts of people & machines.

        I now develop in C++ for Windows. I'm 53, and try to keep up with the technology. I have forgotten the equivalent of several encyclopedias full of documentation for ancient and forgotten OSes and programming languages. Things are definitely getting better.
