        My interpretation is an object that serves to define a relationship between two other objects. An example might be a dependent EJB object that serves to resolve a many-many relationship between two entity beans. --<a href="JohnHarby.html">JohnHarby</a>

        IMHO, all attributes arise out of relationships. Objects do not have
        any attributes themselves.

        <em>Your comment above strikes a responsive chord with some thoughts I recently had about relationships (associations) in the context of relational database-based applications. Except I used "many", even "most", but I never got to "all".  Please share your thoughts further. --</em><a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a><em></em>

        If you do a lot of design and you consider issues at a deeper level,
        it seems that all attributes come from relationships. It is, however,
        inconvenient to make models this way so we tend to toss attributes into
        records/objects. I maintain all attributes arise out of relationships
        and have yet to see a counter. Objects/records simply supply identity.
        The relationship may be with space or time or other concepts that
        traditionally have not been modeled.

        How about attributes like date of birth, SSN, Postal Code, IP address, auto license plate number, SIC code, race, blood type, hair color, country code, domain name, etc.?
      </p>
      <p>
        SSN is relation with the social security admin. Postal Code is in relationship
        with a geographical area, time, governing body. Our has changed once.
        IP addresses our relationship with your ISP (or whatever). Race is in relationship with whatever group is defining
        what constitutes race, there are many opinions.  Hair color is in relation
        with time. Etc. Drop what is in relation-to and the attributes either go
        away or aren't really accurate. Hair color changes with time, may change
        with diseases, etc. Time is an important relationship yet is normally ignored
        for pragmatic reasons. If the agency giving you the SSN doesn't exist
        then you don't have an SSN, thus i think the attribute is properly
        part of the relationship and not the thing in itself. -- Todd

        I recently attempted an "ultra-normalized" database design, which combined minimalist entity tables (enterprise, person, phone, street address, city, country, etc.) with a many-to-many three column association table for every pair of entity tables where a relationship existed. (The third column, "role", an attribute of the relationship, took values such as employer, customer, voice, fax, mobile, modem, home, ship to, bill to, etc.) I was struck by how few entity table attributes I was left with, and how much information was represented by the relationships -- including information that was not anticipated in the initial systems design.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I was left with attributes like those above, mostly externally assigned, or inherent to the entity. (I also reinforced my opinion that classification-related assignments need to be kept separate from entity attributes, but that is another discussion).  -- <a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>

        <em>Objects/records simply supply identity.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've discovered that "non-object" attribute values are always a kind of foreign key.  If they don't refer to other objects, they are values <em>where the identity and value are the same.</em> Hence the attribute is the key and the target value, all at once.
