        Viewing Algorithms As Collection Processing
      </h1>
      <p>
        I often view algorithms in terms of processing collections (<a href="CollectionOrientedProgramming.html">CollectionOrientedProgramming</a> or COP), and <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> in particular. If the data structures are organized "right", then roughly 50% to 80% of typical processing can be practically viewed as COP. It could even be 100% if you stretch things, but every technique has areas where it doesn't shine so well, and current tools don't support COP to its fullest. 
      </p>
      <p>
        COP tends to be more compact and a higher abstraction than "one-node-at-a-time" algorithms found in traditional programming and OOP. Higher abstraction includes meta-techniques that otherwise requires awkward language features like reflection to replicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is to document some examples to give ideas of how COP can play a roll. I will tend toward tables as my example collections. -- <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>

        <strong>Example 1: Field selection</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In CRUD apps, often different reports, screens, and forms will use a different subset of entity columns (fields). Rather than mention the column list over and over with different subsets of columns excluded, it can be useful to use something like a <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a>, and filter by some criteria to get the subset of columns we want. It is usually easier to change the assignments in such a table than dig around through linear and verbose code and hand edit column lists or bunches of similar-looking function/method calls.

        <strong>Example 2: </strong><a href="GooglifyDeepMenus.html">GooglifyDeepMenus</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If we have a data structure holding attributes about most of our app options, then it gives us and/or users more tools to sift, manage, and search through bunches of options. Off-the-shelf CRUD techniques can be used as at least an optional interface to search and study the options.

        <strong>Example 3: Dynamic Code Grouping</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        With flexible collections, what appears "together" is merely a choice of dynamic presentation. One stops viewing code as linear or tree-shaped files and instead views them as blocks which can be presented as dynamic groups of multiple factors, such as database-related code, security-related code, GUI-related code, etc. <strong>without having to hard-wire</strong> our original module or routine grouping to fit any one of these. "Together" becomes a virtual, dynamic, and relativistic concept. See  <a href="SeparationAndGroupingAreArchaicConceptsDiscussion.html">SeparationAndGroupingAreArchaicConceptsDiscussion</a> for more.

        (Note that this is more of a technique than an "algorithm". Perhaps the topic title should be widened, but it's not different enough to justify.....just yet.)

           <em>I'm generally of the philosophy to error on the side of wider topic titles until the point that identifiable confusion or overlap happens. Further, example 3 is not data-processing-specific. Aspects can be found in any domain.</em>

           This is just <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s opinion.  He can put it on his home page, if he wants.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The page title implies a reasonable notion -- that we can describe algorithms in terms of explicit set operations.  Of course, this is what we do with, e.g., Z notation.  However, except for the unsubstantiated claims in the introduction, the page content references neither algorithms nor collection processing.  I would expect to find examples of common algorithms -- e.g., BTree item deletion, Kruskal's Algorithm, matrix multiplication, Fourier transformation, red-black tree insertion, and the like -- described in terms of collection processing.  Instead, I merely find some rough summaries of user-interface design strategies.  As such, either this should be moved to </em><a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s home page, retitled, or rewritten.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               I think I see what you mean, in terms of classical algorithms.  Some, like red-black tree insertion would not make sense as collection processing; you just wouldn't do it that way; you'd address the business needs at a higher level, using different algorithms.
            </li>
            <li>
               Perhaps a different page name, like DataProcessingAsCollectionProcessing would make more sense?  (Not implying that classical CPSCI algorithms can or should all be done as collections -- just most business needs being doable with collection processing.)
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I have not spent enough time with problem-types of the examples given (BTree changes, matrix multiplication, etc.) to readily supply a collection-processing version of them. I invite others to give it a try. Personally, an algorithm calculating bowling scores would tickle my utility gland more than BTree processing. -t</em>

        <li>
           It could be valid and helpful to view algorithms as collection processing.  <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> might not be the only person who thinks this.
