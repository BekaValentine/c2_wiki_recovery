        Free Coffee

        And a common point of discrimination against <a href="SoftwareDeveloper.html">SoftwareDeveloper</a>s, since most
        companies provide free coffee, but only supply vending machines for caffeinated sodas

        <em>It is dangerous to antagonize Dew drinkers, for it is very hard to predict what a mind afloat in so much caffeine might do under stress.</em>

        At least one company, Qsent Inc, supplies free soda and junk food vending machines as well as free coffee, hot chocolate, bottled water.

        <a href="NuMega.html">NuMega</a> provides free coffee, including cappucino, espresso and more. Hot chocolate. Fridges full of every type of caffeinated beverages. Bottled water too. And the famous 3pm daily DevSnack - food that only a geek could like -)

        <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> was, once upon a time, famous for its free soft drinks, fizzy water, juice, milk, and probably coffee. You had to be quick with the chocolate milk, though -- the summer interns would have it gone in the time between 'fridge refill (5pm) and the time they went home in the evening...

        Gee, I always figured that the huge gobs of money the client was paying me could cover any soft drinks or coffee I needed to consume during the day...are you saying I've been mistreated all this time? Garsh! -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        One former employer provided free softdrinks via a soda fountain.  Soda fountains are much cheaper and more efficient than vending machines and it gave us all the opportunity to learn how soda fountains work. We also had the rare opportunity (with minor modifications) to taste the bliss that is carbonated Hawaiian Punch.  This employer also provided <a href="FreeLunch.html">FreeLunch</a>, which was a great way to get people from different teams socializing in the same room.

        Nah.  HP-CO2 has no caffeine and more acid than any soft drink I've had.  It burns.  Not for the faint of heart.

        Are we talking about free <a href="CoffeeFlavoredCoffee.html">CoffeeFlavoredCoffee</a>?  Or the gourmet expensive stuff?

        We have Free Coffee in our office and it is worth every penny (-:

        In my <a href="HomeOffice.html">HomeOffice</a>, Coffee costs a lot less than the gasoline it takes many to drive a couple of blocks toward their CorporateOffice. It is expensive to work away from Home! Now if Companies offered <a href="FreeGasoline.html">FreeGasoline</a>, that would be something significant! -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

        I find it worrisome that we're arguing about free soda, coffee and junk food, whereas healthier alternatives aren't mentioned at all.  Free fruit, for example.  I know, I know, shelf-life issues.  But what percentage of vending-machine goods in your office won't result in a sugar crash an hour later?  --<a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        Health issues should not be based on what is free, but upon what is <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> with regard to your health. The BrownBag is a good container for carrying such healthy things to work from your home, however if you are at your <a href="HomeOffice.html">HomeOffice</a>, the healthy items are always accessible. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
