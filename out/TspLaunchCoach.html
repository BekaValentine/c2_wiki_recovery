        Tsp Launch Coach
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="TspLaunchCoach.html">TspLaunchCoach</a> is a person trained to coach project teams using the <a href="TeamSoftwareProcess.html">TeamSoftwareProcess</a>. The coach plays a key role in providing team members trained in the <a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a> with the support they need to be successful with this <a href="HighDisciplineMethodology.html">HighDisciplineMethodology</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        TSP coaching includes
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           'Launch'ing projects at the beginning
        </li>
        <li>
           'Re-launch'ing projects periodically
        </li>
        <li>
           Advising project team members on a daily or weekly basis
        </li>
        <li>
           Doing periodic 'checkpoints'
        </li>
        <li>
           Guiding project teams through 'post-mortems'
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="TspLaunchCoach.html">TspLaunchCoach</a> role is somewhat analogous to <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> in XP, but does not include any <a href="ChiefArchitect.html">ChiefArchitect</a> aspects; the coach does not perform direct project tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A prospective <a href="TspLaunchCoach.html">TspLaunchCoach</a> must first become certified as a PspInstructor by the <a href="SoftwareEngineeringInstitute.html">SoftwareEngineeringInstitute</a> to be eligible for TSP Launch Coach training. After the training is
        successfully completed, the prospective coach must successfully launch a real TSP project under the mentorship of a member of the SeiTspTeam to become fully certified as a TSP Launch Coach.
