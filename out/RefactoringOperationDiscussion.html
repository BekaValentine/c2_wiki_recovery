        Refactoring Operation Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here is a page to discuss what is a code <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> operation and what is ReWorking instead.
        It is hoped that this will eventually be a fairly complete list of refactoring operations.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a start:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Simple refactoring operations</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           change the name of a variable
        </li>
        <li>
           change the name of a class or structure definition
        </li>
        <li>
           change the name of a method or function
        </li>
        <li>
           change the type of a variable or class member
        </li>
        <li>
           change the name of a parameter in a function/method definition
        </li>
        <li>
           change a literal into a variable (or do the reverse).
        </li>
        <li>
           increase type strength of a variable or member (or do the reverse).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>More involved refactoring operations</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           convert an inner class to a top-level class definition
        </li>
        <li>
           convert the users of class into using a class that inherits the first class.
        </li>
        <li>
           change to using a different CollectionStructure.
        </li>
        <li>
           take an inline chunk of code and turn it into a method or function (or do the reverse, take a method or function and pull its contents in line).
        </li>
        <li>
           convert a group of simple hashes/dictionaries with the same keys into a single hash/dictionary with a new class containing members from the old collection structures (or do the reverse, convert a dictionary/hash/list of objects into one collection structure for each member in the object's class, and stop using the class).
        </li>
        <li>
           convert a StaticClass into a DynamicClass (or do the reverse, convert a dynamic class into a static class).
        </li>
        <li>
           convert a class member into an instance member (or do the reverse, convert an instance member into a class member).
        </li>
        <li>
           change an interface into an abstract class (or do the reverse).
        </li>
        <li>
           change a for loop into a recursive procedure (or do the reverse).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Database centric refactoring operations</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           move an InlineSqlStatement into a <a href="StoredProcedure.html">StoredProcedure</a> (or do the reverse).
        </li>
        <li>
           move a <a href="StoredProcedure.html">StoredProcedure</a> into a SqlFunction (or do the reverse).
        </li>
        <li>
           change a SQL filter into an application language implemented filter (or do the reverse).
        </li>
      </ul>
