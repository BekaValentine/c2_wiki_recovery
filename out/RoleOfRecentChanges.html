        Role Of Recent Changes
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is the lubricant behind the social function of wiki. It's what makes wikis a happening, a social place and not yet another source control / shared edit web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        A secondary role is that it helps <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s deal with spamming, vandalism, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of its important role, it has also become the prime real estate in <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> and an important target in the WikiAttentionEconomy, so a new form of unethical editing emerged in late 2004, beginning 2005, consisting of adding or removing whitespace - just to bring the page back to <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> / <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> prime real estate position. For folks who have nothing important to say and who would therefore attract no interest with their initial contribution, this is one way to keep repeating the same thing so that maybe somebody will eventually <strong>pay</strong> some attention to it.

        Recently (in 2005), I started to pay attention to <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a>. I have used <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> previously and was generally impressed with the contents and its presentation. BTW, those of you who haven't yet done so should go read the <a href="BarnRaising.html">BarnRaising</a> page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2005, lack of access to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> led me to seek temporary refuge at <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a>. I started watching its <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. So quiet that you can hear a pin drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in the "good old days" at <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> of 2004, missiles were flying everywhere in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Just dodging the sidewinders keep me fit in my armchair. I wished it were more orderly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>So what is </strong><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>? It is a <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a> mechanism. It's <a href="WhereTheMindGoes.html">WhereTheMindGoes</a>.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the mind goes too quickly in a human, it is termed "seizure"; too slow, it is "suspended animation".
      </p>
      <p>
        A proper balance between the extremes is probably <a href="TheWikiWay.html">TheWikiWay</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would not <a href="GaveUpOnRecentChanges.html">GaveUpOnRecentChanges</a> unless I <a href="GaveUpOnWiki.html">GaveUpOnWiki</a>. If <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> turns too quickly, I just reduce my usage of it. Too slow, I go visit another <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> in a different wiki of interest.
      </p>

        <em>Epilogue: Sparring between RoberAbitbol and SunirShah got me interested to visit </em><a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> to take a look.<em></em>
