        Perl Database Iteration Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Ancient History -- This bug plagued wiki for a year or so. None of the suggestions below worked. Nor did a half dozen others I tried. The problem went away when I upgraded to perl5 and tied in a different implementation of dbm. -- </em><a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a><em></em>

      <p>
        One of my long standing <a href="WikiWikiBugs.html">WikiWikiBugs</a> really has me stumped.
        I use Perl's associative array iteration construct,
      </p>
      <code>
        while (($key, $value) = each %db) {	...	}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        to search pages of this database.  I report the number of
        pages visited which is normally in the hundreds.  I say
        <em>normally</em> because sometimes it stops early.  This messes
        up my search command and could be catastrophic in my 
        compress-database script.  (Don't worry, I check.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Does anyone know what is going on?  My only other hint is
        that the problem corrects itself with the addition of another
        page. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Do you lock the database? I don't think UnixDbm or the
        PerlDbmInterface does this automatically. Thus, you may be seeing
        problems only when the iterator runs simultaneously with some other
        access. -- <a href="MarkEichin.html">MarkEichin</a>

      <p>
        Yes, now I do.  When I first saw this problem I interpreted
        it as a <a href="WikiWikiDatabaseSerializationProblem.html">WikiWikiDatabaseSerializationProblem</a>, but now I think otherwise.

        I suspect that this is related to a problem I've seen with just exactly this type of iteration. Try
        changing the loop to be a 
      </p>
      <code>
        foreach my $key (keys %hash) {<br/>
        my $value = $hash{$_}; <br/>
        # do the thing with $key and $value ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When I changed it to this, an unpredictable and undependably irreproducible error that seemed to be related to memory management quit happening, and we were able to handle a lot more entries in the hash without running out of memory.

      <p>
        I agree with Joe; use
        <em>keys</em>
        rather than
        <em>each</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to PERLFUNC(1)'s definition of <em>each</em>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>There is a single iterator for each hash, shared by all each(), keys(), and values() function calls in the program; it can be reset by reading all the elements from the hash, or by evaluting keys HASH or values HASH. If you add or delete elements of a hash while you're iterating over it, you may get entries skipped or duplicated, so don't.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        To use the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> terminology, Perl has only internal iterators, not external iterators.
      </p>
      <p>
        Calling <em>keys</em> grabs all the keys at once, and stores them in an array; you then iterate over the array. (Storing the keys for a few thousand page names should be okay.)  --<a href="PaulChisholm.html">PaulChisholm</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Using <em>keys</em>
        instead of <em>each</em> is an essential first step.
        The next step requires locking. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The generally accepted way of locking (via flock) a DBM file is to use a <strong>separate</strong> lock file. The prior accepted scheme -- extracting a file handle from the DBM and flock'ing the file handle -- has been shown to be unsafe.
