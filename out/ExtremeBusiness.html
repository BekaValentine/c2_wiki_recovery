        Extreme Business

      <p>
        New kinds of software business you can enter because you have an <a href="ExtremeTeam.html">ExtremeTeam</a>. For instance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="FractionalTeams.html">FractionalTeams</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PublicTesting.html">PublicTesting</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

        When I hit this page coming from <a href="ExtremeMarketing.html">ExtremeMarketing</a> I expected something different:
      </p>
      <p>
        Business done the <a href="ExtremeWay.html">ExtremeWay</a> (please don't follow this link - you'll find something different), based on the values communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage.
      </p>
      <p>
        To tell the truth: I expected to invent (discover?) this page myself, but somebody has been here before ;-)

        I just duplicated Helmut's experience, after some idle musings on applying the <a href="ExtremeWay.html">ExtremeWay</a> to BusinessPlans.
      </p>
      <p>
        It all starts with a one-page business plan.
      </p>
      <p>
        Business maps to Investment, Development to Business.
      </p>
      <p>
        Investment writes InvestorStories. Business estimates and implements them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The enterprise has a three-month iteration "heartbeat".
      </p>
      <p>
        Stories have tests. "Sign contract with one of the Top 5 companies in sector X. Success criteria are as follows..."
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a chart on the wall telling everyone how we're faring with each of the quantities the business wants to control : Getting Along, Money In, Money Out, Business Tests Passed, Business Tests Failed, Velocity, Burn Rate.
      </p>

        Tell your customers you have no product (or an incomplete product, or one that sucks), but you think your ideas are worth a shot. If you rely on hype, you can't reliably expect to succeed and will most likely fail anyway; so you <strong>actually</strong> have compelling reasons to believe you'll succeed. Just tell people about those.
      </p>

        Pretty silly, now that I see it written. But it's interesting that I left a startup dot-com I cofounded mostly for what I perceived as failure on the part of my ex-partner to do any of the above, though I didn't think of the above in these exact terms.

        An interesting concept that has infested my brain like a virus. I would suggest replacing the 'Investor' with the 'Customer'; I use CustomerStories rather than (or as well as) InvestorStories. I'm trying this out for a new eBusiness; the CustomerStories describe the experiences of a typical customer interacting with the business.

        This same concept has done more than infest our brains - two of us from I.S.  have convinced the company we work for to use Extreme Practices to run the company.  We are calling it <a href="ExtremeOrchestration.html">ExtremeOrchestration</a>!

        I'm curious to know how this concept differs from <a href="OpenBookManagement.html">OpenBookManagement</a>.  Thanks.
