        <em>How do you test the name of a product, such as a cola drink or a software development methodology?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One way is to ask people if they like the name. You could even ask them to come up with a better name. Some will like the name, some won't. You'll get a list of approximately 1.65 proposed names per person you ask.
      </p>
      <p>
        A better way is to present the product to different (statistically significant) populations of subjects, keeping all variables constant except the name.
      </p>
      <p>
        If 55 percent prefer your cola under the name of Barfo, and 89 percent prefer it when the name is Ralpho, the name Ralpho may be presumed to be better than Barfo.

        <em>When should you test the name of a product, such as a cola drink or a software development methodology?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When the effect of the name on sale of the product is stronger than any other change you could imagine making to the product.
