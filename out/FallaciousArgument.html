        Fallacious Argument
      </h1>
      <p>
        An argument that sometimes fools human reasoning, but is not logically valid. It is crucial to remember that reasoning from definitions and facts to conclusions is fundamentally different from reasoning about definitions. Before you can scientifically establish whether or not Foo is a Bar, you have to establish the meaning of the label Bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        A given term is associated with one or more definitions and one or more concepts. A definition is correct when it accurately represents a chosen concept. Definitions can be more or less formal, the more formal the better. Concepts are not correct or incorrect, but merely useful.
