        Partitioning By Change Versus By Category
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> debates, I propose that likely <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a> should be the primary driver of code partitioning, and not categories, such as business logic versus display logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Category-based partitioning allegedly makes use of <a href="MentalIndexability.html">MentalIndexability</a> to help people find things. However, this may conflict with actual <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a>s to increase maintenance cost. Thus, if these two goals compete with each other, I recommend learning toward the change-management approach. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, categories are often vague, unknown, overlap, change, or are perceived differently by different people. Your head model of the universe may likely not match that of other people. Change patterns are more tied to reality. -t
