        I begin visit Wiki from 2000, I love this idea.

        I used java from 1998, and was ashamed that java.net use twiki as wiki engine and also I choose zwiki to be my tools.
        and wiki changed my life

        I look funny, but like some girl in my homeroom. I think her name is Jenny. If not, I'm probably gay. Check back with me later about this.
