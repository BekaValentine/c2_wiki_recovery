        Single Unified Build Script
      </h1>
      <p>
        You want to ensure that your <a href="BuildProcess.html">BuildProcess</a> is done in a consistent manner.  You don't want to require or can't enforce that developers to use the same editor or IDE.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintain a <a href="SingleUnifiedBuildScript.html">SingleUnifiedBuildScript</a>.  Use something like a makefile or a <a href="ApacheAnt.html">ApacheAnt</a> build script to have a common way of building the project.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        GNU projects all use <a href="AutoConf.html">AutoConf</a> and makefiles.  For UNIX types in general, this is is probably just an obvious thing.  Any well run <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> project will provide a <a href="SingleUnifiedBuildScript.html">SingleUnifiedBuildScript</a> due to the unenforceability of development environment issue.
