      <p>
        RISC OS (to give it its "official" capitalization) is the operating system that runs on the Acorn series of desktop computers such as the <a href="AcornArchimedes.html">AcornArchimedes</a>. It has also been used as the base for the Pace set-top box.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a feature rich, small (4MB) ROM based windowing or command-line operating system with a built-in scripting language. The scripting language is actually a BASIC (<a href="BbcBasic.html">BbcBasic</a>), but it has local variables, procedure and function calls, looping structures, arbitrary length variables, multi-line IF constructs, and CASE statements (equivalent to "switch"), so it doesn't look much like the BASIC you may remember. (Unless you remember, say, <a href="QuickBasic.html">QuickBasic</a> or <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>.) It also has direct access to operating system calls.
      </p>
      <p>
        RISC OS is a cooperative multi-tasking system that also has a light-weight message passing system.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's an absolute delight to use.

        You can now get <a href="RiscOs.html">RiscOs</a> to run virtually on Windows or the Mac. See <a href="http://virtualacorn.co.uk.">http://virtualacorn.co.uk.</a>

        It is also gaining popularity again as an alternative OS for the Raspberry Pi. See <a href="http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads.">http://www.raspberrypi.org/downloads.</a>
