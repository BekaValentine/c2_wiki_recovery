        I'm a Haskell programmer working for Starling Software in Tokyo:

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My previous jobs have included a couple of years with a consulting company, training a team (and a manager!) in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and building an enterprise application for a client, and a couple of years building a multilingual web site. Both jobs involved a lot of Java, though by the end I was getting rather annoyed with the limitations of the language. I shortly thereafter abandoned Java entirely for Ruby which, while much better for a good programmer, still has many limitations. These days I do as much as possible in <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>.

        I also contribute to <a href="NetBsd.html">NetBsd</a>. Most of my projects have used certain precepts of extreme programming, such as never checking in anything that doesn't build and run. Blink did a new release about once a week, and <a href="NetBsd.html">NetBsd</a>, whilst releasing relatively rarely, has many developers and users running `current' code (i.e., that at the head of the source tree), even on production systems.
