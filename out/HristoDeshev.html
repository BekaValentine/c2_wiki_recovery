           Relatively new to the IT industry - I started working as a programmer in 2000.  Graduated from university in December 2002.

        I started getting into <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> just before I graduated.  I've been doing some of code'n'fix before that.  Tried to delve into the <a href="SystemArchitect.html">SystemArchitect</a> mindset and did not like it at all.  I started looking at <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> as a way to make the software development a more disciplined, predictable, and enjoyable experience.  My initial focus was on <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, Refactoring and defect rate improvements.  I think my view on the software development process has changed significantly thanks to the <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a>

        I am a part of the effort of creating a Bulgarian <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> user group.  The group has a mailing list set up at yahoo groups - <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xp-bulgaria/.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xp-bulgaria/.</a>
