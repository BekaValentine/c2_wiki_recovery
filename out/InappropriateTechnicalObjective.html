        Inappropriate Technical Objective
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="InappropriateTechnicalObjective.html">InappropriateTechnicalObjective</a> is what a manager gives to a developer or a designer to pretend he knows about technical stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a manager parade to hide the lack of understanding of technical matters and a way to prove to the line management the manager is still able to manage his staff technically. Very often, the objective in itself is not applicable, irrelevant, or even dangerous or totally absurd.

        Samples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You must implement a <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a> in production for next year review. Cf. <a href="OverUseOfPatterns.html">OverUseOfPatterns</a> <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           You must use this technology once in a year and develop at least 3000 LOC in it.
        </li>
        <li>
           You have to use a particular middleware component delivered by the middleware team (even if it doesn't make any sense).
        </li>
