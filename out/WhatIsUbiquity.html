        What Is Ubiquity
      </h1>

        One of the strengths of wiki is its ubiquity.
        Wiki leverages the ubiquity of web browsers:
        most computers have web browsers,
        and  given a browser they can view and edit nearly 
        any wiki page on any wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What does it mean to be Ubiquitous?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, a ubiquitous facility will just work,
        on nearly any computer system of interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing special needs to be installed.
        (Or, if something needs to be installed,
        it can be installed transparently and automatically.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ubiquitous is not portable</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many portable systems, such as the portable 
        scripting language Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, as of the time I write this, most computers 
        do not have Ruby already installed. Therefore, Ruby is not
        ubiquitous.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or: Ruby may be ubiquitously portable.
        But it is not ubiquitously installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Relative Ubiquity</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ubiquity is never absolute.  It is relative to your problem
        domain or market.
      </p>
      <p>
        E.g. for my concerns, I am interested mainly in Linux 
        and Windows {2000,XP} running on x86 processors.
        A solution that is ubiquitous to these systems is
        good enough for me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>What is ubiquitous?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Web browsers are pretty much ubiquitous.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is ubiquitous in most modern web browsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java is not, unfortunately, ubiquitous.
        I wish it were.  But, e.g. at my place of work
        very few PCs have Java installed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is probably reasonable to say that Perl is ubiquitous
        on modern Linux systems, since it is preinstalled
        in most distributions.  Ditto Python.
        Ruby not really.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, none of these - Perl, Python, etc. -
        can be considered to be ubiquitously preinstalled on Windows
        systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Server based solutions are more likely to be ubiquitously usable
        without requiring anything to be installed on the client.
        All of the installation and configuration is done on the server;
        the client just has to use its web browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why do I care about Ubiquity?</strong>
