        <strong>What-If Inheritance</strong> means creating a hierarchy of abstract subclasses with a single concrete class at the bottom. The abstract classes usually break the behaviour along somewhat logical - though perhaps arbitrary - lines. An example might be:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a> <- Component <- ManifestComponent <- SharableComponent <- HardwareComponent
      </p>
      <p>
        Where only HardwareComponent is concrete. When pressed about why there are all these abstract classes, the usual answer is, "Well...<em>what if</em> someone wants to make a NonSharableComponent???"
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, this violates lots of common-sense (and XP) principles. <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>...SolveTheProblemAtHand...DontPredictTooFarInAdvance.

        I can see how this would make sense if you were in an environment where refactoring was difficult, expensive, or overly time-consuming. Then adding in the hypothetical classes early might make sense. Fortunately, we're not in that sort of environment. Refactoring is cheap, quick, and (if you have sufficient unit tests built in) easy. So we do it mercilessly. <g>

      <p>
        While I agree that <a href="WhatIfInheritance.html">WhatIfInheritance</a> violates lots of good principles that are currently en vogue, isn't it right in line with sort of the early object analysis and design philosophies?
      </p>
      <p>
        And (in a half-hearted attempt at devil's advocacy) is there any strength to the argument that you wanted to put in all those abstract classes as design clues to whoever is maintaining your code in the future?

        If you were making a library to be used by others, it could make a lot of sense.

        A related question is "Well...<em>what if</em> someone wants to <em>use</em> a NonSharableComponent???" In C++ and Java, that notion needs to be expressed in a class and that class inherited from explicitly. In Smalltalk, it's a non-issue. Hence in Smalltalk people tend not to bother with the NonSharableComponent class unless/until there is some code that belongs there. (If then. Often the code can go in the base class ManifestComponent and be just ignored by client code that doesn't need it.)
