        Top Down Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        A technique invented by John Wellum whereby there are nested levels of "control routines" such that the top level controls the large-scale behavior and the lower levels handle individual details. It reached its peak usage in the late '70s and early '80s, later replaced by <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> thinking and the influence of <a href="RelationalDatabases.html">RelationalDatabases</a> to create data-driven and <a href="EventDriven.html">EventDriven</a> control flow techniques instead.

        The book <em></em><a href="ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction.html">ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction</a><em>, by </em><a href="BertrandMeyer.html">BertrandMeyer</a>, contains a rather devastating critique of <a href="TopDownProgramming.html">TopDownProgramming</a>.  Meyer claims that it usually leads to software which is brittle, difficult to maintain, and difficult to extend.  (Of course, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> wrote a rather infamous criticism of Meyer's book...)

        <em>Meyer's error was that he made it appear that the only two options were OOP or top-down, as if all of procedural was heavy top-down. But that is a </em><a href="FalseDichotomy.html">FalseDichotomy</a>. It is roughly analogous to suggestions that I claim that all of OOP depends on hierarchies (which I did not). -- top<em></em>

        It could be argued that all sequence-based programming is top-down to some extent. The top-down-ness may be a matter of how dependent or independent each routine or module is.

        <em>I was taught top down programming at school, not so much as a technique but as one of several useful views of development.  Top down was emphasized, but bottom up and middle out were useful alternatives.</em>

        (<a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: Is there a significant difference between <a href="TopDown.html">TopDown</a>, <a href="TopDownDesign.html">TopDownDesign</a>, <a href="TopDownProgramming.html">TopDownProgramming</a> ? Or should they all be merged on one page, leaving the others as stubs pointing to that page ?)

      <p>
        <a href="TopDownDesign.html">TopDownDesign</a> and <a href="TopDownProgramming.html">TopDownProgramming</a> are not the same thing, although they are clearly related.  I think merging it all into <a href="TopDown.html">TopDown</a> would not be a bad idea.
