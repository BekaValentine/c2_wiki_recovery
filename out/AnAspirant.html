        An Aspirant
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is one of those silly personal pages that arguably don't really belong on the Wiki. Should there be any people interested in discussing the role of "an aspirant" along the lines of <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a> (etc.), can I suggest JustAnAspirant?

        <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a> is a signature, lying in some as-yet poorly defined area between a <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a> signature, a <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> and <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a>. As far as I'm aware, it's currently only used as a signature by one person (me).

        I'm just someone looking for the true path to happiness in programming. XP seems to be a contender, but I'm not yet convinced. "IWantToBelieve" would seem an appropriate summation of my current stance towards XP.

      <p>
        Why have I chosen to use a nickname? I'm not anyone you've heard of, and I'm sure that while my ideas are forming I'll say some pretty dumb-sounding things. It's a security blanket. I do want to be able to search the Wiki for things I've said though, so it's better than total anonymity.

        Duly noted. I'm nonetheless going to claim one of the special exceptions for the moment. As I feel more sure of myself on the Wiki, I will probably make attempts to discard aspects of my anonymity. Other than this foible, I have every intention of being a model wikizen.
      </p>
      <p>
        Incidentally, if anyone cares to point me at any other people's pages who have taken similar stances, or discussion of this issue from the point of view of others who believe in the use of nicknames, it would be appreciated. Currently, I can't see any way in which this stance is worse than signing myself as <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>. (<em></em><a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em> might be one example?)</em>

        <em>The distinction is between a </em><a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>, a disposable online handle, and a nickname. A DI should be used as the punchline to a given paragraph, not chronically. Online handles should not be used (per <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>) because they are disposable. They exist in <a href="ChatMode.html">ChatMode</a> fora to provide severability and role playing. A nickname, such as <a href="TaralDragon.html">TaralDragon</a>, that one has invested in full-time is not severable, and represents as much accountability as a real name. And "Phlip" is not a nickname, it's a contraction.<em> -- </em><a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        The important page seems to be <a href="RealNamesPleaseDiscussion.html">RealNamesPleaseDiscussion</a>. With some trepidation, I'm going to enter the fray.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I discussed, and was discussed, on </em><a href="RealNamesPleaseDiscussion.html">RealNamesPleaseDiscussion</a>, and some generous <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> added me to the list of 'exceptions to legal names' list. I might note that I'm against nicknames, since I don't consider mine to be one. The difference I see between signing as <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a> and signing as <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a> is that the latter is not an identity. Almost everybody is aware that <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a> is a 'signature that is not a signature' - a way of putting a signature on something (usually for formatting and clarity reasons) without claiming ownership. However, signing as <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a> is first of all moderately confusing - it sounds, as we discussed with <a href="BrianOneiromancer.html">BrianOneiromancer</a>, like an Extreme <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>, intended to represent a <strong>generic</strong> person learning about XP. This is at least briefly confusing. Second, once it's been explained that this is not the case, it still doesn't 'look real'. This is arbitrary and personal, but my personal observations regarding IRC and other nickname based systems suggest that when people lurk behind nicks, interpersonal relationships suffer. Nothing personal intended, of course - I'm sure you're great. =) -- <a href="TorneWuff.html">TorneWuff</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding the <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> aspect, that's partially the intent. When I started signing as <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a>, I hadn't properly realized it, but now I'm a bit more au fait with <a href="DramaticIdentities.html">DramaticIdentities</a>, I can be more explicit. Should anyone else wish to assume the <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> of <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a>, they should feel completely at liberty to do so. Should the contents of this page become a bit more stable, I'd be actually encouraging it. This would dilute the usefulness of <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a> as a unique marker for me to search for, but since I consider it a useful <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>, it's a small price to pay.
      </p>
      <p>
        It occurs to me that my ideas on this point are more than a little confused, since I also claimed on <a href="RealNamesPleaseDiscussion.html">RealNamesPleaseDiscussion</a> that I don't think of <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a> as a persona. I think I shall have to update that. It clearly is a persona, but I can't think of a situation in which I wouldn't want to adopt it. It's a description of who I am, or believe myself to be, or would want myself to be. A persona is pretty much how I would want others to see me, and I must admit that by signing myself off in that way, it's certainly that too. The name serves as a reminder. I may be a foolish seeker of unattainable goals, but at least I attempt to stay aware of that fact. The most obvious aspect of myself which differs from <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a> is that I tend to be a lot more argumentative in reality (no, really, it is possible). <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a> is also an attempt to keep that in check (although of course it has also led to me plunging into the thick of things).

        Well, this is all excellent - I'm learning already. Perhaps after going through more mental hoops I shall arrive at the same conclusion about all this that the rest of you have (i.e., use <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>s). Even if that does turn out to be the case, I'll be pleased to have these pages as a record of the reasoning behind that decision. Until then, I hope that other people will accept it as an experiment. Perhaps Wiki isn't the place for it, but it's all ideas, innit?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>One of those ideas is clarity. See the PrinceOfStories thread on </em><a href="RealNamesPleaseDiscussion.html">RealNamesPleaseDiscussion</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmmm, this page is already growing out of all proportion. Refactoring coming soon I think. Still, in the meantime, anyone want to voice their reactions to the above?

        Question for <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a>: if you're using this as a <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>, what role does it represent? Dramatic Identities such as any of the <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> or (in a specific context) <a href="ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation.html">ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation</a> <strong>add information</strong> to a comment. For example, signing with <a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a> shows the comment comes from a critical frame of mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        What frame of mind does <a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a> represent? What information does it add? Does using an easily confused <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>/<a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> hybrid add information to the wiki?
