        Programming Is For Trains
      </h1>
      <p>
        Having been a night owl since before I can remember, I really liked the suggestion that <a href="ProgrammingIsForNighttime.html">ProgrammingIsForNighttime</a>. Then I got a new job, where my schedule looks something like the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           6 - 7 a.m.: wake, shower and breakfast and prepare lunch, food for cat, coffee for spouse
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           7 - 9 a.m.: ten minute walk to hour and half train ride to twenty minute walk to office
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           9 a.m. - 6 p.m.: work at office
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           6 p.m. - 8 p.m.: twenty minute walk to hour and half train ride to ten minute walk to home
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           8 - 10 p.m.: eat supper, time with family, household duties
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           10 p.m. - 6 a.m.: ditto 8-10, prepare for bed, read a little, sleep
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nighttime? When's that?
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, new pattern: <a href="ProgrammingIsForTrains.html">ProgrammingIsForTrains</a>. Lock the programmer in a seat for over an hour, with pencil and paper, maybe a laptop, and nothing else but his or her thoughts. It encourages abstraction, since you usually can't carry your manuals (with a laptop, maybe online). You may be unable to test your programs; that encourages you to linger. Fewer distractions than the office: no phone, no e-mail, no Netnews, no Web. No useless meetings! (But no <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, either.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: creative thought doesn't come easily after intense aerobic exercise (such as sprinting twelve blocks).
      </p>
      <p>
        Complementary pattern: Writing Is For Trains. An hour and a half lasts a (single spaced) page or two, and seems to fly by. Don't have time for documentation? Here, here's three hours a day. Maybe you'll get some of that stuff written down. (Where do you think I wrote this?)
