        Started off not in the IT business at all, and was lucky enough to be offered a job by WDS around 5 years ago. Since then I can skip on a few years and say that I've been lucky enough to see how XP is done with the likes of <a href="OliBye.html">OliBye</a>, <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a> <a href="DafyddRees.html">DafyddRees</a> and <a href="RichardEmerson.html">RichardEmerson</a>. Since then, I moved across the company and started a small development team. Try as much as I can at the moment to fit in as much XP as I can (story boards, wiki, velocity) but alas, no stand up meetings (not easy having a stand up meeting and passing a "talk token" between just two!)

        Seems like I have taken on some legacy systems, but at least now I can choose the .net language I work in (opted for C#) and write some funky tests first. Been using <a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a> which is a great VS.NET plugin that uses nNunit as its engine, but is a dockable window, so it is just like using jUnit in Eclipse.

        The things I really miss from using Eclipse are the re-factoring tools, though another VS.NET plugin available at <a href="http://www.xtreme-simplicity.net/">http://www.xtreme-simplicity.net/</a> solves this (all but at a cost unfortunately) Though I see that the next VS.NET edition will have all these built in already. In fact as far as I remember, the refactoring menus practically mimic those of Eclipse.
