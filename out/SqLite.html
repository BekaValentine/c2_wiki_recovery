      <p>
        SQLite is a <a href="PublicDomain.html">PublicDomain</a> <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> library that implements an embeddable SQL database engine. Programs that link with the SQLite library can have SQL database access without running a separate RDBMS process. In that sense, it behaves more like a <a href="DesktopDatabase.html">DesktopDatabase</a> (minus the GUI).

        <strong>Linking SQLite to a C application</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: Does the fact that it is a C library mean that it would be easier to link a SQLite database to a C program than any other database?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A</strong>: Generally, yes, but their web page says that they also have wrappers to support linking to <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, and <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also often the case that language creators go out of their way to make sure that there is some way to link programs written in their language with C libraries/programs, precisely because C is the <a href="LinguaFranca.html">LinguaFranca</a> of portable libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failing to support such external linkage actively interfered with the adoption of languages such as <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> back in the 1980s.

        <strong>Record Handling capacity</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q</strong>: Can SQLite handle a great number of records?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A</strong>: Yes, no, and maybe, depending on what you think "a great number of records" means in the database world. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           thousand records is considered somewhat small in the database world, not "a great number". Non-database people think in different magnitudes than does the database world. Terabyte databases were considered large not <strong>that</strong> long ago, but these days it's gotten to the point where hundred terabyte databases are quite commonplace.
        </li>

        I've stored sqlite3 databases of over 8 gigs on disk, but vacuum seems to have stopped working after a couple gigs, so it's hard to say how big it really is.  Might have been that I ran out of disk space to create the copy, I don't recall.  You probably want to graduate to <a href="FireBird.html">FireBird</a> if you want to scale up that DB without requiring a RDBMS manager present (FB can operate as a library or server, not sure if the file formats are compatible though)

        <em>That is asking for too much in my opinion. Use </em><a href="PostgreSql.html">PostgreSql</a> or <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a> if you really need something that big. It reminds me of the expections of those who want MS-Access to scale like Oracle.<em></em>

        Tera is 10^12, mega is 10^6, so terabyte equals 10^6 (a million) megabytes, or if you prefer, one thousand gigabytes.
      </p>

        <em>Gummo, Atto, Zepto, and Yocto, the </em><a href="MarxBrothers.html">MarxBrothers</a> who did not go into the movies. :-)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are additional nitpicks on the subject. Computers like to number things in powers of two rather than ten, so you never know if "megabyte" really means 10^6 = 1,000,000 bytes, or whether someone actually means 2^20 = 1,048,576 bytes, but the two are only different by a few percent anyway. Salesmen pick whichever numbers are most impressive, and even engineers find it handy to pretend, for the purpose of approximation, that 2^10 equals exactly 1,000 and 2^20 equals exactly one million and 2^30 equals exactly one billion, etc. "Close enough for government work."

        <em>All of which is nothing more than a cop-out to manufacturers to excuse scrimping on space and overstating their capacities.  A byte is 8 bits, a word is 16 bits, a dword 32, etc.  Measuring bits and bytes in base 10 is </em>NotHelpful.  I have been known to slap people in the face whenever I see people writing that little "i" before the B.<em></em>
