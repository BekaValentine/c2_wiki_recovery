        Fusion Methodology
      </h1>
      <p>
        Fusion is a popular OOAD methodology within HP, though a little obscure outside it. The latest variety of the method is based on the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a>, and so may be a little more accessible than its predecessor, <a href="ClassicFusion.html">ClassicFusion</a>. An iterative intermediary is <a href="EvoFusion.html">EvoFusion</a>.

        The account of the 1997 OOPSLA session on Fusion
        found on the web, mentions the publication of a book 
        on Team Fusion:
      </p>
      <p>
        "...
        Derek Coleman is the co-author of Team Fusion:
        Object-Oriented Development using UML, and two previous
        books on Fusion			  ..."
      </p>
      <p>
        I can't find any references to this book - is the
        title correct? Has it been published yet?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Am I right in thinking this methodology is just another development strategy based on <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>?  
        On page 7 of the article by Todd Cotton quotes Ould stating:
        "The success of the incremental delivery approach rests on the ability of the designer to create--from the start--an architecture that can support the full functionality of the system so that there is not a point during the sequence of deliveries where the addition of the next increment of functionality requires a massive re-engineering of the system at the architectural level."  
      </p>
      <p>
        Doesn't this imply that the users understand what functionality they will want to implement years down the road?
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="FusionMethodology.html">FusionMethodology</a> incorporates user feedback at multiple places, which is a good idea.  But how does the methodology cope when new user functionality comes in that is not supported by our 'Object Model'?  
      </p>
      <p>
        Where does maintenance of the code come into play with this methodology?
        <a href="MaintenanceAndMethodologies.html">MaintenanceAndMethodologies</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens if I have a need to refactor the code at some point in the future?  Do we need to do a <a href="BigBangTesting.html">BigBangTesting</a> effort?
      </p>
      <p>
        --<a href="FrancisTownsend.html">FrancisTownsend</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as "choosing the right architecture up front" goes, what do the other 
        methodologies do? What happens if XPers pick an inappropriate <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Potential for automated testing</strong>  The analysis phase of <a href="ClassicFusion.html">ClassicFusion</a> does deliver a grammar of "allowed events". Substrings in this grammar specify individual "system operations". Each system operation has pre and post conditions, and a summary of the expected state changes. I think this has some potential for an automated testing tool. (See <a href="VerifyOutputWithGrammar.html">VerifyOutputWithGrammar</a> for an example of one of these grammars.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Weaknesses</strong> The main weakness of <a href="ClassicFusion.html">ClassicFusion</a> is the lack of mechanisms for describing concurrency. Newer versions of this methodology (<a href="TeamFusion.html">TeamFusion</a> or whatever its called today) introduced stages for explicit consideration of software architecture, and optional sub-stages for database and GUI design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Simplicity of </strong><a href="ClassicFusion.html">ClassicFusion</a><strong> This is the sort of methodology I'd use to teach beginners OOA/OOD, because the method is straightforward and the book is small. There aren't a lot of potentially confusing options or process patterns in </strong><a href="ClassicFusion.html">ClassicFusion</a> - that will help beginners.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>(What no) Discussion?</strong>  There doesn't seem to be much discussion of Fusion on the web/maillist these days. Where have all the Fusion people gone? (Perhaps there's a much better Fusion website on the HP intranet.)

        I worked on a couple of projects using a somewhat modified <a href="EvoFusion.html">EvoFusion</a>. One was a training project of medium size and was a Resources Control System for the Lab we were working for (about 4 techs in a 30+ group of archaeologists). We didn't actually code anything (except some skeletons for the Communications Cycle). My impression of it (and I also took the role of 'secretary') is that the amount of documentation it requires is too much. It almost took me half a day every day to keep the System Dictionary, Class Diagram, Use Cases, schemata, &c up-to-date with the new entities that appeared after Analysis, Design, and started low level analysis of the first cycle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unitary cycles were about the size of XP ones, but complete cycles <em>ready-for-delivery</em> were about 2 or 3 months, which now looks like a way-too-long time (not enough feedback) but then (a couple of years ago) looked much better than up-front "classical" way of doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other project was bigger, a Control System of Cultural Heritage for our State (well, that would be the spanish equivalent). Feedback with users was important we had a kind of mini-magazine with news, report of advancement and tests, questions to be answered, &c... about weekly. Cycles were of 3 weeks but, again, delivery was longer, about 7 or 9 weeks (if I remember well). No pair programming, and (some) customers (specially managers) were pretty angry because our Requisites Capture phase was too disrupting for their work... so I guess asking for an Expert to be in-site for XP would have been hard... Didn't know how it ended, as I moved just after architecture was pretty much wrapped up and before starting the first coding cycle...
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, <a href="EvoFusion.html">EvoFusion</a> seems much more <em>realistic</em> and concerned with customers' needs than other methodologies, but still it kind of has that <em>static</em> nature... changes that could easily be imported to the design can be easily inserted in between cycles, but if you have to change something important... I don't think it's that much flexible...
      </p>
      <p>
        And that's right, system operations could really be used for automated testing, but as our <em>coach</em> discarded the schemata (documentatio takes too long), we lost the motivation for very low level testing...
      </p>
