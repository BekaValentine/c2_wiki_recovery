        Top Ten Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've always felt that Top 10 lists weren't a good idea for web sites because they tend to self-preserve themselves. Everyone reads the top 10 sites so those sites get the most hits and end up staying on top 10... $0.02.

        I find it a bit disturbing that <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and the five or so newest pages seem to be on <a href="TopTen.html">TopTen</a> continuously.

        I think the last 2,000 hits is too small of a sample. None of the real pages have more than 20 hits. Maybe 10,000 would yield more interesting results? -- <a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a>

        <em>I'd like to know the time period for which the log is sampled. There is a starting time given at the beginning of the page, but what kind of time is this: universal or local, and if local, then which zone?</em>

      <p>
        Why not reveal the <em>bottom</em> ten, as measured over a long period? Might indicate what needs some dusting off. -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a>

      <p>
        Or better yet, the <em>oldest</em> ten, measured by the last time they were { edited | read }.  (See <a href="AncientChanges.html">AncientChanges</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Having a list of the BottomTen pages would be a great feature. While a <a href="TopTen.html">TopTen</a> is self-preserving (not just on websites, either - how about PopCharts?), a BottomTen would be changing constantly, since people would be checking out the BottomTen, thus removing them from the list. -- <a href="AalbertTorsius.html">AalbertTorsius</a>

        I like this idea, but for a possibly different reason. A list of all <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s sorted from least recently edited at the top would be an interesting view of "core" Wiki.
