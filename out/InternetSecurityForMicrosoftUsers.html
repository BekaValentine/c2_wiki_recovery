        <a href="InternetSecurityForMicrosoftUsers.html">InternetSecurityForMicrosoftUsers</a> is a page focussed on improving security (allow legitimate access and reduce exposure to <a href="SocialEngineering.html">SocialEngineering</a> and other scams).

        I believe the IT community is not immune to being victimized, as indicated by various reports in the press in the past (e.g. within Microsoft many employee SQLserver DB were affected by a worm, months after the patch was released).

           <em>Yes it is both incomplete and will be out-of-date.</em> However as said in the beginning, lots of PC have not been patched months after exposure identified, so there is still value in listing the more serious (common and intense) exposures as these are identified and solutions found.

        this is the latest version of security update, the "September 2003, Worm.Automat.AHB" update which eliminates all known security options on your MS Windows platform. It turns your computer into an SMTP server, scans your memory and drives for e-mail addresses, and sends itself to all of them. Then it takes a whack at your IRC, Kaazen, and your shared network drives.
      </p>
      <p>
        It foils and mangles its headers each time to fool the less robust spam filters. Put another way, it installs a decade of spam technology to broadcast its malicious executable.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are stupid enough to think that MS would e-mail security patches, then you will not suffer as much as your electronic contacts, whose mail boxes will fill up with 1-10 copies of the "security patch" per minute.
      </p>

           years after the "I love you" worm, MS's installed user base can <em>still</em> be relied upon to double-click anything in their mails that looks harmless or official. And <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> can still be relied upon to never close the simple loopholes in their systems.

        I've always wondered why someone doesn't just write a worm/virus that exploits security holes such that it installs the patch for the security hole. Kind of like a vaccination.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="AmigaComputer.html">AmigaComputer</a> had one, but the leading virus scanners clobbered it for you anyway...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They tried that for SoBig.  Aside from the ethics of such an act, the 'patch' ended up consuming more network resources than the virus.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or so said the </em>AntiVirus industry. Biased?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Possibly, but also correct in that the anti-worm at least did some damage. It is believed that Welchia was the virus responsible for crashing the State Department's electronic system for checking every visa applicant for terrorist or criminal history.
      </p>

        Anyone have information on Secure Agent (CSA), a rebranded product from Okena acquired by Cisco? MS is claimed to use this as a dayzero attack prevention mechanism.
