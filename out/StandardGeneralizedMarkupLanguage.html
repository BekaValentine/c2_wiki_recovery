        <dd>SGML (Standard Generalized Markup Language) - The ISO 8879 standard developed in 1986 to assist electronic delivery and publication of text-based documents. Classified under `Information processing - Text and office systems'. Developed and maintained by the ISO/IEC JTC1 SC18/ WG8 committee. </dd>

        <dd>SGML is an international standard for the description of marked-up electronic text. More exactly, SGML is a metalanguage, that is, a means of formally describing a language, in this case, a markup language. </dd>

        Might also stand for "Sounds Good, Maybe Later", a joke referring to SGML's intimidating complexity.

        Try the <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> (XML), which is less complicated. XML was originally intended to be a 'simplification' of SGML (80% of the power with 20% of the complexity).
