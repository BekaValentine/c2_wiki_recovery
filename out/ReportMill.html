      <p>
        It is great to build reports that use objects as datasource (you can bind report elements to objects, or methods in objects) so it is a great option if you are using an <a href="ObjectRelationalMapper.html">ObjectRelationalMapper</a> to get the information from the database. 
        AFAIK until recently <a href="ReportMill.html">ReportMill</a> was the only ReportingTool that was designed to make it easy to use objects as the datasource for reports.
