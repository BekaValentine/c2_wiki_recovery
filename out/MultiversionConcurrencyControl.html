        Multiversion Concurrency Control
      </h1>
      <p>
        An advanced way of designing a database concurrency control system, invented by <a href="JimStarkey.html">JimStarkey</a> (who now works at <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a> completing a new OLTP storage engine, Falcon).
      </p>
      <p>
        Each transaction is granted a consistent view of the data from transaction begin, and the database will use old "versions" of the data to ensure your isolation level is attained without locking the data.  This way readers will not block writers and writers will not block readers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This is sometimes used in combination with <a href="OptimisticConcurrency.html">OptimisticConcurrency</a> control, where a field-call checks whether a transaction has conflicted with the current one.  Since there are no locks, the transaction would have to be aborted & retried (or in the case of Oracle, one could commit the work completed thus far, as the exception would be thrown at statement-execution time.)
      </p>

        <strong>Known implementations:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> and <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> implement this through disk-based garbage collection and comparing read & write object sets for each transaction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Does </em><a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> really do this?  I used it before and don't recall it having the same locking model as <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An <a href="OracleDatabase.html">OracleDatabase</a> implements this through using the rollback-segment and keeping a recent transaction interest history in each block (the INITRANS and MAXTRANS parameters).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PostgreSql.html">PostgreSql</a> is a log-based storage model, so it can query prior data versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oracle and <a href="InterBase.html">InterBase</a> implement MVCC, as does the the InnoDB table type in <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AxionDatabase.html">AxionDatabase</a> does this with something like a rollback-segment.
