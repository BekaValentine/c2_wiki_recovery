        <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> (<a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/directX/htm/directshow.asp),">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/directx9_c/directX/htm/directshow.asp),</a> formerly Active Movie, is a component of the Microsoft DirectX 8+ (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/)">http://www.microsoft.com/directx/)</a> family of multi-media APIs.

        It is characterized by streams of data that are represented and controlled by a graph of data filters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Filters can have input and output "pins" that permit their interconnection. Pins are typed so that only legal interconnections are permitted.
      </p>
      <p>
        A filter graph may represent data moving through memory, data moving through hardware, or a combination of the two.

        <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> is closely associated with the new WindowsDriverModel (WDM) supported in Windows98 and WindowsNT 5.0.

        Q: In earlier versions of DirectX, I had to install DirectX Media. Do I still need it?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: No, not with DirectX 9.0. The key part of DirectX Media for video capture, Microsoft <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a>(R), has been integrated into DirectX.

        Some resources for developers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           For ones starting out, play around with the graphedit utility.  You won't learn any programming, but you'll learn how filter graphs work - which are by far the most complicated (i.e. convoluted) part of DS.
        </li>
        <li>
           Look at the DirectShowEncoder sample over at <a href="CodeProject.html">CodeProject</a>.com
        </li>
        <li>
           Pay close attention to the asyncfilter sample in the latest directx sdk and the way it renders the memory
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An interesting tidbit is that most of the API still has ActiveMovie remnants around it (AMMediaStream, AM_TRUE etc.).
