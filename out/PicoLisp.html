      <p>
        <a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a> can be viewed from two different aspects: As a general purpose
        programming language, and a dedicated application server framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) As a programming language, <a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a> provides a 1-to-1 mapping of a clean
        and powerful <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> derivate, to a simple and efficient virtual machine. It
        supports persistent objects as a first class data type, resulting in a database
        system of Entity/Relation classes and a <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a>-like query language tightly
        integrated into the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        The virtual machine was designed to be
      </p>
      <code>
        Simple<br/>
        The internal data structure should be as simple as possible. Only one<br/>
        single data structure is used to build all higher level constructs.<br/>
        Unlimited<br/>
        There are no limits imposed upon the language due to limitations of the<br/>
        virtual machine architecture. That is, there is no upper bound in symbol<br/>
        name length, number digit counts, or data structure and buffer sizes,<br/>
        except for the total memory size of the host machine.<br/>
        Dynamic<br/>
        Behavior should be as dynamic as possible ("run"-time vs. "compile"-time).<br/>
        All decisions are delayed till runtime where possible. This involves<br/>
        matters like memory management, dynamic symbol binding, and late method<br/>
        binding.<br/>
        Practical<br/>
        <a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a> is not just a toy of theoretical value. <a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a> is used since<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
           in actual application development, research and production.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The language inherits the major advantages of classical Lisp systems like
      </p>
      <code>
        - Dynamic data types and structures<br/>
        - Formal equivalence of code and data<br/>
        - Functional programming style<br/>
        - An interactive environment<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a> is very different from any other Lisp dialect. This is partly due to
        the above design principles, and partly due to its long development history
        since 1984.

        You can download the latest release version at <a href="http://software-lab.de/down.html.">http://software-lab.de/down.html.</a> It is also available in <a href="DebianLinux.html">DebianLinux</a> - apt-get install picolisp
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) As an application server framework, <a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a> provides for
      </p>
      <code>
        NoSQL Database Management<br/>
        Index trees<br/>
        Object local indexes<br/>
        Entity/Relation classes<br/>
        Pilog (<a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a> Prolog) queries<br/>
        Multi-user synchronization<br/>
        DB Garbage collection<br/>
        Journaling, Replication<br/>
        User Interface<br/>
        Browser GUI<br/>
        (X)HTML/CSS<br/>
        XMLHttpRequest/<a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a><br/>
        Application Server<br/>
        Process management<br/>
        Process family communication<br/>
        XML I/O<br/>
        Import/export<br/>
        User administration<br/>
        Internationalization<br/>
        Security<br/>
        Object linkage<br/>
        Postscript/Printing<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <a href="PicoLisp.html">PicoLisp</a> is not an IDE. All program development in Software Lab. is done using
        the console, bash, vim and the Lisp interpreter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only type of GUI supported for applications is through a browser via HTML.
        This makes the client side completely platform independent. The GUI is created
        dynamically. Though it uses <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and XMLHttpRequest for speed
        improvements, it is fully functional also without <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> or CSS.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GUI is deeply integrated with - and generated dynamically from - the
        application's data model. Because the application logic runs on the server,
        multiple users can view and modify the same database object without conflicts,
        everyone seeing changes done by other users on her screen immediately due to the
        internal process and database synchronization.

        It compiles and runs on current 32-bit GNU/Linux, FreeBSD, Mac OS X (Darwin),
        Cygwin/Win32 (and possibly other) systems. A native 64-bit version is available
        for x86-64/Linux, x86-64/FreeBSD, x86-64/SunOS and ppc64/Linux. The 64 bit versions have support for CoRoutines.
