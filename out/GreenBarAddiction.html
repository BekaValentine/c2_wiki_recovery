        Green Bar Addiction
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="GreenBarAddiction.html">GreenBarAddiction</a> is that driving need an extreme programmer has to see that <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> progress bar turn from red to green.  Ahhhh, the satisfaction of that green bar!
      </p>

        If the bar is green the code is clean. (Said to the cadence of "When the light is green the trap is clean." from <em></em>GhostBusters<em>) -- </em><a href="ErikMeade.html">ErikMeade</a>

        Alternatively, the green bar poses the question: "What did I forget to test?" -- <a href="DaveWhipp.html">DaveWhipp</a>

        I have recently been experimenting with JUnit and Idea under <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, and I was getting a blue bar, rather than a green one. Having previously read Wiki pages such as this, I was quite disappointed. What was I doing wrong? -- <a href="RobertAtkins.html">RobertAtkins</a>

        Yes, this is an outrage. What is the point of pressing run if you can't get a green bar? This must be due to some ill considered abiding to some UI standard. We must organize and protest. Save the green bar!

        I don't get the <a href="GreenBarAddiction.html">GreenBarAddiction</a>... all it does is encourage me to write simpler and fewer unit tests. God forbid that I should write a hard test and have to live with a <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a> for a while. I have <a href="RedBarAddiction.html">RedBarAddiction</a>. -- <a href="JohnFarrell.html">JohnFarrell</a>
