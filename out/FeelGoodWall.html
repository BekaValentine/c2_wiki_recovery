        Hey Top,
      </p>
      <p>
        While I was pondering the inner nature of Lisp yet again the other day, I was moved to think of you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like many non-<a href="SmugLispWeenies.html">SmugLispWeenies</a>, you think (if I understand your many comments over time correctly) that the single most important defining feature of Lisp is that it's all (primarily) about lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have often said "but...but...but...you don't grok Lisp, please don't think you do" -- which is not particularly instructive, even if true.
      </p>
      <p>
        It occurs to me that what I <strong>should</strong> tell you is that, in a very real sense, lists are <strong>not</strong> the fundamental point of Lisp, especially in regard to modern Lisp(s), rather it truly is founded on lambda functions -- which in Lisp could be called "merely" unnamed functions -- but that's misleading, because lambda functions are different in several ways than functions in most widely used languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        This came to mind because I was re-reading, yet again, <a href="LispInSmallPieces.html">LispInSmallPieces</a>, which explains Lisp semantics by showing many, many, many approaches to defining various aspects of Lisp -- in Lisp -- and typically each different approach/feature involves yet another brilliantly quirky inventive use of lambda functions (or alternately, if you grok lambda functions well enough, each different use is all actually just a simple variation on a theme).
      </p>
      <p>
        You have to actually drink the Kool-Aid to understand all of this stuff; the code is typically <strong>very</strong> short, but makes absolutely no sense until you've grokked a certain essence to this whole cultish subject.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I was thinking, for the 100th time, "Lisp is brilliant, because you can do <strong>anything</strong>, unlike pretty much all other languages", and then went on to "...but it's also crazy, because some of these things are like building the Eiffel tower out of toothpicks -- and also showing that it can be done with only 30 toothpicks, but <strong>man</strong>, do you have to understand the toothpicks well to do so." :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        And those toothpicks really are lambda functions, not lists (which actually just boil down to more lambda functions, but skip that).
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that doesn't directly educate you about the inner nature of lambda functions, but still, I thought it was worth stressing the point: <strong>not lists</strong>. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am afraid we have reached another <a href="FeelGoodWall.html">FeelGoodWall</a>. Further, different people will paint different aspects of Lisp as the key. Typical claim keys include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Simple, consistent syntax
        </li>
        <li>
           Difference between data structure (nested lists) and code is blurred to make them interchangeable.
        </li>
        <li>
           FP techniques (including HOF, etc.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In all the debates in all the different subject areas I have debated about, it is frustrating to repeatedly run into the "feel good wall". This is where somebody loves a technology/paradigm/technique ("tool" for short), but for the life of them cannot demonstrate the grand ability of the tool in any objectively or even semi-objectively measurable fashion.  I bang my head against the wall trying to figure out what to do about this because it just plugs up the discussion like gum in a pipe.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Just try it for 5 years until it clicks and then you will love it" does not scale because there are too many alleged <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>s. One would have to live a long time to even try a fraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have a solution, but wish to give the concept a name to refer to for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        --top
      </p>
      <p>
        However, "I'll try it for 5 years and make $50million" <em>does</em> scale, assuming you can actually pull it off.  If you fail, then maybe your <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> wasn't so golden after all.  If you succeed, you can bet that there will several other people who would also like $50million.  Even if there aren't, who cares?  You've got your $50million.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of the recent success of Lisp, Python, and Ruby is due to precisely this effect, in the form of ViaWeb, Google, and 37signals, respectively.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        Well, I was like, all relaxed, and thinking out loud, and feeling neighborly, and thought I'd share some partial thoughts with you, so I took the above shot at that...
      </p>
      <p>
        What I am hearing back from you in response to that is, well, not nasty flames or anything, but hardly a response in kind; I am disappointed, and sorry that I took the effort, and am in general feeling considerably less good-will towards you, after your response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a small thing like that is all it takes to convert one more person, one way or the other. It's not like I haven't been trying, for some years, despite your large anti-fan club, and despite a general appearance that you may not be interested in life-long learning. -- Doug

        <em>I am not sure what you had in mind. I was hoping to at least trigger a discussion about what other Lisp fans fealt the most important aspect of Lisp was (perhaps like </em><a href="OoBestFeaturePoll.html">OoBestFeaturePoll</a>), and also maybe encourage something fairly concrete to compare. I did not set out to dissapoint. I am as frustrated as anybody here by the difficulty in transferring preference reasons between Wikizens. That kind of reoccuring difficulty is a larger problem than just you and me. --top<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure it is, in the overall scheme of things, but what's this "I was hoping to at least trigger a discussion"??? To remind you, ***<strong>I</strong>* left a note on your home page, and you responded with this page. You didn't initiate this, I did, and I am extremely disappointed with your response to my casual and friendly comments. -- Doug
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you mean it appears I changed topics? In my mind I was trying to focus it toward areas that are more, well, measurable. I am not a verbal person and don't communicate very well verbally IMO. I like examples and scenarios to compare and communicate. No harm was meant. -- Top
      </p>
      <p>
        I more or less apologized for not giving examples and scenarios.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding that, I offered you a thought -- a hand-wavey thought from your point of view, I quite understand, and acknowledged at the time, and your response is now to take a poll (<a href="LispBestFeaturePoll.html">LispBestFeaturePoll</a>) on who thinks which features of Lisp are great? That is just rude. I offered you, a non-Lisper, a possible insight, and your response is to reject it out of hand and ask other people if they agree or if they think something else about Lisp is important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing that both misses my point, misses my meta-point, and is really quite rude. If I tell you that the important thing about a book like Candide is to understand it as a criticism of other thoughts of the day, well, I may be right and I may be wrong, but if you have not studied Candide, Voltaire, and the era, and want to make up for it by taking a poll, that's just preposterous, and rude.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't insist that you study the subject more, I merely offered you a completely free-of-charge thought on the subject. -- Doug
      </p>
      <p>
        It is simple curiosity, not intended rudeness. Your statement raised the question in my mind, so I used wiki to ask. I guessed I hoped that you would be interested in that question also. However, it was interpreted as rudeness it now seems. Maybe compare me to the rain; rain does not rain down on you because it is rude, but simply because that is what rain does. If I purposely set out to be rude to you, there would be no mistaking it. --top
      </p>
      <p>
        You're being disingenuous. I offered you a personal opinion about something about Lisp that I thought you should change your mind about (not about Lisp being good, but that Lambda is more important than List). You have not responded directly <strong>AT ALL</strong> to what I said to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have, however, responded highly indirectly, by creating these two pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am telling you, I take offense to your lack of direct response combined with your indirect responses...and note, I am not being purposefully rude to you, but just as with you said, if I do, there will be no mistaking it, and your provocation continues. What, do you <strong>want</strong> me to flame you? -- Doug
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, I tried to think directly about your suggestion while stuck in traffic. I do have a question: If it's the lambda's, then what about other languages that have lambda's? Is it Lisp lambda's, or lambda's in general? Lisp's syntax approach is pretty unique to Lisp, but not Lambda's. --top
      </p>
      <p>
        Lisp's syntax has certain advantages and certain disadvantages, but that is, to my mind, a slightly different subject. Any language that 100% supports Lisp style lambda -- <strong>that</strong> is the point, regardless of syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not familiar with Dylan, which they say is Lisp with non-Lisp syntax (IIRC it had pascal-style syntax), but if it supported full-fledged Lisp-style lambdas (which again, IIRC, it may have), then yes, that's the point, and good enough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does that answer your question sufficiently? -- DOug
