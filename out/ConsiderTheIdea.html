        So I'm in a building. Nearby a shot rings out. The macaw next to me squawks: "Duck!".

        A much better notion might be to consider all opinions, regardless of source. See whether they hang together, see whether they are looking at forces you have ignored. See whether, even in their abject stupidity, they give you a better idea.

        This seems painfully inefficient to me. As an extreme example, it's like letting the 1000 monkeys bang away at typewriters, and saying 'There might be something good coming out of that.' Sure, there might be, but time and attention are finite, so you're better off having some kinds of filters.
