        Quality Of Life
      </h1>
      <p>
        Good Quality of Life is the enjoyment of what you are spending your time on while still meeting your basic needs (food, clothing, shelter, companionship, etc.). Generally the rule of five positive experiences to one negative experience will result in the perception of enjoyment of an activity. Therefore, if you can perceive more events to be positive events, you can increase your overall enjoyment of an activity and improve your Quality of Life.
