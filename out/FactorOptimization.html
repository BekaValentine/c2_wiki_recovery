        Factor Optimization

        Quoted here <em>not</em> to plug '<a href="OptimizeLater.html">OptimizeLater</a>', rather as an illustration that optimization is or can be a separate design task.

      <p>
        The page <a href="OptimizationPattern.html">OptimizationPattern</a> and <a href="CategoryOptimization.html">CategoryOptimization</a> give some methods for optimizing. What I am looking for is how to factor out optimization. If in <a href="CategoryCpp.html">CategoryCpp</a>, we'd be looking for a class that captures the optimization decisions. We can't do that in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. -- <a href="JamesCrook.html">JamesCrook</a>

        <strong>Observation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        'Simple' optimisations are done automagically by compilers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Complex optimisations often require radical rework of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimisation is not currently as useful a 'factor' as it could be. Implementation languages let us down.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>More Detail</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Orthodox computer languages lack a flexible way to specify optimisations orthogonally to the actual code. Ability to specify functions as 'inline' and compiler switches such as optimise for speed/space are the only two examples that spring to mind. Until compilers expose their optimisation techniques to users better, it will be very hard to implement optimisation as a factor.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>However</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In design documentation, optimizations can (and should?) be design topics in their own right. You can understand the purpose and structure of a program without understanding the details of optimization choices that have been made and vice versa. If designers routinely treat optimization as a design topic, language designers will in time follow up with language support.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How this could work</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are at least two optimizations which have very widespread applicability:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Adding a cache -- <a href="FactorCache.html">FactorCache</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Adding constancy hints -- <a href="FactorConstancy.html">FactorConstancy</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With language support for these factors, optimization could more easily be a design task independent of the main design.
