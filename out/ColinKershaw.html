        I am an independent consultant who takes on the roles of software developer, architect, and process mentor. I create and test large-scale enterprise applications using Agile methodologies with both .NET and J2EE technologies. I'm passionate about test-driven development, continuous integration, automation, and communication. Prior to graduating with Honours from the Object Oriented Software Engineering program at SAIT, I received a Bachelor of Arts from the University of Calgary.

        Currently, I am consulting at a national telco in Calgary, Alberta, Canada. Prior to returning to Calgary and independent consulting, I worked for <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a> where I did stints in India and Chicago at several Fortune 100 clients.

        The best book I've found for what I've been doing lately is <a href="WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode.html">WorkingEffectivelyWithLegacyCode</a> by <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a> - it's a great catalogue of dependency-breaking techniques to start down the road of getting code without tests into a test harness. I would highly recommend checking it out.

        Colin's a great guy to work with. He's as nutty as his hair is long. -- <a href="DustinAleksiuk.html">DustinAleksiuk</a>
