        Frank Adrian
      </h1>
      <p>
        Frank Adrian has been designing software for quite a while.
        He has worked at companies such as Tektronix, <a href="MentorGraphics.html">MentorGraphics</a>, <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a>, the <a href="FirstDataBank.html">FirstDataBank</a> division of TheHearstCorporation, and Symantec working as an individual contributor and in technical leadership and/or management roles.  All of this means he manages, mentors, and generally tries to stay out of the way of several people who do actual work.
      </p>
      <p>
        His current interests include application of patterns to the software design process and, in particular, testing, as well as looking for meta-patterns in the design patterns currently being published.
