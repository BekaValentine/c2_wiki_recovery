        Exception Handling Challenge
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are those who like to <a href="AvoidExceptionsWheneverPossible.html">AvoidExceptionsWheneverPossible</a>. There are others who hate this attitude. Let's try to depolarize the discussion with some code.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="ExtremeProgrammingInPractice.html">ExtremeProgrammingInPractice</a>, we see the following algorithm:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Try to add a new user to the database, and email them their new password. If either of the above steps fail, redirect the user to a web page explaining what happened. Also, if the emailing fails, delete the user from the database.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>Before jumping to solutions let's observe that the above is not an algorithm, it is a specification of a requirement (business rule), probably a </em><a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> or half of it in XP jargon.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Second, the specification is not well-defined. Within the scope of a single interaction with the user (it's talking about redirecting the user to an error page), these things absolutely cannot be accomplished: you cannot make a transaction of the first two actions (inserting into the database and sending an email), and you cannot reliably detect if the email failed in such a short time span (it may take hours or even days); even if it fails, it's hard to make sure that the user is deleted because then the delete must fail.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        {Monitoring returned/bounced emails would generally be a separate operation.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What is needed here is a workflow scenario, not a transaction scenario, which will render the problem of how to handle exceptions moot. Further clarifications are welcome. Hopefully, it's not another typical book/toy example that doesn't have any relation to reality and encourages sloppy thinking in software practice.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why not put the explanation page up anyway, but have a link to click in the email that confirms and actually initiates the account?... which would make this a definite 'state machine' type situation... but no one seems to have voted for that yet... oh well, the road less travelled by... -- <a href="BillWeston.html">BillWeston</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The requirements, though reasonable, are more complicated than any exception-handling situation I've come across in four years of Java coding. A simple try...catch...finally construct almost always suffices, but not in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isn't this the case of a long running transaction? I wouldn't attempt this with simple exception handling, like try-catch-finally. -- LuizEsmiralha

      <p>
        <strong>Cons:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you're not used to reading try/catch blocks, the normal code looks obscured by the indentation, as if it were incidental. (See <a href="IlluminateTheMainline.html">IlluminateTheMainline</a>.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Could be shorter still.
        </li>
        <li>
           Requires exception handling support from the language - thus is not usable in languages without that support.
        </li>
        <li>
           Requires several reserved keywords ('try', 'catch', 'finally', 'throw'), polluting the identifier namespace.
        </li>
        <li>
           Forcefully breaks encapsulation by requiring client code to know what exceptions called code might raise without an explicit way of describing those exceptions. (Java does have a way, but it uses unusual syntax and another reserved word)
        </li>
        <li>
           If the called code changes, and raises a different exception, this will force a change in the catch group. Therefore the Throw/Catch technique causes coupling.
        </li>
        <li>
           The catch groups suffers from <a href="SwitchStatementsSmell.html">SwitchStatementsSmell</a>, as described below.
        </li>
        <li>
           There is no guarantee that exceptions are handled correctly, or at all (i.e. do-nothing catch block).
        </li>
        <li>
           A given function or method using a try/catch/finally block must not only perform its duty but also handle any exceptions in doing so. This decreases cohesion within that function or method.
        </li>
        <li>
           As the try block may contain more than one statement, it is possible for different statements to raise the same error classes for different reasons. Thus one reason can 'mask' another. This exacerbates the debugging process as the person debugging is quite likely to try to fix the more obvious cause of the exception. E.g. if the mailPassword() step recorded the email in the database but the email table has some problem, then we may end up redirecting to 'addfailure' even though the user has been added. So in fact, this ordinary looking example is itself a potential source of difficult to fix errors thanks to the 'try' block.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>How is it obvious that the DatabaseFailure exception is emitted from UserDatabase.add(), and that EmailFailure is emitted from mailPassword()? Is it not better style to wrap each potentially throwing function call in its own try/catch block? In this case, how is Throw/Catch Exceptions any better than testing error codes?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless both methods throw the same exceptions you don't need separate try/catch blocks for each call. Is this what you mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think that the question is - how can the reader tell which calls might throw which exceptions? The example is (reasonably) clear, but I recently worked on code that had one try block with about 5 catches, and eleven function calls inside the try(); each function would throw exceptions on failure cases. During initial testing (not </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing, alas), I was hard pressed to find which function was failing, because the exception names were not immediately relatable to the calls that threw them, and the log statements were subclassed so that I had to search header files to find what was failing. Not the best way to make it easy to track the errors down.<em> -- </em><a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The caller should not need to know which call throw the exceptions, because exceptions should describe <strong>why</strong> things failed, not <strong>what</strong> thing failed (e.g., FileNotFoundException vs CannotReadConfigFileException. I have seen codes that throws ConstructionException from constructors, the only way to handle those is to dump the error and exit, since you never know why it failed to recover). If you really need to know which call failed to properly handle the error, put them in separate try-blocks. If you only need to know to debug it, look at the stack trace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you use </em><a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a>, turn on "Mark Occurrences" in the Java editor preferences. Then put your cursor on an exception named in a catch clause.  Every method in the try block that can throw that exception will be highlighted.<em></em>

      <code>
        NewUserNotifier notifier = new NewUserNotifier(user);<br/>
        notifier.useDatabase(userDatabase);<br/>
        notifier.attemptToAddUser();<br/>
        notifier.sendPasswordEmail();<br/>
        notifier.handlePendingIssues();<br/>
        notifier.redirectWebPage();<br/>
        delete notifier;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A variation of the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> example, where the notifier maintains its state via a <a href="StrategyPattern.html">StrategyPattern</a>, delegating the relevant methods to the appropriate strategy object.  For example, if attemptToAddUser() fails, then the updated strategy object's sendPasswordEmail() and handlePendingIssues() will do nothing.  However, if sendPasswordEmail() fails, then handlePendingIssues() will result in the deletion of the user's record from the database.  In either case, redirectWebPage() will redirect to the error page; otherwise, to the success page.

        But this is ridiculously stupid. With closures, a state machine is infinitely more elegant simply by using <a href="CollectionAndLoopVsSelectionIdiom.html">CollectionAndLoopVsSelectionIdiom</a> with lambda thunks (and a little let* magic). Alternatively, one could create state objects in object-oriented <a href="BondageAndDisciplineLanguage.html">BondageAndDisciplineLanguage</a>s.
