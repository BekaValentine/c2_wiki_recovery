        What Isa Factor
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Short Definition</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A factor is an aspect of a program that can be thought about relatively <strong>independently of the rest of the program</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Relation between Factors and Patterns</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> a program you are explicitly or implicitly <a href="FactorFinding.html">FactorFinding</a>.  The improvement in design comes about because the modified design now explicitly recognizes an independent aspect that was buried unrecognized within a monolithic block.  You're also now better able to vary that aspect.  Some factors may correspond directly to <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, <a href="RefactoringPatterns.html">RefactoringPatterns</a> or to <a href="OptimizationPattern.html">OptimizationPattern</a>s, but they don't have to.
      </p>
      <p>
        When a <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a> is really earning its keep we have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A program designed in terms of 
          <ul>
            <li>
               independent factors which are implemented
              <ul>
                <li>
                   by independent objects
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When we're refactoring or optimizing we may have to make do with:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A program that we can view as
          <ul>
            <li>
               independent factors which are
              <ul>
                <li>
                   captured by macros and comments in the code
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>How Useful?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It isn't that useful to have wiki pages for Factors that correspond to the underlying objects of individual <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.  <em>Evidence: We very rarely have Wiki Pages for Objects</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It could be argued <em>and look someone just has</em> that it is useful to have Wiki pages for the Factors that relate to <a href="RefactoringPatterns.html">RefactoringPatterns</a> and to <a href="OptimizationPattern.html">OptimizationPattern</a>s.  In these cases the underlying Factors may make it easier to clarify the patterns and their applicability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I will argue that it is useful to have Wiki pages for the Factors that don't yet show up as <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, <a href="RefactoringPatterns.html">RefactoringPatterns</a> or <a href="OptimizationPattern.html">OptimizationPattern</a>s.  The Factors are a hint to us that there is a useful pattern to be described, and a hint to language designers to boot.

        <strong>Trouble with the Definition</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've read <a href="RichardDawkins.html">RichardDawkins</a> trying to define what a 'gene' is in <em></em><a href="TheSelfishGene.html">TheSelfishGene</a><em>, you'll know something of what the problem is in defining what a 'Factor' in a program is.  Something is more or less a Factor to the extent that it is more or less independent of the rest of the program, but 'relatively independent' is hard to define with more precision.</em>
