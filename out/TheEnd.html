        This is the last page on Wiki. That's it. It's the end of the line. Now turn around and go back where you came from.
        You can, however, go to the end of the internet at <a href="http://home.att.net/~cecw/lastpage.htm">http://home.att.net/~cecw/lastpage.htm</a>
        But that's it. There is nothing more. See also <a href="http://www.explodingdog.com/january2/theendoftheinternet.html">http://www.explodingdog.com/january2/theendoftheinternet.html</a>
        There's an Earthlink (or somesuch) DSL commercial running about the end of the internet. It would be great to get a DIVX/MPEG of that.

        This page is actually a complaint about moded interfaces and the proliferation of escapes that they encourage. Read on for that rant.

        <em>"Tha tha that's all folks." -- Porky Pig</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An early stumbling block for me in programming was learning the difference between "stop" and "end". In the <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>, for example, the former halted the execution of the program while the latter halted the compilation. In the '70s, I supported the campaign against <em>modes</em>. This was as much about having a uniform and <a href="OutOfBand.html">OutOfBand</a> mechanism to escape one context for another as anything. The campaign failed. This came home to me this morning when I wrote the statement ...
      </p>
      <code>
        print "<a href=/cgi/wiki?$&>$&</a><br>\n";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Never mind the cryptic variable name ($&), this statement sucks because it requires eight terminators <em>(almost)</em> in a row. These are ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           /a -- ends the anchor
        </li>
        <li>
           > -- ends the /a tag
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>There's an < here, which opens the <BR> tag</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           br -- ends the line when formatted
        </li>
        <li>
           > -- ends the br tag
        </li>
        <li>
           \n -- ends the line when transmitted
        </li>
        <li>
           " -- ends the line when compiled
        </li>
        <li>
           ; -- ends the statement when compiled
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>enter</em> -- ends the statement when entered
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It sucks because I must remember that I am nested that deep in context and must pop my way out of it before I get on to the next thing I want the computer to do. This gets me wondering, just how many ways are there in use today to say <em>the end</em>?

        Being able to juggle these multiple levels of context is IMHO a fundamental programming skill. One I make sure to spend time with my students on (it comes up when preparing dynamic SQL in VB or C++).

        The real problem with the above is the <em>number</em> of levels. Encapsulating the tag-creation nastiness might make things easier. (Pardon any mistakes, but perl is not my lingua mater):

        A possibly better way is to encapsulate the script-linking code. (I'm sure Ward would have done this if he was writing in Smalltalk rather than Perl.) For instance, in my wiki clone all links to the script are done through through a subroutine:
      </p>
      <code>
        sub ScriptLink {<br/>
        my ($action, $text) = @_;	# Gets the subroutine parameters<br/>
        return "<a href=\"$ScriptName?$action\">$text</a>";<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ...which is called in any place that needs a link back to the script. Since links to pages are common (used in 7 places so far), I wrapped them in a GetPageLink subroutine (which calls ScriptLink). My version of the above print statement would read:
      </p>
      <code>
        print GetPageLink($&) . "<br>\n";<br/>
      </code>

        When I was at university, I encountered a package for doing
        statistical manipulation or something, called MINITAB. If you typed "quit" to its command prompt, it displayed the message <em>Type "exit" to leave MINITAB</em>, which has always struck me as a particularly impressive bit of sadism.

      <p>
        Note that "quit" is just a string in the default interpreter namespace. Having "quit" actually leave the application would require "quit" to become a somewhat special syntactic form. In Windows, you're told to type Ctrl-Z then press enter.

      <p>
        quit the python interpreter? Like so:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Quitter:<br/>
        def __repr__(self): return "Use quit() to exit."<br/>
        def __call__(self): raise SystemExit<br/>
        quit = Quitter()<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Also note that Matlab does the opposite: it lets you exit with
        "exit" or "quit" but <em>not with CTRL-D</em>, not even on Unix.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For people using nslookup from their shell accounts at Primenet, "quit.primenet.com" used to point to the alias "Use.exit.to.quit.moron.primenet.com", or something similar.</em>

        Using MIT Scheme interactively you cannot exit with the exit command because that is not a valid s-expression. You have to use (exit) instead. Then after a confirmation that you really wanted to exit, it closes with <em>Happy Happy Joy Joy.</em>

        Interestingly, <em>The End</em> was the last song listed on the LP cover of <em>Abbey Road</em> (their last record they recorded), but not the last song on the album. Paul's little ditty <em>Her Majesty</em> is the last song on the record. Later releases sadly had <em>Her Majesty</em> on the cover.
