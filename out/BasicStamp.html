        Basic Stamp
      </h1>
      <p>
        A BASIC Stamp is a stamp-sized computer that runs a version of BASIC and has programmable I/O pins.

          <em>The BASIC Stamp line of microcontrollers was created specifically to make learning to use a Î¼-controller simple and easy. Functioning as stand-alone ICs, beginners can plug a BASIC Stamp into a board and immediately begin programming, with no other circuitry required.</em>

        Lots of little clients like these damn things. They figure they can create an embedded application without one of them there high cost greybeards to get the details sorted out. When they can't they call up the greybeards anyway. Cool.

        One can control a self-propelled device. A Robot, to follow a predetermined path, via sensors and a program. (thinking lawn-mower or vacuum-cleaner) -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

        <em>No problem. Of course, that kind of application doesn't require the "brain" (such as it is) of a Basic Stamp. However, if you are creating the application yourself and you have no </em>EmbeddedDesign experience then you <em>do</em> need something like a Basic Stamp to create the working product.<em></em>

        It is not a problem of experience, it one of opportunity and expedience. I can acquire a stamp computer and a robot. I am not employed in the production of a product which will be mass produced, or in which an EmbeddedProcessController is desired or required.
