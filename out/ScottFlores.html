        I am a founding partner in Magpie Telecom Insiders, Inc (<a href="http://www.magpieti.com),">http://www.magpieti.com),</a> a software
        development and consulting firm located in North Denver. Magpie provides all kinds of
        different software services from prototyping, architecture, requirements generation,
        project management, design, development, testing, etc. We even teach a class titled
        "Understanding VOIP and the Session Initiation Protocol (SIP)".

        Prior to forming Magpie, I worked as a software developer, project manager, and technical
        manager at Lucent Technologies. I became interested in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> while at Lucent
        as we were using some of the practices. Magpie was founded on the Agile principles which
        we apply to the projects we work on. One of our goals as a company is to share the 
        benefits of Agile practices with our clients to make them a better development organization.
