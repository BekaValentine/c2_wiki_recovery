        A <a href="SockPuppet.html">SockPuppet</a> is a false identity created by someone to give the illusion of having support, or having someone against whom to excel in debate.

        <em>B</em>: Hold on. Tabitha is blogging about "The Fluff"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: Yeah! and there's another blog on <a href="MySpace.html">MySpace</a> called "rallythefluff", and it's run by their fans, right? And I said the video for their hit song "Earnestly Derivative" was disappointing, and then someone said they might make another one, and ...

        <em>A</em>: Because it's <em></em><a href="MySpace.html">MySpace</a><em>!</em>

        <em>B</em>: So... the naivete of the medium lends it street-cred?
