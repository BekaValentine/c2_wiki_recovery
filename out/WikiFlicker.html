        Wiki Flicker

        No, this is not a serious page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiFlicker.html">WikiFlicker</a> is a phenomenon brought on by browsing to a page that's continually deleted (or changed) and restored.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a little like trying to read under a fluorescent light that's losing its ballast unit.

      <p>
        The good news is it doesn't hurt the eyes as much.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bad news is it hurts the mind (in a surreal not-quite-a-headache way) even more.

        Now, if we could please have an electrician in to repair that bloody fixture ...

        Perhaps a surreal electrician.

        I still think this is a <a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a> as it is an <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>, and therefore unlikely to be widely read, and was last edited December 10, 2004 (other than discussion on its deletion).

      <p>
        But it is referenced on <a href="FunnyWikiProcesses.html">FunnyWikiProcesses</a>. Isn't this a funny wiki pattern?
