        By adding the word <em>Concerns</em>, I have enlarged the scope to include topics that are not exclusive to the world of EnterpriseComputing, but are relevant to EnterpriseComputing nonetheless. --<a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

        I believe the term <a href="EnterpriseApplication.html">EnterpriseApplication</a> is too ill-defined to be useful for categorization. I suggest <a href="CategoryScaling.html">CategoryScaling</a> for "large" issues (if "enterprise" is really about size). Plus, it is shorter.
