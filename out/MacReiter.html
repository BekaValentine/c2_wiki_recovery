        I am a Software Engineer at a small company in Stillwater, Oklahoma, called Nomadics, Inc. (<a href="http://www.nomadics.com)">http://www.nomadics.com)</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I was the primary developer of a family of real-time data acquisition, logging, graphing, and manipulation programs written for Windows 3.1x and Windows 95 in Visual Basic 4.  I learned a lot along the way, and feel safe saying that, in all honesty, I am probably a very strong Visual Basic expert (at LEAST for version 4, very knowledgeable about 5, haven't played with 6 except to help other people out...)

        Hmmm.  I vaguely remember entering this information, but don't remember why...  The mailto address is wrong now -- so much spam that I killed it.  Used VB6 a lot more, and have been doing almost all my programming since in either VC6 or GCC, so some of my VB skills are rusting...
