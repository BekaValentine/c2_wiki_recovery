        Peter Schickele
      </h1>
      <p>
        Peter Schickele is a composer, conductor, and performer of music.
        He has recorded several albums as <a href="PdqBach.html">PdqBach</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He currently has a Saturday morning music explanation program
        on National Public Radio. <a href="http://www.schickelemix.org/">http://www.schickelemix.org/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        His music has fun with the stodginess of typical classical music, and the pretentions of contemporary music (after all, when <em>he</em> uses "prepared" instruments, you're <em>supposed</em> to laugh.)
      </p>
      <p>
        He is a very funny man, who writes fun classical music.
