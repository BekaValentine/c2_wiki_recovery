        Mocking In Many Languages
      </h1>
      <p>
        Let's pretend that you have a legacy report function, called "run_report()" (every company has one of those, don't they?).  Your customer wants it to send the report by email after it's done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely you don't want to actually send a mail every time you run your tests, so you mock.
      </p>
      <p>
        Presume you have a working "Email" class.  It has a "send_it" method that you need to mock.  Here's how you do it in various languages:

        local *Email::send_it = sub { @args = @_ };<br/>
        my $email = Email->new();<br/>
        run_report($email);<br/>
        is_deeply(\@args, [ $email, 'The report went like so...' ]);<br/>
        }<br/>

        run_report(email)<br/>

        def send_it(self, message):<br/>
        self.assertEqual(message, 'The report went like so...')<br/>
        email = MockEmail()<br/>
        run_report(email)<br/>

        $email = &new MockEmail($this);<br/>
        $email->expectOnce("send_it", array('The report went like so...'));<br/>
        run_report($email);<br/>
        $email->tally();<br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        These tests are doing different things: some fail as soon as an invalid message is sent (as <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s should) while others store the message and test its validity after the fact.
      </p>

        I would really like to see the same thing in FORTRAN for my department, but their FortranCompiler has no interface at all to the EmailSystem.  It's so sad... --<a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a>
