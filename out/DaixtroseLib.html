        Daixtrose Lib
      </h1>
      <p>
        Daixtrose is a <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> class header library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Daixtrose was designed to provide a convenient way to apply Expression Template techniques to any kind of C++ classes without the need to modify any line of code of these classes. As an example, consider you have written a very elaborated high performance class X. The only things missing are the operators and other code which would allow objects of type X to be used within expressions. No problem for us, we have Daixtrose: <a href="http://daixtrose.sourceforge.net/.">http://daixtrose.sourceforge.net/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The current version is 0.0.2 (available from sourceforge). This uses a version of Loki which must be 0.0.4 or earlier and a version of the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> which can be 1.31.0 but not later as the Boost MPL library which it uses changed its interface in 1.32.0. (For Loki see <a href="ModernCeePlusPlusDesign.html">ModernCeePlusPlusDesign</a>.)
      </p>

        This is all fixable and I have reported it to the author. A new version is under development.

        I am finding that more or less no-one is expressing interest in this code. I looked at it some years ago and was put off then by the warnings about the demand it put on the C++ compiler. My experience now is that <a href="GnuCpp.html">GnuCpp</a> both versions 3.4 and 4.0.2 are O.K. with this, so perhaps its time has come now. See <a href="ConSol.html">ConSol</a> for discussion of the use of <a href="DaixtroseLib.html">DaixtroseLib</a>. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

      <p>
        <strong>Jan 2006</strong> There is a new version <strong>0.0.3</strong> of Daixtrose which no longer depends upon Loki.
