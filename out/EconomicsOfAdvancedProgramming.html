        Economics Of Advanced Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a discussion based on material in <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>. I'm trying to present a somewhat more concrete model for training/knowledge and what the "market wants".
      </p>
      <p>
        The skill/training-level issue can be viewed as <strong>resource allocation</strong>, AKA economics. 
      </p>
      <code>
        p = k1*s1 + k2*s2 + k3*s3...kn*sn<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        "p" is total productivity of a given employee. "kn" is knowledge about sn and "sn" is the Skill N, or more specifically, the importance of Skill n to Productivity (p). Ideally an organization and/or employee wants to optimize p, and one way is find the best allocation of k's (knowledge).
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember, in the "deparmental" model (above), the skills will also include domain skills, and perhaps other IT skills besides development, such as networking, DBA, Photoshop, <a href="SmartPhone.html">SmartPhone</a> programming, etc. (I've counted at least 30 skills I can list, and probably many I've forgotten at the moment.)
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, let's assume that the total time allocated to gaining Knowledge is fixed. Thus,
      </p>
      <code>
        k1 + k2 + k3 ... kn = constantX<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If one focuses on a specific skill, such as HOF's, let's say that's "s34", then one has to make the argument that some OTHER k should be reduced. Nobody has made a good argument that s34 is more important than s35 or s7 etc. Please try.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, one could argue that constantX should be increased and a given employee should spend time learning EVERYTHING more. But time spent learning takes away time spent on other things, such as actually doing the here-and-now job. And it may make the employee more valuable in the market place such that the org has to decided whether they want to pay for that level of knowledge. The best balancing point would make an interesting discussion, but I'm not sure that's the pro-lisp or pro-HOF perspective. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also the issue of using techniques that current or future colleagues may have trouble following.

        {This is nothing but speculative nonsense until it has backing from theoretical proof, empirical evidence, or both.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is nonsense. About the only thing that isn't is the bit about resource allocation being economics. The linear model relating knowledge and productivity is particularly laughable, since there's very little reason to believe it (and quite a bit not to).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why are you complaining? I don't understand. <a href="DontComplainWithoutAlternatives.html">DontComplainWithoutAlternatives</a>. The only alternative I've seen is "in an ideal world programmers would fart code and all have PhD's and A+ GPA's because everybody gets a pony and there should be magic".  The above is meant as a <strong>framework for discussion</strong>. Those who make hiring and tool decisions more or less use models similar to this to make their decisions. Even if you disagree with it (for unstated reasons), you should still know <strong>how the market works</strong>. It's good for you, like broccoli. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have an <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> but <em>neither do you</em>! My evidence is D- but yours is F- because it's grounded in an idealistic fantasy universe. I'm at least starting on the road to science by presenting draft models to start to explore. Your "should" model makes no empirical nor intellectual sense to me. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [The claim is <em>"there is very little reason to believe your model"</em> and <em>"your model is speculative nonsense"</em> not <em>"here's another model you should believe"</em>. Nobody needs to overturn or your theory because you haven't established it. Nobody needs to present alternatives or evidence for them. This isn't a contest for who can provide grade D+ bullshit. If you're providing a model, you need to show how it fits and predicts evidence. You claim to be providing a 'framework for discussion' but you go about it like a juvenile throwing turds into the swimming pool and seeing what floats, and asking others to do better. The only 'discussion' you'll ever receive is how utterly disgusted everyone is with you, at least from the few who walk by or decide to stick around.]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           These kinds of models and analysis are common in business and finance when weighing trade-offs. They are not meant to be perfect but are rather for "thumbnail" analysis. There is a continuum between experienced judgment alone (usually stated verbally), rough numeric models, and careful & detailed & rigorous models. The techniques shown here are in the middle of that spectrum. Often a high-end model is not practical and have costs approaching the project itself. It's like spending $5k to decide which $2k TV to buy for your house.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Let me try to simplify this a bit. Suppose a multi-hat developer/IT-worker has been told that they should learn Photoshop by their boss as a suggestion. They always read this wiki and see a suggestion that they should study and practice HOF's. This person already works long hours and has a family to help take care of. They only have enough time to pick one to study this month. How do you propose they "rationally" decide among the two? -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You want an alternative? Study economics. (And you'll even find an </em><a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> or two.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Too vague. Any specific studies you want to cite?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At this point, just about any introductory course would do.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, you've got nothing beyond patronizing verbiage. I've taken 2 econ courses, by the way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Then you've forgotten everything in them already. Take them again, and pay attention this time. For example, rather than starting with a linear relationship, start with the following. (Where y is a conglomeration of all the factors that affect productivity other than knowledge.)</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        p = f(k1, k2, k3, ..., kn, y).<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I'm trying to keep the discussion focused at this point. We'll explore other factors as they come up. For discussion purposes, it's often best to keep certain things constant in a given section to explore a specific set of variables. The discussion then gradually works around to other factors. English is linear, for good or bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There's nothing wrong with that approach. I certainly could have said "p = f(k1, k2, k3, ..., kn)." The thing is, that now f itself is a function of y.  I.e. "p = f(k1, k2, k3, ..., kn)" is just a shorthand for "p = f[y](k1, k2, k3, ..., kn)". (I'm using [] to indicate a subscript.) The two approaches are mathematically equivalent. (I don't know what the purpose of your last statement is. Nothing on this page is dependent on the linearity of English. It's also factually incorrect. English isn't even close to being linear.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {"English is linear" makes almost as much sense as "dream is fish".}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A linear language is a language for which a linear grammar exists. A linear grammar is a context-free grammar with at most one non-terminal on the right hand side of it's productions. The phrase makes sense, but it's false.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {I'm almost 100% certain that's not what Top meant.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That I can agree with.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You guys are sometimes too literal. Anyhow, the above says nothing about what's inside the function. I'm just trying to illustrate the trade-offs involved. When you say a person "should do/learn X", you also have to consider that perhaps they "should" also do A and B and C and D, etc. The typical developer/IT-worker has limited time and resources (or will at least spend only a limited time and resources on work-related stuff). If you make the claim that they should spend it on X, then you need to also explain clearly why they should do X <em>instead of</em> A, B, C, D, etc. That's a perfectly rational question, I don't know why you are bothered by it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Then explain what you meant by it. Anyhow, your model doesn't actually illustrate the trade-offs involved, it's just something you made up and never connected to reality. That step is crucial.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How is it disconnected from reality? I invite you to produce a better model of the tradeoffs involved in allocating resources, such as learning time.
      </p>
      <p>
        {How is it connected to reality?}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't agree that people have multiple choices of what to spend their time on, I don't know what else to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There's an alternate model already on this page. But the issue has never been that there aren't choices, but that you've never shown a connection between your model and reality.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Where's the alternative? The big undefined function?
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as connection to reality, do you agree there are time trade-offs?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, it's the function. While we haven't exactly specified it (how could we since each situation will be different), it's also true that yours is likewise not completely specified. It does however, have the advantage of not assuming that the relationship between the cost of learning and its effect on productivity is linear. It also doesn't assume that the effects of learning different things are independent.  There is plenty of reason to believe that both those assumptions are false.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Good! We are starting to begin to get somewhere. If linear is a bad approximation, what would you propose is a better approximation and why do you believe it to be so? In actuality, often it's a case of diminishing returns. For example, plumbing 101 will have a vastly stronger affect on a plumber's productivity than a hydraulics degree per time spent in school (ignoring tuition cost for now).
      </p>
      <p>
        And I do believe that the affects of learning different things is approximately linear for most learning candidates. Learning <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a> and learning Ruby and Rails are not going to have a lot of interaction between each other, for example. We can deal with specific overlaps as we encounter them. We can still flesh out a general model without having it be accurate for every situation, correcting for those as encountered.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        If I had the foresight to know exactly which knowledge would most increase my productivity, then perhaps an economic analysis would do me a lot of good. But, in practice, I often use knowledge in ways that I do not foresee. And if I did not have that knowledge, I would be unable to judge how much it costs me. (I have not studied past econ 101, but my impression is that opportunity costs are invisible in most economic theories.) Anyhow, a consequence of my imperfect foresight is a belief that people should never stop learning and discovering opportunities that they would otherwise have never recognized. LuckFavorsThePreparedMind. Learning doesn't need to be entirely separate from doing; there is plenty space for a little experimentation in any development process. But we do need to find an effective balance between getting it done and learning new ways to do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not against learning. If you believe that was my point, then you have misunderstood my point. -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not suggest you are <em>against</em> learning. But it is my impression that you <em>do not actively pursue</em> learning, and that you often seek and find thin excuses to remain ignorant and unprepared with respect to whatever topic you're arguing. This impression comes from pages such as <a href="BookStop.html">BookStop</a>, <a href="MindOverhaulEconomics.html">MindOverhaulEconomics</a>, <a href="SelfStandingEvidence.html">SelfStandingEvidence</a>, and this one. The evidence for my impression is entirely circumstantial but thoroughly whelming.

        <em>That's because you have a simplistic (and wrong) cartoon version of me in your stubborn little head. I probably have an overly simplistic cartoon version of you in that I picture you as a professor or tutor of graduate school students who wants to justify the cost and time of extra education to the market place in order to feel better about your career and worth as a person. It's perhaps more complicated than that, but it's the image that keeps coming back based on your writings. It's my opinion you don't understand the market-place and human nature. There's nothing wrong with a personal endeavor to learn more of everything and anything. However, such suggestions or specific suggestions may </em>'not scale<strong> to the larger market-place.

        Of course my view of you is simplistic. You only present one small aspect of yourself on this forum. But my simplistic view is nonetheless sufficient to recognize you as someone who argues outside his competencies. And you regularly seem to demonstrate hypocrisy, for example: it isn't as though your economic theory will <em>actually</em> tell you how to allocate tradeoffs - in practice, you'll <em>never</em> have valid numbers to fill the variables in your equations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Re: "Outside your competencies" - you don't prove your claims. You cannot objectively prove that I am wrong, you just claim claim claim.

When picking between things that aren't scientific, platitudes, patterns, and practices (regardless of whether 'best' or just good) are more effective and useful than invented formula and hand-waving claims about types or psychology.

           <em>It's more about the model and not the numbers at this point. I'm just trying to demonstrate that trade-offs exist to get you thinking and articulating about why YOU believe one approach is better than another beyond "I'm experienced and smart and I just say so". I admit my observations about human nature and "office behavior" are purely anecdotal, and if your observations differ, so be it. But you imply you know about some whimsical factor beyond that, some insight that I or others "don't get", hovering around comments about "outside your competency". Not "getting" something on a larger scale is also an economic factor to consider. You seem to base your economic assessment on the fact that programmers "should" make the effort know certain things (at the expense of others). Economics is usually not about "should", unless it relates to where consumers, owners, and workers </em>'see the most opportunity per effort/resources<em>'. If you are certain they are weighing their options wrong, you need to make a better case, such as measuring the benefits and showing the measuring being done.

      </ul>

        <li>
           The reason that programmers <em>"should" make the effort to know certain things</em> is precisely so they can <strong>see opportunity</strong> when it's nearby. The unprepared mind will not see opportunity, will not recognize it, and cannot weigh it. That's what I was saying above re LuckFavorsThePreparedMind. You seem to believe that people can recognize opportunity without preparation, or that they can create adequate weightings without knowledge or experience. Because your model depends on such foresight, it is useless. Well, not quite useless: I'm sure you'll use it as another thin excuse to avoid learning.

           It's not really about the languages, but what is emphasized. Remember, there are certain techniques I tend to avoid because other developers may be confused by them.

           Re: "The majority of developers our graduates will work with will have received the same level of education" -- Well, that's a unique position to be in. Most of the developers I've encountered over the years have a wide mix of backgrounds, many of them are there because of their domain knowledge and have limited or no college-level education. The pattern you describe is not something I see much of. I imagine one would only tend to see such at big IT shops such as Microsoft, HP, Google, etc. Most of my experience is in non-IT companies. They usually use the "department model" where each department finds a their own candidates rather than be managed by a centralized IT hiring group, or are too small to have a centralized IT hiring group, and most IT hiring is managed by an HR generalist(s). And many are skeptical of what may be considered "over educated" applicants because such tend to write code that's hard for follow-on developers to work on, and they tend to get bored easily, wanting to create some elaborate model or apply what may be seen as "esoteric" techniques. Maybe such is a good idea technically, but doesn't fit the their staffing patterns. Legible repetition is often valued over hard-to-read factoring or abstraction that may save code, for good or bad.

           I don't believe that statement to be accurate. However, I will agree that a <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> degree is perhaps over-kill for many of the CBA programmers out there in terms of delivering a product. Remember, companies also value domain knowledge of their industry and people skills, something a CS graduate may lack at first. In my last job before the current, I was dinged on my performance evaluation for lack of domain knowledge, although given good ratings for my technical skills. That particular company liked to hire from within in order to have the domain knowledge (although different companies may tilt the other way), but had trouble getting sufficient domain knowledge and tech knowledge in one person.

           <em>Your performance review confirms my assessment.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are full of squishy smelly stuff. The domain knowledge is often not in textbook or classroom-presentation form for quick digestion. It comes from time and experience. Enough of your Fake Fantasy World. In this particular case the company was used to hiring within such that they were not used to outsiders who were new to their world. They had their own lingo and short-cut phrases. (It was a poorly-managed office such that if employee functions were better partitioned, then the domain-experts could handle more of the domain analysis role. Instead, they got lost in their pet projects. But the environment was what it was.)

Note that I wrote that "any computer scientist or skilled programmer can acquire domain knowledge", which does not imply domain knowledge is "in textbook or classroom-presentation form" or that it is acquired through something other than time and experience.  Given time and experience, a computer scientist or skilled programmer can develop extensive domain knowledge.  Despite time and experience, most domain experts will not become computer scientists or skilled programmers.  That's why there are so many jobs for educated computer scientists and skilled programmers.<em></em>

           Perhaps we are entering into a <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> tangle over "computer science jobs". I would paycheck-safe-bet estimate that at least 98% of CBA code is <em>not</em> written by "scientists", and actual code in general is probably roughly in that range also.

"CBA", as you use the term, appears to refer to essentially an extension of end-user computing, and so I would guess that you're essentially right -- the majority of it is not written by computer scientists or skilled programmers.</em>

           I meant in terms of code volume written, not code usage frequency. I agree that some of the core algorithms and perhaps code used by a good many systems and tools are written by those in close association with academia. Anyhow, for this discussion I'm considering a "typical" developer because we are looking at the bigger economic picture, not necessarily what may be considered "elite", which we don't need to define just yet.

        <li>
           They are a mix. I'd gander roughly a third have no completed degree, a third "info systems" type of degrees, and a third CS degrees. Most are more concerned about learning the current IT fads that make the most money. If HOF's will get them money and chicks, they'll dig in, otherwise most will ignore them. I'm not condoning that, only reporting my observations. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>That means the majority are, to use my own words, "those who graduate with information systems or business degrees or who have moved toward IT from some other discipline."

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           At least in the US, what percentage of programming time do you estimate is spent by those with at least a CS degree. In other words, if we took a snapshot right now of all programming work activity being done in the US, what percent would you estimate is being done via someone with a CS degree? Remember, this is counting time, not lines of code or code usage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Note that the behavior of the CS degree owners are pretty much the same as the other 2 groups mentioned: they follow the skills that seem most in demand: they follow the money. And the tools are generally shaped by "average" programmers. If you are selling something, you usually target the "average" or typical consumer, not the edges of the bell curve. (I will agree that open-source tools tend to target a more high-brow audience. But some do argue that this hurts their penetration.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I imagine the vast majority of programming is done by people without a CS degree. I count scripts (CGI, HTML, JS, DOM, CSS, CGI and game scripts), spreadsheets, queries, non-trivial CLI (piping commands together), and other models as programming. This is as it should be. IMO, programming and UI should be fully unified (via <a href="LiveProgramming.html">LiveProgramming</a>, <a href="GraphicalProgramming.html">GraphicalProgramming</a>, etc.) perhaps based on a spreadsheet-inspired programming model. I believe in advanced programming in the sense that languages should grow along with their developers, applications, and fields; a language with a low ceiling will suck (which indirectly leads to <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>). But a young programmer should be able to start concrete, i.e. do useful stuff without importing Monads or grokking HOFs or developing DSLs. Naturally, someone joining a project with advanced developers or codebases will need a little time to get familiar with the techniques used on that project, but even then a good language should provide a nice concrete 'view' (e.g. with <a href="ProgressiveDisclosure.html">ProgressiveDisclosure</a> and ability to inline the HOFs and such). Don't confuse "advanced programming" with elitism.}

           I don't see that most organizations value "advanced programming". They even frown on it fairly often because it <strong>limits the pool of maintainers</strong>. Like I said in <a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>, organizations lean toward valuing consistency (availability of maintenance) over average productivity. The productivity of advanced programming does not appear to be strong enough to overcome these factors:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Maintenance availability
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
           People skills

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One point of view is that organizations are just "too stupid" to recognize the value of productivity from advanced techniques; the other is that the above factors (at least) are stronger than the productivity gains. I'm sure you will disagree. -t

        <li>
           <em>You're using the term "organizations" in a generic, all-encompassing sense when it's clear that you're only referring to </em>'some<em>' organisations.  There are many, many, many organisations that value advanced programming, and regard it as a competitive advantage.  This applies to small, local, non-IT organisations as much as it does the obvious Googles and Microsofts.  I know of a small shipping and logistics firm, for example, that hires computer scientists because it considers its IT infrastructure to be business-critical and a competitive advantage.  Organisations that don't regard IT infrastructure to be business-critical or a competitive advantage will almost certainly have the view you've described.  The only open question is what percentage of businesses across the world are the former as opposed to the latter?  I doubt there is any simple statistic that will answer it.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I mean it in the sense of "average" or "typical". And we will indeed disagree over the frequency and let the lack of objective surveys be the end-point for now. Note that if there are enough logistics and shipping firms around, then eventually pre-packaged solutions will be available to reduce number of programmers devoted to the core of automated optimization algorithms, just like the 13 employee shift scheduling products we found online, but still a fairly large group devoted to customization, such as "side reports". Thus, there is a "scaling suspicion" that hangs over your claims.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What makes you think your view of "organizations" is "average" or "typical"?  What is a "scaling suspicion"?  Anyway, many pre-packaged solutions are already available in the field.  Companies like the one I described believe they maintain a competitive advantage specifically by identifying what pre-packaged solutions are available -- and these they consider to be a form of competitor -- and creating better solutions for themselves and their clients.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Okay, but that's still a rather narrow niche because most shipping companies will probably use the pre-packaged solutions because they are in the shipping business, not the software business. Some will choose technology as their edge and others use container material research, others schmoozing, marketing, etc. as their method to keep up or get an edge.

           <em>A few years ago, it was a narrow niche.  Now that such companies easily equal each other on containers, schmoozing, marketing, etc. -- i.e., the relatively unskilled areas -- they fight it out in the area where they can most differentiate, which is IT.  I don't know if you've noticed, but the whole IT/Web/Internet/Software/mobile/social-networking thing is kind of big at the moment.  It's why excellent programmers -- those capable of advanced programming -- are well-paid and in demand.</em>

           Like I analogized elsewhere, it's similar to the the C++ market when GUI's first came of a age two decades ago. GUI's were in demand and that's where all the "elite" programmers went. Then VB, Delphi, Paradox etc. came along and reduced the skill needed to make most GUI's and it became a more or less generic skill via mostly drag-and-drop widgets. The C++ crowd yammered on about reuse and abstraction, but it turned out that VB made reinventing the wheel faster than the reuse guru's could reuse because the <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a> kept byting them in the ass. COPY AND PASTE WON for good or bad. A similar thing happened to websites that at first needed very specific knowledge of HTTP and session tracking techniques. Then web-oriented server-side languages and libraries came along that pre-packaged much of this. The cycle has been slower for web GUI's, but I'm betting something will eventually give and a VB-like commoditizer will come along. In theory <strong>it should NOT require a rocket scientist to put a </strong><a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> and combo-box on the same screen/page<strong> without crashing 20% of browsers. The stupid </strong><a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> just makes easy things hard. But even now specialization is used such that a mid-level programmer can use mostly drag-and-drop of say Spry Widgets via Dreamweaver to get a good many UI idioms, and then a "Javascript whiz" comes in to help tune or add in the really sticky, buggy, or advanced stuff. We'll see how it all plays out. Flash was supposed to be such a tool, but stumbled. The behavior of GUI's is pretty much known and has been established for 20+ years, it's just that attempts to pre-package these idioms "for the masses" has faltered of late.  It may be that open-source is less skilled at packaging idioms "for the masses" than commercial companies because they <em>like to play</em> with "clever" syntax resembling a cat swallowing Lisp and Perl and then coughing up a fur-ball: $()[{]{($.().((%${$}(){[:]|&.${}.())

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Indeed, what is currently considered cutting or bleeding edge will become commoditized whilst excellent programmers will, as always, surf the edge.  Just behind the edge is the commodity mainstream, where it's not that "pre-packaging of idioms" has stumbled, it's that the nature of the commodity mainstream itself has changed.  Software project managers no longer consider it worthwhile for "a mid-level programmer [to] mostly drag-and-drop", because mainstream development has advanced to the point that today's mid-level programmers are comfortable using  HTML/CSS/Javascript and related tools like JQuery.  These tools </em>'are<em>' the result of a "VB-like commoditizer", but the capability bar has been raised -- they can do far more than limited drag-n-drop environments.  In short, today's mid-level programming is yesterday's advanced programming, and today's mid-level developer is fully capable of using lambdas, higher-order functions, event-driven I/O, meta-programming and the like.  Today's advanced programmer is comfortable with functional programming, advanced type systems, monads, and so on, but these too will become mainstream as the cutting edge advances.</em>

           That's not what I see. The average developer is <em>not</em> better educated than 20 years ago. And most orgs were comfortable with the capabilities of VB, Delphi, Paradox etc. for niche or internal projects. It was the pain of deploying them that made web apps popular, NOT the alleged capability of the <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a>. I've sat in many meetings where the trade-offs were discussed. To handle the screwier <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a>, there tends to be a <strong>division of labor between "front-end" and "back-end" specialists</strong>. For example, the back-end developers may be well versed in databases and server-side web programming while the front-enders are not. The VB (desktop) programmer used to handle both the front end and the back end. And many internal web apps use plane-jane-style server-side-centric programming rather than trying to mirror the desktop GUI closely. CRUD is clunkier than say Paradox for such server-side web apps, but if they serve relatively few users, then orgs live with it. If it's a wide-use internal app, then the front-end specialist(s) is called in to give it a better GUI. Deployment of desktop apps was expensive for orgs, especially with <a href="DllHell.html">DllHell</a> and managing software updates. It's cheaper to spend more on <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> GUI development (and/or live with clunky interfaces) to cut deployment costs compared with the desktop era. -t

           {Regardless of whether or not they are 'better educated', average developers today regularly use HOFs, metaprogramming, reactive programming, and other (historically) "advanced programming" concepts on a regular basis - for purposes such as event handling, asynchronous programming, GL shaders, GUI frameworks, etc.. They don't need to understand HOFs to use them, but using certainly helps them understand. In addition to VB, <a href="LabView.html">LabView</a> and <a href="MatLab.html">MatLab</a> are other programming tools widely used by people who aren't professionally programmers.

           If you focus on a specialty, you eventually memorize the patterns to use things even if the interfaces are goofy and poorly-thought-out. Similarly, the A/C repair man learns from experience and tips from colleagues that when Bradford model 34726 makes moose sounds, they change dial X to be at 820. They may not know why to set it to 820, they just know it works. There are a good many programmers who quickly memorize patterns of code and learn how to use those patterns without necessarily knowing what's happening under the hood.  I'm not sure what your point is about <a href="LabView.html">LabView</a>. I consider it a domain-specific programming language and those who program with it fairly extensively are indeed "professional programmers".

           {People who use <a href="LabView.html">LabView</a> are often engineers, but (in my experience) are rarely trained or employed as programmers.

           Most engineers take at least one programming class, usually C, Fortran, or Java if I'm not mistaking. They are usually familiar with conditionals, loops, and functions. I used to work at a company that had 3 <a href="LabView.html">LabView</a> programmers, all engineers, and they said they took C in college. And you don't need HOF's for GUI's, as VB and Delphi showed. HOF's can help in writing terse GUI code, but terse is not always better maintenance-wise. Stuffing too many activities in one statement can be difficult to read, and is one of the reasons why Lisp has failed to catch on. Besides, much of the maintenance was done with point-and-click IDE's for VB and Delphi, not code sifting. Again, JS as a de-facto client standard has forced development into places it wouldn't normally go. In a similar but smaller fashion, <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a> has resulted in many Lisp programmers, but that would probably not be the language of choice for most. <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a> now offers other languages.

I do not believe that taking one programming class makes anyone a professional programmer. Also, I never suggested you <em>need HOFs for GUIs</em>, so I'm not sure what your point is there.}

Just because one is using a <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> or programming tool doesn't make them a "non-professional". Their expertise is the <em>melding</em> of domain knowledge and programming. It may not be expertise in advanced programming techniques, but it is still a form of expertise that involves programming and a potentially very valuable skill. A similar situation is a "programmer/analyst" who excels at communication with the customers/users to extract their needs by following subtle cues and asking smart but understandable questions. It is a valued skill even though it may not involve "advanced programming". One can save a lot of time if they can find out what's needed without excessive trial-and-error. There are different ways to be "good" and valuable.

As a result of typical </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> education, today's mid-level programmers are quite capable of using (at least) Java or C#, Python and Javascript/HTML/CSS -- whether they use them daily or not -- and are comfortable with lambdas and higher-order functions and don't give them a second thought, as they're taught along with variables, expressions, loops and functions in introductory programming classes.<em></em>

           The pool of programmers I encounter come from a wide variety of backgrounds such that orgs have to cater to a kind of middle ground. Advanced techniques don't offer any significant demonstratable advantage for custom apps actually found in the wild such that they are often shunned to avoid making fungible team maintenance more difficult or unpredictable. That's what I see. If I'm blind or looking at the world all wrong and cock-eyed, I apologize that I am not aware of my disease; it's what I fucking see around me. If your observations differ, so be it. You report, I report, and we move on. Further, those who seem most adept at advanced techniques often have the worse people and team skills, and this bothers orgs.

If that's not the sort of people you work with, it's probably because you work in a branch of IT that has largely evolved from end-user computing.

           Well, at least the last two sentences starting with "Its focus is not..." are spot on. The "evolved from end-user programming" is flat wrong though. There has always been a large group of mid-level programmers and their shops who don't give a care about lisp-isms in the 25 or so years I've been in field. If there was such "evolution", it finished before I arrived on the scene, making it so long ago as to be irrelevant.

           I've worked in or consulted at approximately 30 companies/orgs in my career so far. I generally don't see such outside of the main line of business. This is because plumbers, let's say, eventually realize they know shit about software and software management and will not be able to compete with <strong>dedicated</strong> plumbing software vendors. Most managers and staff at a company/org that makes foo came up through the company making foo or working on foo directly. They think in foo. If they had talent in BOTH foo and software development, they'd likely go work at a foo software vendor: those who specialize in domain-specific software for foo. I have seen a fair number of cases where experimental AI and/or advanced statistical analysis techniques are attempted to find customer patterns, billing anomalies, etc. but it's usually using pre-packaged AI or statistical software or an AI/stat consultant is used and usually managed or performed by somebody with a degree in statistics or math. Most stat packages have a basic programming language or hookups such that a programmer may be called in to automate steps being done manually. But the bulk of the processing is done via the pre-packaged steps such that this code mostly just manages where the inputs and outputs come and go, not the actual computations. It's "glue code".

           You've suggested that your niche is highly-optimized software for companies that try to get a strategic edge over "generic" domain software. They may not worry much about a reliable supply of maintenance developers because they decided up front and are determined to pay top dollar to find a good fit for their project. "Pesky salary budgets" are not their concern for such positions. Perhaps this niche biases you toward thinking there are more companies like that. Or, maybe my background predisposes me to the opposite kinds of companies for whatever reason, where programmer salaries and programmer staff "supplies" are treated no different than toilet-paper procurement and budgets by Dilbertian managers. Advanced programming techniques are frowned upon because they make it hard to have <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a> that are as easy to replace as toilet paper rolls in standardized restroom rollers. It's hard to know what perspective biases are in place for any given person without objective surveys.

           You seem to be trying to reflect this back into me. Let me state it this way: humans are primarily social animals.  They are not Vulcans. Decisions are not made in a rational science-influenced way, but via a mostly ad-hoc social web of push-and-pull of egos and personal connections. <strong>Personally</strong>, I'd like to see a more democratic and open argument-by-merit decision process, but that's not the way most organizations function, for good or bad. I'll admit it frustrates me at times. I'd like to see more Vulcan's and less Ferrengi's.

           I've done a self assessment and don't see that the "problem is in my head". I don't know what else to say. Bias can work both ways, I'd note. Dale Carnegie (<a href="HowToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople.html">HowToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople</a>) and Scott Adams (Dilbert) have noticed pretty much the same thing about human nature in Office Land (but present it from different perspectives). Perhaps there are those who bitch about the "irrational stupidity" of humanity, like me, and those who accept it as the way things are and learn to live within its rules, and even master its rules. Maybe there are pockets of rationality out there, but they are rare in my observation. I've only worked at one place that came close, and it all went to hell when a bigger company purchased it and filled it with their clueless <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a>es. Maybe you have the rare nose to sniff out rational companies, but assumptions of having that ability doesn't scale into general advice.

           I didn't come here to talk about me and I don't want to hear details about your life either unless they reflect a specific issue at hand. Everybody's personality and skills probably lead them to certain "kinds" of organizations and/or tasks and thus everybody is going be biased; that is, their experience is influenced by their personality and skills. But I do look around the organizations I am in and talk to other developers to get their perspective to try to widen my viewpoint. Whether that is sufficient to counter bias, I don't know. Unless reincarnation is true, we all only live one life.

           I expect you have a terrible estimate of where I'd recommend training. E.g.

That's enough, over a few years, to know what's available, to make sound judgements, to avoid over-specialization, to recognize opportunities and avoid unnecessary efforts. If you, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, spent even half the time you currently spend arguing in defense of your ignorance into <em>correcting</em> your ignorance, you'd waste much less of yours and others' time.

For that to be a sustainable argument, you need to demonstrate -- via logical proof or empirical evidence -- that most characterisations are "written by consultants selling 'methodologies'".

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Here's a somewhat extreme example of the "don't target too high" pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen an org with 6 people with enough skill to edit basic HTML. 4 of these 6 are graphics experts who also know HTML, and the other 2 are power users who picked up HTML along the way. But there are only 2 "programmers" with knowledge of scripting or programmed templating.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason the organization is reluctant to use content factoring techniques, such as scripting to avoid repetition. If there is an urgent change request, none of the 2 programmers might be available to make the changes. (Lack of availability problems have happened more than once.) If the org sticks with direct HTML, along with copy-and-paste repetition of many page elements and page patterns, then the chance of finding an HTML editor on staff is much higher since there are 6. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This org values the ability to make quick changes for specific pages but doesn't want to hire more programmers. Because the 6 HTML-only staff members are in scattered departments, training them in abstraction techniques is not a viable option, for at least political reasons related to the scattering.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I was in charge of the whole org, I may shuffle around staff and position titles to better handle this situation, but I am not. Those calling the shots are not so technically savvy and that's not likely to change; thus they want <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a> (or experts) even if that means less use of abstraction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, higher abstraction requires more expensive or less <em>available</em> experts such that companies tend to design staffing patterns around the lowest common denominator.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Twenty years ago, some companies were reluctant to use computers and at best would grudgingly outsource IT work to their accounting firm.  Now it's exceptionally rare to find a viable firm without any computerisation, but the above is certainly the modern equivalent to the techno-Luddites of two decades past.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Not sure if those are equivalent. I agree the above firm should bite the bullet and get a real WCMS, but that would require a staffing increase, which they may not be ready to do. Maybe in a future boom they may finally think, "Let's see, now that we have money, what can we fix up that's been messy and neglected?".
