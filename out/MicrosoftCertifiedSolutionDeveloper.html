        Microsoft Certified Solution Developer
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Microsoft Certified Solution Developer</em>, or <em>MCSD</em>, is the premier <a href="MicrosoftCertifiedProfessional.html">MicrosoftCertifiedProfessional</a> credential for software developers.  According to Microsoft, it is "the top-level certification for advanced developers who design and develop leading-edge enterprise solutions".
      </p>
      <p>
        There are currently two "tracks" for MCSD: one for Visual Studio 6.0 developers, and one for Visual Studio .NET developers.  The 6.0 track requires passage of four exams; the .NET track requires five exams.  The 6.0 track is, of course, being phased out.
      </p>

        Having recently obtained this certification, I thought I'd share my experience and opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got the MCSD certification for .NET.  I've been trying to find contract jobs for the past year, and despite ten years of experience with a variety of operating systems and programming languages, nobody will hire me because I don't have 3+ years of professional Java experience or twelve months of .NET.  It is too late to jump on the crowded Java bandwagon, so I went for the MCSD.NET certification hoping it would help me get in on an early .NET job.
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefits of holding an MCSD are pretty meager.  I never had any recruiter or interviewer say "Oh, you are an MCSD?  That's great!"  The only person who mentioned my certification at all simply said that he didn't think much of it, but wouldn't hold it against me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I did get a nice lapel pin and a handsome certificate suitable for framing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lack of respect for MCSD is well founded, in my opinion.  For the most part, it represents one's ability to absorb documentation and regurgitate it during the exam.  While studying, I did learn some things that I probably wouldn't have if I didn't have a goal to pursue, but the exams are really nothing more than trivia contests.  The exams were not as easy as some claim, but they do little to test one's competence as a developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best that can be said is that a holder of an MCSD has demonstrated familiarity with the features of Microsoft's development tools, and knows how to use them as Microsoft intends.  So it is strong evidence that someone has done more than spend a couple of weekends going through the VS.NET tutorials before declaring himself or herself to be a .NET expert.  But I would never consider it to be evidence that one is a "top-level ... advanced developer" as Microsoft claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a little like a driver's license.  One must pass a test of minimum competence, not of extraordinary ability.  It indicates that the holder is familiar with traffic laws, knows how to use the turn signals, and is capable of driving competently through the cones on a closed course.  It cannot guarantee that the holder won't do a lot of stupid things out on the open road, and does not indicate that the holder is ready to be a professional driver.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a job seeker, I will continue to put MCSD on my resume in the hope it will trigger a favorable response from somebody somewhere.  However, if I was hiring somebody, I would probably ignore an MCSD certification (or any other MS certification), except maybe as a tie-breaker when considering candidates who have little real-world experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        For anyone going after the MCSD for .NET, I offer these tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Microsoft's self-paced training kits suck.  I did use them, as they are a good outline of what is on the tests, but they do not provide all the stuff you need to know.  Concentrate on reading (and re-reading) the MSDN docs.
        </li>
        <li>
           ADO.NET comes up a lot on all the exams, so make sure you know it well.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Web Applications (ASP.NET) exam is the easiest of the development-tool exams, so you may want to do it first.
        </li>
        <li>
           I found the Designing Solution Architectures exam to be the easiest exam overall.  Many people have a lot of trouble with this one, but I think it should be easy for anyone who has real experience with analyzing requirements, creating database schemas, and doing other <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> activities.  (This may be the one MS exam that truly does separate experienced people from those who have just read the exam guides.)  The Exam Cram 2 book for this test is the best exam prep book I've ever seen--buy it.
