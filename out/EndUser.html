      <p>
        A person using software on a daily basis.  Adding an appointment to a <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a>, telling the ATM that they want money from their Savings Account, using prepaid telephone calling cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's the <a href="EndUser.html">EndUser</a> for whom the <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> is designed.    
      </p>
      <p>
        Given a set of keys and a description of where it is, almost anyone I work with could find my car, start it up, and drive it home -- without a <a href="UserManual.html">UserManual</a>. (Except of course my four year old nephew, he gets car sick).
