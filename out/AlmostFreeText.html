        I have Patterns in MS Word RTF, <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a>, and HTML. So how do I maintain so many formats? I decided that I needed to adopt a standard documentation system to keep my various Patterns in a manageable format.
      </p>
      <p>
        MS Word was unacceptable. That would mean that I would have to install the product everywhere I work (I spend quite a bit of time in UNIX).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> is my standard documentation format, but my fingers cramp from all the curly braces and verbose inline commands.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML has the same problem (and I can't rely on keeping a WYSIWYG HTML editor handy everywhere I go).
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I was inspired by Wiki <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>. Most of the markup is done unobtrusively. About a year ago, I began working on a standard markup syntax and came up with AFT (Almost Free Text).
      </p>
      <p>
        AFT modifies and extends Wiki markup conventions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Section names are preceded by 1 to 4 asterisks (for different levels).
        </li>
        <li>
           Bolding can span lines and uses _ to denote beginning and end.
        </li>
        <li>
           Emphasis works just like Wiki (but can also span lines).
        </li>
        <li>
           Bullet, named, and numbered lists are supported and work like Wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           A Verbatim (pre-formatted) and Quote mode is supported.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of this is done in a way that requires <strong>few commands</strong> (like Wiki) and looks very readable in its own right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, AFT outputs <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> and HTML. I am producing some <em>shaky</em> RTF (it works but needs improvement).

        My next improvement is to add a <em>style</em> for doing Patterns in an Alexandrian form.

        So far, it works great.

        <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a> uses something very similar for Perl 5 documentation. He calls it ``perlpod<em> (Perl Plain Old Documentation).

        I now do all my pattern writing using AFT. My PLoP96 paper was written by me and my co-author using AFT because I don't have access to MS Word. It was an interesting collaborative experience. I used emacs; he used Word. We exchanged pattern edits via mail. Our patterns were hyperlinked when online and <em>referential</em> when printed. The final conference paper was produced directly from AFT sources.

        If this is a pattern, I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>. When I was revising for my final exams, I wanted to write revision notes on my computer. I didn't have (or want) word, HTML is too verbose to write by hand, and plain text wasn't expressive enough. So, i cooked up a 'revision notes' format; this is a hierarchical format, where curly-brace-delimited sections contain other sections, and each section has a title and some content paragraphs. There are simple conventions for _italics_ and *bold*, as well as for embedding an [+image.png], a [:<a href="http://hyperlink.com/like/this.html],">http://hyperlink.com/like/this.html],</a> a [*"Literature reference" Anderson T. (2002) Wiki Wiki Web 12(3):456], and internal [=anchors] and [>links]. I wrote programs to convert these files to HTML representations, either of the whole thing, or just the section titles (as nested ordered lists), or just section titles plus references, etc. <em></em>'N.B.<em>' the bold tag in this example was not closed.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I still use this format for making notes - it's so much more simple and compact than any real format.

        I deem it unfortunate that Wiki's <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a> originally chose to use apostrophes to mark emphasis.  It doesn't look right when read in source form, and it's not very intuitive. -- <a href="PanuKalliokoski.html">PanuKalliokoski</a>
