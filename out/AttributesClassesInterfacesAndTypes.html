        This page was intended to discuss with people that there are different types of <a href="SoftwareArchitect.html">SoftwareArchitect</a>s doing different things. Some <a href="ArchitectsPlayGolf.html">ArchitectsPlayGolf</a>, some ArchitectsPlayGod, and some <a href="ArchitectsJustPlay.html">ArchitectsJustPlay</a>. <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a> responded, and most of the page had been a dialogue with him. Unfortunately with WikiTechnology here anyone can respond, and therefore the page is getting more messy than it necessary.

        <em>If so, then this page is poorly named. I'm loath to suggest such a long name, but </em>ArchitectureIsNotAboutAttributesClassesInterfacesAndTypes perhaps better catches the meaning. There must be a shorter way to name this concept...<em> <I accept some architects, and in some situations, do value the skills and insights related to a </em>DeepKnowledge of xxxxxxx.

        <em>Complete non-sense, </em><a href="ArchitectsPlayGolf.html">ArchitectsPlayGolf</a> and <a href="ArchitectsJustPlay.html">ArchitectsJustPlay</a> are OrganizationalAntiPatterns. If you think that attributes classes, interfaces andn types are not your concerns, then you shouldn't be "architect". If you are in charge of picking up tools and technologoies, find your best developer, and ask for professional advice. Do not assume that if you can google for buzz-words, read expensive "industry reports" filled with trivialities at best, and more often than not with wrong information, then you have some kind of competence on judging the merits of technologies as they may apply (or not apply) to a software project. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now the extraordinarily funny </em>MetaAntiPattern at work here is that the so-called "architect", not only applies anti-patterns in his parochial business environment, but wants to promote them urbis et orbis as "patterns" on a site like c2 (which is by programmers and for programmers). And in the process he deploys CollaborationAntiPatterns and even those he tries to promote as <a href="CollaborationPatterns.html">CollaborationPatterns</a>.<em></em>

        I've never understood what someone could do with tools like <a href="JavaAndDotNet.html">JavaAndDotNet</a> if <a href="AttributesClassesInterfacesAndTypes.html">AttributesClassesInterfacesAndTypes</a> were not their concern.  How do you use them? -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The statement at the top is probably an extreme form of rhetorics.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Having said this, I would suggest the (top section) statements draw attention to the fact that architectural projects need to be started in <a href="TopDown.html">TopDown</a> manner. 
        </li>
        <li>
           At higher level, <a href="StrategicAlignmentOfItProductsAndServices.html">StrategicAlignmentOfItProductsAndServices</a>, <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a>, and GovernanceVsManagement issues are on focus and need to be resolved. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Subsequently, on the issue of <a href="SystemsArchitecture.html">SystemsArchitecture</a>, one need to examine alternate desired and achievable target frameworks. A reference technical architecture need to be built with consideration of funding and <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a> concerns.
        </li>
        <li>
           A key aspect is legacy considerations. One does not go about implementing a <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a>, if <a href="CulturalReadiness.html">CulturalReadiness</a> is lacking. Lots of projects fail due to failures in achieving the cultural change in a timely fashion.
        </li>
        <li>
           Legacy considerations also include analysis of skills and synergies. For example, if  <a href="EssentialSkillsForAgileDevelopment.html">EssentialSkillsForAgileDevelopment</a> is nonexistent, then perhaps it is not yet time to consider a <a href="JavaPlatform.html">JavaPlatform</a>, if you haven't got one already. So maybe it is forget <a href="EnterpriseServiceBus.html">EnterpriseServiceBus</a>, and consider <a href="EnterpriseApplicationIntegration.html">EnterpriseApplicationIntegration</a> instead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometime later, the architects come to more technically relevant areas. This is the intense "Golf playing" stage. Middle user management (lots of people) make or break "proof of concept" and QuickWin projects, so it may be necessary to <a href="GetIndividualBuyInBeforehand.html">GetIndividualBuyInBeforehand</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is already a business endorsed ApplicationArchitecture in place, and some funding prioritization to make the transition (from here to there). Assume there is already senior (perhaps board level) support for the aquisition (and implementation) of an <a href="EnterpriseResourcePlanning.html">EnterpriseResourcePlanning</a> package. There need to be exercises to examine what specific functions to acquire and implement. The "Golf playing" include the networking with peers in other companies, to understand what and how things might work, what level of user participation is needed when, whether you need interim technologies / solutions. Inhouse people, architects included, just do not have all the required knowledge of solutions and their limitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also the stage the architectural team need to work with "delivery areas" (application and enduser) to agree on resource and schedules. A proposal is needed for signoff, to obtain reaffirmation of the business commitment, and to start dependent processes which can include partnering and tendering.
      </p>
      <p>
        There may be some consideration of <a href="AttributesClassesInterfacesAndTypes.html">AttributesClassesInterfacesAndTypes</a>, but these are probably limited, and pale in size compare to policies, contracts, agreements, services, etc.

            <li>
               However my initial reaction is that the <strong> problem started with the deficiencies Governance / IT alignment stage.</strong> And not helped by the knowledge that the company has lots of cash to burn. I had a discussion with a colleague who had decades of IT experience, different from mine, about the two step process. He remarked that in his experience, "sometime later" statement made above was actually a "parallel exercise" in the real world. My reaction at the time was "it takes lots of time to address internal relationship issues". How long? I can say that in my experience one senior manager confirmed in one organization that four years after the initial creation of the "Governance model", they are beginning to put this into practice. Cultures do not change overnight. But that does not mean all development stand still. It just meant make sure the culture is right before you undertake massive infrastructure projects.. if you can.

        <em>Huh?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Earlier I said the following and still feel this is how things work in reality. Programmers do not pick tools. Programmers apply tools the best they can, based on software dictated to them by much higher up. The higher ups get their ideas from conferences, presentations (vendor), visits (other companies, vendor labs), their business colleagues who want products only one vendor can provide, paid consultancy studies  etc. I am qualified to say the above because I have worked in various medium to large companies for many years. Inhouse technical staff are often snowed by vendor heavies sent in at product demo (proof of concept, etc) time. This has nothing to do with my personal view, nor the view of any other people, whether this is how things should work. So I keep focused on "what is realistic now and in near future", and talk to people sitting around me (and they all happen to write code, for different platforms).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I assure you that programmers pick their tools.  I've picked every tool I've ever learned, and it's been 15 years since someone "higher up" tried to tell me which tools to use.  I have also worked in various medium to large (5,000 to 100,000 employee) companies for many years.  But I'm still a bit confused about how you learn about tool sets.  The people sitting around you write code, so they must be programmers, correct?  But programmers "do not pick tools", so they are using tools "dictated" to them by non-programmers, also correct?  If so, why do you trust their judgement about tool sets?  And how do you know their assessment is accurate?  -- </em><a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is one of those rare moments where you tried harder than me to explain viewpoint.  What do you mean "how I learn about tool sets".  The first tool I used was Fortran decades ago. The first tool I use at work is Apl, decades ago and none of the programmer types there made the choice of tools. And when I came to participate in the evaluation of tools there were lots of constraints put on our team by all stakeholders, and that was only proper. Now please tell me what do you mean by your 100,000 employee firm go about letting programmers choose their tools. Is it possible you worked for a consultancy selected by a 100,000 employee firm to do software evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not asking about the tools you've used.  I'm asking about the tools you say you don't use.  How do you learn about a tool without using it?  From everything you've said it sounds like you trust the knowledge of others.  From your actions on this wiki it seems like you want us to research tools for you.  Why not get your hands dirty and use these tools yourself?  Then you can come back and tell us what you think.</em>

        <em>In my experience, the degree to which a developer gets to choose his or her own tools depends on the project, the company policy, and the seniority of the developer.  If some combination of these results in a developer (or a set thereof) not being free to choose his or her own tools, it is typical for the toolset to be chosen by some technically astute body, with at least some, and frequently all, input from other programmers.  The reason for this is simple -- the average non-technical manager is more than aware that he or she isn't qualified to recommend one programming language over another, and is likely to face resistance from the developers and/or look stupid and incompetent if he or she makes an uninformed and/or unpleasant choice.  I'm sure there are organisations where such decisions are made over golf games by non-technical people, but I've never done any work for one, and it sounds as dysfunctional as letting a committee of non-drivers choose your next car.  But then again, that view may reflect the fact that I've mainly worked with relatively small companies that valued the opinions of their programmers, and for individual departments in large companies that were granted the flexibility to make language and platform decisions for themselves.  In other words, this may come down to a difference in corporate culture, where </em><a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> works in one type of culture and <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a> works in another.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        <li>
           I've worked in corporate cultures where tool sets were selected by engineering review boards.  Those boards tended to have bright programmers on them, though, who actually used the tools they selected.  Even there the programmers got to choose their tools, though.  If they didn't want to use the selected tools they went someplace else.  Programmers who had chosen those tools were hired to replace them.  -- EH
