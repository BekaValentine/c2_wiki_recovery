        Welsh Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WelshLanguage.html">WelshLanguage</a> is one of the languages of Wales (the one that isn't <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a>). It is a member of the Celtic branch of the Indo-European family of languages. Apparently the celtic languages divide up into two groups: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the Q group (Irish, Scots Gaelic and Manx)
        </li>
        <li>
           the P group (Welsh, Cornish, Breton and (once upon a time) Gaulish)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This grouping is a historical one. It is postulated that all the P languages developed from a common ancestor-language, which became distinguished from the other Celtic languages when its speakers began pronouncing the sound <em>*kw</em> (inherited from proto-indo-european) as the sound <em>p</em>, instead.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The English question pronouns <em>who what when where which why how</em> are also derived from <a href="ProtoIndoEuropean.html">ProtoIndoEuropean</a> *kw/kw*; there is thus a close relation with similar terms in Welsh (pw*) and in the Q group too, IIRC.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This development is supposed to be the explanation for the <em>p~c</em> sound correspondences observable in words of the modern languages. For example, the Welsh word for "head", <em>pen</em>, corresponds to Irish <em>cen</em> (or something like that... I don't know Irish).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> It's ceann, I believe. As to the hard-and-fast P/Q split, see Kim </em>McCone. I think the book is <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0901519405/ref=sr_aps_books_1_2/026-9703678-6105249">http://www.amazon.co.uk/exec/obidos/ASIN/0901519405/ref=sr_aps_books_1_2/026-9703678-6105249</a> , but I could be mistaken. Mae'n hyfryd i weld Cymraeg ar y Wiki. - <a href="LlewelynThomas.html">LlewelynThomas</a> <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, St. Patrick's name gives away the fact that he was a Brit, not Irish, in origin. The originally Irish (Q-celtic) version of the name Patrick is Cethric.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Erm, no. Patrick is a borrowing from Latin Patricius, from patrician. Irish use Padraic for Patrick.</em>

        <dd>Close, but no cigar: it's Padraig --KeithGaughan</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The P-celtic languages are sometimes called Brythonic, and the Q-celtic ones Goidelic.
      </p>
      <p>
        (This grouping might explain why I can sometimes get the gist of Breton, but not Irish. --)
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yr iaith Gymraeg yw iaith Cymru. Mae'n iaith Geltaidd. ("Welsh is the language of Wales. It is a </em><a href="CelticLanguage.html">CelticLanguage</a>.")<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pat, I'd like to buy a vowel!
      </p>

      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>y</em> and <em>w</em> are vowels in Welsh --KeithGaughan</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>So ... a student of these languages would have to be sure to mind their p's and q's?</em>

        Welsh looks more difficult to pronounce than it actually is. I am not a Welsh speaker, but some of the misleading-looking combinations are:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>dd</dt>
        <dd>pronounced th (as in THis or THat).</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>th</dt>
        <dd>pronounced th (as in THree).</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>ll</dt>
        <dd>pronounced <soft ch>l where the soft ch is like the Scottish loch or German ich. - <th as in THree>l <em>is a better approximation of Welsh </em>ll<em>. The quicker you say it, the closer you get to a genuine Welsh </em>ll<em>.</em> (If you position your mouth and tongue to say an s, and then try to say an l, you get ll.)</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>y</dt>
        <dd>most often pronounced like the "schwa" sound in the English word "but", but (in certain words) like the "ee" sound in the English word "beet".</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>u</dt>
        <dd>pronounced like the "ee" sound in the English word "beet".</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>w</dt>
        <dd>most of the time a vowel, like English 'oo'.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>ff</dt>
        <dd>like English "f".</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>f</dt>
        <dd>like English "v".</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>ch</dt>
        <dd>like Scottish "ch", as in "loch".</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>And don't forget some of the dipthongs, like <em>eu</em>, which sound more like <em>ey</em>	</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Then there are the mutations. <em>Gymraeg</em> above is derived from <em>Cymru</em>, but I have forgotten how and why if I ever knew. GoogleIsYourFriend.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Here's how you get <em>Gymraeg</em> from <em>Cymru</em>: the Welsh suffix <em>-eg</em> makes adjectives of nationality and language from country names. So take the word <em>Cymru</em> ('Wales'), add the suffix <em>-eg</em> and, with a little alteration to make it look/sound right, you get <em>cymraeg</em> (adj. 'Welsh') and <em>Cymraeg</em> (adj. and n. 'Welsh [language]', note capitalization).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now for the mutation bit to get from <em>Cymraeg</em> to <em>Gymraeg</em>. Mutations are changes that happen to certain initial letters of words in certain syntactic contexts. There are three types of mutation: soft mutation, nasal mutation and aspirate or spirant mutation. Different contexts produce different types of mutation, and different types of mutation make different changes to letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        In your example above, <em>Yr iaith Gymraeg yw iaith Cymru</em> ('Welsh is the language of Wales'), <em>Gymraeg</em> and not <em>Cymraeg</em> is correct because <em>iaith</em> ('language') is a feminine noun, and an adjective following a feminine noun will undergo a soft mutation. In this type of mutation, the unvoiced consonant <em>c</em> becomes voiced <em>g</em> (other things happen to other letters).
      </p>
      <p>
        If mutations excite you, you can read more at <a href="http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/learnwelsh/pdf/welshgrammar_mutations.pdf.">http://www.bbc.co.uk/wales/learnwelsh/pdf/welshgrammar_mutations.pdf.</a> To assist in searching for more, the Welsh for <em>mutation</em> is <em>treiglad</em>, pl. <em>treigladau</em>.

        <em>pattern-identification, maybe? It was actually the Welsh who adapted the Roman alphabet to represent their own vernacular.</em>

        <dd>In fairness, Welsh orthography identifies it's pronunciation at least as well as Spanish. It just looks a little alien.</dd>

        Well that shows up my history knowledge, then.

        In middle school, my best friend and I tried Memory Chess, with a standard opening setup and standard rules, but no physical board. I think Welsh Scrabble would be a similar exercise in <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>.
