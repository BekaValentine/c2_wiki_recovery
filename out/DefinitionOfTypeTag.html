        Definition Of Type Tag
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an attempt to define Top's "side tag" typing model, which is subject to many heated debates between Top and others on this wiki. 
      </p>
      <p>
        An informal definition of Top's "side tag" is a language system or engine that "act likes" it has a side tag to indicate types other than the value itself. "Acts like" is used to avoid prematurely tying it to actual implementation. Further, it should be considered a "working definition" for the scope of only this wiki rather than universal, although universal attempts are welcome here. Just please state this assumption. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So far there are 3 candidate definitions, and there is discussion about whether "tags" should be considered a <em>model</em> for prediction such that having a definition is of secondary importance.
      </p>

      <p>
        Attempt #1:
      </p>
      <code>
        A language uses the "type tag model" if it's possible to get different<br/>
        results for two different variables even if their string representation<br/>
        is identical. Scope differences excluded (local versus public, etc.)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Well, now we have a definition of "a language uses the 'type tag model'". What about "type tag"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Furthermore, what does "it's possible to get different results for two different variables ..." mean? When and where do these "different results" manifest themselves, and in what manner? What do you mean by "results"? What do you intend by the sentence fragment, "Scope differences excluded ..."?}
      </p>
      <p>
        Would you suggest a topic name change to DefinitionOfTypeTagModel? I'm not sure what your point is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a>: test_53
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as "different results":
      </p>
      <code>
        print(toString(a) == toString(b));  // result: True<br/>
        print(myPureFunction(a) == myPureFunction(b)); // result: False<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Alternative:
      </p>
      <code>
        if ((toString(a)==toString(b)) And Not (myPureFunction(a)==myPureFunction(b))) {<br/>
        print("Possible type tag detected.")<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Consequence of this definition: Whether a language uses the "type tag" model depends on its toString function. 
        If a language has a toString method which completely represents its internal structure, then that language doesn't use the tag model. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You didn't do what you set out to do. You said you wanted to define "type tag". That's all well and good, but instead you define "a language uses the 'type tag model'".</em>

        <strong>Attempt #2:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        Given two variables, <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. If it's possible to get different<br/>
        results using identical operations or transformations upon these two variables even if <br/>
        their textual representation is identical, then the set of <br/>
        properties for <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> that cause <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> to give different <br/>
        results is called a "type tag". If it's not possible to get different results, <br/>
        then a given variable has no type tag.<br/>
        Scope differences excluded (local versus public, etc.)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Questions:
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you mean the textual representation of the 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           declaration of the variables
        </li>
        <li>
           the expression(s) used to assign a value to the variables
        </li>
        <li>
           the value literal(s) occurring in the assignment
        </li>
        <li>
           (causing recursion) variables occurring in otherwise equal expressions in the assignment above
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Textual representation of the "value" of the variable. I realize that some languages have a "dump" value that may be different than a "print" value. The "dump" value is generally used for debugging or serialization across servers etc., while the "print" value is designed more for end-users. People may have to first agree on which best represents the "value" of a variable that "prints" out in a production "output" sense. How to work that into the definition is still an open issue.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By identical operation do you mean
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the operations have the same name
        </li>
        <li>
           ... the same definition
        </li>
        <li>
           ... the same source text
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Same source text, such as same expression.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Just to exclude the obvious: Consider the identity function id:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = 1<br/>
        b = 2<br/>
        id(a) -> 1<br/>
        id(b) -> 2 <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This returns different results and according to the definition I'm bound to call the difference a type-tag, even though it is just a different value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus something about the variables must be equal, otherwise values would be type tags.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please state the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't understand what the above example is intending to show. What is "id", and why are the variables given different assignments? That would give them different "printable" values, and thus disqualify them. Is "id" similar to the RAM address of the variable? I suppose that's one of those weird exceptions, such as scope differences that may have to be excluded. It may be difficult to make a definition without a messy list of exceptions. But first let's work out the "gist".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hm. If everything is the same (value, function, expression) there will never be a difference and hence no type tag.
        Something has to differ. I have to assume that you mean the 'printed' value at some intermediate place be the same like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = "2"<br/>
        b = 2<br/>
        toString(a) -> "2"<br/>
        toString(b) -> "2"<br/>
        toString(dup(a)) -> "22"<br/>
        toString(dup(b)) -> "4"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Thus it looks as if you define type tag relative to some toString method. So it appears you have to specify the toString method in more detail. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that there are some languages where the default toString method renders a string "2" as ""2"" and a numeric 2 as "2", so theses differ in these languages and thus there'd be no type tag differing between "2" and 2.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm not sure what you mean here. It's false that "their textual representation is identical" if one has quotes and the other doesn't when "printed", and thus they are not covered by the definition. (What kind of goofy language would do that anyhow?)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Actually I like languages where the default toString method returns the notation to recreate the value. Scheme does this. It simplifies reading debug output because it avoids extra type annotations (at least in the base cases).

                   [I think you're misunderstanding something. Scheme (and other languages; the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> does this too) avoids showing "internal gobbledygook" that other languages might display. This not only simplifies reading debug output, but all output. Java's (and C#'s equivalent) toString(), for example, is often misused to produce output full of "internal gobbledygook". However, the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> (for example) always outputs values in a format that re-creates the value if used as input.]

        We've had a similar discussion in <a href="TopsTypeDeterminatorChallenge.html">TopsTypeDeterminatorChallenge</a> over "types" and "cats" (feline). The state of the art is still not beyond the "I know it when I see it" stage. Historical-pattern recognition is not sufficient for a definition. - t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course it is. What do you think definitions are?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Definitions are often influenced by historical patterns, but don't actually use historical patterns as PART of the definition itself. If I look up "bonnet" in the dictionary, it usually described the characteristics of a bonnet(s); it doesn't define it as "looking very similar to the following pictures....". It may have pictures as side info, but does not use the pictures as the definition itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Typically, a definition for a term <x> is simply an agreed set of terms that accurately reflects a common understanding of <x>.

      </p>
      <p>
        "Common understanding" is not sufficient for settling controversy and differences in viewing/modeling things. "Good enough" for general or "most popular" notions, perhaps, but that obviously should not be considered the pinnacle of communication.

        If they were truly formal and thorough, then a machine could be constructed that would be able to take a programming language grammar and compiler/interpreter as input, and unambiguously label the parts of source code.

        <em>Why do you think that's possible? There's a vast gulf between making a definition unambiguous and making artificial intelligence.

        The point is to be able to "apply" allegedly formal definitions such that given sufficient info about the language grammar and behavior, a machine (algorithm) could determine if a definition applies to parts of a given (and potentially new) programming language without human intervention.

        Top-- since you are the one who invented the term type tag, do you have any examples of languages that use the "type tag model" or dont use the "type tag model". Do you have any example programs that illustrate the model. I.e. a program that would behave differently if the language did not use the "type tag model".

        <a href="ColdFusionLanguageTypeSystem.html">ColdFusionLanguageTypeSystem</a> and <a href="TypelessVsDynamic.html">TypelessVsDynamic</a> discuss the issue. The tricky part is defining and/or characterizing it it in terms of <strong>externally-observable behavior</strong> versus as an implementation versus a model. The boundary between all of these can be blurry because a sufficiently-explicit model usually *is* an implementation. The models of the type tag I prefer resemble this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Diagram var_01:
      </p>
      <code>
        Variable: [ [name] [tag] [value] ]  // tag-based model<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Variable: [ [name] [value] ]  // tag-free model<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But turning it into explicit language/rules/definitions that people agree on, both practitioners and the academic type, can get sticky. The above resembles an implementation model, but we can't assume that one can open up the hood and see the implementation because the same language can be implemented many different ways. A language is not defined by the compiler/interpreter implementation techniques it uses. But we can present a model that resembles an implementation that predicts behavior (input-to-output), and this can be a "tag model".
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to move past "I know X when I see X" with regard to both types and type-tags, but it's an elusive goal for everybody. We can make models that mirror our personal notions (or Cardelli's), but saying it's the "right" model is another level. --top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If the goal is a model rather than a description of implementation, wouldn't the following be sufficient?</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Variable: [ [name] [type] [value] ]       // variables are typed<br/>
      </code>
      <code>

           They are your words: "it appears that "tag" is an unnecessary synonym for "type" ". Thus, Types == Tags.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Types are much more than just a tag. A type is (simplistically) a set of values and operations on those values. A "tag" -- in the usual meaning of the term -- is an integer or string value, typically used solely as an indicator to distinguish one item making use of a tag from another. Above, you appear to be using "tag" as a synonym for "reference to a type". That's not the same thing as "tag" is-a "type", any more than "pointer to integer" is the same thing as "integer". Sometimes we treat them as the same in discussion -- e.g., for the sake of convenience we say "integer p" when we mean "the integer pointed to by p" -- but that doesn't mean they are the same.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Yes,"sometimes". We need a stronger model than "sometimes"; stronger than the fuzzy language that's often used in practice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I can only answer that if given a reasonably-clear definition of "type". Sure, "tag" may not be well-defined either, but it doesn't have the baggage of an overloaded history. - t
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps a "tag" can be seen as merely a <strong>second value</strong>. The built-in operations of the language tend to favor the transparency of one over the other, but that is a "soft" rule. I've shown in <a href="TopsTypeDeterminatorChallenge.html">TopsTypeDeterminatorChallenge</a> that they are potentially interchangeable: we can use the "type tag" to "hold" information we normally associate with a "value", for example. We could call it the "dual value model" and it would have pretty much the same properties as the other candidates. - t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If "tag" doesn't mean "type", then I assume a variable can have a tag of, say, "3" or "Dave"? Obviously, that is ludicrous. "Tag" only makes sense as a synonym for "type", thus it is redundant.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What is "done with" the tag is up to the language. I observe patterns in their typical actual usage, but that's not rigorous. One can use a wrench to drive in nails, and it works. It's just not as "effective".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sorry, not following you. Do you know of any programming language where a "type tag" is anything but a type?</em>

      <p>
        <em>Once again, you are conflating "understanding" with "computability" (they are unrelated!), and mistakenly believing your personal lack of understanding about types represents some general (and non-existent!) lack of understanding about types among the </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> communities.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not convinced there's a hard distinction. See <a href="ChineseRoomArgument.html">ChineseRoomArgument</a>. Further, "understanding" may be inadvertently defined in your head as "uses my favorite model also". Further, <a href="TopsTypeDeterminatorChallenge.html">TopsTypeDeterminatorChallenge</a> doesn't ask the machine to "understand" something, only label "types" properly and expose the rules/algorithm for all to see. "Understanding" is generally the ability to apply a model to some external activity or object. But that doesn't necessarily mean the model is the "proper" model, unless prediction against some external event is taking place, but you haven't defined what that external thing is. Testing that my head model matches your head model is of little practical use unless it can be codified and externally examined. Arguing about what <strong>can't be measured</strong> is often futile.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you said that the tag "resembles a type", your head did some kind of <strong>computation</strong> to come to that conclusion. Why can't you codify the rules/formulas/algorithms your head used to make that determination when you made that statement? "It feels like a type" is not very useful here.

        <em>I didn't write 'tag "resembles a type"'. Please read what I wrote. I wrote that '"tag" only makes sense as a synonym for "type", thus it is redundant.' In other words, your model makes "tag" into an alternative term for "type", but "type" is well-known whereas your use of "tag" is not. Therefore, your use of the term "tag" in place of "type" is unnecessary. If you can rigorously show that "tag" is different from "type" but explains all the same behaviours, then you may be onto something.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, "type" is well-known, but also overloaded. Commonality is hardly the only concern. Again, I don't wish to bring something with historical baggage and other distracting complexities into the model. I can define "tag" as a "secondary value" and it's simple and fits into the model. When you tie a simple definition to a complex definition, it's no longer simple because it inherits the complexity of the added complex part. I <strong>don't want to foul up the model with drama-laden parts</strong>.

        <em>What do you mean by "type is overloaded"? What's a "secondary value"? What do you mean by "drama-laden parts"? What drama?</em>

        <em>Unless you intend "tag" to mean something other than "type" -- and I'd like to see an example of a language where that's the case -- surely you'll inevitably be talking about types anyway, because that's what tags refer to, no?</em>

      <p>
        <em>As far as I can tell, you are using the term "tag" in precisely the places where a programmer, software engineer, or computer scientist would normally use the term "type" in a familiar, recognisable, and generally unambiguous way. Even beginners to programming quickly understand types via simple examples, like "integer", "string" and "float". What would these be in your model? Integer tags and string tags? How does that make them easier to understand?</em> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yes, but it's a vague notion, <strong>a feeling</strong>; the classic "I know it when I see it" due to historical pattern matching, but not rigorously defined in a codified way such that it's existence on/in an instance of something can be falsified.

        <li>
           <em>I rather doubt any programmer, software engineer, or computer scientist would regard a type reference as "a vague notion, a feeling". Types are rigorously defined in theoretical terms, but they are informally recognisable in programming languages by even a programming beginner.

           It fails "rigorous" for reasons given above. And if each compiler/interpreter decides using it's OWN rules (or the maker's rules), that's local/working definition of types, not universal. For example, many programming languages use something called "function" even though they don't fit the strict definition because they allow side-effects. They are labelled in a vague "notiony" sense, not rigor. - t

        <em>I don't see how using the term "tag" makes understanding types the relationship to language behaviour any clearer.

      <p>
        Again, familiarity is not the same as thoroughness. I am not sure what you mean by additional level of indirection. Where are you getting your two example mappings from?

      <p>
        <em>By additional level of indirection, I mean this: You say a value has a tag, but apparently a tag always refers to a type. So: "Value has a tag" can also be written as "value --> tag". Therefore, "value has a tag, and tag always refers to a type" can also be written as "value --> tag --> type". But what does "value --> tag --> type" mean? Apparently, it means "value --> type". Hence, there is an additional level of indirection between "value" and "type" in stating "value --> tag --> type", because "value --> type" means exactly the same thing.</em>

      <p>
        <em>In other words, "type tag" simply seems to be your personal terminology for "type reference".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a rigorous definition of "type", one cannot tell. I'll choose simpler atoms over complex and defective ones to build a definition/model around if given a choice. And I never said a value "has a" tag. I consider them distinct in the model. See Diagram var_01. Although, there are different ways to model constants. I choose to model them as anonymous variables for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But there seems to be an obvious relationship between "tag" and "type", and it's trivial to identify the type references and type definitions in any programming language, so surely you can define the relationship between "tag" and "type" without having to define "type", no?</em>

        I'm pretty sure I've encountered such in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> [see below] and Php, I just don't remember the code itself. There was a case where I had to use Php's triple equal sign (===) because a double equal didn't work. Below is an example from ASP.Net -t

        Example "hungry":

        a = "123"<br/>
        b = 123<br/>
        '<br/>
        If a.toString = b.toString And Not myFunction(a) = myFunction(b) Then<br/>
        Response.Write("Possible type tag detected")<br/>
        Else<br/>
        Response.Write("Get me a sandwich, I'm hungry.")<br/>
        End If<br/>
        '<br/>

        '----------------------------------<br/>
        Function myFunction(byVal thing As Object) As Object<br/>

        End Function<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The result I get is "Possible type tag detected". For type "String", the plus sign appends, but adds arithmetically if it's type Integer. (I've put comment markers on blank lines because of a spacing bug on this wiki.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing this also gives a result:
      </p>
      <code>
        Dim a As Object<br/>
        Dim b As Object<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Thus, the quotes seem to be used to "set" the internal tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no overloaded operators in <a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a>. There is also no equivalent of Php's "getType()" function. I believe one can trigger a result in Php by replacing the equivalent "myFunction" in Php with:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = "123";<br/>
        b = 123;  // no quotes<br/>
        ...<br/>
        function myFunction($thing) {    // Php<br/>
        return(gettype($thing));<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a> has functions such as "isNumber", but it appears to parse the value, not a type tag. It can't be used to write a "myFunction" that gives a different answer for <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>. Thus, it has no detectable "hidden tag". Placing quotes around the initialization doesn't change any known result.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You've shown that </em><a href="ColdFusionLanguage.html">ColdFusionLanguage</a> internally represents all values as strings.

        Types are defined in a type system. Words are defined in a language. Top's insistence that a definition of type be "universal" to be rigorous is so irrational and unreasonable that it is <a href="NotEvenWrong.html">NotEvenWrong</a>.

        Sure, if you defined "types" to be "the output of the type system". Definitions are the meaning we give words. That is a simple concept. But you would need to be careful to avoid equivocation in arguments using the words "type system" with another meaning.

           Similar to what neural nets do: learn based on "training sets". One could, for example, take 100 programming languages, label the "types" or "type indicators" of each language, and "train" neural nets or some statistical process to be able to take a new programming language as input and spit out the parts labelled in such a way that they'd probably closely match what a person would do. But this is generally not considered a good way to build a definition or a model, similar to using circular regression versus a gravity model in <a href="AddingEpicycles.html">AddingEpicycles</a>. Regression can "match" a process but it is usually not modelling it.

           I don't really know what steps my mind makes to ascertain such, at least not enough to claim or produce an examinable formula/algorithm for them. A lot of it may indeed be historical pattern matching. The human mind generally uses a combination of techniques to make judgements. Note that neural nets are lossy in that they don't necessarily remember each instance of the training set. Plus, it may be continuous, some things are more "businessy" or "loopy" than others. For example, smart languages/compilers can run contents of multiple loops in parallel such that they may not really be "loops". Functional/declarative languages also have things that resemble loops but may not really "be" loops. "Loop-like" is perhaps all one can safely say. It's a continuous/probabilistic way that humans generally classify things in their mind. It's only when it becomes an academic problem that we try to find clear, rigorous, and Boolean (yes/no) definitions and then try to turn wishy washy notions into something more systematic and rigorous. Maybe it's a lost cause and the fuzz is "good enough" or the best we can do at the moment.

        Having and using visual models or visual metaphors has served me relatively well over the years in school and IT.

These are useful for communication, "explaining", and predicting the behavior of software. I often form such models in my head and then test them against reality. If they hold up, I keep them; if not, I tune or toss them. They may not even reflect the underlying actual mechanism, but if they predict it well anyhow, it may not matter. I've yet to see something useful for explaining how "types" work in typical programming languages and the kind of oddities and differences demonstrated on this topic other related topics, other than the tag/flag model.

        Let me make an <a href="EverythingIsRelative.html">EverythingIsRelative</a> statement here. Maybe there is a "proper master model" (PMM) of types that every developer "should" know and use. However, most developers probably don't use this PMM in practice (since its existence is sketchy and cryptic and/or vague). So what are they using instead? Probably some kind of <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> model of their own making (likely a conglomeration of experience-based pattern recognition and "computed" models). 
      </p>
      <p>
        These individual self-rolled models may not be perfect, and this lack of perfection may cause bugs or confusion at times, but the problems are fixed when encountered and the programmer continues on their merry way. Thus, even if the type-tag model isn't "perfect", it can still be a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> just as good as or better than most other typical <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> typing model floating around out there in <em>existing</em> programmer heads.

        <em>Other than obfuscating the simplicity and obviousness of the notion by adding a level of indirection -- you add "variable -> tag -> type" to what can simply be "variable -> type" -- your "model" is functionally indistinguishable from "a variable has / doesn't have a type".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, because "type" can be a "conceptual type" without a computer-kept representation. Example:
      </p>
      <code>
        foo = 347;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The programmer (reader) may conceptually model this as "having" type "number". But in a tag-free system, there is NOTHING inside the computer that tracks number-ness. It's purely <strong>in the reader's head</strong> and has no machine-represented counterpart (other than being parse-able as a number). But in a tag-based system, there is a computer-side representation: the tag. The distinction may become important when foo is used along with other variables or operations such that a conversion, implicit or explicit, may be applied. It affects machine behavior (output).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is usually a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> for programmers to "track" intended type-ness in their head when reading and writing programs, but it does not necessarily have to have a computer-model-side counterpart to get results that are reasonably close to what the programmer intended based on "running" an explicit type model in their head.

        <em>You appear to be saying, in your example, that "a variable doesn't have a type." The alternative -- which you describe as having a "tag" -- is that "a variable has a type."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In most programmers' minds, "can be usable as type X" is nearly synonymous with "has type X". Thus, one could say that foo "has the properties of a number type" or "satisfies the requirements for being a number". This is largely because the practical, observable behavior of tag and non-tag languages is identical in most cases. The observable difference is usually subtle and the situational "fixes" cover up the differences. Thus, your suggestion would be <strong>confusing</strong> to a good many programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, "has the properties of a number" and "is a number" is pretty much the same thing in most programmers' heads, and your approach doesn't help clean up the difference between the two. <strong>"Has the properties of X" can be seen as or mistaken for the same thing as "is X".</strong> In fact, tag-free languages have functions similar to "isNumber()" to test for number-ness. But there is no computer-side representation of "number". (It may pass other isX() tests also at same time, unlike most tag-based systems.)
      </p>
      <p>
        (Earlier in my career I didn't really care or ponder much about the difference either; I just coded, got the program working, fixed any discovered bugs, and continued on. Over time I grew more curious and did more experiments to isolate the differences between the two. It's kind of like when you get a new car: you are happy just to figure out where the basics are so that you can drive to work on time. Over time you start to explore the radio short-cuts and "funny knobs" some more. I wanted a concrete head model that <em>always</em> predicted the output properly; and got the tag model as the product of this.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why do you think my "suggestion would be </em>'confusing<em>' to a good many programmers", given it's what the majority of programmers learn (very early!) in university?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No they don't. They usually encounter the concept of a type-tag in say a compiler class, but other than possible existence don't give it any further thought. Maybe it's covered in an "interpreter" chapter or class, but most seem to forgot about such if it is. A lot of students think, "I want to be an application programmer, not a <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> programmer", and so will just get a passing grade in such a class. If you look at the grades, most students get a "C" if the school has balanced grading. My degree did NOT formally cover interpreters, although I didn't choose the <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> sub-specialty. They had about 5 sub-specialties IIRC such that only about 20% of CS grads would have covered interpreters thoroughly.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even if they did, it's still useful to make a distinction between "having a type" and "having a tag" because one may not know if one is talking about their head model or the interpreter's guts. Often when talking to other programmers or working out designs, one tends to think at a higher abstractions level than perhaps what the interpreter can provide such that it's best to be clear.

        <em>You appear to be conflating understanding of language behaviour -- which is what the majority of programmers learn (very early!) in university -- with language implementation.

        No, you are, and that's the problem. And sometimes it takes experience before one realizes the impact of such distinctions. Most students have a lot going on their head at the same time, trying to absorb so much in such short periods. <strong>Subtlety often escapes them</strong>.

        I already explained why "has a type" is ambiguous.

My explanations look perfectly good to me, I don't know why you are rejecting them.

      <p>
        <em>In the eleven uses of "ambiguous" on this page, none appear to explain why "has a type" is ambiguous.

Introducing "has a tag" as a substitute for "has a type" adds nothing but complexity and irrelevancy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope, because tag-free dynamic languages like Perl and CF behave <strong>different than</strong> tag-based dynamic languages like Php and <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. There are different kinds of dynamic typing. Haven't we been over this already? (I'm not sure I'd call C# "static". It's kind of a hybrid because it allows "object" types that can morph into or be treated as the other base types during run-time.)
      </p>
      <p>
        You have no decent model that can explain the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The different kinds of dynamic typing are trivially explained by values and variables having or not having types.

(And, yes, C# supports 'object' as an alias for Object, which is the base type for all other types. It's still statically typed, and there is no "morph" (whatever that might be) involved.)</em>

      <p>
        "Having" is confusing, per above. We are going around in circles again. It seems we are using different assumptions about the minds of programmers, and these assumptions are not readily empirically testable here, so we are stuck at an impasse. (I disagree with your characterization of C#, but will save that debate for another day.)

      <p>
        <em>Beware of conflating your personal "having" difficulties with a general confusion. (C# supports class inheritance, and in languages with class inheritance it is typical to be able to assign values of type T' to variables of type T when T' is inherited from T, because T' is-a T. In this case, T is type Object and T' is every other type. The same is true of Java for all but the primitive built-in types. Both are statically-typed languages.)</em>

        Perhaps you are doing the opposite conflating. All we <em>both</em> have are anecdotes and counter-anecdotes. You or somebody similar have suggested elsewhere that you are not very interesting in the psychology of "ordinary" programmers because it hinders your goal of "learning from the best". Well, I <em>am</em> interested the psychology of "ordinary" programmers and do pay attention to it. Perhaps my observations have some flaws, but that's probably true of anybody who doesn't have a secret shortcut to observation.

      <ul>

           No, because it's different than how say Php or JS would do it. It is an issue, but again often subtle in terms of results.

           Please elaborate. "Have type" is ambiguous for reasons already explained. Regardless of how you or I label/classify stuff, the two classes of dynamic languages <strong>act</strong> different. Call the difference floo, zog, or flurddle, it's still a concrete difference.

           <em>"Have type" appears to be ambiguous to you, but not in general. Some dynamic languages represent values using various types such as string, integer, float, etc. Others represent all values as strings of characters. This choice of representation affects how the language behaves.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           "Relates to" and "associated with"? That just drips with clarity. Note that in non-tag langs, the property of "numberness" is "associated with" a variable/value if it can be used AS a number. It's just not "explicitly" associated with it, and I use "explicitly" in a notiony sense.

      <ul>
        <li>
           In non-tag languages, numberness can be "associated with" (your words) variables (or their content). It's just that it's "done" differently than tag langs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The usual way to describe "numberness" is "numeric type". The usual way to describe a variable's content is a value.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I thought you said that tag-free languages don't "have" types. You complained that tag was synonymous with "type" and therefore redundant. But this appears to contradict that claim because number-ness can be determined withOUT a tag. (Let's just consider the scalar level right now.)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I don't recall saying "tag-free languages don't 'have' types", and it seems unlikely that I would. That sounds like a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of something I wrote. Can you show me where I wrote that?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are thus saying that CF "has" types (where CF uses only parse-based-typing), yet you say "tag" in my model is synonymous with "type". But the lack of a tag in my model "state" for CF modeling is what explains the <strong>difference</strong> in output between the two "kinds" of dynamic languages. But if I follow what you said above, then there would be no difference in the state of the models under parse-based and tag-based langs, meaning it won't explain the output diff. Identical model states will produce identical results, which contradicts the reality of output of the thing being modeled. We want our models to match reality, no?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The "lack of a tag" in your model is equivalently explained, in precisely the same case and exactly the same results, by the phrase "lack of association with a type."</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wrong! There is the potential association "can be interpreted/used as type X", which doesn't distinguish problem cases. You agreed that that association may be called a "type"; but permitting it breaks your model's forecasting ability.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Sorry, not following you here. Are you claiming there are cases where "tag" is not equivalent to "type", or at least not equivalent to "reference to type"? If so, can you give an example?</em> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Note that it may be possible to model parse-based typing via a tag(s), but there are at least two problems. First, it's possible that it may "have" more than one "type" at the same time, such as "number" AND "string", because parsing successfully as an X does not preclude ALSO parsing successfully as a Y, meaning your model would need to handle <strong>multiple tags</strong> per variable; and second, it's superfluous in that it's not necessary to model the behavior of such langs (but is necessary for tag-based languages). Third, it doesn't emphasize the difference between both language kinds. The difference has to be stuffed into ugly little specific rules of the model. Occam's razor says toss it. (At least toss it if explaining/modeling type-related behavior is your primary goal of using the model. I agree that different models may illustrate different things better. One model to explain/illustrate/predict <em>everything</em> well may be unrealistic.)

With mine the difference is clear-cut: with a tag in place, you get one answer, and with the tag not in place, you get a different answer because there is simply NO tag around to provide the info available in the tagged version. It's simply there or not there; there's no half there or connected with fuzzy wires or have semi-transparent walls that let some unspecified things in but not other unspecified things in. You have no clear visual nor step-by-step counter-part, at least without fuzzy membranes between parts.

           CF and Perl could in theory "compress" numbers under the hood to something similar to a Double and nobody would be able to tell the difference in terms of output. We don't even know that Php or JS don't store numbers as strings (or vice verse) under the hood (when possible). We couldn't tell without dissecting the run-time memory image or interpreter source code. Thus "choice of representation" is NOT a defining difference because the rep could be <strong>swapped</strong> and programs would run identically (other than speed/RAM issues). What I offer is a model that has <strong>prediction ability</strong>, but does not intend/guarantee to accurately model actual implementation. But it would work in the swapped implementation scenario because of this. - t

           CF has optional "type checked" function parameters. The attribute even uses the word "type". They are just checked a bit differently than tag-based dynamic langs. Thus your notion that CF does not "have" types appears to contradict your statement.

           "Associated with" doesn't tell me anything other than there's some unnamed relationship. I don't see your stated CF reference above. Essentially what CF does (or acts like) is parse-validate the byte string to see if it fits the syntactic profile of "number". Either way, "numberness" is a determinable attribute of the contents of the variable (passed "value"). Tag-based languages will also do this, but only if the "tag" says it's something other than a number.

        C-sharp has two kinds of types, compile-time types (seen with "typeof") and run-time types. We can model this with two tags: one tag that's locked at run-time and one that isn't.

        Couldn't one declare that all variables in a dynamically-typed language are subclasses of some flexible "god type", and therefore statically typed? That's essentially what C# can be, except that there are other optional types besides the God Type (Object) to choose from.

      <p>
        No, the God Type in the dynamic language is the one and only type from birth to death. Anything else that resembles a type is merely something else or the type of the value, not the variable just like your rejection of the "getType" method above.

      <p>
        <em>You mean Object is a base class? I've never heard that described as a "God Type" before. In C#, integer, string, Dictionary, etc., are all subclasses of Object and can therefore be assigned to variables of type Object.

You can assign an integer value to a variable of type Object, but you can't assign an Object value to a variable of type integer.</em>

      <p>
        That's pretty much how tag-based dynamic languages work, regardless of what label you glue on it. You can call it subclassing or plagnorffing, but it's pretty much the same result.

      <p>
        To use our specimen languages, there are no tags in Perl and CS (at least when used as scalars) because there are no (known) observable traits that cannot be determined by examining the output (string representation). However, in Php and <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, there are such traits (as illustrated by prior examples). - t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That appears to be a definition by incomplete exclusion, which is a bit awkward -- like saying "a frog is a creature that can be identified by its legs but not by counting them." You've said a "type tag is an observable trait ... that cannot be determined by examining the canonical string representation". How, then, do you observe that trait? Are you saying that a "type tag" exists where two values have the same canonical string representation but behave differently? Isn't that more trivially stated that the variables (do you mean values? variables don't have string representations) or constants have different types but the same string representation? It appears, from the above, that Perl and CF represent scalar values as a string type whereas PHP and Javascript represent scalar values using various types.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I already gave coded examples of how such traits can be isolated. I have since added "content" to clarify the "variable" issue. I'm not going to use the word "type" because it's either ambiguous or not determinable by practical means (as our long debates over it have shown). Your use of "represent" is also questionable. Representation or its impact would have to be observable in some way to be objective or stable enough for a definition. I agree the exclusion approach is awkward, but tags can potentially store or do a lot of stuff.

        Test_53 is an example of "observing traits of variables". Printing "typeOf()" is another. We probe and test it like a scientist does to new species of animal. How does Species A act in box 7 compared to how Species B acts? And I've already explained difficulties with existing general notions of "types". I wish to avoid using "type" for now because language is poisoning this whole debate and I just wish to only describe observable traits for now on rather than "probe head notions" further.

How about this experiment: explain the differences in the two "kinds" of dynamic languages withOUT using existing language terms such as type, value, variable, etc. Call them Flig, Mook, Zog, etc. or whatever. Just make sure that whatever rules and terms your model uses are clear and self-standing. None of this, "programmers already know what X's are" stuff.

        <em>"Tag-free" appears to be your label for some languages that have variables without type references and values that are always of type "string".

        But you just said "as needed"? The contradiction is back. Your "as needed" contradicts "no type references ANYWHERE". Nowhere-ness and as-needed-ness cannot exist at the same time in a language, at least not without adding caveat rules to the model, complicating it.

           You seem to be tripped up by the word "type". It could just as well be called "validation" or "groppnipping". Yes, the "validation" is needed, but <strong>not</strong> a tag.

           "Often" is not good enough. <em>Often</em> the existing feel-ish notions of "types" work just fine; to that I agree. But I don't want just "often" here, I want an "always" model, at leave very close to 100%. Or, at least explain a <strong>pattern I see</strong> that creates two "kinds" of languages.

           "Type" is vague; that's the bottom line. I'm not going to build a model around a vague idea if it makes it too complex. You are force-fitting. Again, if the tag/type is "always there", then it cannot be used to explain the diff between tagged and non-tagged languages. And we don't need it for example CF002: it explains nothing and <strong>provides no prediction benefit</strong>. Why add extra parts to the model of they don't affect it? The model is just plain simpler if we simply say language set X has a tag while language set Y does not have a tag. If that's not obvious, I don't know what else to do at this point. Perhaps we should just end this and <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a>. You haven't shown how your model explains the difference other than on a case-by-case basis say that something is ignoring your fuzzy "type reference". You complicate the model by trying to apply "type reference" on a case-by-case basis because then you need <strong>lots of specialized rules</strong> rather than simply saying "all languages of set X have no tags".

           <strong>The language calls it "type", not me</strong>. If given a choice between model simplicity and fitting programming street terminology, in this case I'll go with model simplicity. The primary purpose of the tag model is to improve results prediction in a way that's relatively easy to explain. The notion-y fuzz was the state of affairs BEFORE the tag model. Further, calling it a "tag" reduces confusion when language words like "type" come up. Using your suggestion that tag=type increases confusion. I don't have to use the word "type" to explain anything because my model needs no parts called "types". - t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Granted, languages may intermix type-related concepts such as validation and the IS-A hierarchical style of "types", but that's going to happen regardless because there are different ways to do type-ish things and diff languages will straddle these in various ways to various degrees and make up their own terms or usages of existing terms. I'm just trying to clarify it all by <strong>making a mechanical/visual model instead of a verbal model</strong>. Your verbal model is too complex and vague; and I'm not even sure it can be made to work right (by adding more rules). - t

        <li>
           I <strong>don't know how</strong> to clearly explain "types". Type is a vague concept. I can explain them in a fuzzy notion-y sense, but that's not always helpful when it comes to actual details of production languages. That's the very reason why I evolved the tag model: because I wanted a consistent, clear model. Like I said elsewhere, it may not matter if you call the parts, "zizzles", "friddles", and "flackabobs" as long as they clearly do their job in the model. Matching the external vocabulary is a nice bonus if it can be done smoothly, but so far nobody has done it. You are welcome to try. That being said, one can use the tag model to explain specific situations in such languages, such as parse-based "typing" ("typing" used in a loose sense) versus tag-based typing (or combo-typing). Some languages and/or operations use the tag, some only use the value. One can do experiments to see if a thing is ignoring the tag and then they have a better idea of how it reacts to dynamic data.

           <em>But it's clear that your "tags" and the "types" that programmers are familiar with are closely related.

Surely, therefore, you have to draw some clear connection between "tags" and "types"? How will you explain it? It certainly isn't clear to me from your descriptions -- they suggest to me that "tag" == "type reference", but you say they're not the same -- and I use and implement programming languages including type systems. How do you expect it to be clear to programmers without that level of experience?

           "Know [types] well" is debatable. As a general notion-y feeling, yes, but that doesn't answer some sticky areas of dynamic languages where most programmers just use trial and error or "defensive" techniques to work around them. I wanted something less ambiguous and that's why I worked toward a more mechanical/visual model that "explains" (predicts) certain language differences. I suspect you are a linguistic thinker such that MV models perhaps confuse you more than help. Perhaps different models fit better to different minds. I generally don't like linguistic models.

It's easier to say the "the value is parsed" for fit such that we don't have to model a temporary tag-like thingy. You are adding unnecessary state and parts to the model.

           Like I already explained, "type" is ambiguous, which is the main reason why I go with "tag" instead. If one just "ignores it", then it's not clear what role it's playing (or not playing) to explain/model why the two kinds of dynamic languages behave different. It makes things far more obvious to lop it off altogether for Type II languages. Why have distracting clutter floating around the model? And the missing tag <em>highlights</em> the fact that it's not being used. Non-use is no longer a rule one has to "just remember", it's in-your-face because it's gawwwnnn! <strong>You don't have to remember to ignore something if it's not there to ignore.</strong>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We have a choice: explain it as parse-based testing, or introduce a tag or type-like thingy or whatever it is you call them into that spot of the model. I see no good reason to do the second since it cannot be examined. If it actually did such under the hood, it's garbage-collected away before it affects anything else. And risks confusion with other language models.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
           No. It's automatically explained as only looking at the value since that's all there is. Magic! But because the question of "how can it be done without a tag?" might come up, we offer parse-based validation as a possible processing-based explanation. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {It's not all there is. You also have the part that decides whether or not the value is valid. The current question is "are we going to concern ourselves with it?"}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Since the tag model is to model "type-related or type-like behavior", and the language itself uses the word "type" at that spot, it should probably be addressed as a practical matter. My key point is that we don't need a tag or something like a tag called a "type" to explain observed behavior. The language "acts like" it uses parse-based validation of the value and only the value. There's no evidence it needs to look at the tag or a tag-like thing called a fizzle, dooggle, or "type".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In fact, if we go with your suggested naming, we have <em>more</em> reason to address it because your naming has "type" and the language uses "type" in its syntax. I get away from that more by using "tag".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {The point is, that there is something type-like involved. Something has to determine which values are valid and which aren't. Now, we don't care if you wish to include it or not. Types can explain the behavior of cfargument just as easily as they do with variables and values. Apparently tags can't, so to get an equivalent model, you need to include something besides tags if you wish to explain the behavior of cfargument.}

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not "doing" anything specific or testable. It has no concrete model behavior or results, other than unspecified magic. I want a concrete model, not a fuzzy notion-a-tron.  I want to see something like: step 1, it checks box A, step 2 it copies box B to box X, etc. Concrete. Mechanical. Visual. Hard Walls. Metal, not cotton. Granted, I don't explain "parse-based testing" but that's either understood by most or explainable as a side topic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {What do you mean it's not doing anything specific or testable? Cold-fusion defines what it does. How is that not specific? You can try passing numeric and non-numeric data to the function. How is it not testable?}

      <ul>
        <li>
           What is "it"? The cfArgument statement does the checking. Not a "type", at least not as concrete thing of the model. We can conjure up a "type ghost" that helps the cfArgument statement, but that's just making up parts of the model for undefined reasons or to force adherence to nebulous type feelings out of.....habit?

           How does one test/observe "same type"? And if they are ALWAYS the same, then "type" is superfluous, and can be tossed to avoid distraction.

           <em>An obvious way is to examine variable declarations and/or assignments. "Same type" is still a type of some sort, with associated operations and a set of possible values, unless you're dealing with arbitrary sections of memory of undefined length.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           But in dynamic languages, the boundary tends to be blurry. For example you can usually do string operations on "numbers" (or things that appear to be numbers) and numerical operations on strings, assuming they resemble numbers to a sufficient degree. "Still a type of some sort" is nebulous. Things can be multiple "types" at the same time and different operations can interpret the same variable and same content as a different "type". <strong>Using traditional hierarchical "type" classifications is a poor fit</strong>, and the alternative is messier than the the tag model.

      </ul>

        <li>
           <em>No, it's simple.  The "same type of some sort" is invariably a string.

           Again, what validation is "type checking" and which is not? If it's too open ended it will be difficult to make a clear and consistent model around. Parse-checking is very different from tag checking, and to lump them both together under "types" is asking for confusion. You are <strong>bowing down to pet language</strong>, even if it's the wrong tool for the job. Divorce your ugly nagging types wife and free your mind.

        <li>
           Bzzzzt. Wrong. The pattern is at a language-level. Those langs in the non-tag category <strong>ALWAYS act like they have no tags</strong>, while those in the other camp mix and match tag-based inspection and parsing. Perhaps YOU need the tag model to recognize it for yourself rather than think of it on a case-by-case basis. Your approach seems to be blinding you to larger-level patterns.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please elaborate on this "associate...with". That's too nebulous. And no association is <strong>necessary</strong> for explaining/modeling program behavior, so why introduce such fuzzy ghost terms? Specifically the cfArgument process examines the parameter passing through and it either passes the examination or fails and the program stops. No creation of a reference is necessary; we don't have to glue anything <strong>extra</strong> on to the package; and it doesn't explain anything taking place. I will agree we could perhaps rework the model to include such "association", but it complicates the model. Lack of a tag is conceptually simpler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Associate with" is the intuitive and expected meaning. For example, in a language that specifies a declaration like "int x", we can say that "x is associated with 'int'" and vice versa. "Lack of a tag" is precisely the same as "not associated with a tag".</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But if the association doesn't do anything or does nothing clear-cut, then it's not helping out goal, and may only serve as a <strong>dis</strong>traction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What do you mean by "doesn't do anything"?  In a declaration like "int x", the association of "int" with "x" serves a fundamental purpose: It means "x" can only be assigned integer values.  If "int" wasn't associated with "x", we (and the compiler) wouldn't know what types of values "x" can or can't be assigned.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We are talking about Example CF002, no? Not "int x". If cfArgument by chance makes a temporary tag-like thing, nothing testable uses it. It helps nothing in a forecasting model, existence or not. I suppose the parsing step (model) could create an extra tag with the result of the test, but that's extra steps because you create a (temp) type code first, and then have another comparison to see if the validation is pass or fail based on the set of pass-able types. It's <strong>less steps</strong> to return pass or fail based on a match-parse because the result only has to be a Boolean value in the model regardless of the "type" of the input variable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that tagged dynamic languages may also do parse-checking in some cases, but it's used less often because the tag can be examined first, often eliminating the need for parsing.

        Maybe we should try models that are <strong>semi-machine language</strong>. Such can risk adding low-level detail that we may not need, but machine-language is something that most graduates should have experienced and can be defined in concrete ways where all the bits are X-ray-able and observable with clear ordering and rules. No more "notion processing". But hopefully there is a way to abstract away or postpone the portions that are not in dispute. -t

        <em>Undergrads are often taught the inner-workings of the machine via machine-language, typically in 1st or 2nd year.  However, this illustrates actual mechanics -- I thought your goal was an abstraction or a model?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, that was the goal, but it's not working for either side. Something more explicit may be needed. Abstraction is in the head, and everyone's head is different. We may have to go to a lower level of abstraction to have a prediction model that is clear to both sides. Keep in mind that a virtual machine is not necessarily an (intended) implementation, but rather a model with prediction capabilities.

      <p>
        <em>That's not unreasonable.  Some educational institutions favour giving students a heavy dose of computer architecture and assembly language, often in 1st year, for this reason.</em>

        Like I said somewhere, it depends. My university had about 5 "minors" (sub-specialties) of CS, and only one covered such heavily. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But even if this was the case, the actual tag existence or non-existence would probably be reflected. Dynamic langs like Perl and CF probably only represent scalars as strings without any extra tags for number versus string versus date, etc.; and likewise Php and JS probably have an explicit tag separate from the value. Thus, if type=tag as you assert, then parse-based testing/comparing is not "types". QED. (It would also make CF's use of it in cfArgument a misnomer. But I get away from that problem by using "tag" instead of "type". I've thus solved 2 problems. Now give me my fucking Nobel so that my ego gets even more obese, like the Gods of Logic intended.)

      <p>
        What? So if we have range checking, then it is the "types" of all things in that range? That's ludicrous! Waaay too open-ended. Every WHERE clause is a type picker?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Recall that a popular definition of "type" is that a type defines of a set of values and a set of operations on those values.  Does a WHERE clause define a set of values and a set of operations on those values?</em>

      <p>
        Such string parsing is blind to operations down the road. It doesn't think/plan about the future and the "meaning" of numbers; it just follows orders.  The programmer or language designer may have had intentions or future usage patterns in mind, but that's exploring human heads, not program results. I want to model program output, not YOUR output.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even so, which set of all possible regex's qualify it as "type checking" and which don't? Do we have to know programmer intent to answer that? If so, are we back to the old <a href="WhatIsIntent.html">WhatIsIntent</a> fights?

      </p>
      <p>
        If one is modeling behavior, then modeling a difference based around the existence of the the word "type" is against that goal. Behavior-wise, it's no different than any other regex expression or filter rules such that bifurcating a model to have split paths based on the existence of the word "type" is a violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, since Path A and Path B could be explained the same but are not to cater to a word-centric or historical-habit-centric model.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's just agree that both approaches can "work" and having both model choices can help one view the thing from different angles, one behavior-centric, the other vocabulary-centric or history-centric. <strong>Let's agree to let both live</strong>.

        <em>So, what does that mean, exactly?

Or do you mean you think existing language semantics and syntax are confusing, redundant, and possibly misleading?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But your model is either more complicated because of your language-centric tilt, or if simplified outright doesn't work to explain differences in languages. One of main problems is that <strong>"types" has been overloaded</strong> with explicit typing and parse-based typing (examining the value only). The tag model cleans that up and models both in a clearly different way, not your hazy "associated with" vagueness. If one bifurcates these two concepts into distinct modelling actions/features, then it reduces confusion and highlights why the two language families act different. --top

        Surely the "$" in the Perl variable is a type tag, while @ and % are other examples in the same language. The var named $fred may contain several types of value but they must all be all suitable for use in a $-variable. This is enforced by the language and is not just a convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whether this is what Top meant or not I don't know but several popular languages have had these sorts of type tags, including the classic implementations of BASIC that many of us started out on (a$, b$, i%, j% etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's not what Top meant, though it might be the inspiration for his "tag model".  Single character prefix or suffix "tags" are syntax for specifying a variable's type.  BASIC's 'a$' is semantically equivalent to C#'s 'string a', but obviously syntactically different.</em>

The CSR shouldn't chop off precision: default to sufficient precision to show all influence of the 8 bytes, but have formatting operations to round if desired. Maybe "%f" is not the CSR anyhow because we can use different formats in printf for any variable regardless of declared type. C may not have a CSR. (My C is rusty.) I wonder if any dynamic languages do this? </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        C doesn't really have a CSR. Only the arithmetic types, pointers, and arrays of characters have anything that's even a reasonable candidate. ("%f" or "%g" are the best candidates for both float and double. Both suffer from rounding.) But the question is now, how can we determine if a "Same string, different foo" is because of a "flaw in the CSR" or a "tag"?

      <p>
        <em>Is there any direct way to extract the full value faithfully? (Indirectly we may be able to subtract the value from slightly rounded versions of itself to slice the parts.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can explicitly specify the precision. Regardless of which precision you choose, C allows for an implementation that exceeds it. C does give you the ability to look at any object as a sequence of bytes. I don't see how either helps in distinguishing between "flaws in the CSR" and "tags".

      <p>
        <em>If C has no CSR, then we cannot apply candidate definition #3. But the existence of tags during compiling but none at run-time can help explain/model why we can apply different formats to different (compile) types willy nilly. Also note that I mostly limit using the tag model for dynamic languages.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My question still stands. How can we differentiate between "flaws in the CSR" and "tags"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How does one find flaws in something that doesn't exist? I will agree that hypothetically, if a CSR doesn't show us the full "value", then def #3 would be picking up the hidden effects of this under the name "tag", which is probably not what we want in the def. There will probably always be odd caveats that break any def or "rule".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Forget C for the moment. Let's say we have a language that defines a toString method that works for every value, but that method truncates floating point values. That toString method would be the obvious choice for the CSR. How do we tell if that toString method is flawed as a CSR or if the language has tags? (BTW, there are plenty of rules and definitions that don't have any exceptions. As examples, the standard definition of integer, Von Neumann ordinals, modus ponens, etc.)

        <em>Because math doesn't have to worry about practical issues, unlike programming.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           How about which values belong to a given implementation of C's int type?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>We could add 0.0000001 to one group of numbers, say monetary amounts, and not add to quantities to create a kind of "tag" that differentiates between both kinds of numbers in an app or shop, and build that into a library (including removal of the 0.0000001 end-marker for processing). Thus, it </em>'can act<em>' as a typical "type tag". Whether it's convenient or not is another matter. The difference comes down to intent and usage, and we've already done the "intent dance". What I really want is a model that explains behavior of the language, not a model of human heads.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, we can take our own ad-hoc type system and stick it on top of the language's type system. I'm not interested in that at the moment. I want to know how to differentiate between CSR flaws and tags.

        Ummm, it's called <strong>typedef</strong>. --<a href="MarkJanssen.html">MarkJanssen</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A </em>'typedef<em>' is a C-specific alias for a type name or a means to associate a name with a type definition.  How does it relate to the above?</em>

        Try actually making a <strong>compiler</strong> to transform language text into machine code, instead of debating abstractions, and then you'll know.  Find more at <a href="ComputerScienceVersionTwo.html">ComputerScienceVersionTwo</a>.

        Rather than endlessly (and circularly -- it's getting lengthy and repetitive with no resolution in sight) debate the merits of the "tag model" vs understanding language behaviour in terms of language semantics and syntax and well-known elements like types, values and variables, I have created <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>.  Top, I encourage you to create a similar page for the "tag model", and then <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a>.

        Quote: "a tag section that describes the type of the data: how it is to be interpreted, and, if it is a reference, the type of the object that it points to."
