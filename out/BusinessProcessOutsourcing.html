        Business Process Outsourcing
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BusinessProcessOutsourcing.html">BusinessProcessOutsourcing</a> (BPO) is a variant of <a href="OutSourcing.html">OutSourcing</a> where the activities that are outsourced are bounded by "self-contained" business functions, e.g. Accounting Services.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of BPO is the migration of all inhouse accounting functions to offices to a different location where labour costs are much cheaper. I believe Hong Kong based Cathy Pacific Airways did such a move ten years ago and moved Accounting to main land China.

        Contrast this type of <a href="OutSourcing.html">OutSourcing</a> with the commonly seen Call Centre outsourcing. The Call Centre could be handling service requests and co-ordination for a variety of business functions within the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        BPO can be effected through <a href="InternationalOutsourcing.html">InternationalOutsourcing</a> mechanisms. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are initiatives being implemented by State governments to effect <a href="BusinessProcessOutsourcing.html">BusinessProcessOutsourcing</a> to a centralized SharedServices division, overseen typically by Treasurey. These usually include IT intensive (and thus expensive) <a href="EnterpriseResourcePlanning.html">EnterpriseResourcePlanning</a> applications. Objective of these programs are to save labor, software and hardware costs.

        <a href="SecurityIsHard.html">SecurityIsHard</a>. So firms are expected to unload inhouse activities to Managed Service Providers. See link in <a href="SecurityManagement.html">SecurityManagement</a> which it is said antispamming services being done outside will expand to include entire suite of security processes.
