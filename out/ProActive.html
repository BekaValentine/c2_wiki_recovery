        Pro Active

      <p>
        The opposite of "Reactive".
      </p>
      <p>
        Often used instead of "active", which means the same thing but evidently has too few syllables.

        <a href="ProActive.html">ProActive</a> means pseudo-active. See <a href="DilbertMoment.html">DilbertMoment</a>.

        Actually, no. <a href="ProActive.html">ProActive</a> means that when things start to go wrong, you take early, thoughtful, directed action (not just <em>any</em> action, and not 
        <em>late</em> action) to get them back on track. While I won't support the etymology, there's a useful distinction embodied in the term.

        I thought it was an active that lost its amateur status....
