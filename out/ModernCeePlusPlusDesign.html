        See <a href="http://www.moderncppdesign.com/">http://www.moderncppdesign.com/</a> One of the books in the <a href="CppInDepthSeries.html">CppInDepthSeries</a> published by <a href="AddisonWesley.html">AddisonWesley</a>.

        "Mandatory" book for the following categories: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          C++ programmers (obviously). 
        </li>
        <li>
          C++ naysayers: to make sure you're talking about the same C++ as C++ programmers do.
        </li>
        <li>
          Java programmers (see what you've been missing all along).
        </li>
      </ul>

        I haven't finished reading it yet, but it seems to be re-inventing well-known OO concepts in C++ at compile-time instead of run-time. It seems like a big waste of a programmer's time to use template meta programming to do stuff that could be done easily in Smalltalk via polymorphism, dynamic dispatch, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's nice, but this is a book on how to do these things in C++, and in ways that trade a compile-time processing cost for a reduction in run-time cost. So what if another language can do them at run-time? If a programmer has other reasons for using C++, then why would it be a waste of time to learn how to do these things in C++?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another take: The book tells you how to use C++ to implement well-known OO concepts. That sounds nice to me -- I'd like a book that explains how to do OO programming in C++!

        What's more interesting to me is how Lisp-like much of the techniques are. C++ templates are very much like a <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>, so many of the techiques look a lot like reimplementing Lisp features using the template features of C++. Perhaps it's <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>.  The disheartening thing to me (as a C++ programmer and non-<a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>) is how baroque the implementation has to be, mostly because of <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>.

        The first chapter of this book is called <a href="PolicyBasedClassDesign.html">PolicyBasedClassDesign</a> and what is surprising to me is that there is not yet a page on <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> for this topic. The book also introduced a library called Loki which implements a lot of interesting things. Some of these are also available in different forms in the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generic versions of <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> and <a href="AcyclicVisitor.html">AcyclicVisitor</a> are discussed in Chapter 10 and implemented in Loki.
