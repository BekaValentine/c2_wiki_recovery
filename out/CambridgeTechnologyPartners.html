      <p>
        Cambridge Technology Partners was a $250M publicly traded consulting company specializing in building fixed cost, fixed schedule, fast solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        CTP was a spinoff from CambridgeTechnologyGroup, an earlier, fixed-price fixed-schedule consulting company.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>CTP was acquired by Novell during the dot-com bust. Some of us who knew the company were neither surprised nor disappointed.</em>
