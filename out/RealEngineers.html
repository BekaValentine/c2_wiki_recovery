      <p>
        <a href="RealEngineers.html">RealEngineers</a> want to write code that is the most efficient solution to each task an application performs. The worst 4-letter word is a 3-letter word: NOP. No Operation. A cycle that the program could, nay should have used constructively, but was wasted. Code should look as good as it works. A code poet is an engineer who writes code that looks good during disassembly. Aspects of beauty are maximum efficiency of the instruction set welded to concise, accurate style-guide with which registers are used for what, in a consistent way. This should make a disassembly of the code as easy to read to a third party without the aid of comments. Spending a day reducing a 31 cycle inner-loop to 30 cycles is a day well spent.
