        When To Delete Pages
      </h1>
      <p>
        See <a href="HowToDeletePages.html">HowToDeletePages</a> after picking a page to delete.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reasons to delete a page</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's just an editing experiment by a newbie, see <a href="HowToUseDeletedButWelcome.html">HowToUseDeletedButWelcome</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's an <a href="AbandonedHomePage.html">AbandonedHomePage</a>, but see <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           If someone sets up a corner of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> for private purposes. See <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's an <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> (easily found with <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/orphanWikiPages)">http://c2.com/cgi/orphanWikiPages)</a> and is not likely to become connected. Click on the page title to verify if there are any <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's virtually an <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> (see <a href="DeleteNoContextLinks.html">DeleteNoContextLinks</a>) but doesn't show up with the above script.
        </li>
        <li>
           You're reworking in a way that makes it redundant.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's just flamage.
        </li>
        <li>
           Deleting it resolves an argument amicably and consensually.
        </li>
        <li>
           You wrote it and you think better of having written it. However, if others have contributed to it, think twice.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> and ...
          <ul>
            <li>
               You find an acceptable place for it. There are several <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a> which have been provided for such pages.
            </li>
            <li>
               It's basically free of content. It's so easy to create pages, there's no need to create them speculatively.
            </li>
            <li>
               Other <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> pages that receive general acceptance due to community interest, may be left alone.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Reasons not to delete a page</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You've deleted the page before. (See <a href="DeleteOnceRestoreOnce.html">DeleteOnceRestoreOnce</a>.)
        </li>
        <li>
           It's on topic and unique.
        </li>
        <li>
           You don't know what it means.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's not on a topic that interests you.
        </li>
        <li>
           Its content offends you.
        </li>
        <li>
           Someone you don't like wrote it.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's short.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Alternative to deletion</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Prefer <a href="RefactoringWikiPages.html">RefactoringWikiPages</a> over simply deleting.
        </li>
        <li>
           Move the page to an appropriate <a href="SisterSite.html">SisterSite</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Consider use of <a href="DeleteThisPageSoon.html">DeleteThisPageSoon</a>?
        </li>
        <li>
           Move content by particular authors to their <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>s.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        When appropriate, check for other edits by the same person before deleting.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do not understand. Please explain.
          <ul>
            <li>
               For example, such a check may reveal that a new page that seems to be an orphan is actually referenced from another page edited by the same person.
            </li>
            <li>
               For this reason <strong>one should always wait at least a day, preferably two days, before seconding deletions.</strong> That gives time for the backlinks database to update so you can check that the page isn't referenced from anywhere.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There were recent disputes about <a href="DeleteOnceRestoreOnce.html">DeleteOnceRestoreOnce</a>. So comments about preconditions for overriding this guideline are useful (e.g., If <a href="DeleteInsults.html">DeleteInsults</a> is really the better choice, spell out and illustrate it with an example).
