        When I have something I want to keep that consists not only of text, but also having images, links, videos, audios and the like, not necessarily of my own composition, I use <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> (MicrosoftTechnology) to record not only the artifact itself, but also the <a href="FromWhere.html">FromWhere</a> information.
      </p>

        It is another of the strategies utilized while <strong></strong><a href="RunningSixYearsBehind.html">RunningSixYearsBehind</a><strong></strong>

      <p>
        It also allows editing so all that is not <a href="UsefulUsableUsed.html">UsefulUsableUsed</a> can be removed or put elsewhere. Additional stuff which is related can also be added at my leisure. ( A <strong></strong><a href="NotBuiltInOneDay.html">NotBuiltInOneDay</a><strong> strategy )</strong>
      </p>

        Another OrganizationalTechnique within <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> is the ability to create Notebooks with many Sections and sub-Sections in which StuffThatIsAlike may be accumulated for future reference.

        --- <strong>How to Archive a page - in the browser window:</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Simply open a new page in <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> in the Notebook and Section desired
        </li>
        <li>
           do a Select All on the wiki page ( or other page in the browser )
        </li>
        <li>
           then drag and drop the selection to the opened new page in <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               it need not be the whole page, often only a part of the page is desirable for archive.
            </li>
            <li>
               The nice thing about this is that most often images, links and other non-textual-stuff is carried into <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> also puts a <a href="ComeFrom.html">ComeFrom</a> note at the end of the pasted stuff as to where the extraction exists in a Reachable Document
