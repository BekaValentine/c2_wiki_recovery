        Argument From Intimidation
      </h1>
      <p>
        A combination of <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> and <a href="AdVerecundiam.html">AdVerecundiam</a> which basically alleges that the opposition must be stupid, racist, cruel, immature, or something like that in order to believe whatever it is arguing. After all, '<a href="EverybodyKnows.html">EverybodyKnows</a>' that the argument has been proved false for centuries. You don't actually believe it, do you? You must be a genuine extremist in order to believe it.

        (e.g., "What, you oppose a ban on pornography? Well, we know what <em>you're</em> looking at, you <a href="CensoredExpletives.html">CensoredExpletives</a>...")

        This fallacy can frequently be a path to <a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a>. -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a>

        Like the other fallacies it is based upon, it has nothing to do with the real content of the opponent's phrase.

        Polls are also used as an argument from intimidation; by polling people who don't know a lot about an issue and who therefore deliver the wrong answers about it, pollsters can intimidate the well-informed minority with the majority result. i.e. <a href="ArgumentByTheMasses.html">ArgumentByTheMasses</a>.

        It is also a form of <a href="ArgumentFromIntimidation.html">ArgumentFromIntimidation</a> to simply shout the same point so loudly and so often that it drowns out the opposing point of view. Sadly, a lot of people argue in this manner.
