        <em>Why don't you make a page about your class and then ask interested students to add a few comments about the class and/or language.

        I was pleased to see packages mapped to directories by strict rules, and that the compiler enforces/exploits this arrangement.

        I'm continually puzzled that what seemed like a sensible exception mechanism requires so much busy work and still doesn't catch errors. <em>(See </em><a href="JavaExceptionsAreParticularlyEvil.html">JavaExceptionsAreParticularlyEvil</a>.)<em></em>

        I am pleasantly surprised by the way that reflection has become a central tool in the design of frameworks.

        I am distressed by the lack of language support for aggregation. A lot of my objects seem to wind up passing messages along to their friends. Which requires a fair bit of typing and always makes me pause and think, "Why am I doing this typing?"

        I am pleased that they tightened up <a href="TypeChecking.html">TypeChecking</a> and at the same time provided an alternate mechanism for <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a>. Ditto threads.

        I'm with Ward on the <a href="ExceptionHandling.html">ExceptionHandling</a>. I expect the ripple effect to start biting designers once they get into maintenance phase and start making mods. It's already hard on me. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        I am pleased that some essential constructs, such as <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, reflection, and separation of type and class, have reached the mainstream.

        I am most disappointed at the lack of renaming (e.g.,
      </p>
      <code>
        import ... as ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and "typedef"), and the weakness of some of the standard libraries.

        I think the most striking feature of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is that <a href="EverythingIsaReference.html">EverythingIsaReference</a>. This is sort of good and sort of bad, but I generally come out in favour of everything being a reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<em>Almost</em> everything is a reference - primitives are not, which is probably just as well because it's pretty memory inefficient to store small data as references and primitives are the smallest. -- <a href="JamesHollidge.html">JamesHollidge</a>]

      <p>
        Since Java now has <a href="JavaGenerics.html">JavaGenerics</a>, and even <a href="ChainedExceptions.html">ChainedExceptions</a>, there's not much about Java-the-language you can point to as bad, apart from its overall chunkiness. Java-the-platform still has a way to go. I suppose you could point to the access mechanisms (public/protected/private) as not being 100% good, because occasionally I, and even Sun, have had to make a method public even although it should have been package-protected, because the classes that need to call it are in a different package. If there was a "packageinternal"-type modifier which allowed access to any package in the same general area of the package hierarchy, but not to completely different packages, that might be nice.
      </p>

        [Sounds like a 'friends' construct to me - I'm sure <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a> will probably take that from <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> too ;) -- <a href="JamesHollidge.html">JamesHollidge</a>]

      <p>
        <em>Concur. What if a class could belong to more than one package? You could keep the </em><a href="TreeStructure.html">TreeStructure</a> naming convention for packages, but use package directives to define multiple memberships. You could define packages that described/explained the relationship between certain classes as needed. Or think of it the other way. One class can show up in multiple packages. <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a><em></em>

        <a href="MetaClass.html">MetaClass</a>es would be nice. I'm not a big fan of hidden statics. If we could subclass Class, life would be a lot easier. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        I am pleased to use a language that's almost as powerful as <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, but not nearly as dangerous: it's essentially impossible to corrupt memory with <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.

        I'm guessing that method pointers aren't going to be provided because <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a> is striving for a purely <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> platform. Of course things like <strong>static</strong> methods are more like procedures placed in a namespace - since there's no instance context it wouldn't seem unreasonable to be able to reference to it. That we can't is probably because having multiple first-class entities would screw up the VirutalMachine's/Sun developer's model of things. -- <a href="JamesHollidge.html">JamesHollidge</a>

        I am pleased by the Java security model in general and the <a href="JavaSecurityManager.html">JavaSecurityManager</a> in particular. I like to be able to run code not trusted by me.

        I'm puzzled by the lack of easy-to-type closures. I know that Java <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>es can be closures, but they are a pain in the ass to write.

        I dunno, maybe I've just gotten used to them but I seem to find myself writing this sort of thing all the time:
      </p>
      <code>
        new Thread(new Runnable() {<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public void run() {<br/>
        System.out.println("Meh.");<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        }).start();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Although I'd almost certainly refactor if it got more complicated than a few lines of method code. And closures are probably preferrable to creating a slew of new classes for Action<strong>'Listeners and the like.</strong>

        -- <a href="JamesHollidge.html">JamesHollidge</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well I've actually written something like this on a real application:
      </p>
      <code>
        new <a href="ActionListener.html">ActionListener</a>() {<br/>
        public void actionPerformed( <a href="ActionEvent.html">ActionEvent</a> e) {<br/>
        new Thread( new Runnable() {<br/>
        public void run() {<br/>
        doSomething();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }).start();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or was it using the Foxtrot library? I don't remember. But I remember the awkward feeling to see an <a href="AnonymousInnerClass.html">AnonymousInnerClass</a> inside another anonymous inner class. I write closures inside closures in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> and it seems nicer. Certainly, it requires both less typing and fewer syntactical components! -- AC

      <p>
        That looks astonishingly familiar - probably because I did something entirely similar! It's kinda convenient for a delayed action on a GUI component by getting the thread to sleep for a bit. -- <a href="JamesHollidge.html">JamesHollidge</a>
