        When I went looking for a PHP-based wiki several weeks ago, there were none so I set off to create one [a <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a>].  When I got a reasonable version going and came back here to "register" it, I found two other PHP implementations
        already there.  Sheesh.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I based my code on <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a>, a Python wiki implementation that I admire for its clean design.  I have followed the formatting rules of <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a>, although I'm thinking about converting to classic wiki rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest goal was to implement a wiki that allows for <strong>very fast browsing</strong>.  PHP seemed a good candidate since when run as an Apache module we can skip the whole fork/exec overhead thing.  Although I'm fairly happy with the result, the algorithm I used to handle formatting chews up a lot of time. If only PHP3 had the '/e' option for regular expressions.

        Oh yeah, you can find my code and an example <a href="PhikiWiki.html">PhikiWiki</a> web via some links on <a href="http://www.ontosys.com/reports/PHP.html">http://www.ontosys.com/reports/PHP.html</a>
