        I am a (retired) Professor living in Pennsylvania. I used computers in High School back in the middle 1950s and have been involved with them ever since. I was a member of the research staff at Project MAC and one of the `founders' of the first Decision Sciences Department at  a major University. I spent the majority of my career as a teacher and as a consultant to large organizations. I was a co-founder and co-developer of one of the first systems to deliver on-line disaggregated data to the advertising industry in the late 1960s, well before distributing information to remote sites was very common. And I brought microcomputers to TV-Guide as head of data processing operations there in the early 1980s.

        My computer interests focus on typesetting (<a href="TexTheProgram.html">TexTheProgram</a>), array languages (<a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a>, <a href="KayLanguage.html">KayLanguage</a>, <a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a>) and I do most of my work in these languages along with <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and occasional lapses into <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>/<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.
