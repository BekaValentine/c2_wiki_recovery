        Seldom Affirm Never Deny Always Distinguish

      <p>
        "Seldom affirm, never deny, always distinguish."
      </p>

      <p>
        Good advice for those who would rather discuss than argue.
      </p>
      <p>
        An admonition against taking a pig-headed absolute position, as doing so closes the door on reason, rather than opening it by revealing more information.

        <dt><em>"Always distinguish"</em></dt>
        <dd>between what? Details. ...meaning to open up further discussion by examining the details, to distinguish the specifics from the general, to avoid broad sweeping generalizations. </dd>

        <strong>Examples of failing to do this:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Affirming an absolute:
          <ul>
            <li>
               "The only way to do X is to take Y approach."
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Denying an absolute:
          <ul>
            <li>
               "There is no such thing as a useful global variable."
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Failure to distinguish:
          <ul>
            <li>
               "You're just like Hitler!"
            </li>
            <li>
               "Oh, you're one of those <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> types."
            </li>
            <li>
               "Now you're sounding like a Buddhist!"

        Add to CategoryCareerEmploymentAndLifeStrategies?
      </p>
      <p>
        I disagree that this category that you added is the appropriate one; not even close -- 67.113.149.160
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You are probably right. I put up the categorization because I think </em><a href="SeldomAffirmNeverDenyAlwaysDistinguish.html">SeldomAffirmNeverDenyAlwaysDistinguish</a> is a good Life Strategy. What are your thoughts? -- dl<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it would be worthwhile for you to add your thoughts to this page as to why it is a good life strategy. But in the absence of some discussion along those lines, this page does not yet fall into that category.
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that it is possible to find worthwhile philosophical lessons about life virtually in any subject whatsoever, however that doesn't mean the original subject was literally about life strategy; that's an extension, or a metaphor, or a springboard, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        So comment away, tell us your thoughts.
