        Events are divided into groups: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           low-level events
          <ul>
            <li>
               Low-level events represent window-system occurrences or low-level input. 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Examples of low-level events include mouse and key events â€” both of which result directly from user input. Examples of semantic events include action and item events. A semantic event might be triggered by user input; for example, a button customarily fires an action event when the user clicks it, and a text field fires an action event when the user presses Enter. However, some semantic events aren't triggered by low-level events, at all. For example, a table-model event might be fired when a table model receives new data from a database. 
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           semantic events
          <ul>
            <li>
               Everything else is a <a href="SemanticEvent.html">SemanticEvent</a> 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   You should listen for semantic events rather than low-level events to insure that code is robust and portable. Listening for <a href="ActionEvent.html">ActionEvent</a>s on buttons, rather than mouse events, allows the button to react properly when the user activates the button via a keyboard alternative or a look-and-feel-specific gesture. When dealing with a compound component such as a <a href="ComboBox.html">ComboBox</a>, you should use Semantic events, as a way of registering listeners on all the look-and-feel-specific components that are used to form the CompoundComponent.
