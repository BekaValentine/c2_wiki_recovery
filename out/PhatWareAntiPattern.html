        Phat Ware Anti Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        PhatWare has <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> features that someone on the dev team, <a href="ProductManager.html">ProductManager</a> or developer, thought would be a cool (i.e., the product is in a fashion show) deviance from usability. The term derives from the word "Phat" which means "cool", and that Phat sounds like fat, the opposite of lean, and therfore the opposite of <a href="LeanProgramming.html">LeanProgramming</a> (the application of <a href="LeanThinking.html">LeanThinking</a> to programming, which basically means agile program).
      </p>
      <p>
        Example phatware:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Quicken has a feature where every time you enter a transaction, a loud cash register noise emits from the PC, annoying everyone within earshot. Not all that easy to turn off either.
        </li>
        <li>
           Many companies make <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a> apps that only run in <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a>. It's cool because it's in a browser, yet it gives up all the benefits of being <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> only. The worst of both worlds. Sometimes to make it phat they do all sorts of crazy stuff - <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> controls that are hard to use.
        </li>
        <li>
           Media players are a typical offender. Instead of making the program easy to use for those familiar with the <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> windowing paradigm, it looks like a phat stereo console.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> (all versions up to and including <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>). Those docking windows are sure phat. Who cares that while I am editing a text file I don't need huge real estate taken up by the stack/debug windows or that it takes 100 clicks to move my window choices around? It's phat!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        You're wrong about <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a>. I use VS every day, and the docking windows are extremely useful, configurable, etc. The environment conforms to my needs, not the other way around. And if I want my <a href="TextEditor.html">TextEditor</a> to take up most of my screen area - and I often do - it's trivial to do so. Comparing this work environment to the hideous, bloated, unusable interfaces for media players (which I generally hate) is simply wrong. -- <a href="ArlieDavis.html">ArlieDavis</a>

        <em>When you undock a window to get rid of it, you don't find it takes several minutes to get it back?</em>

      <p>
        I HATE docking. How much time has been wasted when you accidentally undock/dock something? WHY WASN'T IT ADDED TO THE UNDO LIST? This should be its own <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>. Never design something dockable that can't be Undo-ed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you really want your undo button to undo BOTH changes to a document and changes to the user interface? Personally, my expectation is that when I hit the undo button, it undoes what I last changed to the document. When I don't see my change revert back, I inevitably start spamming the undo button.</em>

        man i hate having to dock/undock, one time at work, after having to dock for what felt like the thousandth time, i was fed up of it, and so, just started crying, banging my desk shouting AAAAAAARRRRRGHHH!!! WHY MUST YOU TORMENT ME!?. true story, i am now nicknamed "docker" for my many tantrums over docking.
