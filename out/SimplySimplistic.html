        Simply Simplistic
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SimpleIsntEasy.html">SimpleIsntEasy</a>. There exists <a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a> in most situations in life.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="EinsteinPrinciple.html">EinsteinPrinciple</a> states that theories should be <a href="AsSimpleAsPossibleButNoSimpler.html">AsSimpleAsPossibleButNoSimpler</a>. If you violate the latter clause ("but no simpler") in any system, by not capturing the <a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a>, you make it <a href="SimplySimplistic.html">SimplySimplistic</a>. You cannot be rid of <a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a> (it being 'essential'), so <strong>simplistic</strong> solutions, models, and theories end up foisting the complexity they didn't capture upon their user.
      </p>
      <p>
        One example is <a href="AddingEpicycles.html">AddingEpicycles</a>. A <a href="SimplySimplistic.html">SimplySimplistic</a> model placing the Earth at the center of the universe required that users of this model that observed the universe create complex, epicyclic orbits for the planets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simplistic protocols and models and language features can end up becoming <strong>complexity multipliers</strong> because the complexity is duplicated by each and every <strong>user</strong> of the model or protocol. They are also effort multipliers. Fortunately, one can sometimes solve this problem by wrapping or refactoring the protocol or model or language feature within a library to utilize it, thus capturing the <a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a> into the library and thus creating the feature/language/model that should have existed in the first place. (If a language cannot refactor this model/protocol into a library, or must expose implementation details to do so, it suffers from the <a href="MissingFeatureSmell.html">MissingFeatureSmell</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example, since <a href="YouCanSolveAnyProblemWithAnotherLevelOfIndirection.html">YouCanSolveAnyProblemWithAnotherLevelOfIndirection</a>, many consultants unwittingly add complexity after decision makers buy into an attempt to find <a href="AsimplerWay.html">AsimplerWay</a> using indirection.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, there are indeed SimpleSolutions at times. Without these, the <a href="SimplySimplistic.html">SimplySimplistic</a> arguments would not have existed.
