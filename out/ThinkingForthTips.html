        Thinking Forth Tips
      </h1>
      <p>
        Everything old is new again. There are no new ideas. Modern software development is not so modern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some random tips (quoted verbatim) from the book <a href="ThinkingForth.html">ThinkingForth</a> (published in 1984):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Start simple. Get it running. Learn what you're trying to do. Add complexity gradually, as needed to fit the requirements and constraints. Don't be afraid to restart from scratch.
        </li>
        <li>
           Plan for change (by designing components that can be changed).
        </li>
        <li>
           First, and most importantly, the conceptual model should describe the system's interfaces.
        </li>
        <li>
           Factor the fruit. (Don't confuse apples with oranges).
        </li>
        <li>
           You don't understand a problem until you can simplify it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Decide on error and exception-handling early as part of defining the interface.
        </li>
        <li>
           Generality usually involves complexity. Don't generalize your solution any more than will be required; instead, keep it changeable. <em>(hmmm... </em><a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>? -- Ed)<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           To simplify, take advantage of what's available.
        </li>
        <li>
           The mean time for making a "two-hour" addition to an application is approximately 12 hours.
        </li>
        <li>
           In deciding where to start designing, look for:
          <ul>
            <li>
               areas where the most creativity is required (the areas where change is most likely)
            </li>
            <li>
               areas that give the most satisfying feedback (get the juices flowing)
            </li>
            <li>
               areas in which the approach decided upon will greatly affect other areas, or which will determine whether the stated problem can be solved at all
            </li>
            <li>
               things you should show the customer, for mutual understanding
            </li>
            <li>
               things you can show the investors, if necessary for the rent.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and that's just up to page  95 ;)

        I seem to recall (although I can't begin to remember the page) another quote:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't set a flag, set the data.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a> page here attributes that one to him (Dijkstra).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't know whether Dijkstra said it first, but </em><a href="LeoBrodie.html">LeoBrodie</a> did say that, on page 258 of <a href="ThinkingForth.html">ThinkingForth</a>. He explains that, if you're just going to use a flag to choose between two data sources later, then just go ahead and save the correct value, rather than postponing the decision.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Similar tips follow:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           DUP (copy) a flag, don't recreate it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't set a flag, set the function (basically, save a function pointer).
        </li>
        <li>
           Try to avoid altogether saving a flag in memory (save it on the parameter stack instead).
        </li>
      </ul>

        This can also be seen as a primitive form of <a href="ReplaceConditionalWithPolymorphism.html">ReplaceConditionalWithPolymorphism</a>, if you come from an OO background, or a more sophisticated form of <a href="ReplaceConditionalWithPolymorphism.html">ReplaceConditionalWithPolymorphism</a> if you come from a functional background.
