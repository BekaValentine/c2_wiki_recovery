        <dd><em>The book is organized around programming concepts. It starts with a small language containing just a few concepts. It shows how to design, write programs, and reason in this language. It then adds concepts one by one to overcome limitations in expressiveness. In this way, it situates all major programming paradigms in a uniform framework. More than twenty paradigms are given, all represented as subsets of the </em><a href="MultiparadigmLanguage.html">MultiparadigmLanguage</a> Oz [<a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a>]. We find that all have their place: "more is not better (or worse) than less, just different".<em></em></dd>

        The nickname "The Oz Book" is appropriate, both because <a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a> (which the authors, along with several others, developed) is the primary language used in the book, and because of the inevitable comparisons with <a href="TheWizardBook.html">TheWizardBook</a> (<a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a>). Like <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a>, CTMCP is first and foremost a book on <em>programming</em>, not on Oz or Scheme or anything else. And if <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a> is the reigning king of such books, <a href="ConceptsTechniquesAndModelsOfComputerProgramming.html">ConceptsTechniquesAndModelsOfComputerProgramming</a> is a worthy challenger to that particular throne.  (More accurately, this book deserves to be on the same shelf as <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a>, in my opinion -- and I definitely would read both of them, along with <a href="ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction.html">ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few concepts in this book which receive better coverage here than in <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a>; namely:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Stateful programming, including <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. The authors have many interesting things to say here.
        </li>
        <li>
           Concurrency. Several concurrency models are discussed: dataflow programming, <a href="CommunicatingSequentialProcesses.html">CommunicatingSequentialProcesses</a>, and <a href="SharedStateConcurrency.html">SharedStateConcurrency</a>.  
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> and <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Conversely, traditional functional programming is better covered in <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a>, as are the contents of <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a>'s chapter 5, dealing with language implementations and compilers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One good point in favor of this book (compared to many programming texts and well-known personalities) is the authors' careful avoidance of dogma. Although <a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a> features prominently in the book, this book doesn't make extravagant claims about Oz (or engage in specious criticism of other languages -- if anything, the authors are <em>too</em> nice).  Compare this to <a href="ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction.html">ObjectOrientedSoftwareConstruction</a>, where an otherwise excellent book is diminished due to the fact that it frequently reads like a sales brochure for <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a>. Nor do the authors engage in "paradigm-bashing". While the authors clearly do have a favorite paradigm, all of the paradigms presented are discussed in a reasonable fashion, with strengths and weaknesses cataloged and analyzed.  When the authors <em>do</em> criticize something (<a href="SharedStateConcurrency.html">SharedStateConcurrency</a>, a technique which seems to dominate programming these days, receives quite a bit of criticism), it makes you want to sit up and pay attention.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the final analysis, the authors recommend use of whatever paradigm works, including several different ones in the same problem. A welcome relief from several other authors I can think of, each promoting their own One True Way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Highly recommended.

        Agreed on all counts. Wonderful book, very insightful, strangely easy to read (haven't figured that out yet), very unusual in many respects. There really isn't any other book out there that is even vaguely like it in subject coverage. I think it's a natural complement to <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a>. A must-read even if one isn't interested in <a href="SiCp.html">SiCp</a>, too. I've quoted it multiple times on various pages here. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
