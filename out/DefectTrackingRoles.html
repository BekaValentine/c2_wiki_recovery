        Defect Tracking Roles
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong><em>Role Definitions</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Customer</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Customer role is the person who files the bug report. It may be a real end user customer, or it may be a QA Tester, or an IT project team member. In all cases, the duties are the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Programmer</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Programmer is the role taken by the person who is assigned to fix and regression test to make sure the fix didn't break other features in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Tester</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of Tester is to verify the fix and validate it against the bug reported
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dispatcher</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Dispatcher has the role of setting priorities and assigning bugs to be worked on, then following up on work. The Dispatcher can coordinate the life cycle events between various other roles. The Dispatcher can be a Systems Analyst, Developer, etc. This Dispatcher generally does <em>not</em> get involved with severities -- that is a Customer's role.
      </p>

      <p>
        These definitions seem to be driven to supporting some specific approach rather than being common role definitions.  Perhaps this page should be rolled back into the source that provides the context for these particular definitions?
