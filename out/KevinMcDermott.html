        I'm back to working in Glasgow again...as a Senior Java Developer for a large Government organization.

      <p>
        Bizarrely, my first task in the new job involves writing a lot of <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> as part of a rules engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        After more than 3 years away from Python, I'm amazed how easy it is to go back to writing <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, it's like I've never been away (well...except for all the new things), in fairness I've tracked <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> during that time, and written a fair amount of Python :)
