        I guess that means that I am not really a novice any more. See AndyGlewWikiExperience.

        The UWisc web pages are now orphaned. One day I hope to have broadband and a <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a> at home, so that I am no longer at the mercy of companies, organizations, and institutions.  (2009: rented cloud server space for <a href="http://glew.ca,">http://glew.ca,</a> <a href="http://andy.glew.ca,">http://andy.glew.ca,</a>  and <a href="http://semipublic.comp-arch.net.">http://semipublic.comp-arch.net.</a>  Only the last was properly set up as of March 2010.

        <strong>Identity</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Software:</em>
        A slow but sure programmer. A poor typist with carpal tunnel.
        Interested in the meta-processes of programming, as a way to make up for my poor physical skills.
        Interested in XP and lightweight methodologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hardware:</em>
        A computer architect. I.e. designs microprocessors, not buildings.
        Worked on the Intel P6 and MMX. Interested in XP for hardware design.
        Now at AMD!!

        I used to work at "The Little Software House on the Prairie", Gould CSD/Motorola MCG with <a href="ScottPreece.html">ScottPreece</a> and <a href="BrianMarick.html">BrianMarick</a>, although not in the same group. <a href="BrianMarick.html">BrianMarick</a> made fun of my aspirations to design hardware - actually, he made fun of me in all ways, that just being one particular way.

        <em>It's because I was intimidated by you. That used to be my way of being tongue-tied. I'm better now.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No worries, Brian. I have, of late, realized just how advanced "The Little Software House on the Prairie" was. I don't think it's accidental that so many of us have had careers heavily influenced by software quality (you) or hardware quality (me).

        You asked a question on <a href="WikiFarms.html">WikiFarms</a>. It was moved to <a href="ComparisonShoppingWiki.html">ComparisonShoppingWiki</a>. Then an answer appeared.

        <em>Interested in XP for hardware design.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I would also find that interesting.

      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, I feel the same way -- I want to set up my own web server.
        I'm finding it hard to articulate why I spend so much time diddling with this stubborn box, trying to coax it into serving web pages, when I can (and have) put web pages on distant servers in a tiny fraction of the time.
