        Fair Credit Assignment
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Fair-credit assignment</strong> is about giving personal, <strong><em>named</em></strong> assignment where one has originated something (author-credit in one's <em>own</em> work) or fair <em>re</em>-presentation when <em>another</em> has originated something (as in a <strong>citation</strong>). In other words, you can't publish someone else's work under <em>your</em> name without giving a reference.  This is the heart of what <a href="CopyRight.html">CopyRight</a> is supposed to be about.  But see also <a href="FairCredit.html">FairCredit</a>.
