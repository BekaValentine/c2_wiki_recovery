        Strong Concept
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="StrongConcept.html">StrongConcept</a> is a Concept that has evolved to the point where it never changes as is it only ever enhanced.  At a lower level, its implementation may change but its effect can be depended upon.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="StrongConcept.html">StrongConcept</a> is the generalisation of a particular design pattern and a particular interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        A particular <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a> or a particular Interface is the realisation of some concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Correct and useful <a href="DesignDocumentation.html">DesignDocumentation</a> depends on <a href="StrongConcept.html">StrongConcept</a>s.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        An example is the some sort of transactional pattern to ensure ACIDity.  Once the concept (patterns + interfaces) are understood and they are not subject to change then other design entities can depend upon that transactional concept.
