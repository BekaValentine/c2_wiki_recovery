        Cal Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        "CAL Actor Language", also called "Caltrop", is a dataflow actor language developed at the
        Center for Embedded Systems Design at <a href="CalBerkeley.html">CalBerkeley</a>.

        After perusing the Caltrop white paper, I'm pretty convinced that Caltrop isn't an actor language. It uses the word 'actor' to describe its computational units in a manner unrelated to the use of the word 'actor' in <a href="ActorsModel.html">ActorsModel</a>. Actors in Caltrop are <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a> primitives. Caltrop is a <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a> language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Caltrop is also an incomplete language; it leaves a great deal up to the environment, including how to handle ambiguity and all issues of concurrency. This isn't necessarily a bad thing... it means that Caltrop is a DSL for describing dataflow network configurations and could be applied in a broader spectrum of applications. But it also means you can't judge many properties of Caltrop  programs by looking at their source-code, and you have no way of specifying certain environment properties from within the language.

        Nothing to do with <a href="InterCal.html">InterCal</a>, I suppose? <em>Nothing at all.</em>

      <p>
        And nothing to do with CakewalkApplicationLanguage, a Lisp-based scripting language for CakewalkProAudio too.
