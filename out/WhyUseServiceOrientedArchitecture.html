        Why Use Service Oriented Architecture
      </h1>
      <p>
        Why use a <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a>? What do you gain, what are the costs?
      </p>
      <p>
        This page grew from my concern that SOA is being used inappropriately. While it offers a lot for integrating "your stuff" with "other company's stuff", there seems to be considerable interest in using it internally - i.e. between apps or tiers developed by the <em>same</em> company. I don't think that's appropriate, and so I've started this page to discuss the matter.

        <em>One example: I was talking about integrating software I'd worked on with a system under development at another company. The developers at the other company said they preferred </em>'not<strong> to use web services to integrate with our stuff, but that they </strong>did<em>' use web services extensively within their own system. I couldn't help wondering if that was one reason for their slow progress.</em>

        <li>
           I think one reason for using <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> internally but not between organizations is that within the company there is less concern about security, and also there is a need to put learning into practice (e.g. how to make it perform, what change management procedures are appropriate, etc), so do it internally first. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

        Some points for consideration, implied by the above...
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Firstly, even if you don't use SOA, a good architecture will typically follow many of the same principles. In particular, stateless servers. So while alternative technologies, such as <a href="DotNetRemoting.html">DotNetRemoting</a>, let you do all kinds of fancy stuff with stateful servers, you probably shouldn't. (See <a href="http://www.thinktecture.com/Resources/RemotingFAQ/RemotingUseCases.html)">http://www.thinktecture.com/Resources/RemotingFAQ/RemotingUseCases.html)</a> So, some of the fundamental principles are the same, regardless of whether or not you use SOA.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, SOA is not the <em>only</em> way to put those principles into practice. Between tiers of the <em>same</em> application, it's arguably not even the <em>best</em> way to put them into practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) SOA suggests that your server should assume nothing about the client. Therefore, you need to consider:
      </p>
      <p>
        - Security. The server cannot trust the client, and therefore should perform authentication and authorization in response to every request received from the client. (Personally, I prefer to do this anyway, even when using alternatives to SOA, such as .NET Remoting.)
      </p>
      <p>
        - The structure of the objects/XML messages that are passed between client and server. While a non-SOA solution, such as .NET remoting, lets you pass all kinds of complex objects (by value) between the client and server, with SOA you pass XML messages. Furthermore, are there any restrictions on the nature of your XML messages? For instance, passing .NET Datasets over web services is possible, but the XML is complicated. Is it realistic to assume that a non-.NET client can parse it?
      </p>
      <p>
        - The validity of those objects/messages. I.e. your server cannot assume that the client has performed any particular data validation. In reality, the client probably has performed some validation, but the server can't really make many assumptions about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Versioning. Techniques like .NET remoting automatically check that the client and server versions are in sync. With SOA the client and server may evolve separately and you, the developer, must assume much greater responsibility for that. You must either make sure your server can handle various versions of the client(s), or at least detect cases where an incompatible client tries to connect.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you were going to run tight server-side security anyway, if your objects/messages are simple enough, if re-validating the data on the server is OK, and if you're prepared to take more responsibility regarding versioning - then I guess using SOA "between tiers" might be OK.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me though, it still doesn't seem quite right.

        Many months later, I am going to restate the rationale behind the <strong>WhyUs</strong>eServiceOrientedArchitecture - simply because :

      <p>
        Having written a truckload of EDI code and having designed (and written) entire EDI/ETL systems, my first response is that the emperor has no clothes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The emperor has lots of overhead, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        SOA allows you to use <em>somebody else's</em> tool instead of writing your own, adopting the baggage that goes with the generalization, with plenty of YAGNI penalty weight, "because it's a standard."
      </p>
      <p>
        We're going through this horror where I work even now. We have installations with <em>thousands</em> of units reporting, in near <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a>, to a central system with seriously interactive requirements. We have traditionally used a very terse messaging format in a lightweight protocol - bandwidth is precious - and done very well, thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, we are in danger of death by <a href="ConventionalWisdom.html">ConventionalWisdom</a>, as pointy-haired buzzword advocates wave the "standards" banner in our direction. Gotta use XML, it's the <a href="NextBigThing.html">NextBigThing</a>, and it integrates with SOA, and we can make our marketing reports talk to the electrician's priority list! Our personnel files will integrate with the customer issues list! We can all dance and nibble Lotus blossoms!
      </p>
      <p>
        Down here in engineering, we are somewhat less enthusiastic. We are, even now, designing (quietly) the alternative methods. We've crafted a revision to the protocols that will, if it comes to that, be able to carry the load. We've developed a compression system that will lighten the load on the copper to the floor and prevent meltdown. And while this goes on we still appeal to the reason of those who would dress the emperor.
      </p>
      <p>
        When execution time and bandwidth are not your primary concerns, maybe SOA is convenient enough to merit employment. When microseconds count and resources are thin, it's the wrong answer.

      </p>
      <p>
        Hand designing protocols, designing an compression system? Sometimes necessary, sometimes not. XML is not evil, nor is it "slow". Bandwidth is not THAT precious unless you're in a real NarrowBand environment or you have extremely high volumes. Obviously if your system works well today, why fix it? Is there a maintenance challenge? An integration challenge? If people are just applying SOA and XML without a business need, then the emperor <em>in your organization</em> has no clothes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        SOA, on the other hand, can have clothes, if there's a business need. Your complaints seem less targeted towards SOA and more targeted towards the problems of <a href="DistributedSystem.html">DistributedSystem</a>s in general. This is all true of course, if your architects and engineers don't "get" distribution and its risks like latency, partial failure, concurrency, etc., your SOA will not work. But this is not a reason to trample on the concept of SOA itself. I would be more concerned with your IT management's desire to be run by buzzwords instead of business needs. -- <a href="StuCharlton.html">StuCharlton</a>

        According to <a href="RogerSessions.html">RogerSessions</a> in a mid 2004 newsletter, "SOA: WhyBother", it comes down to the value of integrating information, and the reduced costs of an SOA approach to fulfilment.

      <p>
        If you work in a reasonably large organization, there is a lot of packaged software that keep the IT division at float.

And new versions of most software packages are laden with <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>. These provide opportunities for programming staff to create new services. You get the picture.
