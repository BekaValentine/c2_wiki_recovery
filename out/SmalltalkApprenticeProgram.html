        Smalltalk Apprentice Program
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Smalltalk Apprentice Program (STAP) is a project-focused 
        total immersion training program.  It's designed to 
        accelerate Smalltalk teams by integrating project 
        development with customized training.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each STAP team consists of one KSC Mentor for every two to 
        three client developers. In a STAP we will teach everything
        from basic OOA&D concepts through detailed implementation
        techniques.

        Lately, we've begun using <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> as a tool to help 
        teach our STAP Apprentices good design techniques.
