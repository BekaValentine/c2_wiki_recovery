        Berli Os
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BerliOs.html">BerliOs</a> is an open source evangelization effort by the Europe located 'Fraunhofer Institute', its probably most important service being the <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>-derived and -imitating open source <em>project hosting service</em> <a href="http://developer.berlios.de/,">http://developer.berlios.de/,</a> which provides:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           code repositories (<a href="ConcurrentVersionsSystem.html">ConcurrentVersionsSystem</a> and <a href="SubVersion.html">SubVersion</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           file repositories (and anonymous FTP access and considerably less user-frustrating file download interface than <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           web server, database (<a href="MySql.html">MySql</a> and eventually <a href="PostgreSql.html">PostgreSql</a>?)
        </li>
        <li>
           bug and patch tracking, mailing lists
        </li>
        <li>
           forum, wiki, site-wide project news
        </li>
        <li>
           ah, yes, and the shell service, of course (hard quota 5MB)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is greatly enhanced in comparison to <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> and since it currently hosts few less projectes, maintenance is more active (up-to-date servers) and admins are pretty user friendly. Also it is purely non-commercial and sponsored from a non-profit (?) organisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Opposed to its TLD, its interface is also available in English (not only German). Some major projects are already hosted there, and transitors are welcome.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not clear if they use the original <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> code or <a href="GeeForge.html">GeeForge</a>, but they've clearly enhanced what was out there.
