        To Grok

        From the <a href="JargonFile.html">JargonFile</a>:

      <p>
        <strong>grok</strong>
        [from the novel <em></em><a href="StrangerInaStrangeLand.html">StrangerInaStrangeLand</a>,<em> by </em><a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a>, where it is a Martian word meaning literally "to drink" and metaphorically <strong> "to be one with" </strong>] The emphatic form is <a href="GrokInFullness.html">GrokInFullness</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To understand, usually in a global sense. Connotes intimate and exhaustive knowledge.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Contrast zen, which is similar supernal understanding experienced as a single brief flash. See also glark.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Used of programs, may connote merely sufficient understanding. "Almost all C compilers grok the 'void' type these days."
        </li>
        <li>
           False! There's a big difference between a C compiler that sort of more or less understands "void", and one that truly and completely groks it. But "void" is a relatively shallow subject, so it would be more to the point to say, e.g. "Wow, their C++ compiler groks the ISO standard on templates!"
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The current internet usage (July 2000) of <em>to grok</em> seems to me to be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>to understand, and assimilate successfully</em> (for a human)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>to accept and process successfully</em> (for a program)
        </li>
      </ul>
