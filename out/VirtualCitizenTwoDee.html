        provision for education and the upholding of Democracy. 
        Depicting and simulating the intricacies of relevant 
        Financial, Social and Political Networks and Systems, yet specific enough to 
        identify real problems and/or opportunities, the <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a> could
        look something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          EconomicsEngine
        </li>
        <li>
          SocialEngine
        </li>
        <li>
          PoliticalEngine
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        etc.

        The pages could be hyperlinked such that users can continuously view, edit 
        and modify content interactively, navigating as effortlessly as possible.
        Alerts could be sent automatically on an OptIn basis, and uploading could be
        done by SMS, WML or HTML. PayPerUse versions could be developed later on
        on this foundation, but in an Era where whole Industries are evaporating
        and abberations like TrafficHacking are being aimed with DeadlyForce at
        innocent pedestrians, the community should take CounterMeasures using available technology.

        Simulating economic systems is something I've been playing with, in my spare time, for years.  It's an amusing diversion.  However...  "TrafficHacking [is] being aimed with deadly force at innocent pedestrians?"  Huh?  I'd agree that bad driving is occasionally -- presumably unintentionally -- aimed with deadly force at innocent pedestrians, but I'd hardly call it an organised effort.
