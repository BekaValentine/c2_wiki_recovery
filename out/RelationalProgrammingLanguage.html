        Relational Programming Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A relational programming language (RPL) is a <a href="DeclarativeLanguage.html">DeclarativeLanguage</a> built around the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> of data.
        <a href="StructuredQueryLanguage.html">StructuredQueryLanguage</a> (SQL) is an example.

        A relation can be viewed as a reversible function that can return an arbitrary number of values. For example, the "square root" relation maps the number [0] to itself, but maps [4] to [2 -2]. Relations can also be arranged as tables, and can be self-describing. For these reasons, relational programming can be seen as a generalization of functional programming.

        MacLennan's approach combines the relational calculus with ideas from the FP language by <a href="JohnBackus.html">JohnBackus</a> and a syntax inspired by the constructed language Loglan (from which <a href="LojbanLanguage.html">LojbanLanguage</a> is derived). The resulting notation is somewhat reminiscent of <a href="JayLanguage.html">JayLanguage</a> or <a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a>.

        <em>And here I was thinking about stored procedure / trigger languages that execute "in" a </em><a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>:<em></em>

        <li>
           PL/SQL - Oracle
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To me, these seem more like imperative languages that happen to allow SQL and DDL statements -- what would PL/SQL look like, for instance, if it was "truly relational" (whatever that means)?

        The <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> could be considered a relational programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not really. </em><a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> has no inherent support for labeled tuples. All it has is untyped lists of "atoms". In this respect it is quite similar to <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>. I suppose you could add support for labeled (typed) tuples, though. OTOH one of the fundaments of <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> is an in-memory database of "facts" (forgot the actual term - clauses maybe? - but "facts" describes them better than original).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> has tuples, but you examine them using pattern matching instead of using labels.  Prolog is based on predicate logic rather than relational calculus.  Relational calculus is I think a restricted form of predicate logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth statements of prologs are similar to the rows of a relational table. (are there your tuples above?)
      </p>
      <code>
        employee ('Joe Doe', 1979, 'Department of Defense').<br/>
        employee_managed_by ('Joe Doe', 'Mister X').<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The thing that <a href="RelationalCalculus.html">RelationalCalculus</a> is missing are the <em>rules</em> of Prolog.  It is straightforward to have a "directReports" relationship in a relational table--associating each employee with his/her boss--but deriving the "indirectReports" relationship (the transitive closure of the directReports relationship) is trickier.  You can do it with RelationalJoins, but that's ugly.  A rule in <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> expresses this relationship much more succinctly.
