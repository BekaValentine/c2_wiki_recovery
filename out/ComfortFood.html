        Comfort Food
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="ComfortFood.html">ComfortFood</a> is something you fondly remember from your childhood. The psychological benefits from consuming it usually outweigh the nutritional benefits. Wikizens are invited to list their <a href="ComfortFood.html">ComfortFood</a>s below.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

      <p>
        Some documentary I was watching pointed out that most comfort food is fatty, salty and sweet. Donner kebab, please!
