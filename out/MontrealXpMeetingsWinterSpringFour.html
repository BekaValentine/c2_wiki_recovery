        Topic of Discussion: The Customer
      </p>
      <p>
        Various experiences with "customers" were presented. We all realize the importance of a customer but there was discussion on how the customer interacts with the team. <a href="SebastienDaupleix.html">SebastienDaupleix</a> described his successful experiences with "customers" on his most recent project. <a href="BobPotter.html">BobPotter</a> provided his difficulties with the concept of customer in a multi-client environment where the product could sell to one client for $1,000 and another for $1,000,000 and the influence of the sales and marketing team. PascalRoy described the difficulty of customers making decisions where there is more than one "right" way to go.

      <p>
        Discuss about the mission and the organization of the group. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We had the chance to have newcomers and we divided in 2 groups to think about what we expected from the group and what we would like to do during the meetings.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main points that came up were the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        - We are looking to have fun while discussing Agile matters and we value the social aspect of the meetings<br/>
        - We want the meetings to be organized, yet stay informal in nature<br/>
        - We must make everything possible to facilitate integration of new members<br/>
        - We realize that we have disparate levels of knowledge of XP and Agile practices, with different levels <br/>
        of interest, so we need to find a way to accommodate everybody<br/>
        - Some people were interested in getting back to the basics and discussing the core values and practices<br/>
        - Some people were interesting in exchanging on real world experiences,war stories and tools<br/>
        - Some people were interested in doing workshops, role playing/games or projects<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Knowing that, we decided to experiment the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        - The group will continue to meet and Cafe Veranda (no more karaoke, we scared the guy), once a month, <br/>
        on the first Thursday.<br/>
        - Formal presentations on Agile/XP practices will take place during the Montreal Agile Users Group meeting.<br/>
        That hopefully will help cross-pollination between the 2 groups.<br/>
        - A follow up on the presentation will be done to people interested, in the next XP Group meeting. <br/>
        People from the Agile meeting are encouraged to come discuss the subject. If there is enough interest,<br/>
        we can organize practical exercises for a another meeting.<br/>
        - A second discussion group is held on a related subject. This will interest the more "experienced"<br/>
        members. This second discussion group is less formally organized and can take various forms.<br/>
        - Study groups/projects are done outside of the group meetings but participants are encouraged to <br/>
        share their experience with the group.<br/>
        - A list of subject proposals is posted on the wiki/list and people vote the content of the next meeting.<br/>
        - We encourage people to suggest ideas for future meetings.<br/>
        - We would like to try pairing new members/more experienced members to give presentations at the Agile<br/>
        Users Group or organize discussions at the XP Users Group.<br/>
