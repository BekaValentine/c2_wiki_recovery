        <em>Note: this topic is </em>'not<em>' related to security breaches (spam-bot "zombies"), but rather obsolescence patterns.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We can't always afford to throw away investment in older technologies. Some technologies survive due to the excessive cost and risks associated with change even when there's a consensus amongst most people that we'd be better off in the long term converting.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be difficult, however, to say when a technology is truly obsolete. Although one technology may seem 'obviously' better than another, a closer look often reveals advantages of both. As always, don't use a snappy epithet as a substitute for critical thinking.
      </p>

        See the <a href="ScaleOfObsolescence.html">ScaleOfObsolescence</a>; it might be useful to attach scores to the technologies listed here.

Occasionally someone really does need that final increment in speed that <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> can give. Often people that write OSes must write a few words dealing with interrupts in <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>. Also, most CPUs have registers needed for systems programming which aren't abstracted by high-level languages. Further, how does one convince any compiler to spew out native relocatable code that has no independent requirement for a language overhead? Sometimes it is necessary to do really bizarre things with memory mapping, including unmapping and remapping the code segment. The trampoline that ties them together must be written in assembly. And no, I'm not a virus writer or something like that.

               Making a kernel "32-bit" doesn't really mean anything except that the default word/address size has changed. I think this is a WintelCulturalAssumption, where the 16/32 address size shift happened to coincide with the implementation of Virtual Memory Management in Intel processors making things like proper memory protection possible. On other platforms, these two innovations didn't necessarily coincide. So, talking about "true 32-bit kernel" when meaning "true memory protection" is IMO somewhat erroneous.

               <em>but looking closer:</em> Only pointer size matters here (All other things being equal, 64-bit systems do not significantly outperform 32-bit systems). The leap from 16-bits to 32-bits was inevitable and necessary, but 32-bits might be enough for 90+% of what gets done with computers <a href="WithinTwentyYears.html">WithinTwentyYears</a>. <em>The 32/64-bit OS shift is in the </em><a href="WinTel.html">WinTel</a> world not at all like the 16/32 shift - instead of a new generation of operating systems, all that's happening is 32-bit operating systems being reworked for larger address/word sizes. So, 64-bit operating systems are in fact 32-bit, but with 32 extra bits - while the 32-bit operating systems were complete rewrites (Win NT or OS/2 vs DOS/Win3.1/Win95) of their 16-bit counterparts<em></em>

               <em>but looking even closer:</em> Many others say that tube-loving audiophiles are nuts, and it's all in their head. At any rate, few (if any) claims that tubes are superior have been validated by statistically-valid, double-blind studies. Many audiophiles retort that such studies themselves are flawed - that the only evidence that matters is the opinion of an "expert listener" (i.e. an audiophile) aware of his environment (i.e. already knows whether the amp uses tubes or transistors).

               That's only talking about studies that looked at distortion-free amplification. This was all objectively settled a very long time ago.

Don't turn it up to 11, and then it doesn't matter which you use.

                   CDs have their problems, but "bulky"? Compared to what, a diskette? BTW if you did happen to want one for your computer, they've come way down; today's paper shows $40 for a combo CD/DVD drive, $60 for a dual 8x DVD writer (very useful for larger quantities of data than a CDROM can hold). Even DVDs are too small, but nonetheless a cheaper archival/backup solution than swappable hard drives.

In the age of computers, one of the key benefits of SI (use of powers of 10) becomes less and less important. <em>And powers of 10 is not necessarily an advantage. Imperial units are based on multiples of 2 and 3 (3 teaspoons in a tablespoon, 2 tablespoons in a ounce, 8 ounces in a cup, etc.), which makes it very easy to do scaling and conversions in your head. If I use 2 tablespoons of coffee per 12 ounces of water, and I want to brew 4 mugs worth, how much water and coffee should I use? Answer: 6 cups of water and a half-cup of coffee.</em> Imperial measurements also provide a good level of granularity for hand-made objects eg inches are still used for quilting squares; gallons are a good measure of home-brew etc.

(yards in a perch, equal 16.5 feet), 11 (22 yards in a chain, but this is 1/80 of a mile, but that still involves a multiple of 5)...  <em>(But 5 != 5.5, so that is </em>yet another<em> factor you have to remember.)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>but looking closer:</em> Imperial units are more natural to human scales than SI units are.  When cooking, it's more natural to think in terms of teaspoons, tablespoons, and cups (where there aren't good "liter" equivalents); in measuring things, inches and feet can be better than centimeters (whereas yards and meters are about the same), and so forth.  At least, that's been the case for me...YMMV.  (And this is probably a part of the reason why Americans have resisted the change...)

        When I first read the title of the page, I understood "Zombie" to mean "technologies which <em>should</em> be long dead (technologically) but aren't (on the marketplace)".

        Anyone here into using "old" technologies? Especially someone using or maintaining SAG's Natural and Adabas. If so, what ya think? Is this fading away in front of all that hitec java, jini, corba, sql and stuff? Or will micro$oft rule the world shortly with all it's proprietary "must-install-to-run-the-latest-things" strategy? Just a thought...

        I was recently at a user group meeting where the director of research and development for a fortune 500 company was telling us that Java is the future, and all other programming languages will go away within the next 10 years. "Wait a minute," I said, "<strong>Your company</strong> is still using COBOL 74 for its main applications!" (And they refuse to upgrade to COBOL 85 or COBOL 95, as it would require recompiling their programs, which they claim they can't do. They have the source code; they claim that they can't afford to compile it.) So I'm sure that many familiar old technologies will still be around, for as long as the hardware holds out.
