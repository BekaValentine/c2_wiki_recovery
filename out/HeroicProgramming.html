        Heroic Programming

      <p>
        <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a>, usually a pejorative term, is used to describe the expenditure of huge amounts of (coding) effort by talented people to overcome shortcomings in process, project management, scheduling, architecture or any other shortfalls in the execution of a software development project in order to complete it. <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> is often the only course of action left when poor planning, insufficient funds, and impractical schedules leave a project stranded and unlikely to complete successfully. It is highly probable that more projects are, in fact, completed by acts of <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> than by proper analysis, design, architecting, planning, scheduling, budgeting and implementation combined. Many people (especially methodologists and consultants in the business, of which I am one) would disagree with this last statement, but in my experience, this sad fact is most likely true and is one of the most important obstacles that the software design and engineering community must overcome.

        I fear this may be true. I am <strong>sure</strong> that the following is true: "more projects have failed through the insufficiency of <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> than from any other single cause."
      </p>
      <p>
        When I reflect on my failed projects, it seems that many/most failed from trying to do too much in too little time. Even the best hero (and we know who he is) can't really produce good software forever doing 80 hour weeks. Stopping to think what <strong>not</strong> to do could have saved some of those projects.

        Failure due to "trying to do too much in too little time" is often merely a <em>symptom</em> of the problem of MediocreManager, which just a subset of the problem of MediocreTalent, which in-turn is a subset of HopelessApproach.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I look back on my own failed projects I see <em>squandered</em> time rather than lack of time. I see projects that could easily have been built by a handful of good programmers in 6 months attempted unsuccessfully by <em>legions</em> of programmers, project managers, program managers, process managers, configuration managers, u.i. designers, business analysts, product marketing managers, directors, vice-presidents, etcetera, spending tens of thousands of hours squabbling in conference rooms and tens of thousands of hours producing never-to-be-read paperwork, in noisy five-acre cube farms, housed inside hermetically sealed buildings with stale air, cheap lighting, and bad coffee.

        "Too busy mopping up to fix the leak" is another related expression. People become obsessed with testing and fixing, papering over the cracks, etc. Although the fundamental flaws are known, it's usually easier to justify a quick fix.

        One time I was brought in on a large project to perform triage and find out the reasons it was over a year late and nowhere near close to completing. The cause of my <a href="DilbertMoment.html">DilbertMoment</a>: the first thing I asked for was the project plan, and after much squirming and avoidance they finally told me that they were so busy completing the projects (over 50 coders, heads down in the cubicles) that they had no time to update the project plan so it was about 9 months out of sync and had no bearing on reality. This is commonplace in my experience and usually results from lack of good project management skills on the part of the project leads.
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I have seen, real project planning and management is thrown out the door because it fails to meet expectations and doesn't tell people want they want to know when they want to know it (PM usually tells you that you are in trouble after it's too late to do anything). One concept I have been interested in is <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a>, or the measurement of the rate at which scheduled events in the project are taking place. For example, if you are driving to New York at 60 miles an hour, and you have 60 miles to go you will naturally think you'll get there in an hour. But 3 miles away, you'll slow to 3 miles an hour and you'll still have an hour to go. Currently, most project management methods do not measure this and consequently often misforecast the time and effort that goes into a project, especially since software systems are prone to the "last 10% takes 90% of the time" syndrome. <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a> measurements can identify when things slow down soon after they happen and allow for more realistic forecasting. It's still not a panacea and will not help projects that are deep in the throes of a misguided attempt to finish the project through <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a>, but it's a start.

        About triage and <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a>, a little CultureBuildingStory I kept hearing at EvansAndSutherland (a <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> heaven - i.e. lots of it) was when, way late into a big expensive project, the project manager was told a particular card was being difficult to test. He asked about the other cards of the same type - "They are OK, it is only this one card we have spent several weeks (of 15-hour days) unsuccessfully trying to debug." After some more questions, the PM asked to see the card. He took it and broke it over his knee. "It's a broken card," he said. "Use a different one."

        I'm somewhat unconvinced of the downsides of <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a>. I understand that, in general, <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> can be a bad thing to encourage. However, I work at a company with a Hero Culture - I'd say 80% people in department would be the absolute <a href="AlphaGeek.html">AlphaGeek</a> if they worked elsewhere. We have done the proverbial "shove ten pounds of s--- into a five pound bag" - creating a working DMT DSL implementation using less than 1/10th the memory that our competitors use (thus smaller die size and less cost, good things). And the reason we do so is because most everyone casts themselves as a hero - the impossible is expected of each of us and we step up to the plate and knock it into the stands. It is a team culture in a very macro sense: everyone is good friends, we hang out together, watch each others kids, etc. But in the office, it is very competitive, a game of "Who can do the coolest thing" with a new winner every week. I dig the culture, and I accept the fact that it isn't conducive to newcomers, so eventually it will have to be abandoned, but in the meantime I'm enjoying every minute of working there, and working with a team that is extremely good at what it does despite our internal chaos. -- TimBornemisza

        I wouldn't simply correlate <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> with poor planning and disorganization, a.k.a doesn't work because it implies <a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a>.

It might get product decisions all messed up, though. But I'd generally trust a (peer I know/work with and respect) hacker's decision any day. Functional business statistically get things all wrong a lot more.

        Here's an idea. I've got a 10000-line computer game that's unfinished and I'm partly loathed to go back to it, as I programmed it in straight C, the first 6000 lines went by without even using a single "struct" command! What I reckon would be useful is some sort of programming method that allows you to add new functionality to a program that was originally written really badly, without breaking it... I'm probably dreaming. I know there are various salvage operations you can do like putting all new code in separate functions to isolate it from the rest of the mess...

        <em>In my experience, the problem is not that </em><a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> exists, it's that a lot of programmers want to do it and that there is a company cultural assumption that people will do it. A lot of people like the idea of being the hero, and want to be thought of as the person who saved a project: we all want praise for doing a good job and pulling a project in on time. Managers love a HeroicProgrammer because that programmer is papering over the cracks (or gaping chasms) in the project (at whatever level, be it technical or managerial). Companies who operate a meritocratic promotional system also often see the individuals as key to the success of a project (or failure), and are hence inherently geared to having low TruckNumbers. These combined mean that the focus shifts towards individual effort and away from collaboration towards a common goal, hence a <a href="HeroCulture.html">HeroCulture</a> arises. No-one wants to be seen as the <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a> or feel as though their perceived lack of effort was the cause of failure for the project. So everyone tries to work harder than the other guy, hoping they'll be the one who has the breakthrough and meets the deadline set by the project manager. It is the worst case of <a href="WeWillTry.html">WeWillTry</a>. Pity the person who "wins" and becomes the hero, because she's set a precedent for future and management will expect her to be the hero again when the next project strays too close to the rocks. Do this a couple of times, and you're well on your way to forming your own fully fledged <a href="HeroCulture.html">HeroCulture</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issues is that often the ones regarded as heroes are those who stay long hours to fix things that were done wrong in the first place, as opposed to those who did it right in the first place, and went home on time every day. I worked at such a place, where the Employee of the Month award was given to the same guy 3 months running because he was staying late to fix code he bollixed up by coding without a design.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I've found that deciding DoNotBeTheHero encourages concentration. When I know I'm leaving after eight hours, I really try to get something done during the regular work day. Mostly I succeed, and avoid the graduate student dormitory atmosphere so common in programming.
