        Java Bigotry
      </h1>
      <p>
        The tendancy of fans of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> to assume that their language is the One True programming language, and to bash other languages (see <a href="CppBashing.html">CppBashing</a> in particular) for not doing things the Java Way.  Perhaps spurred on by marketing hype from <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the tendancy for pro-Java comments on sites like <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> to be modded up, sometimes at the expense of more balanced points of view.

        <em>This is interesting to me because I've noted that Slashdot is particularily anti-java. I get the feeling reading Slashdot that if you're not a Perl/Ruby/sh scripting, kernel hacking maniac you aren't cool at all.</em>

        How is this substantially different from any other sort of LanguageBigotry? -- francis

      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="JavaBigotry.html">JavaBigotry</a> is more serious because Java is the language most college students are being taught in. As a result, we are spawning a generation of Java-only programmers, especially among less talented graduates.<strong></strong>

        <em>What do you call it when someone likes every language </em>but<em> Java?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Most folks who dislike Java either a) dislike lower-level languages even more (ie <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>), or b) dislike <em>higher</em>-level languages even more (ie <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>).
        </li>
      </ul>

        What's not to like about Java? It has everything! There is <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> and <a href="JavaServerPages.html">JavaServerPages</a> and <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> and <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and JSQL. If you visit <a href="http://www.apache.org/AmericanStandard">http://www.apache.org/AmericanStandard</a> <em>(</em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 2006-07-21)<em> you can read about the effort to add the kitchen sink to Java.</em>
