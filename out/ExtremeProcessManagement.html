        Extreme Process Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        The attempt to move the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> methodology to being used for more processes than programming.

        <em>I'm not sure I understand the distinction.  What is "process management?" </em>

        Perhaps I used the wrong phrase.  What I'm trying to get at is taking <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, and applying it to engineering a manufactoring line, or other things like that.  Where I work, they are trying to do something similar, except they are RUP fans.

        My FatherInLaw, ValAndres, ran a project to retrofit two psychiatric wards for a prison. He had been reading <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplained.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplained</a>, so even though he had a year to get them both open, he pared the scope until he could open the first one in one month, and the second one month later. Then they began refining the wards, opening access to outside exercise space, etc. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>
