      <p>
        I live in deepest New Jersey, too far from New York to
        get there very often, and too close for my local town
        to have a night life.
        I play various musical instruments, some well enough that
        I'm not embarrassed to play them in public.
        Occasionally, I play with a local band known as the
        Barnburners, composed mostly of ex-Bell Labs folks.

        I'm an alum of the AT&T Worldnet project.
        Many of us, including <a href="PaulChisholm.html">PaulChisholm</a> struggled through to
        get to 1/2 million customers, then moved on to pursue
        other work.

        November 2002: Like so many people at Bell Labs, in October I was caught up in Lucent's efforts to "right-size".  I'm currently at liberty, and interviewing up a storm.  Not sure where I'm headed yet.  It's a safe bet it won't be in telecommunications, though...

        January 2003: I landed in the Software Engineering Department at Siemens Corporate Research, Princeton, NJ.

        It's starting out slowly, but nobody seems to mind.  I've edited a couple of papers for colleagues, and I'm working on a third right now.

        <a href="DavidLaurance.html">DavidLaurance</a> studied architecture at Yale.
        Architecture students often work through the night,
        building models,
        then running with them into early morning class,
        often covering them from the rain,
        huddled over them to protect them,
        not awake or motivated to pay attention to much else.
        The architecture building was designed
        by the dean of the school,
        who was 5' 5".
        David is 6' 5".
        He spent a lot of time trying to run through doorways
        that were comfortable to the architect,
        but that smacked David in the forehead.

        In my experience,
        he's run into a lot of software the same way.

        Actually, I usually come to work well-rested.
        Maybe there's something wrong with that software, whacking me in the head like that...
