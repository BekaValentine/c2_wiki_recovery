        Subsystem Test

      <p>
        A test similar to a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> except that it tests the interactions between units.  See <a href="ShouldUnitTestsTestInteroperations.html">ShouldUnitTestsTestInteroperations</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        No, in that in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, the <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a> is concerned with testing that the software does what the customer wants it to do, regardless of the specific structure of the code.  The <a href="SubsystemTest.html">SubsystemTest</a> is like a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> in that it is used primarily by the programmer to confirm that his code is working.  The difference is that it doesn't test a single class but a group of classes that work together.
