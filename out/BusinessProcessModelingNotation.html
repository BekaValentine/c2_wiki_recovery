        Business Process Modeling Notation
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BusinessProcessModelingNotation.html">BusinessProcessModelingNotation</a> (BPMN) is gaining favor as the <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a> tool of choice, overtaking the use of IDEF3.
      </p>
      <p>
        An introduction to this standard can be seen at <a href="http://www.bptrends.com/publicationfiles/03%2D04%20WP%20BPMN%20and%20BPM%20Owen%2DRaj%2Epdf.">http://www.bptrends.com/publicationfiles/03%2D04%20WP%20BPMN%20and%20BPM%20Owen%2DRaj%2Epdf.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The person credited with the development of BPMN is StephenWhite from <a href="IbmCorporation.html">IbmCorporation</a>; he has an example of using BPMN to model a <a href="BusinessProcessExecutionLanguage.html">BusinessProcessExecutionLanguage</a> (BPEL) process at <a href="http://bpmn.org/Documents/Mapping%20BPMN%20to%20BPEL%20Example.pdf.">http://bpmn.org/Documents/Mapping%20BPMN%20to%20BPEL%20Example.pdf.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are significant members of the IT community who view the arrival of <a href="BusinessProcessModelingNotation.html">BusinessProcessModelingNotation</a> as signifying the end of (BPEL); see, for example, <a href="DavidChappell.html">DavidChappell</a> blog at <a href="http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2006/06/standardizing-right-thing-bpmn-or-bpel.">http://www.davidchappell.com/blog/2006/06/standardizing-right-thing-bpmn-or-bpel.</a> Others are not so sure; a comment sourced from 2006 paper at <a href="http://www.eclarus.com/pdf/BPMN_BPEL_Mapping.pdf">http://www.eclarus.com/pdf/BPMN_BPEL_Mapping.pdf</a> said "it is technically challenging to rewrite arbitrary BPMN diagrams to be BPEL isomorphic" -> meaning "not practical".
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, users of BPMN are probably oversold in relying on the use of this tool to generate code for <a href="WorkFlow.html">WorkFlow</a> processes. Without the upfront data collection and applying the discipline required for code generation later on, it may well be better to start things from scratch. <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a>

        <strong>Limits and Limitations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A starting attempt to list the remarks as they appear
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Limits</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Keith Harrison Broninski explained in his July06 article on the future of <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a>, that BPMN is not expected to excel in HumanInteractionManagement, where another approach called Role Activity Diagram is said to be more suited to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Limitations</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Forgot where I saw it, but one of the readings claim unless done to a convention, BPMN mapping to implementable BPEL "takes a PHD to do it". Since BPMN is to be used in <a href="BusinessModeling.html">BusinessModeling</a>, where mappers (using the <a href="TheMapIsNotTheTerritory.html">TheMapIsNotTheTerritory</a> metaphor) are not PhD scientists, and without proper funding for infrastructure (e.g. naming conventions), the various BPMN trailbrazers are going to be "all over the map".
      </p>
      <p>
        One comment to <a href="DavidChappell.html">DavidChappell</a> blog basically said with BPEL he can define and execute. BPMN is (not like that).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Subprocess limitation"
      </p>
      <p>
        My BPMN instructor advised us to stay away from defining subprocess and it appears puzzling since the drawing tool has it. Recently I came across Bruce Silver blog claiming BPEL has not got the concept of subprocess. So maybe BPMN can have subprocess, if you do not want to implement later on. I understand the upcoming BPEL 2.0 will have subprocess. Meanwhile, I would not use BPMN for any top down modeling exercise.

        In comparison with the Activity diagrams (AD) in <a href="UmlTwo.html">UmlTwo</a>, it is probably not up to <a href="ObjectManagementGroup.html">ObjectManagementGroup</a> to decide which of the two alternatives will prevail. For users who do process modeling and have an extensive collection of UML class diagrams, <a href="UmlTwo.html">UmlTwo</a> is the better choice, due to tight integration. For users who start <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> projects from a top-down business perspective, e.g. using <a href="ValueStream.html">ValueStream</a>Mapping and the like, <a href="BusinessProcessModelingNotation.html">BusinessProcessModelingNotation</a> is the way to go.

        There appear to be a large body of vendors and academia backing the use of BPMN. Since I am a proponent of BusinessDrivenDesign, I have a natural affinity for <a href="TopDownDesign.html">TopDownDesign</a> that can be implemented. So this July2006 blog expressing dis-ease on BPMN interest me. Read "More on BPMN" at <a href="http://itredux.com/blog/2006/07/23/more-on-bpmn/,">http://itredux.com/blog/2006/07/23/more-on-bpmn/,</a> and an early response "Does BPMN belong to BPEL" at <a href="http://www.brsilver.com/wordpress/2006/07/20/does-bpmn-belong-to-bpel/">http://www.brsilver.com/wordpress/2006/07/20/does-bpmn-belong-to-bpel/</a> to help your own decision-making.

        <em>I am having discussions of the applicability of </em><a href="BusinessProcessModelingNotation.html">BusinessProcessModelingNotation</a> vs other <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a> techniques. I am looking into the use of RoleActivityModeling as an alternative to BPMN for <a href="BusinessProcessReengineering.html">BusinessProcessReengineering</a> type initiatives, primarily due to the perceived increased ability to communicate roles/functions and their participation in functions/processes. However tool support for RAD is not easy to find, and that the <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> team certainly want to restrict the dilution of expertise in the services they offer. Anyone who has more to offer please see question posted in <a href="RoleModeling.html">RoleModeling</a> page.<em></em>

           My gripe against any method that use swimlanes is that it takes up too much realestate in a diagram done that way, BPMN and AD included.

           Use of Swimlanes is seen as an arbitrary and imprecise way to depict system behavior.
