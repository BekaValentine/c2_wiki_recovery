        I've just heard Lessig address the O'Reilly peer to peer conference. His most vivid image was that of Kubrick's Hal being turned off one module at a time as an analogy for the recording industry (Dave) disassembling the Napster community one song at a time.

        Pay attention to this guy. Look for his writing and speaking where ever you can find it. He clearly understands how far along we are in an intellectual, social and legal revolution and what we must do as individuals to ensure it comes out well. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        <em>Code and Other Laws of Cyberspace</em> is my bible. It sits quietly at the bottom of my backpack; I take it everywhere I go.

        After writing on <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> for about 8 months, Karsten Self pointed to me to the book. Rusty Foster, Maynard Gelinas, Karsten and I were in the middle of a discussion about how to progress kuro5hin's rating system. He made reading it a prerequisite to continue. I can see why. Almost everything I've even thought about, Lessig has but better. As Karsten says, "Lessig <em>gets it.</em>" -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
