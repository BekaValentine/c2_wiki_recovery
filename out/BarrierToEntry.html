        Barrier To Entry
      </h1>
      <p>
        A particularly high level of investment (money, effort, whatever) which is required to be able to effectively participate in some market, etc. - especially one dominated by one or more established players. Applies to traditional business markets, as well as other "markets" that have little if anything to do with money or commerce at all.

        Various examples that affect technology:

           The WindowsApi has long been considered a <a href="BarrierToEntry.html">BarrierToEntry</a> (via <a href="NetworkEffects.html">NetworkEffects</a>) into the operating system market - one that allowed <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> to maintain a monopoly. Several technologies that threatened that barrier were blunted/co-opted by Microsoft (in violation of anti-trust law) - namely the Web browser, and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>. (Java has not yet been successfully blunted on the server side, however). It is now alleged by European anti-trust authorities that media codecs/players are another <a href="BarrierToEntry.html">BarrierToEntry</a>.

           <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a> did manage to finally knock down this <a href="BarrierToEntry.html">BarrierToEntry</a> somewhat, by providing an OS which is a) more robust than any MS offering (though XP is far better than any of its predecessors); b) cheaper (free, in fact), and c) due to its <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> nature, unable to be put out of business.

           In the programming language field; certain languages (C++, Java)are <a href="MainstreamLanguage.html">MainstreamLanguage</a>s; they have an <a href="ArmyOfProgrammers.html">ArmyOfProgrammers</a> and a whole library of <a href="ForDummies.html">ForDummies</a> books written about them, and gazillions of lines of code in production. Other languages, arguably superior, are not widely used. A <a href="BarrierToEntry.html">BarrierToEntry</a> exists; most shops won't consider <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> (for example) for their IT infrastructure due to a (perceived) lack of Smalltalk programmers, a (perceived) paucity of Smalltalk tools and implementations, and a significant investment in some other language.  Likewise, many programmers (especially <a href="MoneyOrientedProgrammers.html">MoneyOrientedProgrammers</a>) won't bother to learn a language if isn't something that will get their resume' noticed.
