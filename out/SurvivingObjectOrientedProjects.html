        Amazon's "instant recommendations" service
        just recommended Alistair's book.  Cool.  --<a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>

        Interesting little note about the efficacy of advertising I recently learned.  Amazon highlighted the book for about 3 days on its Computers & Internet page, with a nice review.... the book instantly started selling, eclipsing even <a href="UmlDistilled.html">UmlDistilled</a> for a few hours or a day.  It jumped to Amazon's top 100 of computer books (#47) that week.  Wow! Did I feel great, loved, rich, famous, etc., etc.  Then the great webby spotlight of fame moved on to its next target, having given me my 3 days of glory.  And now life is back to normal (sure is dark around here).  Quite the experience, exilarating and humbling, in quick succession. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        "Stay away from C++ for IT projects" caught my eye. I know neither <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> nor <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, but may be forced to learn a little as I am learning <a href="DistributedInternetArchitecture.html">DistributedInternetArchitecture</a> and wanting to create some server components. If not C++, what language, <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>?

        <em>The best choice depends on your context, of course. What Alistair says is that it is never C++. Bear in mind that the book was written at the time when it was a debatable subject. By now, I would think, it should be pretty obvious to anyone that Java or C#, if not necessarily the best choice, is better for IT apps than C++ in almost all cases. Or do you have a different opinion?</em>

        <a href="HorsesForCourses.html">HorsesForCourses</a>, surely? A lot of people use a mixture of technologies. We use C++, Java, C#, Python, OCaml, Excel and so on. Each has different strengths and weaknesses. Saying "X is better than Y" in the absense of context doesn't convey much information to me.

        <em>As it says, the context is "writing an IT application".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now all we have to do is define (constrain) "IT application".
