        Programming In Vietnam
      </h1>
      <p>
        Programming in the country of Vietnam is probably similar to
        programming in any other country. Unicode support might be an
        additional issue.

      <p>
        However, if you were an American and programming in Vietnam
        during the Indo-Chinese conflict (a.k.a the "Vietnam war"),
        then you probably had some additional problems, as described
        in
