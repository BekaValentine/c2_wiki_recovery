        <li>
           children and 4 grandchildren -- Actually they are my step children, I don't have children of my own because alcoholism runs in my family, and I didn't want to pass on bad genes, overpopulate the world, and leave any children in a world of decline. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Limits_to_Growth</a> influenced my decision. Now global warming reinforces that I made a good decision. I hope the world will not fail as Easter Island did. The clock is ticking.

        Anti-interests:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Politics -- Ballots should include a vote for "None of the Above," and if "None of the Above" wins, a new election for that position should be held. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Religion -- Atheism is a religion. Most, maybe all, *isms are religions. Religions teach faith not fact, and expect people to suspend reason and to be faithful. These practices have led to wars and other atrocities, but religion also teaches people to be good and do good things.

        Programming has always been easy for me. While at the University of Texas at Austin, I read about primary and secondary languages, and the differences between spoken languages and computer languages. I've been interested ever since, and have performed many mind experiments over the years. Of course, these experiments have led me to design a new language, an extensible language called Ameba (not Amoeba), a programmable calculator with a metalanguage. IMHO, its closest relative is the meta-assembler, but it is significantly different from any meta-assembler that I have used. As of 2010, I am finishing a design document, and will begin development soon.
