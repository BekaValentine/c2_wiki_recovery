      <p>
        <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> is great, but any kind of dialog can easily get off the path of healthy discourse and onto the path of <a href="YabbitsAndAntiYabbits.html">YabbitsAndAntiYabbits</a>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Up is up, and down is down, there's no arguing with that.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Yabbit, there's always sideways, and we have to consider that.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Yabbit, what </em>'I'm<em>' saying is that in turns of verticality, there is up and there is also down.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Yabbit, you're wrong in saying that, because of the whole left-to-rightness issue and how it intercedes.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        ...and so on, ad infinitum...
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find yourself saying 'Yeah, but...' too often in a dialog, whether you use those simple words or not, give it a re-think.  On the other hand, if someone's yabbiting <em>you</em>, it's a good time to <a href="OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard.html">OnlySayThingsThatCanBeHeard</a>.
