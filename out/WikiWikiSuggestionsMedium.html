           SearchOnSave capability - Takes group of one to three consecutive words on a page when it is saved, make them into a wiki name if that name exists. Presented for author to accept / reject. Example: occurrences of 'wiki name' in this paragraph would become <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

           For what it's worth, <strong>grep -i "wiki  *name[s]* "</strong> gets 34 hits on 29 pages. I could run more searches to see if this idea has merit. I note that people when editing by hand tend to use <strong></strong><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a><strong> once and then </strong>unit test<strong> for the remainder of the page. It might get annoying if <em>every</em> possible link were made. Also, what about </strong>wiki name space<strong> - do we link </strong><a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a><strong> or </strong><a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a><strong>? I know, you suggested it be offered to the author, but it could be a burden. Oh, and I agree that it's a cool idea - it's what I do on my personal wiki.</strong>

           Scatter / Gather for Wiki Pages. I.e. Edit Window can show a gather of say 5 pages concatenated together in a single edit window, with a delimiter say xxxxxxxx between pages. Save then scatters the updated pages back. Would make the editing in refactoring easier, with fewer editor windows open (WikiScatterGatherDiscussion). -- <a href="JeanJordaan.html">JeanJordaan</a>

           Fix mildly broken HTML emitted for preformatted text - Wiki produces stuff like <p><pre>blah<p>blah</pre>, which is incorrectly nested: <p> is a <em>container</em>, not a <em>separator</em>. More Piki Wiki Html.. for <a href="KonquerorBrowser.html">KonquerorBrowser</a>: list items currently begin with a space. They shouldn't.

           As a <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>, I would like a complement to the <a href="WikiStatistics.html">WikiStatistics</a> that tells me which entries have been accessed most often in the last week or month. This probably requires a weekly / monthly batch script that processes the web server access log file and dumps the results to a file (StatisticsForWeekThree, just like ChangesInWeekThree), as on-demand processing (current <a href="WikiStatistics.html">WikiStatistics</a> style) would be too slow. The benefit with such statistics is that we could learn which types of pages, categories, and searches succeed to attract readers. This might stop the current guessing about their usefulness. -- <a href="LarsAronsson.html">LarsAronsson</a> (19 May 2001)

           For those uncertain about their <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> (i.e. browser cookie contents), how about showing it on the edit page, perhaps with a link to the page to use to set it. -- <a href="DaveParker.html">DaveParker</a>

           Add a text field to <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a> and <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> where poster can summarize their change. This would support the failed <a href="ChangeSummary.html">ChangeSummary</a> functionality on the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page. Some other wikis have successfully implemented this kind of functionality.

           Have the CGI scripts cope with clicks on pages like <strong>http://c2.com/cgi/wiki</strong> (note no page name).  The HTTP server can handle the URL, which to me implies a promise that links will work.  Just declaring that the CGI scripts need not cope with the links ignores the fact that the promise has already been made before the scripts run.  -- <a href="DerekPeschel.html">DerekPeschel</a>
