        All Practical Purposes
      </h1>

        A research psychologist is doing an experiment to test human behavior. In the test setup, there is a room with an incredibly attractive, naked, god-like person opposite the door. The test subject enters, and is required to stay still until a bell rings, every five minutes, at which point they can halve the distance to the goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first test subject is a mathematician. When the setup is explained, the mathematician replies, "Oh, this is ZenosParadox, it's impossible for me to actually reach my target. Forget it."
      </p>
      <p>
        The second test subject is an engineer, who says, "Sure, let's do it." The interviewer mentions ZenosParadox, to which the reply comes, "Yeah, but even so, I can get close enough for all practical purposes."
