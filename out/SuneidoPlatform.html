        Suneido Platform
      </h1>
      <p>
        Homepage of Suneido is <a href="http://www.suneido.com">http://www.suneido.com</a>  Latest release is Feb. 4, 2007. The latest snapshot release is from April. 4th, 2011
      </p>
      <p>
        Suneido is a complete, integrated application platform - a system for developing and deploying applications without the frustrations of integrating multiple different products.  Suneido incorporates an object-oriented <a href="SuneidoLanguage.html">SuneidoLanguage</a>, client-server relational <a href="SuneidoDatabase.html">SuneidoDatabase</a>, and application frameworks and components.   It includes the <a href="SuneidoDevelopmentEnvironment.html">SuneidoDevelopmentEnvironment</a> used to create applications as well as the client and server required to run applications on your network.  Suneido is <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software - it is provided free, with complete source code, to give you full control over your development projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suneido's mission is to provide a simple, open, lightweight, industrial strength alternative to large, complex, expensive, closed application technologies such as Visual Basic, Delphi, Oracle, and SQL Server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suneido currently runs on Microsoft Windows 95, 98, ME, NT, 2000, and XP. Windows NT, 2000, or XP are recommended for the server.  A Linux version is planned. but when?
      </p>
      <p>
        Suneido includes simple language translation support.  Translation tables are included to run the IDE in French, Italian, Spanish, Russian, German, Czech, Slovak, Norwegian, Dutch, Vietnamese, Hungarian, Portuguese, and Bulgarian.  
      </p>

        <em>What is the itch that this language scratches?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The itch for me, as the instigator of this project, was to have a free, open source, <em>integrated</em> platform for developing and deploying information systems.
        I like C++ and Java just fine.  But they're complex (C++ especially) and they're not complete solutions.  You still need a database, and a user interface, and networking.
        Look at all the pieces Microsoft would have you use to build an application -
        Visual C++, Visual Basic. SQL Server, COM, DCOM, COM++, .Net ...
        Even if you don't mind the cost and licensing, there's a huge amount of complexity there.
        And if you do run into a bug, you're out of luck.
        <em>All-in-one</em> solutions like Suneido have their own weaknesses,
        but it can handle many applications and at least it's manageable.

        Andrew, would you agree - I only did a 2 hours testing session with Suneido - that its overall structure as a product is nearest to MS Access? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Both
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           have integrated db, language, development environment
        </li>
        <li>
           target (multiuser) database applications
        </li>
        <li>
           available for Win32 systems
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What Suneido has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           open source
        </li>
        <li>
           a small footprint
        </li>
        <li>
           a smalltalk-like open system
        </li>
        <li>
           an application framework "Book" similar to an HTML-based HLP-file
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What Suneido still lacks:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a form/subform editor (discussion moved to <a href="SuneidoDevelopmentEnvironment.html">SuneidoDevelopmentEnvironment</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           separate databases for program logic, customer data
        </li>
        <li>
           a bit of performance
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>Similarities to MS Access</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd agree that there are a lot of similarities with MS Access.  Although MS Access is also intended as an end-user application (i.e. for people to make up their own <em>lists</em>) as well as a development tool.  Whereas Suneido (currently, anyway) is just aimed at programmers developing applications.  And I think, although MS Access has it's own database engine, for larger systems you have to use SQL Server.  Also, I think MS Access uses a form of Visual Basic :-(
      </p>
      <p>
        In many ways Suneido is more similar to the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> (which is also not <em>just</em> a language) - dynamic types, integrated development environment written in the language itself, browsers, integrated compiling, etc.  Many of the Smalltalk idioms (as in <a href="SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns.html">SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns</a> by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>) also apply to Suneido.  However, Smalltalk has a completely different syntax and doesn't have its own database.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Separate databases for program logic and customer data</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Helmut - you've tried to explain this to me, but I'm still not convinced (or clear) that it is necessary to <em>physically</em> split data and programs.  (Currently, Suneido stores both the data and the code in a single <em>database</em> file.)  Obviously, you need to be able to update the code without affecting the data, but there are many ways to handle this <em>logically</em> without forcing a <em>physical</em> split.  I can see some value in allowing an application to access multiple databases, but I'm not sure the value justifies the considerable extra complexity.  A common, single, <em>context</em> for an application is very valuable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Book application framework</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although, Suneido's application <em>Books</em> can be used simply like a help file containing HTML pages, (like the Suneido documentation), when used as an application framework, pages can also be Suneido user interface <em>forms</em>.  This lets you use HTML pages for <em>menus</em> and <em>help</em> mixed in with the actual <em>program</em> pages.  I should probably write a better description of the SuneidoBookMetaphor.

        <em>A Linux version is planned.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This would be cool. Perhaps the simplest way to get such a port might be to use <strong>WineLib</strong> (<a href="http://www.winehq.org/).">http://www.winehq.org/).</a> Just a suggestion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Other people have suggested Wine. I haven't had time to look at it yet.  The first step would be to port the server side since this would be useful, and wouldn't require porting the user interface.  I think in many ways the Linux audience, although smaller than Windows, might be more receptive to Suneido. I keep hoping someone will offer to do the Linux port for me!</em> :-) -- <a href="AndrewMcKinlay.html">AndrewMcKinlay</a>

        I browsed some of the source code today - nice work, Andrew! And I like the decision to use truly relational language to query the database. -- <a href="NikolaToshev.html">NikolaToshev</a>

      <p>
        Thanks Nikola, it's always nice to get some positive feedback.  People seem to be able to write more complex queries easier with a straightforward relational algebra query language than with SQL. -- <a href="AndrewMcKinlay.html">AndrewMcKinlay</a>
