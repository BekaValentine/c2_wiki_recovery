        Write It Down
      </h1>
      <p>
        That which is not written down will evaporate.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is true in specifications and in technical discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In specifications, the writer of the spec will often have a vision that isn't communicated in the document.
      </p>
      <p>
        In discussions, things will seem clear in the moment but the understanding evaporates quickly. This includes both on-the-job discussions and classroom lectures.
