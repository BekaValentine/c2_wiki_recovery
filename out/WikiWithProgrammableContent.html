        Wiki With Programmable Content

        Who knows a Wiki-System in which programmers can experiment with programmable content, integrated in a Wiki forum? -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>

        <em>Why would we want to do this?</em>

      <p>
        Security reasons aside (see below), why not? -- fp
      </p>
      <p>
        The risk is running high of becoming a never-ending process yielding no results. Why indeed. With no purpose, there is no design. Of course, from an aesthetic perspective, Wiki is its own reward. Still, computers are already wiki enough. Software is never truly complete. Bug fixes and third-party support and beta testing and the like. It's all relative. Even the hardware is dynamic when the software becomes more static, but it's a cycle. It only serves us humans when we make the effort to break the cycle by obtaining and using output, or merely turning it off and breaking from the loop somewhere. Editing is not power, neither is restraint. Wiki enthusiasts need to read more <em>Godel, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid</em>.

        Swiki can do this - you can embed <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> code directly in the pages you edit. See <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/mark.guzdial/squeak/pws/active.html">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/fac/mark.guzdial/squeak/pws/active.html</a>

        I've explored this space with a wiki behind my own firewall. Although it gives my windows/browser environment a bit of the feel I've always had with Smalltalk, some errors I made while using it could only be debugged by the author of the server, i.e. me. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        This boils down to SecurityPolicy development. How does one create a SecurityPolicy that implements a SecureSandBox and a FunctionalSandBox at the same time? <a href="CapabilitySystem.html">CapabilitySystem</a>s like <a href="ErosOs.html">ErosOs</a> supposedly provide ProvableSecurity. It would be interesting to put a <a href="CapabilitySystem.html">CapabilitySystem</a> into a <a href="WikiWithProgrammableContent.html">WikiWithProgrammableContent</a>. -- <a href="TaralDragon.html">TaralDragon</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tcl allows scripts inside a SecureSandBox to implement a <a href="CapabilitySystem.html">CapabilitySystem</a> in the form of nested SecureSandBoxes. <a href="SoftWiki.html">SoftWiki</a> can use this to build a hierarchical access control system where each interpreter can impose its own arbitrary restrictions on interpreters that it creates. Of course the first and most important restriction of this kind is something to prevent the SecurityPolicy script from being rewritten. -- <a href="ZygoBlaxell.html">ZygoBlaxell</a>

        I did made a <a href="WikiWithProgrammableContent.html">WikiWithProgrammableContent</a>, which we could call <a href="LukesProgrammableWiki.html">LukesProgrammableWiki</a>, which takes the path of of running programs in a custom interpreter which simply doesn't provide any primitives that could be harmful. -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>

        <em>Part of the </em><a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> as I understand it means that anyone can edit anything. Surely we don't want everybody to be able to run any script on our wiki servers. The really interesting question here is:"what security model do we use?" This causes an essential conflict between the safety and integrity of the server and the open-ended trust of the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. (N.B. I believe that <a href="NikiNiki.html">NikiNiki</a> already embeds JPython.) --<em></em>

      <p>
        <a href="NikiNiki.html">NikiNiki</a> has some access control, so it's a bit safer to allow code, but allowing some pages to be active queries, and authored from a browser, is really cool. -- <a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a>

        <a href="PlatformForInformationApplications.html">PlatformForInformationApplications</a> does some very neat stuff using <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a>, <if>,<let>,<while> tags, very interesting, plus the fact that they are using ServletHandlers to implement the active tags adds another layer of indirection enhancing the security model a bit, and it's <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, and it works.

        Together with the wiki markup in work here: <a href="http://fwiki.logilan.com">http://fwiki.logilan.com</a> , this may become a bundle which, server and client side, bases everything on Forth, though the interpreter is meant in first place as tutorial and practicing system.

        <a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a> does this too. The default markup mode permits embedded DTML (a reporting language) and limited python code. I believe these are interpreted in a safe manner. Some of the wiki functionality is implemented this way, eg the recent changes and jumpsearch pages.

        Question: Fridemar, are you playing with all these constructs like <a href="DoubleColonMessage.html">DoubleColonMessage</a> and the {} tagging to see how they'd work in the normal stream of text and how easy they are to maintain? So that if and when you write a <a href="WikiWithProgrammableContent.html">WikiWithProgrammableContent</a> you have some experience with them?
      </p>
      <p>
        You are just testing/playing? <em>(positioning 'Question:' at the start of your writing. You could have omitted it, without loss of content, thus making your note an </em><a href="AddressedAndSignedMessage.html">AddressedAndSignedMessage</a>:-).<em> I thought of doing this, using the public-domain Win32Forth editor component </em>WinView of TomZimmer. (See <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>) This amazing editor comes as Forth source, has two independent hypertext subsystems implemented. In browse-mode html-links (and some other elementary html-format-tags) are supported, and additionally each clicked Forth Word let you jump to its definition). This editor has even built-in a rudimentary online Web Browser. My main activity behind the scenes, the <a href="DataMusicProject.html">DataMusicProject</a> doesn't allow me to do that at moment. Besides that, I think that there might be better existing solutions, as extensions of the standard Web Browsers. At moment I look urgently for existing DHTML-capable <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a><em>s</em>. You would make me happy to add your favorite forum with programmable content in <a href="JavaScriptEnabledWiki.html">JavaScriptEnabledWiki</a>, if you know one more. -- Fridemar

        There is no need that publicly programmable <a href="WikiClones.html">WikiClones</a> impose a security threat at all. You only have to do it the right way. I'm currently into writing a <a href="ServerSideJavaScript.html">ServerSideJavaScript</a> interpreter running in the <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a> (<a href="http://phpjs.berlios.de/),">http://phpjs.berlios.de/),</a> which will allow to run user contributed code in a <a href="SandBox.html">SandBox</a> (mixing it with <a href="ErfurtWiki.html">ErfurtWiki</a> and <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> somewhen). That is safe as long as you do not provide raw access interfaces to the filesystem or allow unfiltered SQL queries. With a powerful API this would still allow for the majority of interesting features to be written, despite any security restrictions.

        On the Cryptodox wiki, it would be nifty to have "live examples" of encryption and cryptanalysis algorithms. Type in some text, see what the encrypted text looks like, etc. I imagine that "live example" for "simple substitution cipher" might look something like the substitution solving tool Simon Singh wrote ( <a href="http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/frequencypuzzle.htm">http://www.simonsingh.net/The_Black_Chamber/frequencypuzzle.htm</a> ).

        If I ever get my data compression wiki online, "live examples" of data compression algorithms would be nifty. Type in (or paste) some text into one textbox, see several following textboxes show the several stages in compression, followed by the resulting compressed text (in hex?) and the compression ratio. But how do I allow people to improve, wiki-style, each other's experimental compression algorithms, without doing something harmful? I thought that was the whole point of Java and <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> -- that they could be contained in a <a href="SandBox.html">SandBox</a>, guaranteed impossible for them to do anything harmful? -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>
