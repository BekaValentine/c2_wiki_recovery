        Just In Time Design Review
      </h1>
      <p>
        While finding myself on a team of much less accomplished designers (at least to date, they may surpass me soon), I find that pairs often come to get me before they are doing something they aren't totally comfortable with.  Also, the <a href="StandUpMeeting.html">StandUpMeeting</a><strong>'s we have often introduce new </strong><a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a><strong>'s that could be made simpler.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We talk about alternate ways to do it, and the pair does it if they see the benefit (or I insist there is one... but usually it doesn't come to that).  This does not break up the flow of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> at all.  In fact, I think it instills confidence in the others that what a pair can't do well, the team can. -- <a href="KenAuer.html">KenAuer</a>
