        Idea for retrospective: give people big stickies with a letter on.
        Put a word on it that describes the project.

           big sheets labelled "Before the Sprint", "Getting Started", "In the Middle", "At the End".

        Each team makes note cards describing things that happened in the various phases.
        Talk about each others' cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before:  reading, downloading, learning, RSVP, printed Arlo's email, found Python manual, set up sourceforge, ad mailing, install python, wiki page, what's up?, wireless
      </p>
      <p>
        Getting Started: set up Python, downloading, project choosing, get help, helping, describe project, hijacked sourceforge project, too many options?, decided to be an expert, created stories, installed Python card, too much to setup, cards, config problems, Ward
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle: pairing, planning, measuring, debugging, excellent discussions, great coaching, too many people for cards, munchies, transformed in client, show me, how do they read that tiny code?, Macs worked, 2 rooms: one got it, one didn't. It didn't spread, hard time letting the customer be in charge, wrote code, found graphics, ate lunch, not enough experts 2nd day, chocolate!, <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> problems, testing and not testing, glare
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end: Celebrated, drank beer, wish we had more time, eureka, Beer! Sunday: some were absent: brunch, play dates, cycling. Remote eyeballing.
      </p>

        &Delta; Ideas for next time:
        have a subversion server pre-setup.
        Wiki gets used more
        email list
        Some projects decided and staffed ahead
        Review XP practices
        Nametags to help with intros
        Touch and go on powerstrips. Happily, Arlo's office was just downstairs.
        Hub that people know about
        More coaches
        Carry forward existing projects.
        More cross-pollination.
        Chess project felt too large, esp. on Saturday. More projects, smaller teams?
        We did not do enough pair swapping?
      </p>

        Worked well:
        location: downtown, block from Max is nice.
        weekend is mixed blessing... not necessary to be there whole time.
        Python worked well- many of us were there to learn it.
        Ward.
        Bob Langill was a good onsite customer.
        Munchies
        Wide range of ways to participate.
        "Outward looking" projects- real people might use it (vs. only computer people)
        Manageable-sized projects.
        Short iterations. Partner swapping.
        We did OK without dedicated integration machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Appreciations: Ward, Arlo, Kevin, ... 
        Puzzles: tiny screen. Refactoring sorta happened. Iterators.  
        Complaints w/Recommendations
        New Information: a 1-day sprint planned for future.
