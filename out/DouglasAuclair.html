        Hello, all, I had a page for the <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> SWiki
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           send me an email at <a href="mailto://dauclair@hotmail.com.">mailto://dauclair@hotmail.com.</a>  That's where they dont talk about <a href="ObjectShare.html">ObjectShare</a>'s Smalltalk (of which I'm a fan ... I use it, teach with it, and enjoy it).  I'm also very excited about <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> and the progress it's made.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Of course, I'm looking forward to the day when SELF is on as many platforms that Smalltalk is.</strong> :-) ('cause prototyping objects sounds like a whole bunch of fun as compared to creating classes and then instantiating and initializing objects ... I just finished an enlightening paper about metaclasses that had me thinking:  "Butbutbut, aren't traits a simple and elegant way to handle all this?"  (my opinion))
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a CORBA systems designer at work (IONA's OrbixMT).  I'm heavily into <em>Design Patterns</em> ISBN0201633612 using them to build distributed systems.  I use UML to model my designs, so I'm a good customer of <a href="http://www.rational.com">http://www.rational.com</a> since I'm on Rose everyday.  Then I prototype my design in Smalltalk.  Since, however, I'm working on the SGI currently, I implement my systems in C++ (*SIGH*).  So, Bjarne's book ISBN0201889544 is a constant friend at work during my implementation phase, as well as Rational's Purify.  I use the <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a> Tools.h++ library to get as close to Smalltalk as I can for the collection storage and iteration work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm INFJ/INTJ (I really should retake the <a href="MyersBriggs.html">MyersBriggs</a> ... people think I'm very dynamic and outgoing), which makes me a shy <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> (I wear a bracelet with the inscription WWKD -- <a href="WhatWouldKentDo.html">WhatWouldKentDo</a>).  I've absorbed as much <a href="SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns.html">SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns</a> as possible; it's amazing how much quicker my C++ code compiles (!) and how much more flexible the system is.  (Yes, the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> stuff works even for C++.)  Lotsa small functions/lotsa small classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've just completed a Genetic Algorithm implementation in Smalltalk for Windows  NT and Linux.  I prefer work that emphasizes OOAD and mathematics (e.g. I finished a gig at Raytheon working with Greg Weidman and <a href="JohnVenable.html">JohnVenable</a> for a distributed system.  One of its components was an RF monitor.  John designed it, and I implemented a simulated RF spectrum using a fractal algorithm -- good stuff).

        Books I've read (several times each) and recommend:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           UML Distilled [ISBN0201325632] -- one of the <a href="ShortBooks.html">ShortBooks</a>; chapter 3 has illuminated use cases for me better than anything else I've read.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Moor's Last Sigh [ISBN0679420495] -- Salman Rushdie has a way of writing that challenges me, makes me cry and makes me hope at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lord of Light [ASIN0380448343] printed the same year I was born.  Same reactions to a very different text.
        </li>
        <li>
           Testaments Betrayed [ISBN0060927518] -- a companion to GEB; gave me a new way of seeing modern works (painting/music/the novel).  I read Salman's books again after this one.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Tao of Pooh [ISBN0525244581] -- who follows the Tao better?
        </li>
        <li>
           The World of Pooh [ISBN0525444475] -- ... so read the original, too!

        </li>
        <li>
           Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance : An Inquiry into Values [ISBN0688171664] -- actually, VERY western in its inquiry, but reads well along with Raise High the Roof Beam Carpenters and Seymour : An Introduction [ISBN0316769517].  <strong>WARNING!</strong> Do not read these books one after the other, when sad, or when listening to Bach's Cello Suites [ASIN B0000025QM], or having viewed Vincent and Theo (currently not available)
        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
           being digital [ISBN0679762906] -- an out of date book :-) that's a good read anyway.  My laptop is worth a lot more than I thought it was!
        </li>
        <li>
           Summa of the Summa [ISBN0898703174] -- an honest summary of the Summa Theologica (i.e. Peter Kreeft doesn't pollute the Summa with his views or writing style).  Explores fundamental questions:  "Does God exist?" "What makes us happy?"  etc.
