          ) Use of downcasts in order to achieve generic polymorphism in a language which only supports subtype polymorphism.  Java code is full of this; though JDK1.5 (as well as its research predecessors like <a href="PizzaLanguage.html">PizzaLanguage</a>) will mostly fix this problem for Java.  This sort of <a href="PointerCastPolymorphism.html">PointerCastPolymorphism</a> is usually typesafe; however it requires a lot of runtime type checks, and it ain't no fun to write code this way.  (Many C++ programmers do this too with, preferring <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a> rather than templates, on the (questionable) grounds that they will reduce code bloat in this manner.)

          ) Use of void * (or similar constructs) coupled with pointers-to-functions (or tables of pointers-to-functions--an ersatz <a href="VeeTable.html">VeeTable</a>) to achieve ANY sort of polymorphism (both generic and subtype) in a language which has none at all; <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> being an example.  The C library qsort() function is a fine example of this.  How many of us have implemented in C a generic algorithm with a qsort()-style interface, or come up with a pseudo-object framework to give C programmers the equivalent of subtype polymorphism and virtual functions?  Unlike the first case above; this type of <a href="PointerCastPolymorphism.html">PointerCastPolymorphism</a> is usually type-UNSAFE (unless the programmer adds typechecks him/herself), and quite fragile.  Ugh.

        It's worth pointing out that Gnome, one of the two major GUIs for Linux (and other Unices), is chock full of #2.  (It's the only modern GUI I'm aware of that is implemented primarily in a non-OO language.)  The surprising thing is that it usually works quite well...

        GObject, the C-language object system used in Gnome, Gtk and other libraries, implements its own runtime type checking system, so is really of type #1.

        <em>Perhaps; though doing typechecking in a bunch of macros isn't as neat and clean as doing it in the language proper.  Writing code for GObject is truly ugly....--</em><a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a><em></em>

        Bah, <a href="PointerCastPolymorphism.html">PointerCastPolymorphism</a> is one of those things like ExplicitMemoryManagement: easy to do wrong, causes programming overhead, ugly (if one is used to something better), but works just fine when the programmer knows what e's doing and chooses a universal set of rules.  It's easy enough to do e.g. <a href="ComponentObjectModel.html">ComponentObjectModel</a> programming in C; Flux <a href="OsKit.html">OsKit</a> does that quite neatly.

        For more examples of <a href="PointerCastPolymorphism.html">PointerCastPolymorphism</a>, simply look to any of the older <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> programming languages.  Most of them implement polymorphism, and themselves are implemented in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, and so as such are chock full of manual refcounting, manual polymorphism, and various other features.  <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> is a particularly good example of this to look at, since it's system is designed to be easily extended by users for the purpose making custom Python types in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> (a tricky, but not painful, process).
