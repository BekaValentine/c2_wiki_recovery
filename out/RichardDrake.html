        Tom was in London. I hadn't heard from him since, well, shortly after we first made a friendly mess together on his page here. I was struck in 1999 how Tom edited Wiki on first sight of his page, put up by me a few weeks before, as I sat with him in his flat in CoventGarden. By contrast, when I showed <a href="MichaelJackson.html">MichaelJackson</a> his page, also started by me, I'm pretty certain, the Englishman said "Thank you, very interesting" but clearly was never even going to dream of touching it or any other page here. I wonder now if Michael's natural caution was wiser than I thought.

        Still, this difference in reaction remains one of my most enjoyable memories of the profound differences between the two veteran gurus. The gulf was visible on more than one occasion, as <a href="NickSimons.html">NickSimons</a> has also often commented on. It's interesting to us both because of our profound respect for both men, going back to personal contact with them in the 1980s. And Nick has only just learnt that <a href="JenniferStapleton.html">JenniferStapleton</a> used to work for Michael way back at Hoskyns. As Nick said, that puts one of our most famous Gilb-Jackson shoot-outs in a different light again.

        I think the <a href="MistakesOfRogerPenrose.html">MistakesOfRogerPenrose</a> may be even more significant than what he's got right. Interestingly, I find myself supporting so-called <a href="HardCorePlatonists.html">HardCorePlatonists</a> in this area but questioning the influence of Plato on Christian thinking over the centuries. And I never even met the guy. I wonder if Plato would be interested in my <a href="NearDeathExperience.html">NearDeathExperience</a>. Would he have lent a hand in moving it to <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>?
