        I use this pattern phrase when talking with clients about their investment in the future with the products they are developing. "Making a play" for a larger market or greater customer satisfaction will eventually "play out" for them in the long term. It is a rare thing when one of them buys it. Oh, well. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        Oh, by the way -- after REO Speedwagon did their album by this page's name the phrase became something of a cultural phenomenon amongst young people. Now all those young people are <a href="OldFart.html">OldFart</a>s, and some of us are still using this idiom, along with some others:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Roll With The Changes" <em>and</em> "Keep On Rollin'"
        </li>
        <li>
           "Ridin' The Storm Out"
        </li>
        <li>
           "Keep Pushin' On"
        </li>
      </ul>
