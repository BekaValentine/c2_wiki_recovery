        No. It doesn't have a website. Because that would involve more paperwork.

        Yes. It was named after the programming language.

           (in XP:) code that fails one or more <a href="ProgrammerTest.html">ProgrammerTest</a>s, typically causing a red bar to be displayed.

      <p>
        <a href="RedCode.html">RedCode</a> is not the same as <em>broken code</em>, <em>buggy code</em>, or <em>incorrect code</em>, since the problem could be in one or more tests, or there could be a new test that the code hasn't been modified to pass yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RedCode.html">RedCode</a> is a succinct description of a state of affairs (the tests don't all pass) without implying anything about where the problem, if any, actually lies.
