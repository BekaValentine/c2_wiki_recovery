        Begin Monologue
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Much space and time is consumed when two or more individuals involve themselves in point-making that leads to no conclusions, instead leads to conflicts and misunderstandings regarding a topic, method, or structure.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> to avoid involvement in such endless debates, usually typified by creating a very long page, and when it becomes lengthy, to continue the thread by creating part1, part2, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Seldom</strong>, no, <strong>never</strong> gnome such pages, for they are not meant to be improved upon, and you may encounter opposition and be drawn into the inconclusive work.
          <ul>
            <li>
               You may find if you do, that one or more of those who have been interested or involved it the work will attempt to drag you into another such conversation. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           They usually cannot be fixed simply or improved upon somewhat by editing, the strategy seeming to be to make points and counter-points via another paragraph, ask another question, oppose via responses not gendering understanding or resolution.  
        </li>
        <li>
           The way you may identify such pages: 
          <ul>
            <li>
               they will have multiple and continuing appearances on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> for days, weeks and months at a time. 
            </li>
            <li>
               they are also hard to follow and to not resolve to points being resolved.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           so avoid reading, commenting within, or about such pages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        End Monologue
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid this becoming anything other than a monologue, simply delete this page if you disagree and it will all be over, I will not restore it.
      </p>

        Long heated debates are often a symptom of miscommunication or different fundamental understandings of something, not a cause. The real goal should be to get to the bottom of such differences in views rather than sweep them under the rug like a communist nation that wants to hide conflict in order to look orderly and pretty.
