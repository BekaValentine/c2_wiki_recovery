        Cam Spillman is from St. Louis Missouri USA and is an old-school "waterfall" practitioner becoming evangelized as his projects continue to respond positively from lightweight and iterative "new" approaches.  Cam needs pessimists to counterbalance his unrealistic optimism (hell, it's 3/4 full!).  Moderate doses of <a href="FrankZappa.html">FrankZappa</a> keep him in check.  Hand percussion keeps him on time.
