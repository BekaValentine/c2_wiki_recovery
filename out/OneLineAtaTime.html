        One Line Ata Time
      </h1>
      <p>
        When writing complicated code, or using an unfamiliar programming language or API, I will often write and test one line of code at a time.  In other words, I do this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Write the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and enough scaffolding to verify that the test fails.
        </li>
        <li>
           Write one line of code.
        </li>
        <li>
           Compile and run the test.
        </li>
        <li>
           Verify that the test has failed <em>exactly as expected</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Return to step 2
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        When developing code this way, I always know exactly which line is leading to unexpected behavior, and I can fix it before writing more code that will obscure the problem.  I tend to do a lot of internal refactoring as I add each line, so the final result is often better than what I do when I just whip out an entire function in one swoop, test it, and then move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also tend to learn a lot about the system and API this way.  I find undocumented return codes and exceptions.  I discover interesting undocumented behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to have some means to examine the details of the error; a simple Pass/Fail indication is not enough at this level of granularity.  This technique is especially valuable when using an environment such as Smalltalk, Java, or <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> that can provide detailed exception information and a stack walk upon failure.  It can also be useful to step through the lines with a debugger.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar technique works when debugging code: comment out the entire body of the function, and then restore lines one at a time until something unexpected occurs.  (Sometimes a <a href="BinaryChop.html">BinaryChop</a> is more effective than full chop.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, this technique can be time-consuming, especially if the unit tests are not automated or take a large amount of time.  I don't do it all the time, but whenever I do it, I never feel that I've wasted any time.
