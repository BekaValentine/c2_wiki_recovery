        Volunteer Wiki Moderators
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is there anybody who would like to volunteer moderating heated discussions when they occur? Suggested traits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Patient
        </li>
        <li>
           Diplomatic/polite
        </li>
        <li>
           Has no heavy interest in the topic at hand. In other words, it's not your <a href="HobbyHorse.html">HobbyHorse</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Restate points made from a different angle or phrasing, and ask for confirmation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ask questions to clarify information rather than dictate answers. See <a href="SocraticMethod.html">SocraticMethod</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Keep both sides from meandering off topic or guide changing content to appropriate topics.
        </li>
        <li>
           Help narrow general accusations by asking for links or evidence of claims made.
        </li>
        <li>
           A written code of conduct, referenced or created, and agreed on by a consensus of <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> would helpful, but not necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A thankless position, which is known to get oneself beat-up in the dangerous middle position (get hit from both sides).
      </p>

        <em>Perhaps, but that task may be suited for some, such as a teacher or counselor in training. The trick is to focus on asking questions that clarify rather than make original statements. If you wish to make an original statement about the topic, then put on a non-moderator hat and make it under a non-moderator handle.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>Who is asking?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to request one for <a href="ObjectiveEvidenceAgainstGotosDiscussion.html">ObjectiveEvidenceAgainstGotosDiscussion</a>, and any topic that grows heated. --top
