        Of course I'm the one who clicked the button!
        I wasn't the first.
        I won't be the last.
        That's why I added <a href="AddYourName.html">AddYourName</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AddingNewPages.html">AddingNewPages</a> is flawed, because it allows you to click the question mark. And invariably some people will. Even if you ask them not to, they get so involved in the process that they miss the request.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="AddYourName.html">AddYourName</a> it is impossible to click the question mark, because there is no question mark to click!
      </p>

        An attempt to create a new Wiki convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        For brief comments that I wish to sign, my full name seems to large. So I use my initials. Unfortunately, TlO does not "Wikiize". Instead, I use TlOi (i for initial), which is an abbreviation for <a href="ThaddeusOlczyk.html">ThaddeusOlczyk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Typically, when people don't wish to use their full name to sign a contribution, they simply use their initials, whether they form a </em><a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> or not (c.f. recent contributions by <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>, <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a> and others). Ordinarily, your full name will already have appeared on the page somewhere. Also, given Ward's preference that people use their real names, I wonder whether you would reconsider this decision?<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'd have to hear from Ward on that one. I presume his reasoning for wanting real names is to avoid contributions from some of the anonymous types out there who are from left field. Like, say, bikermomma or numberonehacker. Real names might keep the noise level down. Many people often use initials as a substitute for their names. Hell, it's even legal at times. When you make changes to a contract, you initial and date it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole point is this: not to use your initials to sign something, but that when you do sign something with just initials, use a Wiki-ized form so that people can go and see your full name. ("That comment was by TlOi, who is TlOi? Click. Oh yeah, that's <a href="ThaddeusOlczyk.html">ThaddeusOlczyk</a>".) -- TlOi ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh for goodness sake, just sign as Thaddeus if that's quicker than the whole name. Or if Thaddeus usually gets shortened to a recognizable form, use that shortened form. If the full name appears higher up on the page or is well known, that's good enough for me.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>On a more personal note, I think we've got far too many new conventions being suggested at the moment. -- </em><a href="RogerLipscombe.html">RogerLipscombe</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, the use of initials (whether wiki-ized or not), makes refactoring a page harder. If the part with the full <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> gets refactored out, then the initials make no sense. And some people are using initials on pages where their <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> never appeared. It makes it hard to remember who's who sometimes. -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is true if the initials are not Wiki-ized. If they are, it doesn't matter if the full name is no longer there; people who want to know who it is can just go to the "initials web page" and find out (assuming some malicious person hasn't modified it). So with Wiki-ized initials, you don't have to work to make sure the initials are still there. -- <a href="ThaddeusOlczyk.html">ThaddeusOlczyk</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, right. Ok. I have to use my fallback arguments, then: Wikized initials are ugly, hard to read, and would produce a whole of pages that said "These are the initials of ThatGuy". -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, we shouldn't have to click on every link on a page to see what the page is saying. Links should be self-explanatory. Obscure initials are a barrier to comprehension, in my view. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think they are ugly and hard to read, but so small that it isn't much of a problem (looking at mine you pick out the T & O rather quickly, so many common ones would be easily read). The amount of pages - I can't speak to that. Certainly it doubles the number of pages for users (if all do it), but how much does that affect the software? If there is a large minimal record size in the db then each page has a big hit, and lightweight pages may be not worth what they cost. Also, the number of indices increases. In the end, I think the major factor is the percentage of web pages which are names is the most significant factor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do have a reason for wanting people to pick up on this. Sometimes a brief comment is not signed, and for one reason or another I wish it were. Two examples: refactoring, and I would like to know if two comments are by the same person. Sometimes I hesitate to sign my full name to a one-line comment, and I think others do to. They might be more willing to sign if they only used their initials.

        I don't see the benefit of this proposed convention. From an author's perspective: surely we all type our names so many times that it's an automatic response requiring next to no time or thought to perform. From the reader's perspective: speaking for myself, names flow easily on the page. Atypical abbreviations like TlOi distract from the content.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        On my screen, I don't pick out the T and O easily. The O looks a bit like a zero and the L a bit like a one, and my instinct is to try to pronounce it.
      </p>
      <p>
        More generally, being a link makes it seem more significant than it is. I tend to follow the link to see what it is about. At least non-link initials are easier to ignore.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect that unsigned paragraphs happen because someone inserted a comment into the middle of two signed paragraphs. When you do that, copy the signature from the second paragraph to the first so it is signed too. Then the signatures serve to break up the text and indicate the change of voice. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Using full names seems simple and unambiguous. I've often seen a "KB" signature and assumed it meant <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>, some months later realizing that it's <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>. -- ad
      </p>
      <p>
        Huh? You read something <em>I</em> wrote and you thought that <em>Kent</em> wrote it? I'm astonished. Either I'm doing better that I thought, or Kent needs help. Anyway, it might have been <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>. Or <a href="KathyBracy.html">KathyBracy</a>. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
