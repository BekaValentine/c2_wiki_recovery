        Rational Rose Refactoring
      </h1>
      <p>
        Having some interest in evaluating the tool, I was trying to refactor the page <a href="RationalRose.html">RationalRose</a>, but I couldn't really see the whole thing at once.  So I started by just labelling each contribution with a quick bold caption stating its relationship to the main topic.  Hopefully now someone else (maybe a future me) can come along and gather up some of the thoughts more easily.  Please comment here about whether this was useful.  -- <a href="DavidSaff.html">DavidSaff</a>

        Nicely done!

        <em> It helps. (But Rose still doesn't come out smelling like a Rose, does it!)</em>

        (Refactoring a wiki page will never change the contents of a software package -  so why should it?)

        I think it is useful. I am going to add my experience, both good and bad.

        <em>Hmmm, kindof reminds me to those obligated courses at the University. I'd prefer no CASE tool whatsoever. Just plain paper and some sharpened pencils</em>
