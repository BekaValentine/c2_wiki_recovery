        Null Object And Refactoring
      </h1>
      <p>
        When refactoring a design that uses the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern, one must beware of refactorings that change the system to use <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> classes to represent domain concepts, rather than being implementation details.  This goes against the intent of the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern and will cause headaches at later date.  
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Here's an example from my own experience with the <a href="SceneBeans.html">SceneBeans</a> framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="SceneBeans.html">SceneBeans</a> framework provides a <a href="SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph</a> data structure that defines a graphical scene as a directed graph of polymorphic scene-graph "nodes" that are processed using the <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a>.  We used the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern to mark the edges of the <a href="SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph</a>, and combined the <a href="NullObjectAndVisitor.html">NullObjectAndVisitor</a> patterns so that the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> nodes did not <a href="DoubleDispatch.html">DoubleDispatch</a> to the visitor -- as far as the visitors knew, the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> nodes did not even exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the scene graph classes was a "switch" node that would contain multiple subgraphs but only draw one at a time.   We later needed to selectively show or hide parts of the scene.  We realised that we could do this by putting a subgraph <em>and</em> a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> node into to a switch node -- switching between the subgraph and the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> would have the effect of showing or hiding the subgraph.  This only required changing our file format so that files could explicitly create null objects in the graph.  Cunning!  
      </p>
      <p>
        Or so we thought... We noticed a problem when we wrote a visitor to write a scene graph into a file in our format.  The visitor never wrote the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><strong>'s because they did not double dispatch to it.  </strong>
        This was fine for <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><strong>'s at the edge of the graph, </strong>
        but was the wrong behaviour for <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><strong>'s that had been explicitly included in "switch" nodes.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem was that our refactoring had changed the way that <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><strong>'s were used from an internal implementation detail of how the framework marked the edges of the scene graph to explicitly representing concept of "draw nothing" in a user-visible way.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Solutions...
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Add a visitNull method to the visitor interface, and provide a do-nothing default implementation in the abstract base class from which all visitors are derived. (We chose this one)
        </li>
        <li>
           Use different classes for Null Object<strong>'s that mark the edge of the graph from those used to represent "draw nothing". (The most elegant approach, but adds classes to the system)</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Explicitly check for <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><strong>'s in the save-to-file visitor. (A quick-and-dirty fix that we ruled out for obvious reasons)</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>

        <em>Is solution #2 unacceptable because of </em><a href="FearOfAddingClasses.html">FearOfAddingClasses</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution #2 is <em>not</em> unacceptable at all.  I would say that it's the ideal solution in most cases.  However, we <a href="SceneBeans.html">SceneBeans</a> is a client-side library to be downloaded across the net, and so we are trying to keep download times to an absolute minimum. -- <a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>

        Can anyone explain the conceptual difference between serialization of "edges" and serialization of "show nothing" objects in this example?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The difference is that a </em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> representing the "edge" of a graph is implicitly created by the data structure itself as part of it's internal housekeeping (in constructors, or when removing a child node from it's parent), and is therefore an implementation detail that is invisible to the user.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A "show nothing" object is explicitly created by the user when they want to be able to toggle the visibility of a sub-graph by switching between the sub-graph and the "show-nothing" object.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And doesn't <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> always represent some domain concept, which usually is not clearly exposed because of its "non-object" nature? --<a href="NikitaBelenki.html">NikitaBelenki</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It represents the edge of a data structure, but in a way that is invisible to client code.  It is therefore an internal implementation detail of the data structure, and so not a domain concept.</em>
