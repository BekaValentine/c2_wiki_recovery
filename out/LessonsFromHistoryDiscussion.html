        <strong>What Did and Didn't Goto's Teach Us?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The lessons from Goto's seem to be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Visual cues (to program flow) seem to be favored
        </li>
        <li>
           Cross-developer consistency/uniformity seems to be favored
        </li>
        <li>
           Some will resist changes that later prove to be popular
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unanswered questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can consistency/uniformity be measured?  
          <ul>
            <li>
               Yes, to an approximation.  See <a href="KolmogorovComplexity.html">KolmogorovComplexity</a>.  However, it cannot be measured absolutely (absolute <a href="KolmogorovComplexity.html">KolmogorovComplexity</a> is undecidable).
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Too the best of my knowledge, nobody has used them on Goto evidence.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Question: how much does <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> contradict consistency/uniformity?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Were experienced goto-ers as productive as "blockies" due to years of practice with goto's and would it make sense to force them to change immediately? (<a href="MindOverhaulEconomics.html">MindOverhaulEconomics</a>)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Related: Were their maintainers as productive as maintainers for the "blockies"?  (<a href="SoftwareLifeCycle.html">SoftwareLifeCycle</a>, <a href="WriteOnlyLanguage.html">WriteOnlyLanguage</a>, <a href="PainfulLanguage.html">PainfulLanguage</a> - if there is more than one way to do it, maintainers have to learn all of them).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Were there "goto patterns" or thinking techniques that skilled goto-ers used to be more effective? (Lost-art hypothesis)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Definitely yes.  Loop constructs, for example, are well established among the goto patterns, and I learned quite a few patterns when I was teaching Assembly to classes of students.  But see also <a href="AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures.html">AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Which newer ideas are analogous to the goto lessons and which are just fads or domain niches? (<a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> fodder, as below shows)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Hypothesis: any component that meets <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a> in the sense that if your language doesn't have it, lots of people are going to badly reinvent it.  
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Under that hypothesis, modern language design would most benefit from: (1) easy concurrency and atomic operations (e.g. first-class processes and <a href="SoftwareTransactionalMemory.html">SoftwareTransactionalMemory</a> - ideally composable atomic ops), (2) easy communication and serialization (for communication, distribution, and persistence), (3) data and knowledge management support (e.g. relational and knowledge systems built into the language), (4) proper security management, (5) garbage collection.  All these I've seen badly reinvented again and again and again.  We fight with languages to make these happen, and we stumble over, around, and into tons of pitfalls while doing so: deadlock, livelock, stomping on shared memory, weak parsers for variant-typed data (often regexps at best), micro-databases in code that only ever fulfill half the functionality you desire of them, memory management for shared data, and signaling systems that, lacking proper message queues and semaphores, end up being infinitely recursive.  And 'security' is done wrong every time, but more often people (even for military applications) give up on it and simply cross their fingers.

           <em>Why do you get to shove a summary of your side of the story at the top like this? It is rude.</em>

           <em>[I believe "deliberately wrong" was this section's original author's self-deprecatory comment about his own summary.  It does not appear to have been targeted at any participants in the debate.]</em>
          <ul>

               Correct. The subject of the first sentence was "This summary".  The "it" referenced the subject, not the most recent noun.

           Closures are a tool.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Some people can't see the point of closures, and argue that they're basically useless.  There appears to be no evidence offered for this.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>This is a strawman because I never claimed to have such evidence. But the flip side is that there's </em>'no evidence<strong> that they'll improve code more than about 5% either (except in rare circumstances). The evidence just plain does not exist. </strong>Don't add crap to languages until its PROVEN to carry its weight<em>'. That is fair and practical and rational.</em>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       So you say that closures amount to, or are akin to, <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>, and now say that you have no evidence for this?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <em>Let me get this strait: you want me to objectively prove subjectivity?</em>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>{I suggest we shouldn't add </em>'crap<em>' to languages in any case, but I'd note that you need to add them to languages BEFORE they can ever be PROVEN to carry their weight - a feature not part of a language will, quite frankly, never be tested.  As to whether closures should be added, it depends on whether the language possesses any equivalent set of features.  As to your 'improve', '5%' and 'rare circumstances', I'm quite certain you've invented the statistic and that you're no expert on what mean the other two.  Closures have certainly proven useful to those programmers for the languages that have adopted them, but even I, as a language designer, can't give you rankings for how much or how little it has 'improved' the programmer experience over the various alternatives (e.g. dynamic strings).}</em>

            </li>
            <li>
               Others might argue that until they become wide-spread and well-understood, people won't know how to use them and their benefits won't be realised. The point is argued from the analogy of GOTOs versus block-structured programming.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>People associate what they hate to goto's. It doesn't tell us anything. They are like Hitler to political discussions (</em><a href="GodwinsLaw.html">GodwinsLaw</a>) as in "your political beliefs are just like Hilter's". Compare: "Your favorite language feature is just like Goto's."<em></em>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       <em>[You've missed the point.  As the one who introduced GOTOs into this discussion, I can assure you I don't hate them.  GOTOs were merely offered as an example of a construct whose replacement with structured programming was once  regarded as "borderline </em><a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>".  Now, for the vast majority of applications, we regard structured programming as foundational.  Likewise, closures may today be considered "borderline <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>", but in a future programming world might be considered indispensable.  Learn them now; you might need them later.]<em></em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       You claim to be able to predict which features will be considered indispensable in the future and which will be forgotten? I would like to predict that relational and/or closer ties to set-theory will be expanded into app languages, but realize now that hype controls the market more than good ideas (at least in the short term). Predicting the future based on past patterns is what this topic is about. That'd be more interesting than the never-ending FP debate.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <em>[I claim no predictive ability beyond the norm.  I do, however, constantly learn new paradigms, features, approaches, models, and standards -- and endeavour to recognise and leverage their intended value -- </em>'because<strong> I can't predict whether they'll be significant or not, but they </strong>might<em>' become significant.  In the case of some features, I might even financially benefit by gaining a competitive advantage by using them before they become popular.  This topic is not about predicting the future; in a nutshell it's about (a) not foolishly deprecating features now that </em>might<em> have future significance, given that we've seen marginal features of the past (GOTOs and high-level languages) become foundational; and (b) the ineffectiveness of chucking stones at things you don't understand merely because you don't understand them.</em>]

                    <li>
                       Why aren't you as interested as honing your skills in presenting objective and clear evidence as you are in playing with language features? If there was a feature that I really liked and felt its reasons for superiority were objective, I'd try to find ways to present the evidence that would be hard to dispute instead of call people names. Although I don't claim my favorite techniques are objectivity better, I do try to describe why I like them. (See <a href="PayrollExample.html">PayrollExample</a> for an example).
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <em>[Why am I not as interested in honing my skills in presenting objective and clear evidence as playing with language features?  Because in these discussions, the former is tedious, time-consuming, is demanded by you and you alone[1], and gains me nothing; the latter is fun and might give me a competitive advantage that makes me money.  For the majority of serious, forward-thinking developers, the mere presence of a new feature is sufficient justification to devote time to exploring it without requiring a set of qualifying metrics and real-world statistics.  Individual developers can decide whether a feature is of value or not based on their own and their users' criteria.  It's only for you, it seems, that a scientific study must be done on a feature before you'll consider anything but deprecating it.</em>]

                       <em>[1] [And, your past behaviour does nothing to convince me you'd even take the time to read the evidence presented, let alone understand it.

                       Those are just excuses. You don't even try to figure out why you like X and turn it into a clear, non-psychology-dependent description. As far as making money, since when did employers give a flying fsck about closures etc? It just makes hiring replacements more expensive for them. You live in a fantasy land in which your <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> pays off; until you wake up. And you are wrong about me being the lone proof-wanter. The issue keeps popping up: <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/893">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/893</a> Just admit that your preferences are a <a href="PersonalChoiceElevatedToMoralImperative.html">PersonalChoiceElevatedToMoralImperative</a>.

                       <em>[So...  At the top of this threadlet you object to someone catching you out on your failure to provide evidence for your position that closures are "borderline </em><a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>," but down here you request equivalent evidence of me?  And in the same paragraph that you ask me to justify my preference for <x> via a "non-psychology-dependent" description, you claim "[i]ts the psychology, stupid!" and apparently find that sufficient to justify <em>your</em> preferences?  Why, that sounds fair and entirely un-hypocritical!  By the way, when I was an employer I gave a "flying fsck" about closures and any other feature, paradigm, language or approach that might give my company an edge over competitors, and hiring a few highly-productive developers who embrace new paradigms and approaches is actually less costly than hiring more developers -- even if they're cheaper -- who use only traditional approaches.  That's why we developed a custom DBMS and associated declarative language, plus C-based libraries, for developing business applications when most of our competitors were still using DbaseIII.  It's why we later re-developed the DBMS in C++ and embraced OO when our competitors were still paddling about in Clipper and <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>.  In the niche in which we worked, we ate our competition.  It enabled me to essentially retire while still in my 30s and enter academia, where I can now devote full time to that which interests me most -- exploring and leveraging new paradigms and tools to competitive effect for developing business applications, and encouraging new programmers to do the same.  With luck and perseverance, I expect some of them will use the same approach to eat <em>their</em> competition.]<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>GOTOs and assembly language are good enough for me. Are they good enough for you?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Assembly is more lines/volume of code per algorithm, and <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>'s are more inconsistent across programmers and lack the visual flow cues of indentation. Anyhow, rather than get into yet another general paradigm <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>, how about we focus on the above example. How would closures clearly make it better?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My point was broader, and perhaps more subtle, than to suggest we should stick to GOTOs and assembly.  Back in the day, </em><a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>s and structured programming were the subject of considerable debate.  From a historical perspective, we can see that the higher-level abstractions gained preference for what we now consider obvious reasons, and (at least) structured programming and high level languages now seem reasonable choices for most purposes.  At the time, however, the <strong>need</strong> for higher level abstractions was much less clear than it is now --  the goals of most programming were much simpler, and a GOTO or two for the average working programmer seemed as reasonable as the structured equivalent.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's hogwash. I've seen many production COBOL programs, and many were far from simple. In fact, it appears the authors "mastered" GOTO's in ways that we would have a hard time relating to. Perhaps there are even "goto patterns" that escaped documentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>You are conflating "complex" with "large".  Large CRUD-fests, which many COBOL programs are, may be lengthy but are generally not complex per se.  How many historical COBOL programs need to, for example, simultaneously deal with multiple threads, complex data structures, interactive event-driven GUIs and interprocess communication?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are being naive. Business rules ARE often complex. The need for multiple threads is often exaggerated anyhow for biz apps. And, the "complex data structures" are generally kept in RDBMS, not RAM pointer behemoths like one does in school.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Business rules are frequently </em>intricate<em>, they are rarely complex.  Decomposed to their essentials, they tend to involve an intricate, but straight-forward collection of conditional operations.  This is especially true of the legacy COBOL applications to which this section applies.  You introduced both COBOL and business applications as non sequiturs, or an attempt to narrow the debate to your home turf; my mention of threads, complex data structures, event-driven GUIs, etc., was an attempt to bring the discussion back into a general domain.  Legacy COBOL applications generally predate RDBMSes, which were not commercially available until 1978 -- by which time the structured programming and high-level language vs. assembly language debates had largely faded away.  Legacy COBOL applications were more likely to use custom file-based storage mechanisms, or ISAM (and later VSAM) access methods via facilities provided by the operating system.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you want to demonstrate that closures are a significant help to everything but biz apps, be my guest. As far as "intricate versus complex", I would welcome a more detailed comparison. I also agree that pre-RDBMS apps were often messy at dealing with "complex data structures". But, I don't see how that reinforces your points.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>As such, the choice between GOTOs and structured programming -- or between assembly language and high level languages -- was often more a matter of personal preference (or psychology, as you put it) than rationally-based decision.  That may seem surprising or illogical now, but keep in mind the context of the time.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           For one, it is possible to describe to some extent why we don't like goto's: lack of cross-developer consistency (but that has escaped objective measure) and lack of visual flow cues (use of multiple levels of indentation). Further, there's no evidence that experienced Goto programmers were significantly less productive than blockers. A "mess" to you and me may not be a mess to them. But, we have no real data on that, because most Goto'ers are retired or dead. You may be a premature anti-goto bigot. <strong>If a goto expert is as productive as a block expert, why the hell should anybody tell them they're "doing it wrong"?</strong> (Let's assume that like-minded people will maintain each other's code.)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm not. It'd be nice if everyone could use the tools of their choice. It's just not practical, so we must force somewhat arbitrary standards on developers to obtain consistency in order to share work.

           Odd, OOP's navigational nature is a 60's concept that was replaced by what I consider a higher abstraction: relational. I consider navigational the "goto" of data structures. The pointer-centric OOP is simply navigational with behavioral wrappers. Hard-wiring in relationships and grouping instead of calculating them as needed is hardly "more abstract". You simply call your pet tools "high abstraction" and what you hate "low abstraction".

They are merely tools; I have no emotional connection to any of the tools in my toolbox.  ("I love my screwdrivers but hate those $%&!!! hammers!"  Now replace "hammer" and "screwdriver" with any programmatic approach or construct you like.  Ludicrous, no?)  I base my measure of higher-level abstraction vs. lower-level abstraction purely on the degree to which the construct directly resembles or mirrors the concrete machine.  The more it's like the underlying iron, the more it is a low-level abstraction.  The less it resembles the iron, the more high-level a construct is, especially if it is built from lower-level constructs.</em>

And most people who do a lot of work in their heads DO get emotionally attached to their both their ideas and the mechanism they utilized to achieve them (to maintain your own health: don't dis logic in front of a scientist, and don't dis faith in front of a zealot).

            <li>
               <em>Perhaps that is true.  Hobbyists, especially, do become attached to their tools.  Professionals, in my experience, not so much.  I worked in a garage some years ago and continue to deal with professional mechanics on a regular basis.  I've never seen good mechanics treat tools as anything but a means to make money.  Good mechanics are strictly out to get repair jobs done as quickly as possible with the least likelihood of returns, not make love to their tools.  Cheap, crappy tools are universally decried, and clever home-made tools are afforded a certain pride, but I've never seen anything remotely like the irrational favoritism or hatred some programmers demonstrate toward certain paradigms, approaches, and languages.  While I have seen particularly effective mechanics' tools treated with high regard, when the Snap-On(tm) guy shows up to sell a newer and better wrench, if it does a better job, it gets bought and the old tool gets sold or tossed out.  Of course, that doesn't preclude arguments over which tool or approach is best for a particular job.  For example, should you press out E34 BMW sub-frame bushings with the factory tool, or should you cut them out with a Sawzall?  The debate is ongoing, but I've rarely, if ever, seen such debates reach the incandescence that choice of programming tools and approaches seems to engender.  However, I shouldn't make out mechanics to be perfect, because they're not.  There are issues that sometimes draw similar irrationality.  For example, ask a group of BMW specialists what are the best after-market brake pads to use, or what engine oil to choose, or which tires to buy, and you'll probably see opinion and bluster just like you see here about programming issues.  Of course, that's probably because there are no clear-cut answers as to which is "best."  However, among professionals I've never seen such debates reach the duration, heat, and emotional intemperance that often appear here.  Perhaps it's because many programmers lack the level of maturity to recognise when a preference is merely that -- a preference.  Or, perhaps it's because programming is as much art as it is logic.  Or, perhaps it's because programmers are more likely to be overly-sensitive, opinionated, drama-queen artistes than the typical pro auto or motorcycle mechanic.  I know not.  However, I do know that the best programmers I've worked with have the same attitude toward programming tools that the good mechanics have toward theirs -- they choose what they feel is the most appropriate tool (i.e., paradigm, approach, language or platform) on a case-by-case basis, and the best programmers know and can effectively use a wide variety of paradigms, approaches, platforms and languages.  Categorical deprecation of any usable paradigm, approach, platform or language is a mark of a poor programmer, or at least one with an unpleasantly amateur attitude.  That doesn't mean debate over technical choices doesn't occur, because it obviously does, but it rarely if ever reaches the irrational, unsupported, emotional fervor that I've sometimes seen here, and it's far more likely to revolve around a checklist matrix of objective strengths/weaknesses/risks/costs vs. requirements than arbitrary opinions.</em>

For mechanics, the product - their 'baby' - is the construct, not the mechanism by which they constructed it.  For (many) programmers, however, the product - their 'baby' - IS the programmatic mechanism (and pattern) by which it operates.  When someone else comes along and says it's a bad mechanism for reasons X, Y, Z, these programmers get defensive - you've attacked their baby.

                   <em>That makes sense.  I certainly agree that mechanics are no less susceptible to emotion, but my experience is that professional mechanics are far more likely to become emotional over the same hobby or non-professional interests that anyone has -- sports, politics, religion, gardening, woodworking, cooking or whatever -- than the technical aspects of their jobs.  Where mutual recognition of equal ability exists, the pros seem more likely to respect different approaches or professional opinions -- or at least demonstrate a certain cynical detachment to these -- than certain programmers, many of whom can't seem to resist tearing a strip off the other guy for merely having a different preference.  Witness, for example, the heat often generated by Linux vs Windows debates.  With a few exceptions, these seem to be mainly the provenance of amateurs or poor pros.  I've never met a genuinely good programmer who was zealous about one or the other in a professional capacity; most simply use what pays the bills at the time even if they personally prefer one over the other.  It's certainly not worth arguing about.  Discussing, maybe; arguing, no.  Indeed, the best programmers I know are usually eager to explore new paradigms, approaches, or platforms, and regard them as an interesting opportunity for discovery, or at least a chance to play with a new toy that might turn out to be a useful tool.  Likewise, I've never seen pro mechanics get as heated up over (say) Ford vs Chevrolet; plenty of jovial ribbing may go on, but there's little to no emotional investment, and indeed they're likely to claim both are crap despite what they may buy or even prefer for their own use.</em>

Improved platform popularity means improved platform support.  This is a major cause for arguments regarding game consoles, too - a popular console gets more games, which is a win for the owners of said console.

The "final actor" is the hardware, not software. It's as if a robot tells another robot to tell yet another robot to pull the trigger. Data may be further up the chain, but that is merely a matter of degree.

        <em>At present, typical programming tasks do not yet </em>'need<strong> any higher level abstraction than procedural programming.

           I didn't start this. It was started when somebody said the procedural example was "brain-dead", implying that closures would cure it.

           <em>In that case, a far more effective debating technique would be to produce a modern procedural example of that clearly demonstrates its brain-liveliness, and pair it with an up-to-date, unbiased closure example.  Add to this a rational, critical evaluation of both against a variety of reasonable, real-world criteria, and you might have something worthy of consideration.  Your response to the claim that the procedural example was "brain-dead" was merely to emit the following gem:  "Closures are one of those things that look cool on paper, but are difficult to translate into significant practical benefits. They're borderline </em><a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> in my opinion."  That was better...  How???<em></em>

           I could not do that because I don't believe that closures are inherently broken or bad. They just are not a significant improver of the type of apps I encounter. Why should I go through all that work to demonstrate <strong>slight</strong> differences, if thats even possible? My main complaint is that people want to gum up languages with yawner features. If you claim they are better than yawner status, then show them kicking ass.

           As far as the "couldn't test", such languages already exist and are thus testable. I'm not against experimental languages; I'm against unproven fads being forced on us. I couldn't show procedural being objectively better because I believe software design is mostly about psychology; not math, science, nor technology. People like what fits their head the best. I don't dispute that your favorite features may fit your head better. Just don't extrapolate that beyond your skull without solid external demonstrations. If you have objective evidence of X being significantly better, please show it. Anecdotes don't cut it around here. As far as calling me names, go [bleep] yourself you evidence-free goon.

        I submit that some things need to be widely tried by non-experts and by people other than those who really understand it, to find its strengths and weaknesses, to find where it's useful and where it isn't, and to work out how to make the good bits work better, and the bad bits either irrelevant, improved, or missing.

        <em>So we throw crap out there and hype it as if its a given, then see what sticks? Generally there's a ratio of roughly about 10 dropped ideas for every 1 that sticks. That means we are wasting 9/10ths of our time on lame fads. That does not seem rational. Nor does it address the psychology issue: some like OO because it fits their head and some don't. Is this the right-handed argument: lefties should suffer because they are the minority? (And OO given more lip service than code service anyhow. People like it in pre-packaged libraries, but their custom app code is still mostly procedural.)

        <strong>Let's Go To Goto's Again</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the spirit of this debate has gotten lost. Let me restate it:
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost nobody supports going back to the pre-nested block era. Although some support limited forms of goto's, most agree that using mostly nested blocks "improves" software. However, even something this simple and with a universal consensus has no non-psychology-tied evidence to support it. If we cannot provide objective evidence for simple things, then there's almost no hope of providing it for complex  claims. What is the reason for this? 
      </p>
      <p>
        My standing theory for this is that software engineering is mostly about human and personal psychology. It's possible an alien species may dig goto's. So far, other than "we're all too new at such proof techniques", nobody has offered a compelling alternative to this Goto-Paradox. --top
