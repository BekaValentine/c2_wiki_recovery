        To Do Folder
      </h1>
      <p>
        A space set aside where you make a sequential ordered list of the things you have ToDo. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Helpful in setting priorities and preserving your focus on the ThingsWhichMatterMost. You probably need two such folders, one which is at and in your WorkingSpace, and accessible only there (LeaveYourWorkAtWork) and one on your HomeDeskTopComputer (Or Non-Workplace Laptop). It should include both LongTermThingsToDo and the more immediate concerns as TodayTodo TomorrowTodo ThisWeekTodo ....etc. or to simplify to a couple of ThingsAtTheTopOfMyTodo ThingsICanDoLater.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be effective, this must be an active folder, and the things in it reviewed on a regular schedule. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Included might be specific TodoItems, Such as MyVacationPlans, Events20040704, etc.

        <em>One problem is that I often think of stuff </em><a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a> at home while I'm at work. So, I'd want both folders accessible.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        - Eh, then you make them accessible. The point is mostly to separate them, how far you take that is largely up to you, I suppose.

        I fail to see what on this page differs from just saying "<a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a> lists are useful, so you should keep them on your computer and use them regularly."
      </p>
      <p>
        I.e. this page does not seem to serve any purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think Donald's trying to explain a good way to organize the lists.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it falls short.

        I think this subject is much covered elsewhere, and probably belongs elsewhere? See (for one example)
