        <strong>Development Process Model:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Prototype: Build a prototype that proves the concept and embodies all or part of the understood problem solution but no more than that. Observe: <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ReverseEngineer.html">ReverseEngineer</a>: Create and modify requirements and design from the prototype and user feedback.  This creates the documentation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Refactor: Adjust implementation for clarity and simplicity of design.
        </li>
        <li>
           Test: <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and <a href="IntegrationTest.html">IntegrationTest</a> until the <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>s are happy.
        </li>
        <li>
           Validate: BlackBoxTest in the user environment until requirements are covered.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In large scale projects, the <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a> principle is applied before attempting to prototype, if possible.  The objective is to produce a comfortable chunk that is practical to prototype.  The process is recursive until this comfort objective is felt for each subcomponent.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In VeryLargeScale systems, the need to prototype a <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> may be present. Complexity of inter-relationships of components may present a significant case.  Here, a <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> realized by a collection of TestStubs that simulate portions of the ExternalBehavior as presented to the interface (such as message timings) may be desirable.  For example, a function that draws a complex shape or queries a complex database may return a message when completed.  The granular level is only interested in the completion message.  Putting in a test stub with a simple pseudo-random number generator to produce reasonable reply timing may be sufficient to test functionality of the <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> as realized in code.
