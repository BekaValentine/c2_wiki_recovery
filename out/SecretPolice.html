        Secret Police
      </h1>
      <p>
        The U.S. office of homeland security. Immune to the whistleblower protections, FOIA, Habeas Corpus [<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus],">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Habeas_corpus],</a> congressional overview, and any other kind of due process. Watch what you say, watch who you talk to, watch where you surf online - you better watch out, because they're watching you. And if they don't like what they see, you just disappear.

        Does the WarOnTerrorism justify a <a href="SecretPolice.html">SecretPolice</a>, or are the <a href="SecretPolice.html">SecretPolice</a> an instrument of terror?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No. Nothing justifies a <a href="SecretPolice.html">SecretPolice</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           The only thing a <a href="SecretPolice.html">SecretPolice</a> <em>can</em> be is an instrument of terror.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The premise that "anyone <em>can</em> be a terrorist, so you must watch <em>everyone</em>" is almost too broken for comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only remedy for this is to remain as open and transparent as possible. All attempts at security through secrecy and "special" powers lead to tyranny.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that this does not say openness and transparency are easy. Even a little bit. But anything else loses.

        Oh the untruth, and the mistatements made equating a legally constituted, open and regulated agency with SecretPolice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Open and regulated?  That's funny.  And what's legally constituted got to do with it?  Most Secret Polices are legally constituted.  <a href="JasonGrossman.html">JasonGrossman</a>
