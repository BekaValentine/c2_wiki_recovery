        Team Player

        Some people are instinctively turned off by "team" talk. They have worked in environments where the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> would say "you're not a team player" whenever they resisted his efforts to keep them down.

        Q: What does one do when members of the team refuse to help with parts of the dataflow?

        <strong>A team worker</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        More than once in interviews I've been asked "are you a team player?" These days I answer "No, I'm not. But I am a team worker." A recruiter's response to this line can be very illuminating. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

        <strong>What are team players?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The very term "team player" is misleading. By definition, a team player is one who desires and is able to work cooperatively with other people to achieve the team's goals. Labeling someone a "team player" assumes that there is some fundamental part of their character that makes them effective in any team they are plopped into. What's missing is a realization that a person's values and the organization's values have to be aligned before a person can work effectively in that organization. In other words, DrMartinLutherKingJr would have been a horrible "team player" in a KKK meeting, but labeling him as <a href="NotaTeamPlayer.html">NotaTeamPlayer</a> is ridiculous. -- <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a>

        I'm not so sure... how often are really great leaders "team players"?

        Depending on context, of course.
