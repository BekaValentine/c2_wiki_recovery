        Multiple Languages In Java Script
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many languages compile down to a hardware <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>. Some languages can be compiled to <a href="JavaByteCode.html">JavaByteCode</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Interpreters written in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> have been created for some languages. Those languages can all, therefore, run on anything that runs <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> -- including most current <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>s.

           <a href="JsForth.html">JsForth</a> : <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> running in a browser iframe

               ... I thought there were a few others ? ...
            </li>
            <li>
               There were, but none as complete as the above one. looks like that one has blasted the others out of the water - it seems to be fully ANS standard compliant, and not just a demonstration.

               Possibly off-topic, but I wrote an interpreter construction tutorial -- <a href="http://felix.plesoianu.ro/scratch-lang/">http://felix.plesoianu.ro/scratch-lang/</a> -- around a stack-based language invented specifically for this purpose. The interpreter is written in Javascript simply so readers could test it directly in the browser (code compactness was also an important consideration). -- <a href="FelixPlesoianu.html">FelixPlesoianu</a>

        There is also <a href="AviBryant.html">AviBryant</a> 's <a href="ClamatoSmalltalk.html">ClamatoSmalltalk</a>, a <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> dialect with a (compiled into) <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> implementation.

        Mozilla's <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> engine, <a href="RhinoInterpreter.html">RhinoInterpreter</a>, uses <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> as well, but it's only stored internally. A JS implementation of an alternate language could probably achieve better performance by translating the source language code into <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, and then compiling it to <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> using eval().

        Sadly, this is a case of <a href="AbstractionInversion.html">AbstractionInversion</a>. <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is a high-level scripting language, one of the least efficient to run (see how it places in the shootout). A lower-level intermediate language would certainly be a more desireable target. <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is all we got (in the browser, at least).

        <em>True. Unless you run a </em><a href="JavaApplet.html">JavaApplet</a> (ugh).<em></em>

        These programs are nice if you want to do some programming on a platform that doesn't have any good development tools, but does have a browser, such as a phone or PDA.
