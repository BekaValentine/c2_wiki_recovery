        Argument For Refactoring That Makes Sense
      </h1>

      <ul>
        <li>
           What are strategies which preserve, not destroy, content and opinion?
        </li>
        <li>
           What is opinion?
        </li>
        <li>
           What difference does a certain refactoring make in the sense or meaning of the content?arbitrary about

               -- vs -
            </li>
            <li>
               end declarations or statements as sentences by using the period (.)
            </li>
            <li>
               end questions with a question-mark or question mark or questionmark (?)
            </li>
            <li>
               insertion or deletions of crlfs in the edit page when the presentation of the wiki-engine <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> wiki engine is of little difference? or not(?)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           spelling capitalization grammar
          <ul>
            <li>
               why insist on english or american spellings? or English or American spellings?
            </li>
            <li>
               does one have to spell well or use proper grammar to express oneself?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           If you like a page the way you edit it, why insist that this is the way everyone should view it? and revert, modify and delete another's way of expression. or not(.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I could go on, but why labour labor the point?
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the problems and issues expressed above are made irrelevant and unimportant when making expression in Ward's new creation ( <a href="SmallestFederatedWiki.html">SmallestFederatedWiki</a> ) now being tested and modified and created in many places and forms, and thereby being made better in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because one can do something in this wiki, which will make it senseless, meaningless, arbitrary, destructive and a nuisance means SomeoneWillBe, like it or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        When one can be responsible or not, sensible or not, meaningful or not, arbitrary or not, destructive or preservative, polite or bothersome, SomeoneWillBe.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is because of this flaw in the social mechanisms of a  wiki, like <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, which presupposes cooperative, collaborative, critical and rational approaches to subject matter, that it will be subject to vandalism and vandals, to sock-puppets and impersonations, to opinions and views that are polar opposites, to insistence that such oppositions and views appear on the same-named page (properly or improperly spelled), and all other kinds of issues, including <a href="NotOnThisWiki.html">NotOnThisWiki</a>, Please do or don't do this or that, <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> or <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, it's a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> - so it doesn't belong here, that statements like this should not be on one sentence but broken down to be more readable, etc ... and so forth ... and so on, it is because of this nature of human behaviors such as these, that <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> has come to the present point. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Even when efforts are launched to rescue and refine the wiki in its present form or in a slightly modified form as in <a href="CrazyThingsThatMightSaveWiki.html">CrazyThingsThatMightSaveWiki</a>, and notions expressed in the idea that <a href="TheGodsMustBeCrazy.html">TheGodsMustBeCrazy</a>, are and have been less than fruitful.

      <p>
        The ridiculous consumption of band-width, computer resources and human patience which goes on as in:

        This is not just a behavior of today, this week, this month, or even this year. It has been going on for much to long, it destroys and overshadows the scene of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> (of whatever form) and ordinary and sensible discourse for the newcomer and for <a href="BalancingReadersWritersAndEditors.html">BalancingReadersWritersAndEditors</a>.

           The spelling mistake was mine, and I apologize. I thought I spell-checked it before submitting it, but somehow hit a wrong button or over-pasted it somewhere. I'll be more careful in the future and double-check instead of single-check when creating titles. As far as <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>, my suggestion is to create a parallel page that attempts to refactor the points made into a cleaner format, and move the original to a "discussion" topic/name. However, past attempts at these were not very successful because there was disagreement over the wording of the summaries and what deserves to be at the top summary level and what doesn't. In short, one's world view also shapes what one sees as the key issues. Any textual source that ranks ideas in any way, such as having a summary or T.O.C., is going to be subject to disputes over idea or concept importance. Some person or entity is probably going to have to act as a moderator or judge to resolve such. --top

           let me try to refactor it - offline and then I'll post it either at my web-site or at my SFW -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.<a href="DoingStuff.html">DoingStuff</a>.20130117

           <em>Perhaps I should have said: going to have to act as an </em>impartial<em> moderator or judge to resolve such". Those involved in the topic may not be prepared to balance both sides objectively. Most of my disputes are not with those having "mellow" personalities. -t</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           My refactoring will not be to moderate or judge as to the universally acceptable presentation and correctness of the views and or opinions, but to garner stand-alone statements, arrange them in some orderly and fathomable form, taking as the sources what I have managed to, and will in the future manage to, gather from the fragments. I will not take a position of judging as to a particular fragment's veracity, application-domain, or acceptability of opponents, but of presenting alternate and contrasting approaches or views.  This not for those who would take sides, but will judge and test for themselves and apply what they have read to a greater and broader view of the issues involved. This is not something I will do immediately, I will instead "wait it out", and let all of what has transpired has passed by, and all presenters have completed their contributions, additions, edits, deletions, rants, points and counter-points. There is definitely room for something other than a NPOV, perhaps, if I may coin a term: PresentContrastAndComparePointOfView (PCCPOV). Dogma and what is considered fact and correctness is not a static thing in any of the disciplines of practice, whether Science, Physics, Chemistry, AstronomicalStudies, Sociology, History, Philosophy, <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, PlanetaryEnvironmentalScience, and so on.

           I have always been curious and have taken a viewpoint of "I want to know", and "What do we know and not know about", and "What do the current and past experts know or suppose to know". ** How a man or woman views a particular thing is of their own business, and while they may think everyone else, most, or more people should have the same view, it may not be the choice of everyone else, most or more people. Whether they be fanatic, aggressive, indifferent or passively tolerant, is a matter of their own choice and something they are responsible for. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.response.20130119
