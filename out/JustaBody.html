        I call myself an "independent consultant", but aside from one or two gigs where I really acted like a consultant, I'm a hired gun, designing/writing Java mostly.

        I think being <a href="JustaBody.html">JustaBody</a> gives me a perspective unlike either employees or real consultants (like the XPelders around here of whom I remain in awe).

        But I'm not sure what it is yet.

        Are you a registered independent, or registered "none?"  I am an independent consultant, therapist, and pay no allegiance to any groups of such like-titled persons.  If I were interested in the definition of the "<a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a>," for instance, as mentioned above, I may as well register Republican and continue to care for the poor incognito.  I mean, why join a party and talk about it on wiki pages when the whole point is to be independent (consultant or otherwise) and to take full advantage of my freedom to share.  I do not wish to impose, but the point of freely edited pages is to get real diversity of opinion, or flatulation, as it were.  I came here to boogie-wiki, and I shall.  <a href="JustaBody.html">JustaBody</a>? JustaParty? JustaPotty?  Justine Totty?  TerraCotta? LotsaJava? HavaCava? JavaNoddy?
