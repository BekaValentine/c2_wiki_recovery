        It's great that such a thing exists - I thought that <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> was almost unknown in Russia and ExUssr... Can you tell me something about your experience? How many people are in your community? Have you developed (or are you developing) any successful projects? Does <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> work? (I have some doubts about the willingness of Russian people to work in such a way. Not a language problem, of course, but a cultural one.) -- <a href="DmitryJemerov.html">DmitryJemerov</a>

        That's not gonna be a big problem, pair programming is much closer to the Russian culture than to whatever culture, where individualism is brough up since chilhood. I have a very good experience in that, we have been doing a whole XP for 3 months. Pair programming has turned out to be the least problem (not a problem at all). -- <a href="KirillKalishev.html">KirillKalishev</a>

        Very nice to see XP march in xUSSR :)
        Dmitry, I wander that anyone who asks me about a transition to XP, first asks about <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. No one had problems with it, AFAIK. More, it's very difficult to work another way when you once addicted to pairing.

        We here at Madia do <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> just a couple of weeks but i can say that's much more fun than alone espesially if combined with <a href="TestFirstProgramming.html">TestFirstProgramming</a>.

        Wow. Impressive. Sorry, but I can answer your questions at July or
        in late June. Sorry again. I'm hard worker, It's warm time.

        With a little help of my friends (?) we can move it UP.

        Hi all.
      </p>
      <p>
        XPWeb, the tool I'm developping -with a few other guys now!!- is now available in different languages. Well, technically speaking. At this time it is available in english, french and italian.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, if you speak anything else than these three languages, know XP, have an hour to spend (really, just an excel sheet to fill up) to help the development of this open source free tool for XPers, please anwser!
      </p>
      <p>
        BTW, the tool is here: <a href="http://xpweb.sourceforge.net">http://xpweb.sourceforge.net</a> (there's also an online demo)
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks!
