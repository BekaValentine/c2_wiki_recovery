        ---<strong>Titles Do Not Tell the Whole Story</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In articles, books as well as Programs:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Intentions are revealed by "Slicing" them into separately meaningful statements, sentences and phrases
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Chapters in a book may be sliced into segments composed of titles, page-numbers, and into individual sentences
                </li>
                <li>
                   In an Article: It is common to extract to an aside, or highlight within it a most significant sentence or phrase, to tease the scanning eye into further investigation of its contents
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Slices are meaningful if the sentence has been constructed to be self-sufficient, using nouns rather than pronouns, and other defining characteristics which make it a statement not dependent on context to extract information from it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ---<strong>When a slice does not stand on its own</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When editing a sliced-document and discovering fragments which do not stand-alone, examination may reveal via the context, substitutions or replacements which may be made to the fragment which will assist the desired-end of making it self-standing or self-evident.
