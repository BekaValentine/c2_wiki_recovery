      <p>
        I've been programming for more than 15 years. I've lived through the beginnings of the birth of the PC. I cut my teeth learning basic (real basic, not Visual Basic) on a Radio Shack TRS-80. I've even done some programming on punch cards on a Burrough's computer system. I've learned Assembler, Pascal, FORTRAN, a little Ada, C, and C++ over the years. Shell and Perl are the scripts of choice (mostly perl). I decided it was a waste of time to become Microsoft Certified professional. I am an Electrical Engineer by degree, a programmer by choice, and a Christian by grace.

        I'm also constantly learning.
