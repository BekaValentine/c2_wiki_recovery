        <a href="AtLarge.html">AtLarge</a> is a term used to describe the collective group of "members" of the ICANN@Large program (<a href="http://members.icann.org),">http://members.icann.org),</a> which currently elects 5 people to the board of Directors of ICANN. These 5 people are from 5 distinct regions of the globe, divided by ICANN to keep regional diversity among board members.

        ICANN has tried to kill the <a href="AtLarge.html">AtLarge</a> so it is trying to reform at <a href="http://www.icannatlarge.com">http://www.icannatlarge.com</a>

        What other regional division schemes might be better?

        Is there any justification at all for regions within ICANN policies ?
