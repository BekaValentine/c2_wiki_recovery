        Double Buffer
      </h1>
      <p>
        Use a <a href="DoubleBuffer.html">DoubleBuffer</a>, i.e. two buffers, when generating revised datasets for an asynchronous processor.  When the new data is complete and self consistent, redirect the asynchronous processor to the alternate buffer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DoubleBuffer.html">DoubleBuffer</a> became popular with the early computer graphics systems, in which a display processor was synchronized with the electron beam refreshing the display.  You could use double buffers to update the display without flicker. Raster graphics systems tend to have a more synchronous interface, since often the only operations are "display graphical object on window".  But <a href="DoubleBuffer.html">DoubleBuffer</a> is still useful, since building an off-screen bit-map and then displaying it prevents the user from seeing the intermediate forms of a picture and makes the program seem faster. This is why it is used in <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use a <a href="CircularBuffer.html">CircularBuffer</a> to send continuous streams of data to another processor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Especially effective when used to implement <a href="DeferredUpdate.html">DeferredUpdate</a>.

        This is a specialized form of <a href="WaitFreeSynchronization.html">WaitFreeSynchronization</a>.
        The reader (the part of the display that feeds the frame buffer data to the electron beam)
        never waits for anything, unlike the <a href="ReadWriteLock.html">ReadWriteLock</a>.
