        Go On Linux

        <em>Can we morph into a HOWTO page?  Is there already a HOWTO on this?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're running <a href="DebianGnuLinux.html">DebianGnuLinux</a>, you can just <a href="AptGet.html">AptGet</a> cgoban, and you'll find cgoban in the menu, which includes nice help (only in english though, afaik).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="GameOfGo.html">GameOfGo</a> is screamingly popular, and simple to get started. So figure you want to download a simulated opponent and a <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a> Go board for the rugrat to learn. This would be the shopping list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="GnuGo.html">GnuGo</a> - a text-only interface, and a text IO filter protocol (GTP: Go Text Protocol) so you can bond a UI onto it
        </li>
        <li>
           2ptkgo.pl - a Perl <em>what?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           pggo - Python, and requires <a href="PyGame.html">PyGame</a>, which requires lots of libSDL (why??). Further, it thinks the file white.png should be in Windows BMP format...
        </li>
        <li>
           cgoban 1 - a beautiful GUI which can run with a Go server (NNGS or IGS protocols), a local program such as <a href="GnuGo.html">GnuGo</a> via the Go Modem Protocol, a local game between two humans, or in several other combinations; includes one of the best SGF editors.  Runs under X; does not require Java, KDE, GTK, or any such thing.
        </li>
        <li>
           cgoban 2 - a beautiful GUI which, unfortunately, is implemented in Java and only works with the server "KGS".  Includes a port of the SGF editor from cgoban 1.
        </li>
        <li>
           pGo - requires Java, which I've never been able to install.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Have you checked the excellent Java GUI </em>'JaGO<strong> at </strong><a href="http://www.rene-grothmann.de/jago/">http://www.rene-grothmann.de/jago/</a> ? it's cross-platform, works with <a href="GnuGo.html">GnuGo</a> and it's pretty.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               There's also gGo at: <a href="http://panda-igs.joyjoy.net/java/gGo/">http://panda-igs.joyjoy.net/java/gGo/</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RubyGo.html">RubyGo</a> - another beautiful GUI. It supports IGS and local games, can run <a href="GnuGo.html">GnuGo</a>, includes an SGF editor. It requires Ruby, and run on any platform implementing Ruby.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        [<a href="RefactorMe.html">RefactorMe</a>: I may have read only the wrong README files, but I just want GTP and a beautiful UI for it. I don't give a poop about playing over the 'net until I can get the rugrat above novice level.]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Go online and you'll find plenty of other beginners. Play against them and play <strong><em>a lot</em></strong>. That's the best way to learn. If you learn by playing a computer (especially a weak program like <a href="GnuGo.html">GnuGo</a>), you will very likely learn <em>bad habits</em> which you might get away with against a computer but which will never work against a human opponent.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>That may be true - perhaps you could offer a HOWTO about starting playing on-line?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My current solution:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Install <a href="GnuGo.html">GnuGo</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Install libSDL*
        </li>
        <li>
           Install <a href="PyGame.html">PyGame</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Download pggo-0.95.tar.gz
        </li>
        <li>
           Run this command on every png file:
          <ul>
            <li>
               convert images/board.png -compress none board.bmp
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Copy the uncompressed *.bmp files onto the images/*.png files (the horror!)
        </li>
        <li>
           Run this command
          <ul>
            <li>
               python pggo -w human
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result: I'm Go-ing.
      </p>

        pggo seems to no longer be available. Here are my suggestions for a computer player:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="GnuGo.html">GnuGo</a> and Quarry
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="GnuGo.html">GnuGo</a> and Panda glGo
        </li>
      </ul>
