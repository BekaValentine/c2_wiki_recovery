        Fixed Point Combinator
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="ParadoxicalCombinator.html">ParadoxicalCombinator</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        A fixed point is a point in a function's domain which is equal to the corresponding point in its range. That is, suppose a function f which maps from a set A to a set B, that is `f: A -> B' . A fixed point of f is an x in A that equals f(x). So you get input which is exactly the same as the output.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fixed point combinator is a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> which returns a fixed point of its argument.
        It makes a recursive function from a non-recursive function.
        Say we want to define a recursive function fib by:
      </p>
      <code>
        fib 0 = 1<br/>
        fib 1 = 1<br/>
        fib (n+2) = (fib n) + (fib (n+1))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To remove the recursion, we rewrite it as:
      </p>
      <code>
        FIB fib 0 = 1<br/>
        FIB fib 1 = 1<br/>
        FIB fib (n+2) = (fib n) + (fib (n+1))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        where fib has become a parameter rather than the function itself.
        To make the original recursive function fib, we can define
      </p>
      <code>
        fib = FIB fib<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is a general method, so we can define a function Y to do it:
      </p>
      <code>
        Y f x = f (Y f) x<br/>
        fib = Y FIB<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        then
      </p>
      <code>
        fib x = Y FIB x<br/>
        = FIB (Y FIB) x<br/>
        = FIB fib x<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        as desired. We can eliminate all recursion by replacing it with calls
        to the Y combinator.
        This is good, because it means your <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> no longer needs to
        support recursion except in its hard-coded implementation of Y.
        Y can be written in <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a> as:
      </p>
      <code>
        Y = (\y.\f. f (y y f)) (\y.\f. f (y y f))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        From this it is easy to see that Y satisfies:
      </p>
      <code>
        Y = \f. f (Y f)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The other good thing about Y (the <a href="FixedPointCombinator.html">FixedPointCombinator</a>) is that it produces
        the LeastFixedPoint of the recursive function.
        That means that the function produced (Y f), does not do bizarre things like
        assign values to elements outside the domain for which it is specified.
        The LeastFixedPoint of a recursive function happens to be the one which can
        be calculated by computers implementing recursion using stacks, which is
        convenient.
