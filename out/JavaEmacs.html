        Java Emacs
      </h1>
      <p>
        At a PJUG meeting I got a tip on a great IDE extension for using Emacs (including XEmacs and <a href="EmacsNt.html">EmacsNt</a>) to write Java.  It's called JDE,
        <a href="JavaDevelopmentEnvironment.html">JavaDevelopmentEnvironment</a> for Emacs, and you can get it at <a href="http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde/">http://sunsite.auc.dk/jde/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        From the web site:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           JDE menu with compile, run, debug, build, browse, project, and help commands 
        </li>
        <li>
           SyntaxColoring 
        </li>
        <li>
           auto indentation 
        </li>
        <li>
           compile error to source links 
        </li>
        <li>
           source-level debugging 
        </li>
        <li>
           source code browsing 
        </li>
        <li>
           make file support 
        </li>
        <li>
           automatic code generation 
        </li>
        <li>
           Java source interpreter (Pat Neimeyer's <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a>) 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The only missing feature is completion and is in the works.

        Tip: with dabbrev-expand bound to an easily accessible keystroke (I use M-<),
        you already have completion. And if you use JDE's expansion of abbreviations, you can enter Java source code very fast. --JonasLindstrom

        I use Emacs as my Java IDE, but I don't use JDE.  You don't really need makefiles since java compilers do a lot of dependency checking for you, so it's pretty easy to write scripts to compile and run java file(s).  From there it's pretty easy to tie Emacs keys to these scripts so that you can compile/run/run unit tests on the file you're currently editing.
        JDE is pretty good, but I have found that Xrefactory (<a href="http://www.xref-tech.com)">http://www.xref-tech.com)</a> is quicker and supports completion for more things.  More important, it has very good source browsing capabilities.

        I completely agree with <a href="ChristianTaubman.html">ChristianTaubman</a>. If you do Java in Emacs, I wouldn't consider the JDE. Just spend some bucks and buy Xrefactory. It is by far the best Java development environment I've ever worked with.

        Eclipse = java emacs?
      </p>
      <p>
        isn't Eclipse a new emacs equivalent enviroment?

        I highly recommend the ecb package:
        <a href="http://ecb.sourceforge.net/">http://ecb.sourceforge.net/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It has a great introspection facility and allows you to nest Speedbar into it, or use it's own directory/source browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You can also combine it with the JDE</em>
