        Hmm, no page by that name yet?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds too trivial, doesn't it?

      <p>
        But shouldn't someone here at <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> categorize <a href="ProgrammingLanguages.html">ProgrammingLanguages</a> by
        whether they treat function names, classes and variable names case-sensitive

        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="BooLanguage.html">BooLanguage</a> - similar to Python.  It is case sensitive, but there is a patch for the next version that allows you to have a case-insensitive option.

        My first shocking experience with <a href="CaseSensitivity.html">CaseSensitivity</a> was, when a prof from SwitzerLand visited my school, talking two hours about switching from <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> to the <a href="OberonLanguage.html">OberonLanguage</a> (Oberon-2 actually) and I only discovered in the very very last example shown, that it all was case-sensitive (...)
