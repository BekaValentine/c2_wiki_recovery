        The geometry of your trade.  For software developers, it seems one gets a robust feeling for this geometry (he or she masters the craft) after about a quarter-million lines of code.

        Accompanying the quarter-millions lines of code are thoughts like "Hmmm, this could be better, simpler, clearer for the next programmer, easier to enhance and maintain."
