        Maintenance And Methodologies

      <p>
        It is important for a software process to recognize and support the <a href="MaintenanceProgrammer.html">MaintenanceProgrammer</a>.  <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> as a process supports this area by giving the programmers <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s.  Without these tools, a <a href="MaintenanceProgrammer.html">MaintenanceProgrammer</a> is forced to rely on <a href="BigBangTesting.html">BigBangTesting</a> and <a href="TestingByPokingAround.html">TestingByPokingAround</a>. -- <a href="FrancisTownsend.html">FrancisTownsend</a>

        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> seems to be centered around the idea of maintenance of the code, does anyone else get this feeling?

        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> seems to remove the distinction between development and maintenance. -- <a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a>

        I read a talk abstract the other day that lamented that 80% of software development dollars were spent on maintenance. My immediate reaction was, "What would it take to get that up to 95%?" -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        <a href="ImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode.html">ImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode</a> is difficult when you don't have the source. The <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> movement is working on that problem.

        I've argued for years that all software work is a kind of corrective maintenance.   In the sense that there is nearly always a pre-existing way of doing things (manual? mechanical? intuitive?) which we about to replace.
      </p>
      <p>
        The classical stats was that 60-80% of software work was changing existing code.
        <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> just posted the figure that only 47 days in the work year are dedicated
        to adding new functionality/code.

        The <a href="TgpMethodology.html">TgpMethodology</a> is a new approach that tries to tackle the maintenance issue. It is based on <a href="IncrementalDevelopment.html">IncrementalDevelopment</a> so most of the development is done in a maintenance mode (<a href="TgpProcess.html">TgpProcess</a>). However, the Involvement of <a href="BusinessProfessionals.html">BusinessProfessionals</a> and using the <a href="TgpArchitecture.html">TgpArchitecture</a> hands tools to avoid some of the problems by a better connection to the business domain and to respond quickly by flexible architecture -- <a href="OriInbar.html">OriInbar</a>
