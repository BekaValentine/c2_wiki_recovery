        Cocktail Party Metaphor
      </h1>
      <p>
        At a cocktail party or a conference or similar, you can't possibly pay attention to everyone. So whom do you listen to? Well, you listen to the people you're talking to. And to the people they're talking to. And that's all. The connectivity of these people forms a dynamic clique.

A <a href="WebThreePointZero.html">WebThreePointZero</a> peer need merely serve up the connectivity of its peers (and their peers - no more) via its RDFDNS mapping, and then it's out. No forwarding, doesn't need to serve a damn thing. No poll and no push - just notify your peers of any pub/sub changes and let them do all the work. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
