        Just another troublesome, pesky 'noun'. My apologies in advance if I crash into 
        anything or anybody on my way to the bottom of the hill.

        In a hypertext environment, there is not <strong>one</strong> clear starting point. This can be daunting, but for 
        me this home page will serve. Elements of planning fascinate me, stumbling onto <a href="PatternLanguages.html">PatternLanguages</a> has 
        motivated me. If this page were represented by a Venn diagram, the left circle would read 'elements of me', 
        the right 'elements of pattern language' and the conflux would read <a href="EvanDamerow.html">EvanDamerow</a>.

        Edits to this page are very welcome, both as a way to educate me about the Wiki culture, and on the content of
        this page, but please do so with respect. This is a <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> for and about me, and I would 
        like the freedom to represent myself in my own manner. If you make changes, please do so in italics.

        But Where:

      <ol>
        <li>
           Work needs to start now in order to achieve desired results
        </li>
        <li>
           All processes needed to achieve desired results are not known
        </li>
        <li>
           All desired results are not known
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        any attempt at solution?
