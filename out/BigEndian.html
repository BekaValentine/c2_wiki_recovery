        <strong>big-endian</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When writing a number in a positional notation, the practice of writing the most significant digits (of whatever base) before the smaller ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        English speakers normally write left to right and so when they write a number using (the usual) hindu-arabic numerals.  In Arabic, the writing goes right to left and the least significant digits are written first.  However, after they're written, the numbers look the same on the page - whether they are little- or big- endian depends on who reads them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Big-endian is the chosen <a href="NetworkByteOrder.html">NetworkByteOrder</a> for the internet and <a href="TcpIp.html">TcpIp</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        CPU instructions to use multi-byte numbers can take a big-endian approach, where the most significant bytes of a multi-byte number have the lowest memory addresses (example: <a href="MotorolaSixtyEightKay.html">MotorolaSixtyEightKay</a>).  Or the approach can be <a href="LittleEndian.html">LittleEndian</a> with the least significant bytes first.
      </p>
      <p>
        A related but distinct problem is the approach chosen for indexing a bit in a register.  Some CPU instructions have a 3-bit field that designate what bit of a byte is to be operated on.  On some processors, a zero in this field accesses the most significant bit of the byte (as determined by the CPU's other instructions for arithmetic operations).  Other processors use 7 to address the most significant bit.

        <em>Are there any processors left which address the MSB with zero? I have never seen this.</em>

           I don't know, but there are certainly C compilers that pack bitfields into structs in both orders.  Some even have a compiler option to select the order.

               Certain <a href="PowerPc.html">PowerPc</a> processors did as recently as a few years ago; I have no idea if this practice is still followed and for what members of the family.
