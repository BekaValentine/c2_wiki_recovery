        Why We Hate Cobol
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>"The use of COBOL cripples the mind; its teaching should, therefore, be regarded as a criminal offence." (1968) -- Dijkstra</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a> has the following bad attributes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           EverythingIsAMove -- Over 90% of a typical Cobol program will be MOVE, IF, and GO TO verbs, because Cobol is an English version of assembly language, which has the same ratio. Look at the output of a Cobol compiler and you will see a one-for-one translation. The semantics of what the MOVE really accomplishes remains in the mind of the original programmer.
        </li>
        <li>
           EveryVariableIsGlobal -- Variables are shared throughout entire programs (no scope); variables are shared between programs using global Linkage Area; see <a href="GlobalVariablesAreBad.html">GlobalVariablesAreBad</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           EveryVariableIsAStringOrNumber -- There is no support for defining <a href="AbstractDataTypes.html">AbstractDataTypes</a> (ADT) or objects (until recent enhanced versions)
        </li>
        <li>
           MoveDoesSecretStuff -- Many casting and transformation possibilities hide behind every MOVE verb, based on the type, size, REDEFINES, CORRESPONDING, and COMP options. Variables can redefine and rename each other: change one variable, you've changed another. This corresponds directly to assembly language concepts (DS and DC on IBM mainframe assembler).
        </li>
        <li>
           EveryProgramIsLong -- Sub-program capability exists but is rarely used
        </li>
        <li>
           DataLayerIsNotSeparate -- The Program Division contains direct reference to the physical name and size of database fields; this information is repeated in many programs, making changes very time consuming
        </li>
        <li>
           Reserved words -- Long list of common words that cannot be used as variables (longer than <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>...)
        </li>
        <li>
           Not very portable -- Petty differences between implementations (like C and C++)
        </li>
        <li>
           Not available for certain environments. 
        </li>
        <li>
           EverythingIsLowLevel -- Related to EverythingIsAMove. Cobol provides a very small set of functions in the standard language definition. It is difficult (and rare) to create shared subroutines to raise the conceptual level of the programs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Oververbose syntax -- See <a href="SelfDocumentingCode.html">SelfDocumentingCode</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           IF statement uses a no-op statement called NEXT SENTENCE, usually as an attempt to avoid NegativeLogic.
        </li>
        <li>
           IF ends with a dot (period character) (though, an ENDIF verb has been added in Cobol-85). Move a dot in a IF statement until the program compile and have lot's of fun watching your fellow programmers hunt this bug.
        </li>
        <li>
           Columns Matter -- An archaic descendant of punch cards, the notion of columns 7 being a star for comments, 8-12 for major divisions and 13-72 for normal code is outdated and cumbersome when used with modern text editing software.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>The above explains why I've never had any luck explaining Java or any </em><a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> concept to a COBOL programmer.  Anything about defining a type, encapsulation or collections gets a blank stare back.<em> [see </em><a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a>, <a href="EncapsulationDefinition.html">EncapsulationDefinition</a>, <a href="JavaCollections.html">JavaCollections</a>]

      <p>
        Dijkstra lambasted a number of languages in <em>How do we tell truths that might hurt? ACM SIGPLAN Notices. 1982</em> not just COBOL.  He called FORTRAN "the infantile disorder", he called PL/I "the fatal disease", he said "It is practically impossible to teach good programming to students that have had a prior exposure to BASIC: as potential programmers they are mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration." and he said that "APL is a mistake, carried through to perfection."  What do you think he would say about our modern languages?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Everything Is A Move -- "Cobol is an English version of assembly language"?  Let's see the one-for-one translation of the INSPECT, STRING, UNSTRING, EVALUATE, SORT or SEARCH.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Every Variable Is Global -- unless you declare them inside a contained subprogram (ANS85 COBOL) - similar to a procedure or method. Variables are not "shared between programs using global Linkage Area".  The LINKAGE SECTION is used to define the parameters passed to a subprogram.  Items defined in the LINKAGE SECTION of a subprogram are only visible in the subprogram.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Every Variable Is A String Or Number -- true as long as you ignore the version of COBOL defined in  ISO2002.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Every Program Is Long -- "Sub-program capability exists but is rarely used" at least not in forty or fifty year old COBOL programs but how about COBOL programs written in the last ten years?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           IF ends with a dot (period character) -- this used to be true thirty years ago but since ANS85 COBOL and the introduction of END-IF, END-EVALUATE, END-PERFORM etc COBOL's scoping is probably the clearest of any language.  The period can still be used to delimit scope but the dangers of this were recognized by Howard Tompkins in 1983 and most modern COBOL programmers now adhere to the minimum period style suggested by Robert Baldwin in 1987.

        "The problem with being such an old language is that COBOL suffers from 50 years of accumulated opprobrium. Criticism of COBOL is often based—if it is based on direct experience at all—on programs written 30 to 50 years ago. The huge monolithic programs, the tangled masses of spaghetti code, and the global data are all hallmarks of COBOL programs written long before programmers knew better. They are not characteristic of programs written using more modern versions of COBOL."

        <em>I'd say that COBOL-85 was a failure due to lack of user-defined types. What good does it do you to have named functions ("subprograms") in your program with parameters, when you can't reuse types, like "employee?" The structured constructs (IF/END-IF, PERFORM/END-PERFORM are good, but COBOL-85, on the whole, falls short.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know if it was vendor specific but MicroFocus allowed user-defined types ages ago. Getting COBOL programmers to understand what they were about is another matter.

        I'm no expert but how about copy-statements with replacings? You can 'copy' a piece of code (from a so called 'copybook') in your program (somewhat like an include) and replace (literally!) a piece of text that (might) occur(s) in the 'copybook' with some other text. Stuff like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        copy amountcomputer.cpy replacing '-' by '+'<br/>
        copy amountcomputer.cpy replacing 'varname' by 'var_name'<br/>
        copy amount_computer.cpy replacing 'end of the code.' by 'not yet the end...'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You get the point: what if someone changes the copybook (no type checking whatsoever of course). How about more than one replacing? How about conflicting replacings? Which is done first?
      </p>
      <code>
        Copy above-example replacing copybook by 'C header file' <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or conditional expressions. One can write: <em>A > B and C</em> which of course means <em>A > B and A > C</em>. But how about: <em>A > B or F < B and C or D</em>? You might think that the and-operation binds stronger, but that doesn't matter it will produce <em>A > B or F < B and F < C or F < D</em> (I think...).
      </p>
      <p>
        You might hope people don't write code like that. Famous last words...

        COBOL has major limitations, but certainly goes well beyond 1980, especially in combination with appropriate software, such as a database system. The COPY statement (especially the REPLACING option) was always weak. It is possible to write conditions that are "ambiguous" (in the sense that successive compilers from the same supplier interpret them differently), but such matters are uncommon.

        Cobol is decidedly a <a href="LegacyLanguage.html">LegacyLanguage</a>; goodness knows the programming language design community has moved on.  Nobody ever holds Cobol up as a shining example of goodness; nor does (hardly) anyone select Cobol for a project these days except when a) needing to do so to interface with/maintain an existing Cobol system, or b) a hypothetical IT shop full of Cobol programmers who know nothing else.

           Recent surveys show that new development in COBOL is still going on.  In a survey of 357 IT professionals undertaken by ComputerWorld in 2012 53% of responders said that COBOL was still being used for new development in their organization. Asked to quantify what proportion of new code was written in COBOL 27% said that it was used for more than half of their new development - <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225099/Cobol_brain_drain_Survey_results.">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225099/Cobol_brain_drain_Survey_results.</a>

           The ComputerWorld survey 2012 also reported that when compared to languages such as Visual Basic, C#, C++ and Java, respondents rated COBOL better or the same for characteristics such Batch Processing (82% better & 12% same), Transaction Processing (65% & 24%), Handling business-oriented features (55% & 21%), Run-time efficiency (54% & 33%), Security (39% & 38%), Reporting (45% & 37%), Development cost (39% & 32%) Maintenance cost (43% & 29%).  The only characteristics where COBOL scored worse than these other languages was Ability to hire programmers (55% of respondents said it was worse) and Agility (45% of respondents said it was worse) - <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225099/Cobol_brain_drain_Survey_results.">http://www.computerworld.com/s/article/9225099/Cobol_brain_drain_Survey_results.</a>

        Flaming COBOL <strong>is</strong> like shooting ducks in a barrel when you ignore the fact that COBOL is a domain specific language and insist on criticizing it for shortcomings that have little relevance to its target domain. It's like shooting ducks in a barrel when the criticisms levelled are mainly relevant to a version of COBOL and a style of programming that is now forty years old.
