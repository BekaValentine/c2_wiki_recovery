        If I have a single belief about software development, it is that discipline is more important than knowledge, and that knowledge of what's going on (good intelligence) is more important than anything else. My teams know me and know that I expect teamwork and initiative. Nothing less will do. I am an uncompromising son of a bitch. No excuses.

        The <a href="PowersThatBe.html">PowersThatBe</a> in my office are tired of hearing all about <em>eXtreme</em>Programming and <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>. <a href="SellingXp.html">SellingXp</a> is a real problem. Especially all that idealist hug-each-other language. On the other hand, <a href="ArmCl.html">ArmCl</a> may not be XP, but it sure looks light weight ... and it looks like it'll work. I'm glad that <a href="FrankStone.html">FrankStone</a> has brought this to our attention.
