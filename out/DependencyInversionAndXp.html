        <dd>A fundamental principle of object oriented design that states concrete classes should not be directly depended upon.  That rather, the bulk of the code in the system should depend only upon the interfaces that those concrete classes implement.</dd>

        Note, this was early in his <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> days. Since then, he has refined his position to include <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>, where "invert" is a transitive verb.
      </p>
      <p>
        He always defines OO decoupling as equivalent to the <a href="DependencyInversionPrinciple.html">DependencyInversionPrinciple</a> over PolymorphicInterfaces, continuously through 2008.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, if you do indeed plan to invert, you can write tests and perform refactors that lead simple code to the inversion. And if you don't plan to invert, but discover you then need an inversion, you will have the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, and <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> available to assist the inversion.
      </p>
      <p>
        And some <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>s will help automate it, with commands like ExtractInterfaceClass.
      </p>
      <p>
        XP allows you to avoid the high risk of thinking of too many abstractions ahead of time. Architecture evolves, via <a href="EmergentDesign.html">EmergentDesign</a>, leaving room for just the right mix of patterns, architecture and principles.

What he calls seams become assembly points where you create a number of classes and wire them together. Use of the <a href="DependencyInversionPrinciple.html">DependencyInversionPrinciple</a> will be quite prominent at these points. At the seams you'll probably wish that <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> had a standard facility for loading classes dynamically so you don't have to keep changing the resulting factory classes. XPCOM is the most portable solution I know of for C++, check the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> though (I haven't been there in a couple years). I'd also suggest thinking about Martin Fowler's StranglerFig pattern. It probably won't seem obvious how to strangle your application at first.
