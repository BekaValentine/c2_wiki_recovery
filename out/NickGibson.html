        Hey there kiddos! My name is Nick Gibson, from Bellevue, Wa, outside Seattle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm in school right now doing begining training for my MCSE so I can get paid to be a nerd, and my major interests include:
      </p>
      <p>
        PunkRock, <a href="DirectAction.html">DirectAction</a>, love, life and justice, <a href="HowardZinn.html">HowardZinn</a>, computers, grindcore, thrashcore, sideways glaces and www.livejournal.com (I'm at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/~xjaprufrockx">http://www.livejournal.com/~xjaprufrockx</a> .)
      </p>
      <p>
        As time passes I'll find interesting thoughts and musings to make this worthwhile, until then, deal.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can contact me at Nickgoldfish@yahoo.com, I love email.

        PS - For the Record - I was considering explaining this when I initially created this page, however, I felt it would be seen as trite and/or egotistical - but since others have brought it up... I have formatted my name this way for a long time.  As long as I can remember.  The fact the Wiki creates addresses by means of connecting capitalized words/letters together meshed perfectly with this quirk of mine; I can use both my real name *and* the spelling and format I am most comfortable with.  I am aware of <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a> ... I am using my real name... 'NiCk' is no fabrication.  I am not a formal person, I don't like using my last name, but it is provided for those who are curious for some reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        Am I easier to bond with, commune with, understand or argue with, by providing an arbitrary second moniker to complicate the first?  I could have made a page for NickRawmanousski easily, but I chose not to, as that's not who I am.  NiCk is. <em>I don't mean this to be snotty... I'm just explaining.  Not disrespecting those who have brought my name to my attention.</em> -- NiCk

        The reaction you see might also be explained by the principles underlying <a href="FixBrokenWindows.html">FixBrokenWindows</a> and <a href="TheTippingPoint.html">TheTippingPoint</a>. I wouldn't have thought your explanation as trite or egotistical, but instead something that explains the validity of something unconventional. Without that explanation though it could be seen as setting a bad example .. along the lines of IfNiCkCanDoItYouCanDoIt ;-) -- <a href="EricScheid.html">EricScheid</a>

        <em>the </em><a href="FixBrokenWindows.html">FixBrokenWindows</a> theory is intriguing... I can easily see how it applies to my chosen page... For the record, I think most can infer (but assume and you make an ass out of you and me, hah), but I don't see my name as a 'broken window', is all.  It's just who I am.  I don't intend for others to jump on my 'bandwagon' and start pages like '420NOFXPunk' or something horrendously awful like that...   On another note... maybe I as a whole am a broken window... that could be debated.... hmm... perhaps it *should* be debated... anyhow, off to bed.<em> -- </em>NiCk

        Well, seeing as I didn't actually call you a broken window per se, but instead pointed at the underlying principles involved, namely that actions follow appearances, so be careful what example you set. A similar principle is with DontTryThisAtHomeKids <em>(usually followed by "We are professionals ... professional idiots, that is")</em>. -- <a href="EricScheid.html">EricScheid</a>

        <em>Definitely </em><a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>. It's polite and respectful to the community to abide by the conventions of that community, and respect in one direction engenders respect in return. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a><em></em>

        Yeah!!! --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        But doesn't first-name only make things confusing? -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, I've seen many people highly annoyed at '<a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>' .... it says *nothing* about identity, making community fostering difficult.... I've provided my full name... you won't give yours when commenting on my actions? ;)
