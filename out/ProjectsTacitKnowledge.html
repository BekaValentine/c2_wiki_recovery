        I think that a project lives off a lot more <a href="TacitKnowledge.html">TacitKnowledge</a> than most people recognise. It would be good to get some of that out in the open (turn the "use of <a href="ProjectsTacitKnowledge.html">ProjectsTacitKnowledge</a>" into ExplicitKnowledge, i.e., written down.)
