        Refactoring Hat
      </h1>
      <p>
        You want to do a good job at refactoring, and it's already hard enough to keep everything straight in your head.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong> if you are refactoring, refactor.  Don't be tempted to change the meaning of the code. If you are, put on your <a href="RewritingHat.html">RewritingHat</a> first. (See <a href="RefactoringAndRewriting.html">RefactoringAndRewriting</a>.)  A good test is probably whether you need to change any <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s.  If you do, then you're rewriting.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a refactoring session, it is often easy to enhance the system by putting helper methods and classes into the <a href="PublicInterface.html">PublicInterface</a> of the component / package / module they're in.  Then is the time to start writing <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s again.

        SemiOt: where the "Put On Your <Something> Hat" <a href="SnowClone.html">SnowClone</a> originated? Why do people use it so much? Is it an <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>? Is it a GeekCulturalAssumption ?
