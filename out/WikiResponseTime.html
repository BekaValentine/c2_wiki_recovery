      <p>
        <em>How long before some Wiki reader sees a change and responds to it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After showing <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> to a colleague friend of mine, 
        he exclaimed, "They can't possibly just let <em>Anyone</em> 
        edit their pages!" 
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove me wrong, he put a new line of text into
        <strong></strong><a href="MoreAboutMechanics.html">MoreAboutMechanics</a><strong>: </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>this is a test</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, he was surprised when the system allowed his
        change.  We went on to discuss how this could possibly
        work and the trust issues involved. I suggested that he
        would probably waste a fair amount of time reloading the page to see
        if anyone had noticed until it was fixed by someone.
      </p>
      <p>
        He did, but only for about 5 minutes. Then his change was gone,
        which dumbfounded both of us. Now we had another debate: Was the
        change fixed by a reader or a cron script?
      </p>
      <p>
        My hypothesis is that a reader fixed it, and therefore this 
        topic, which seeks to answer the question: <em>How long before some</em>
        Wiki reader sees a change and responds to it?<em>  </em>

        <em>About 5 minutes.</em>
      </p>

        I'll look at <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> quite frequently at times. I've turned some edits around within a minute (judging by <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>) of their being made. If someone is hanging out and hitting <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> or <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> a lot chances are that a destructive edit won't last for very long at all.
      </p>

        <em>Thanks for the story Greg. Here at Wiki, we like to </em><a href="FixBrokenWindows.html">FixBrokenWindows</a>, so allowing everyone to edit is actually what keeps most of our windows fixed, rather than broken.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course there are questions that hang around and might never get a response.
      </p>

        But most open acts of vandalism get repaired within an hour. I just cleaned the <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a> which was misused as a <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a> 39 minutes ago.
