        <strong></strong><a href="SpinBaller.html">SpinBaller</a> is one realisation of <a href="PromotionIsTheProduct.html">PromotionIsTheProduct</a>. I coined this term to refer to people who are focussed on presentation as an end in itself.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to be confused with SpinBowler, a term referring to a game technique.

        <em>Some </em><a href="SpinBaller.html">SpinBaller</a>s graduate to become "Spin Doctors".<em></em>

           <strong> SpinDoctors </strong> perform essential tasks in a world busy with all sorts of unsolicited communications, and are not necessarily evil. It really depends on the objective and the manners the <strong>Spins</strong> are conducted.

        My cricket-loving work colleague tells me TheArtOf<strong>SpinBalling</strong> is a recent-day phenomena, possibly coming from the pervasive nature of reality-TV media in recent decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I certainly agree to that, and wish to add that most younger people, those raised by bottle-fed TV programs, are natural </em><a href="SpinBaller.html">SpinBaller</a>s. They can explain away anything, they worship other people who have a higher level of mastery in this, and lived to believe that this skill alone will carry them through all life situations.<em></em>

      <p>
        Without a deliberate attempt at flaming education institutions, it does appear that the higher education establishments are themselves more focussed in marketing of their capabilities, and less into in the delivery of such.
      </p>
      <p>
        My question is, with everyone doing the spinning (marketing), who does the managing of the slaves in the third world who are into making the tangible things that <a href="SpinBaller.html">SpinBaller</a>s tell people about?
