        Build Loops Yourself

        Pattern: <strong>Build Loops Yourself</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        ...use this pattern when you cannot apply the patterns <a href="UseBuiltInLoops.html">UseBuiltInLoops</a> or <a href="FunctionsForLoops.html">FunctionsForLoops</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Sometimes loops are not simple. Disorientation is unavoidable.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the patterns <a href="UseBuiltInLoops.html">UseBuiltInLoops</a> and <a href="FunctionsForLoops.html">FunctionsForLoops</a> cannot be used, you will need to build loops yourself from low-level constructs. In this case you will need to make the code as understandable as you can by supplying documentation and careful annotation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore,</em> Use the patterns for <a href="SimplyUnderstoodCode.html">SimplyUnderstoodCode</a> as thoroughly as you can to help you write the loop. Write documentation for the code in English and in mathematical notation. Have the code and its design reviewed thoroughly.
      </p>

        This is the difficult case in programming. Read texts like Knuth to understand the trade-offs between efficiency and understandability.

        I don't think this says enough. Maybe something along the lines of EncapsulateLoops?
      </p>
      <p>
        (I've not created a page for this yet partly because I'm not completely happy with the word "loop". I suspect the concept of "iteration" is deeper. A loop is a means, not an end.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you have some data structure like a tree, for which the code to iterate over it is relatively complicated. Try to encapsulate that complication in a class, like the <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> or an <a href="IteratorPattern.html">IteratorPattern</a>. If your language supports closures, use them - write a method which takes a closure argument and invokes it for each iteration of the loop. If not, use inheritance and virtual methods to build CallBackFunction(s), to the same effect. Or (probably better), use the <a href="TemplateMethodPattern.html">TemplateMethodPattern</a> - so that specific iterations are subclasses of the class that holds the iteration logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Smalltalk uses this approach extensively - it has no built-in loops. Java uses iterators plus normal loops (it calls them Enumerations), but there is an argument that this approach is only good in the absence of closures. Eiffel uses the <a href="TemplatePattern.html">TemplatePattern</a> approach.

        (Please correct my links - I don't know where all the patterns are described on this site.)

        I like using an apply where the container is in charge of iteration. This allows the container to control locking without having to worry whether applications behave correctly.
