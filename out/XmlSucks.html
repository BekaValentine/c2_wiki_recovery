        Tedious rather than hard. It takes more time and code to extract the information you want from XML than it does to have the information formatted in flat files. Parsing flat files is easier than processing DOM unless tools are provided.

        <em>Well, this is certainly true. You get an old argument of the virtues of (new thingy) over (old thingy).

        <strong>Because XML is increasingly used for data interchange, it is too easily promoted as a data storage model. XML is only a data encoding format.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not designed as a data storage model, although models can be built on top of it. Compared to older ASN.1 (correction: ASN.1 is really only a language for defining protocols; actually the protocol defined in ASN.1 can use XML as its data transfer format) or GIOP, such XML models suck. Inherent limitations make them unsalvageable. But many folks confuse storage and exchange.
      </p>
      <p>
        XML must be concrete enough for light-weight programs to parse; the same data may be described in many ways, and different XML representations are suitable for different tasks, in opposition to the <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> goal. In contrast the relational model and SQL use a canonical representation not favoring a particular task. In particular, many to many relationships are problematic in XML.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have gone back to the sequential text file model at the expense of the kind of abstraction we gained when moving from COBOL to SQL. If you really want to process data sequentially, COBOL is a far better tool than XSLT applied to XML - but sensible people use SQL. 
      </p>
      <p>
        XML should just be used for transport, and there should be a canonical representation (schema) of the relational model. A simple subset of SQL could be implemented to operate on this representation to allow programmers to extract data. Imagine how much simpler life would be if instead of writing XML parsers, and editing enormous, complex and verbose text files by hand, we had a simple SQL-style interface.

        In fact - I think I'll write one! (that will be easier than XPath and XQuery?)

        <em>Why do people insist on complaining that XML doesn't do this or XML doesn't do that, when XML is just supposed to be a data storage and transport mechanism? And now this comparison to COBOL?</em> <strong>COBOL?!?</strong> <em>Oy, vay!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>XML isn't a database language </em>per se<em>. It is a means of expressing data in a tree structure. If you need flat storage of your data for relational reasons and you don't feel like parsing out an XML file full of relational data items then how about using something other than XML? Although</em> any <em>data</em> can <em>be stored in an XML format; it's just a matter of designing the storage translation in and out. XML reliably transports the stored data for you .</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        XML is a means of storing data in a tree structure and can express relationships. The XML community try to push it far too far. XML databases are a silly idea. XSLT is a silly idea. When you start embedding Java in XML a la Cocoon you know you've gone completely bonkers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have another problem, XML has to be processed by a computer program eventually, be it xslt, java, whatever. Because XML is very concrete and highly non-canonical it introduces a very strong coupling between the actual representation chosen and the processing program, to which I object. You cannot change your XML DTD to optimize a particular task without having to rewrite all your existing programs. I don't think this has really hit home yet - but it will. It is going to cause BIG problems. SQL solves this problem by providing an abstract interface to the data. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My comparison with COBOL was with XSLT, a programming language written in XML for XML, not with XML itself. They are very similar - XML elements correspond to sequential file record types. XML attributes correspond to COBOL data division templates (conceptually at any rate. COBOL is very concrete in its layout of data attributes). COBOL has the great advantage over XSLT that it provides a very clean separation of program from data. In XSLT these are hopelessly confused, which causes much of the difficulty in reading and understanding it.

      <p>
        Ae central fallacy of XML is natural language will convey meaning. It is deceptively easy to develop language that appears sufficient but allows disastrous semantics. Rely on the DTD/schema for syntax. If XML conforms to a schema it will pass muster through the validating parser. The value is then a syntactically legitimate value for that entity, and I can probably use it appropriately.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Syntactically correct phrases in any language can hold semantic gibberish. What's the difference between a bicycle?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When poor schema allow illegitimate values for a particular entity it doesn't matter what name you put on it, it's still going to get buggered up. XML depends on Schema to really offer protection against that sort of thing.</em>

        <em>XML represents just a tree with attribute name/attribute value associative arrays.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh boy like we haven't had that already. Cut all the angled brackets verbosity and that is what you essentially get: a tree with named nodes. The novelty before our eyes is that it is textual representation and node names got our brains in such frenzy that we thought "oh gee we finally have data representation we can all understand and agree on semantics!". 
      </p>
      <p>
        No we don't. In some projects I participated in even xml schema was not enough to express just type semantics and what is allowed where, namely that some attributes in parent nodes excluded some attributes in child nodes, depending on semantics of an item.
      </p>
      <p>
        YAML with schema would be semantic equivalent of XML, and much easier to read, parse and understand. About the only (limited) value in XML is just that: a schema, allowing to do SOME validation of the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantics of the data is left undefined, though, which is nowhere near enough: your understanding of "due_tax" attribute in "taxpayer" node might be very well different from mine. What XML represents is trivial, and what would be very useful to represent XML can't represent.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>XML should not have values in nodes, only attributes</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction between value and attributes complicates parsing and code in a completely unnecessary manner. Could you not have just __value attribute, restricted like a keyword?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>XML does not have predefined attributes</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        General structure of XML is trivial for any programmer to pass around, using say JSON or YAML.
      </p>
      <p>
        What it could contribute but doesn't would be predefined attributes, so we could all around entire world understand and agree on what say "EBITDA" in XML entity "company" meant without negotiating in small areas, like finance, without creating myriad dialects and incomplete schemas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideal, if not overcomplicated solution, would be to make those attributes inheritable in OO manner or tunable in other way, so we could distinguish between "EBITDA" attribute as proper in say Nevada/US, or Germany/EU.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main value of XML is contributing a bit of semantics to a tree structure, but it's way too little value for cost it imposes.

      </p>
      <p>
        "I don't like that this language doesn't restrict people's behavior". S-exps give you the freedom to label elements by names, or not to do so. You are assumed to be an intelligent human being who can design the most convenient representation for your data. There is this concept called context, okay? Context is very helpful in that it gives rise to concise, clear expressions of meaning, if the receiver is only willing to keep a little bit of state and do a little bit of work. Intelligent humans can handle contexts without effort. When I open my dresser in the morning, I don't need every element therein to be labelled as a <sock></sock> or <briefs></briefs>. These objects have a recognizable form, and additionally the dresser establishes a context for their interpretation. I don't care that these objects don't mean anything to someone who has never seen a pair of socks or a dresser.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor do you pretend that labelling the socks will define them for someone who has never seen feet. Meaning depends on usage. The danger of XML is that two clients may assume their usage is the same when it isn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, that is a problem. Just as when binary data is transferred over a network, both ends must agree on the byte order and size of the data. XML can't address that particular issue; that problem is higher up. All XML can do is make certain that the elements are labeled and that their data complies with the DTD/schema. Remember, XML just moves the data around for you without adding, deleting, or changing anything. It's up to you to use the data appropriately when it gets to its destination.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        XML can be overkill when your data doesn't have a deep hierarchical structure. If a Windows-style INI file (sections containing name=value pairs) suffices, use that. If you need more hierarchical structure, or you don't mind markup clutter, use XML. Visually reading "<a href="FooBar.html">FooBar</a>=6" is easier than reading "<<a href="FooBar.html">FooBar</a>>6</<a href="FooBar.html">FooBar</a>>".

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        XML doesn't even have a standard way to handle whitespace or newlines. This really should be in the language specification, but it's not. Every XML parser I've seen has had to have 10 different options for the different ways to parse XML.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>XML isn't perfect, but the statement above is definitely false; XML has extremely precise rules for whitespace (it all, without exception, must be presented to the reading program exactly as it appears in the document) and newlines (any instances of \n, \r\n, or \r must be presented to the program as \n). You may not like the rules, but they exist and are precise.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That also makes it extremely difficult to round-trip XML. Consider how you would attach a digital signature to an XML document: serialize the document, build the signature, then stick the document and the signature into a "container" document and send the container. On the receiving side, parse the "container" and extract the signature, and then re-serialize the document to generate a comparison signature. If your two XML implementations follow slightly different de/serialization rules, you'll get different text and the signatures won't match. </em>Oddly enough<em>, Ron Rivest (of RSA fame) submitted an IETF draft for S-Expressions back in 1997 (</em><a href="http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sexp.txt)">http://theory.lcs.mit.edu/~rivest/sexp.txt)</a> that defines a canonical serialized representation for data.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a canonicalized format for XML, and perfect roundtripping is not necessary, because it is irrelevant whether unnecessary whitespace is preserved or order of attributes is preserved. "Good-enough" (tm) roundtripping is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with this draft is that it is, in my opinion, the worst of both worlds. You can including arbitrary binary data in a document so it's hard to view in a text editor, but it still uses a verbose syntax that is only necessary if you want to edit it in a text editor. I think if size or parsing speed is so important that you can't properly escape your binary data you should use an all binary format. Possibly one with separate headers, so you don't even have to store the structure with the data. See above for my choice - Scheme R^5 minus some things.

        Could someone comment on why people want to use a markup language as a standard for data representation. It really doesn't make sense to me. Programmers and people think in things like sets, lists, trees, dictionaries and tables. XML can represent these, but I haven't seen a nice way to do it. The only thing I've seen XML do nicely is markup documents.

           Not necessarily exclusively. People may think "in trees" (for example), but often we need a <em>textual</em> (notational) representation of a tree because it's hard to prepare and feed images or diagrams to computers. So far XML seems more popular than the alternative textual notations for such. I suppose it is ArgumentByPopularity, but sometimes that's the easiest way to measure <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> issues, and representation is generally a <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> issue. -t

        ...etc. There are lots of flexible ways in which the data can be designed and communicated via XML. The whole argument about verbosity is a <a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>; XML is <em>not</em> supposed to be storage space efficient -- it is supposed to represent data in a means that humans and automata can both read effectively and use by translating into more efficient forms.

        <em>Yes, that is what a printed notation for data is supposed to do. But XML is a failure in achieving these goals.</em>

      <p>
        Oh? And exactly how is XML a "failure" at expressing data? It certainly has nothing to do with the printed expression, since the XML data needs to be run through an XSLT or something to be put into user-defined format.

        My conjecture is that XML dialects are going to include abstractions for conditionals (if/then/else) and iterations (for/while/repeat) - or they most probably already do. So when you read in XML fragments and evaluate those constructs, you are actually writing an interpreter for a programming language. Except that you write your interpreter in a different language (say, Java or Smalltalk) than the source language (your XML dialect). And you need to take care of parsing, internal representations, namespaces, and so forth. In Lisp, you just write a bunch of macros and functions, and you're done. This new set of macros and functions is just another set of sexprs, so afterwards you can even create another level on top of them, for example checkers that check for the correctness of your macros, program transformations that weave in treatment of multithreading, security restrictions, and so on, whatever you need. And guess what, all these layers can be compiled into machine language by Lisp compilers, instead of being executed by dumb interpreters written in Java, or other languages that artificially distinguish between code and data. (Yes, the distinction between data and code is an artificial one, inside a computer there is no such distinction. That's where the power of computers really comes from. Lisp is the only language that gives you this power directly, without artificial boundaries, and in a very usable and easily comprehensible way. Sexprs might be harder to read than traditional languages at first, but they are relatively easy to comprehend when taking the power into account that they give you.)

        XML seems to be too verbose an unwieldy to be a universal document format. Programmers hate it because it's hard to parse, and users hate it because it's too verbose. It is good as a markup language, but I don't think it's good as a universal document format. If you try to represent a database table in XML you end up with junk. It has so much markup that you can't see the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm neutral on this issue, but is XML designed to be hand-written from scratch? I've only seen it (in real life as opposed to on this wiki) in the context of </em><a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> .plist files, and some archived objects on that system. For human-parsing, it may be a bit simpler than sexprs, if only because each field is named. But then, I think the old NeXtStep .plists are easy to read, too, and I'm quite ignorant of Lisp, Scheme, and the like, so... take this for what it's worth. -- <a href="JoeOsborn.html">JoeOsborn</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> .plist files are a perfect example of the unbelievable stupidity of XML. Take the terminal application for example. The background opaqueness can be configured as a floating point number, something like <double>0.4</double>. But a property that is a list of values, like colors or whatever, is just stupid text, like <list>0.1 0.9 ...</list>. Doh! The XML has failed to capture the list as a real object; as a result, the program which reads the .plist must do its own tokenization to extract the elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Don't confuse bad use of XML with XML. I agree it's braindead to include data that must be further parsed. The list should be composed of items. But they didn't have to do it that way and shouldn't have.</em> -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's impossible not to include data that doesn't have to be further parsed, because at the leaf level, every piece of XML datum is just an unstructured text string. To extract what you want from that, you are on your own.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ahh, but the element name tells you what the element quantity or property is </em>in context,<em> so you can convert the parsed string into the proper native format without fear. Also, since you've already run the XML data through your validating parser and compared it to the DTD/schema, you know the data is legit.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Converting a text into a native format has a name: lexical analysis and parsing. But you already ran the data through an XML parser. So in fact, the XML processing software has not done the full job; it only did half of the parsing, leaving still more work to do. Now who or what determines the grammar for this remaining parsing task? And does the DTD validate *that* grammar as well? Can the DTD specify a check that a floating point number is a digit sequence with an optional period, an optional exponent with an E or e followed by an optional sign and digit sequence? Does XML specify the semantics of such a constant?

      <p>
        We *are* talking about the same level of data transfer. My original challenge is in that context. There's no good reason for an end-user to read XML files. If data is intended for an end-user, [write software to] present it. If data needs no end-user examination use a software-friendly format. When end-users want to view data intended for software, use the same software to present it in a human-friendly format. Configuration files are a perfect example. They should be read and written by software that obeys the rules for those actions. If the software needs names in the config file that's its business.

        What's missing here is the existence of good XML editors. XML is at least programmer-readable, and there are good XML editors out there, so you don't have to write the GUI yourself.

When your users want to look at the data in a spreadsheet, <a href="CommaSeparatedValues.html">CommaSeparatedValues</a> is a good choice.

        <strong>There's no good reason for a human to read XML files.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would argue the reverse. There are only files that matter to humans. Very few of us have the luxury of a custom application to create and manage structured data. So that leaves a human doing it by hand. And XML works well enough to that purpose. There are files that only applications touch and then it doesn't matter. The conclusion then is that all files must be human editable and understandable.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the file is for humans-only, what is the benefit of using XML? Why not write it in natural language or outline form?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because the file is for humans talking to a program. This doesn't mean that the program creates the file or stores its data in the same file.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So you're advocating XML as a user interface? Eek. What programs are these that can only accept input in XML format?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Many programs do not have user interfaces and/or allow substantial configuration for which there is no gui component.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because they have better things to do than provide a useless gui for doing something that is very easy in a configuration file. You can concentrate on the functionality of the system rather then the interface. Most commercial apps are certainly gui-based, but many in-house apps and tools are configuration-based.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any GUI that prevents a human from having to edit XML can't be labeled "useless".
      </p>
      <p>
        [Sure it can. Time spent making a GUI that serves only as a front-end to a configuration subsystem is time better spent elsewhere.]
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn't make it useless, it just makes XML costs higher. The problem with XML for human input is that it grew out of text markup, where the markup noise was small (i.e., a smallish percentage of the total text was markup). See LaTeX for an example where this works beautifully. Using XML for arbitrary data vastly inflates this noise, and makes it a real pain in the ass to work with or read. So you need to create infrastructure to deal with it. To tie in with other parts of this page, of course the same could be done with s-exprs, with less overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>GUIs are cheap. User time and effort is expensive. Forcing users to hand edit XML is an insult.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        GUIs are often very platform dependent. GUIs can be a maintenance sink during rapid change. An incomplete or out-of-date GUI can be worse than useless. GUIs are hard to test. GUIs require a graphical infrastructure, bitmapped display, etc. {In other words: GUIs are not cheap.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Text editors are effectively ubiquitous. Over the years people have developed effective, efficient ways of editing plain text on everything from serial terminals, character-only-displays and resource-constrained devices to every form of fancy graphical UI.
      </p>
      <p>
        [So don't use a GUI. But don't use XML either. There are much better alternatives.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please don't discount the simplicity and familiarity of editing marked up text, just because you have access to some GUIs in your situation.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Editing XML is anything but simple or familiar. If the structure is flat, it's more cumbersome than a simple properties file. If the structure is deep, it's hard to navigate.

        <em>I am </em>NoGreatMind, yet I find XML trivial to use and edit. In a minute, I can create a file and use it in my program. That's pretty good. I don't know what is much better than that. But I am a pragmatist.<em></em>

      <p>
        I am a GreatMind and I find XML needlessly complex. Its reason for existing (mixing schema with data) has no value. Schema alone doesn't mean diddly without something to act upon that schema.

      </p>
      <p>
        You don't have to look for closing parenthesis if you have a text editor that does it for you. I am guessing you could write a script for emacs to do this for you, .. not sure, someone clarify this please for me. Unless using notepad, or using some simple lame editor is worth the effort, just so you can brag about it to people. Many times, I lose my place in thought and need my editor to find the parenthesis for me. This should be done by a computer, not a human brain. Take the load off your brain so you can focus on more important things, like more coding rather than tedious work.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other option, if you still can't find that parenthesis (or if you say have so many parenthesis, that you are still confused, or you made a mistake) is just to make a comment after the parenthesis.. i.e:
      </p>
      <code>
        <?script<br/>
        --some code--<br/>
        {		// open of 1st parenth!<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        --some code--<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        {		// open of 2nd parenth!<br/>
        --some code--<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        }		// close of 1st parenth!<br/>
        }		// close of 2nd parenth!<br/>
        script?><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then do a simple search for the parenth you are trying to find...i.e. search for "close of first" using your text editor's find option. In fact I'm wondering why notepad even has a find function, why not just forget the whole find function, keep notepad simple. Notepad doesn't have a parenthesis matching tool, but it has a find function...how silly, let's remove the find utility in notepad, it's too much.

        LISP is my favorite language. But I'm also an XML fan.
      </p>
      <p>
        S-expressions are powerful, in some ways more powerful than XML. I have designed quite a few data file formats using S-expression like notation, particularly when using the LISP reader was an option. Have you ever tried doing text processing in LISPy S-expressions? I have - I coded a TeX like language in S-expressions. At first, I actually used LISP, but it was FAR too verbose...far too much quoting was needed. And that is what I think the key difference between S-expressions and XML is: XML is a text mainly language, where quoting is not required by default, whereas S-expressions are a language where the text is secondary, See the mention of S-expressions on my own wiki page, <a href="http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Non-XML_Data_Formats,">http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?Non-XML_Data_Formats,</a> in addition to the other pages I mention here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recognize that XML is verbose. In 
        <a href="http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?A_Modest_Proposal_For_Evolving_Lighter_Than_XML_Data_Formats">http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?A_Modest_Proposal_For_Evolving_Lighter_Than_XML_Data_Formats</a> I propose how line oriented data file formats be evolved towards XML and/or S-expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider S-expressions and XML almost equivalent. I personally plan to use either, depending on whatever is needed. See <a href="http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?XML-Like_Data_Formats">http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?XML-Like_Data_Formats</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, whoever said the following were equivalent
      </p>
      <code>
        XML: <foo><integer>3</integer><string>abc</string></foo><br/>
        S-exp: (3 "abc")<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        does not know the formal logic theory behind S-expressions: the proper S-expression equivalent is
      </p>
      <code>
        S-exp: (foo 3 "abc")<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Yes, LISP has some implicit primitive datatypes, but if we are going to talk about typing we must be explicit. there are flavours of S-expression based languages that don't, yielding
      </p>
      <code>
        S-exp: (foo (integer "3") (string "abc"))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <code>
        S-exp: (foo (integer 3) (string abc))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Don't give LISP the advantage of positional parameters if you are not willing to give the same to XML tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This isn't about positional parameters, it's about XML's inability to express one number and one string in any other way than <number>42</number><string>foo</string>, while with S-expressions you can simply use 42 "foo". Sure, we could use (number 42) (string "foo"), but that would be completely pointless and redundant; comparable to <number><number-data>42</number-data></number><string><string-data>foo</string-data></string>.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am willing to give XML "the advantage of positional parameters," whatever that is. Now please show me how XML can use it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, I will. We did this at my work (just using XML for the already available parser):
      </p>
      <code>
        <xml><action><param/><param/></action><action> ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Rearranging the action tags had an effect on the order in which they were executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yeeeeah, that's because you didn't identify one action from another. If the actions were supposed to be order sensitive then you needed some way to convey that in the transport. Adding an element or attribute like order="1" would have cured that problem.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, XML has one significant notational convenience over LISP: the angle bracket tag notation allows the creation of arbitrary numbers of superbrackets. I allude briefly to this in <a href="http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SuperBrackets-ProvidingMissingClosingTags.">http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SuperBrackets-ProvidingMissingClosingTags.</a> Now, I admit that superbrackets are not legal XML; they are just implied by the tag notation; I don't think superbrackets are legal in any modern LISP, but they were a great convenience when they were present, but I think they have died out mainly because (a) of smart editors, and (b) they weren't scalable with the small set of brackets in the character set. XML's tags have solved the latter problem, and <a href="http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SuperBrackets-ProvidingMissingClosingTags">http://glew.dyndns.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?SuperBrackets-ProvidingMissingClosingTags</a> describes at least one situation where superbrackets are still nice to have.

        Well, some times you end up reinventing one.. but some times you end up using a database in a situation where you don't need one. Just look at an INI file. Why would you use a database in that situation? With an INI file, are you reinventing a database? Surely not. 
        Of course if you DO need a database, and you have a valid situation where you need one, at least use a proper tool (<a href="PhpMyAdminSucks.html">PhpMyAdminSucks</a>).
        Sometimes a database costs you more time and bandwidth. Let's take for example an FAQ page that you need to make. You won't need anyone interacting with the FAQ page..Maybe people interacting with the webpage, but not so far as you needing a database (say people need to search the FAQ). So it isn't dynamic enough for you to fire up the heavy bloated database. But you still want to be updating this FAQ frequently yourself, you want it easy to manage, and you want to be able to search the file with less code than when using a database. With a simple text file using {question} and {answer}, you would search for the latter with Regexes, using say "eregi" in php. Whereas with a database, way too much overboard just to make an easy to manage FAQ page. A database requires you connect to the database, manage the database, create the database, create fields, write tons of code just to do a simple thing, etc. etc...all for just a simple FAQ page?
      </p>
      <p>
        Just make a text file like:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{question 1}</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>This is question 1?</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{answer 1}</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>This is answer 1.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{question 2}</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>This is question 2?</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{answer 2}</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>This is answer 2.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Then search the text file with "eregi" for instances of {question 1} ... and print it accordingly, on your webpage. And there you have it. You needed a database for your FAQ, but you made an easier to manage one without the bloat of having to use a database. Sometimes You don't need all the garbage that a database has. Imagine having to create all the tables, fields, in a database, then having to access this database (using a hard to get around, slow annoying web interface like phpmyadmin.. or using a proper but still CPU heavy offline database GUI tool.. then writing all those lines of code just to connect and check the database.. Just for a plain and simple page like an FAQ) You waste all that time with the database.. You have to create fields and specify all the primary key, etc. All you need is a simple database... but there isn't one out there, since databases are meant to be complex. So you use a text file .. and this text file can be edited easily even in a spreadsheet if you really wanted to speed things up.
        If you wanted to add information to the FAQ, you'd just go into the text file and add more questions and answers.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{question 3}</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>This is question 3?</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>{answer 3}</dd>

        I might even need to go as far as writing a regular expression just to find what I'm looking for in the XML. It's not laid out like a database is, where you just pinpoint what you need to edit (i.e. an INI file).

I am typing from a Pentium 1 computer, and java won't work on a Pentium one computer.. so java is not platform independent (i.e. work in a reasonable fashion)]
      </p>

        It almost is so slow I'd rather take the time to write a parser myself. Writing a parser isn't that hard for a simple application.. for a complex one, then fine.

        Why do I have to look up an XML library, why can't I just find a website that allows me to download parsers (if this isn't available, who says it couldn't be.. we don't HAVE to conform to XML and what they've started).

        <em>Granted, this is a well-known problem with high-markup-density XML.</em>
      </p>

        You could just use bookmarks, and ditch the xml all together? Why have the markup inside the actual language, when you could just have the mark ups externally in a bookmark or class?

      <p>
        <em>What do you mean by "bookmark" and "class"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I was being a bit vague when I used those phrases, sorry.
        I think the idea is that people fear corruption of the file or something - things like bookmarks or references in a text editor (a class browser) are simple ways of organizing things without embedding any text in the file. Look at RTF. The last time someone manually hacked or read their RTF file without proper software to read it? I'm not saying RTF files are a replacement for XML, I am just saying there is no real reason to continue to want to embed mark up within the file - keep it separate and let software organize like an RTF file or like those 'squares' in a database or cell reader program do. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The funny thing is, I've had so many applications crash that use XML with the following error message: 'While reading XML blah blah is corrupt'. One example is Trillian.. not sure what other software, but I have seen it numerous times.

        XML doesn't scale well. The redundancy in the tags have, in my experience, produced up to a factor of 5 of bloat. Now take a nice 20MB flat file, add XML and ship it. And while you can compress, the bloat is still a factor of 5 or more, making it useless for large scale data transfer. Only good for small data packets.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"XML doesn't scale well." Hah, hah. Yeah, that's good. Please tell this to the SQL people who use multi-hundred megabyte .sql files to replicate their data. XML is actually </em>smaller<em> to reproduce a lot of those databases.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds like a case of a stupid programmer or DBA using a hammer when they should be using a screwdriver. XML however *forces* the bloat on you. In the case you cite lack of skill causes the user to *choose* bloat. I still find XML horribly wasteful of memory and bandwidth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Under what conditions?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any conditions. Bloat is bloat and I find it offensive. In my case I am using multi GB databases and I cannot overlook the bloat. The examples above are toys in comparison to what I do, but they are still bloated. It has been suggested by some that XML is part of a conspiracy by memory (including disk) and network gear manufacturers to force you to upgrade. And while I am at it, DOM parsers are dumb, dumb, dumb. The ones I have seen have processed entire document not only by slurping it into memory but by parsing it recursively. Once we sent an XML file to a client who tried to open it using a DOM parser and imagine their surprise when they locked up their system. We switched to flat files shortly there after. To be fair SAX parsers do stream processing, and so avoid this problem. But it is still inefficient.

      </p>
      <p>
        Except when you want to know what data are in each delimiter or handling nested data.
        You also need to encode commas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Both protocols have some encoding problems. With comma-delimited, generally you put quotes around strings with commas in them.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Notice I did NOT say commas, I said delimiters. Use what works (tabs, semi-colons, unprintable ascii characters). Also in the past I have done things like <fieldname>:<type>:<value> which can be used like </em><strong>first_name:string:Wolfgang</strong><em> solving the above problem. SO instead of giving a downstream user a DTD you send them an equivalent map defining the structure of the data. Same result, less bloat. I suspect (though have not proven) that this is logically identical to XML, just fewer tags.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The comma point I agree with.. why use commas as a delimiter? Use commas as the delimiter only if the text you are working with does not contain commas.

        There could even be a dedicated "CSV" key on the keyboard, specifically for delimiting text. <em>(The </em><a href="AsciiCode.html">AsciiCode</a> already has these separator characters; see <a href="TabDelimitedTables.html">TabDelimitedTables</a>.)<em> Who says we can't change the keyboard standard? I feel far to much time is wasted during coding "pretending" something is something (pretending comma is a delimiter, when in fact there should be a dedicated delimiter key available). People that heavily use </em><a href="CommaSeparatedValues.html">CommaSeparatedValues</a> could optionally go to the store and buy a keyboard with the "Separator" keys on it. Grandma and pop who never touch or see CSV, or know what CSV is, could stick to using their old keyboard.

        <em>There actually are 4 dedicated ASCII control characters intended for delimiting. I have never, ever, seen them used. Still, that would require some keyboard mangling to get the imaginary characters, but the functionality was planned decades ago. -- </em><a href="MartinZarate.html">MartinZarate</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a hardware issue sometimes, or a "current standard" issue. But at some point, there must be a change when we constantly need something and it isn't there (a dedicated delimit character - what would be wrong with one?). Far too often software programmers spend a lot of their time pretending by faking by substituting.
      </p>
      <p>
        One could argue that there are already enough keys and combinations on the keyboard.. so we just don't need another key. The problem is, there is a point in which hardware should be upgraded.. you can't have 6 alt keys and 2 regular keys, for example, and be efficient when typing English.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generally speaking, I think there should be a dedicated delimit character. <em>(There are four of them; see </em><a href="TabDelimitedTables.html">TabDelimitedTables</a>.)<em> A keyboard with a delimit key on it is not required for people who just rarely use </em><a href="CommaSeparatedValues.html">CommaSeparatedValues</a>, but still use it: just the character should be available to them.

        The advantages of XML are not in its size, efficient form, etc., but rather in its cross platform format. That is what XML was designed for. So that multiple platforms/products could exchange data in a format that was understood by all. It's that plain and simple.

        It seems all of the linux applications I am using do not use XML setup files. The configuration files and data files that <a href="GnuLinux.html">GnuLinux</a> uses are very easy to read. It seems all the files I need to adjust are easy to adjust since there is no XML in the way. I am happy that <a href="GnuLinux.html">GnuLinux</a> has easy to read and configure files all over the place and has not adopted Xml.

        Why do we have such things called "datafeeds" on the net, who transfer data via XML? Sure, I can see datafeeds as extremely useful if they were only in data format. But people keep saying XML isn't for data (and I agree). They are really missing something here (people on the net). Why not CSV feeds, or SQL feeds? Or <em>real</em> data feeds. I know the current short answer would be: because not everyone uses SQL, and CSV has some limitations. That doesn't determine XML the answer for data transport!
      </p>
      <p>
        People won't agree on a common database file format, with more options and versatility than CSV? I suggest a new standard that allows comments along with structured data (versatile comments, but not forced markup). CSV is pure data with no comments, and sometimes data doesn't need comments. The column's headers are enough. Some times it does need extra comments, and CSV doesn't offer that. So don't stop right there at CSV and just give up. I don't like overly marked up data, when all I want to do is parse someone's inventory or someone's web data (which is obviously square in format and doesn't need much markup or description. But when it does need an additional description or comment, then fine. But don't force markup on me). 
      </p>
      <p>
        During transport of data, you don't need to transport the comments.. with XML, you do. With a data format that is designed for data, comments can be held in a separate column or file. In XML, the whole markup is transported together with the data, and then has to be parsed. Not efficient - even if computers are getting faster with more wattage (but electricity is getting more expensive). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, um, actually efficiency isn't the point, as has been stated about umpty-fourteen times previously. Not only that, but you can have additive XML descriptions for the same entity, like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        <SomeEntity><br/>
        <SomeAttribute><br/>
        SomeValue<br/>
        </SomeAttribute><br/>
        </SomeEntity><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <SomeEntity><br/>
        <SomeOtherAttribute><br/>
        SomeOtherValue<br/>
        </SomeOtherAttribute><br/>
        </SomeEntity><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When the day is ended the attributes can total up to a single entity. If you don't want to use some particular feature then don't bother describing it.

        <strong>Source file diffing problems</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yeah, you can't diff the XML source round trip, that's for sure. However, you can always diff the parsed tree, so that's what you should do. Eh? Because, after all, you aren't interested in the XML representation of the data, but the data itself. Diff before XML encoding and after XML decoding. Problem solved.

        In <a href="MathMl.html">MathMl</a>, the situation is still poorer than in the rest of the XML world. People are misusing MathML in rather alarming ways. All the hype around the new "cool technology" is forcing people to download and install special fonts and plugins, use browsers with MathML native support, declare "special" mime types and change the rest of the document from HTML to XHTML (for using the XHTML 1.1 + MathML 2.0 DTD).
      </p>
      <p>
        All cool and promising at the beginning. At the end, the final MathML code served on the Internet is ultraverbose (of order of 10-20 times more than similar code in other languages), not accessible and even wrong. For example, Distler is using MathML in his "advanced" blog for encoding [2s ds] whereas visually rendering the square of ds "thanks" to MathML and the rest of XML hype.
      </p>
      <p>
        After of obtaining specially designed fonts and plugins, developing DTDs, browser layers, four specifications, and special tools for editing code, we finalize observing as an <strong>old piece of HTML code</strong> <SPAN>ds</SPAN><SUP>2</SUP> <strong>is more correct, more accessible, and effective</strong> in practice!
      </p>
      <p>
        XML hype really sucks, with things as XSL-FO, Schemas, namespaces, or MathML being a complete disaster for most tasks.

        "Working copy performance improvements (client)
        The way in which the Subversion client manages your working copy has undergone radical changes. The .svn/entries file is no longer XML, and the client has become smarter about the way it manages and stores property metadata.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, there are substantial performance improvements. The new working copy format allows the client to more quickly search a working copy, detect file modifications, manage property metadata, and deal with large files. The overall disk footprint is smaller as well, with fewer inodes being used. Additionally, a number of long standing bugs related to merging and copying have been fixed."

        <strong>XML is verbose and brings nothing new</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated above, there is no advantage of human readability when the XML file gets big. In fact, XML brings hardly anything new. ASN.1 (<a href="AbstractSyntaxNotationOne.html">AbstractSyntaxNotationOne</a>) or XDR (ExternalDataRepresentation) have the same hierachical structure, are binary and compact, actually very compact if ASN.1 Packed Encoding rules are used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that few editors will show the matching tag makes XML hard to edit.

      <p>
        Especially for machine to machine communications a human readable format is ridiculous.

        Hi, just a simple question, I'm not a programmer but do have the misfortune of having to read XML as text far too often, this is because so many manufacturers use it as the output format for system controller logs. I am a SAN engineer and find the lack of any parsers readily available to be very fraustrating, so come on chaps. Someone out there is coding these systems to output log files in XML, who's going to code the application that makes that output actually useful?
