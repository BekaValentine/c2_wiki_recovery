        Domain Knowledge
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the most under-appreciated skills that programmers (and members of other professions as well) have; and a key reason why programmers aren't commodities. <em>Domain knowledge</em> is expertise in a particular problem area - especially problems which aren't the primary concern of a computer science curriculum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of important areas of domain knowledge that can help land you a job:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Accounting systems
        </li>
        <li>
           Desktop publishing
        </li>
        <li>
           Graphics and multimedia
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many cases, <a href="DomainKnowledge.html">DomainKnowledge</a> can be very company- or site-specific, i.e.:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Knowledge of the accounting systems and procedures in place at <a href="GeneralElectric.html">GeneralElectric</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Knowledge of how to write plugins for Adobe <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Expertise in designing codecs supporting the MPEG standard.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Generally, skills in a particular programming language (or programming skills in general) <em>aren't</em> considered a problem domain. Some computer topics are legitimate problem domains of their own, which one might acquire DomainExpertise in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming language design/compiler design. (A programmer who is skilled at writing code in Java wouldn't be considered a "Java domain expert". One who is skilled at implementing <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a>s, on the other hand, might be.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Database design
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In general, domain expertise is hard to come by (which is why it is so valuable). True domain expertise requires both a considerable amount of study in the topic (formal or informal), and a considerable amount of experience in design and implementation. One doesn't read the RedDragon and become an expert in compilers; but if one reads the RedDragon (and a few others) and works on GCC or a commercial compiler for a few years, one could start to claim domain expertise.
