        A variation of the <a href="BondageAndDisciplineLanguage.html">BondageAndDisciplineLanguage</a> first observed due to usage of <a href="TheOnionRouter.html">TheOnionRouter</a>.

        This pattern describes the constraints imposed upon networking code which runs over <a href="TheOnionRouter.html">TheOnionRouter</a>. One constraint is that strong authentication measures and cryptography have to be used when communicating because anyone can control an exit node and intercept the traffic. Furthermore, <a href="BondageAndDisciplineNetworking.html">BondageAndDisciplineNetworking</a> leads to code with very low communication complexity because of the high lags.

        <a href="BondageAndDisciplineNetworking.html">BondageAndDisciplineNetworking</a> can help building fairly robust networking solutions.
