        Local Variables Reassigned Above Their Uses

      <p>
        Pattern: <strong>Local Variables Reassigned Above their Uses</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        ...this pattern helps complete the <a href="SimplyUnderstoodCode.html">SimplyUnderstoodCode</a>
        pattern. This pattern helps solve the problem of making code
        understandable when you need to re-assign their values.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           * *
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes a piece of code needs to re-assign local variables more
        than once. If this is done without paying attention to a person
        reading the code who is unfamiliar with it, misunderstandings are
        easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a piece of code requires that a local variable have its value
        changed several times, perhaps in a loop. When this happens the
        problem is how to signal which use or reference of the variable goes
        with which assignment. In cases of complex control structure, there
        might be no way to have each reference or use correspond to exactly
        one assignment.
      </p>
      <p>
        People normally read code from top to bottom, so their inclination is
        to recall the assignment that is textually above the reference or use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, if the code is complex, it will be difficult to understand
        and the code chunk ought to be well-documented other ways than by
        making the code plain, though it rarely hurts to do both.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore,</em> A local variable that must be re-assigned should be re-assigned in a
        place that is textually above where it is used or referenced.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           * *
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes a local variable that is re-assigned could be turned into
        two variables where each assignment is actually a definition of a
        local variable, one inside the scope of the other. This is preferable
        to assigning twice. See pattern <a href="AssignVariablesOnce.html">AssignVariablesOnce</a>.
