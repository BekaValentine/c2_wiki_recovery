        This is the one I'd personally like to write -- <a href="LaurentBossavit.html">LaurentBossavit</a>

        Well, looking back on my present and soon-to-be former position, the book I would be writing now would be "XpNotAdopted, Turning Your Back On Success In Spite Of Starting With The Best Intentions". I'm not sure this would be interesting to anyone; nobody likes downers. Hopefully someone will have beaten me to it by the time I finally achieve the requisite qualifications.
