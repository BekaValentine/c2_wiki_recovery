        Remote Procedure Call
      </h1>
      <p>
        A remote procedure call (RPC) is like any other procedure call, except it is, well, remote. There is some distance between end points. The ideal is that aside from a potential time delay, the behavior differences are zero.

      <p>
        RPCs provide <a href="SynchronousCommunication.html">SynchronousCommunication</a> as opposed to AsynchronousCommunication.
