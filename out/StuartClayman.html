        I am now showing PhilipCostello wiki as it looks like a great idea
        for collaborative working in many areas of business, not just Patterns.

        <em>Doctor </em><a href="StuartClayman.html">StuartClayman</a> of UCL to his friends. Long before I knew him Stuart taught the <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> to his dear wife as a way of introducing her, as an artist, to programming. Strangely they remain very happily married. In fact Stuart is one of the best communicators, one to one, on how to write good software that I've ever had the fortune to work with. I am hoping to interview his father one day on <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a> about his amazing premonitions on the fall of the Berlin Wall. But that's another story. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>
