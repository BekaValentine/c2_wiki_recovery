        <em>I would have to say that the jury is out on the breakdown size, but it is a case of when not if. As for organic movement, maybe, maybe not. The roles may also happen spontaneously to different people at different times. I expect you are right in the main but the roles can change for specific moments during development. -- </em><a href="TomAyerst.html">TomAyerst</a><em></em>

        Okay, but when speaking of methodologies and process aren't you looking for the major trends rather than the exceptions? -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        <em>Often yes, but many of the most interesting findings come from minor offshoots. That is, after all where paradigm shifts usually start. -- ta (I could use twa but I might get mistaken for an airline :-)</em>

        I'm not sure I disagree but I'm not sure I agree either. I've often viewed paradigm shifts as allowing people to do what they have always wanted to but have been prevented to by existing conventions. I often see a paradigm shift as the result of freeing us up to do the most natural thing. This is different than a fringe case. -- rd

        We all know the rules for success in our business or professions, yet we also know that these rules--paradigms--can change at any time. What Joel Barker does in Paradigms: The Business of Discovering the Future is explain how to spot <a href="ParadigmShift.html">ParadigmShift</a>s, how they unfold, and how to profit from them. Through the power of this method--paradigm spotting--you can:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           find the people in your organization most likely to spot a new trend
        </li>
        <li>
           help your key people adept when a massive change is occurring
        </li>
        <li>
           learn to effectively grapple with your "intractable problems" and improve your results incalculably.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, Paradigms is full of concrete examples of paradigm shifts and predictions for the future, and contains a new introduction detailing recent developments and pointing out areas to watch for paradigm shifts.

        Joel Barker also has some videos which provide a good discussion of these ideas.
