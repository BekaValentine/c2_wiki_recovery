      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="AmygdalasMicrocode.html">AmygdalasMicrocode</a><strong> refers to the fact that the fight-or-flight response is pre-rational, and to overcome this kneejerk-response mechanism (evolved in a previous era <em>for survival</em>) </strong><a href="EnlightenedMen.html">EnlightenedMen</a> must endeavor to reprogram their own brain at the lowest level.

        From the factory the code seems to be roughly
      </p>
      <code>
        (flash (stimulus) (bewilderment (panic (error (return 1)))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and the improved version approximately:
      </p>
      <code>
        (flash (stimulus) (bewilderment (wait 5 seconds (return 0))))<br/>
      </code>

      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, actually. Evidence sufficient to me, YMMV: I've gone quite mad on a couple of occasions by confusing pre- and post-rationality, near as I can give an account here.

        What proof can I offer you, Sir??

        Why not simply learn that the response is an instinctual one, and step away from it, instead of this mystical talk of "reprogramming the brain"?

        The mystical talk helps in the reprogramming :-) <em>I see...the better to fleece you with, my dear</em>

        Actually, the real issue is that the behavior change in question has to work on both the rational and non-rational parts of the mind. Certain aspects of it cannot be approached analytically.

        How can this work? <br/>
        Suppose for an instant that It was <br/>
        suddenly adopted and practiced by such "<a href="EnlightenedMen.html">EnlightenedMen</a>" EM. <br/>
        Also assume that kneejerk response mechanism<br/>
        disappeared from this group. <br/>
        Further that they also discover <br/>
        a place or state of <br/>
        isolation and safety. <br/>
        Wouldn't it also be likely that they would be<br/>
        protected by some other mechanism, <br/>
        (geography, physical structure, or technologically developed defense mechanism)? <br/>
        Let us further suppose that their isolation is such that <br/>
        the unenlightened ones UEO, <br/>
        do not know of their existence, <br/>
        or that if they do, <br/>
        they do not care about what <br/>
        the EM are doing in their isolated environment. <br/>
        A question is, could such a status quo continue to exist? <br/>
        And would the EM stay in their own zone, <br/>
        or would they seek to convert the UEO.<br/>
        What would happen if in the process they <br/>
        encountered resistance that changed into hostility and a <br/>
        sort of class warfare between the EM and the UEO. <br/>
        Not to mention the possibility of logistic and population pressures <br/>
        encountered in either zone <br/>
        creating interface destabilization. <br/>
        (Just some questions)<br/>

        I am afraid that the distinction would create an uncomfortable society unless all men became enlightened.
      </p>
      <p>
        (likelihood -> 0)  The alternatives to make it so are also to horrible to consider. Perhaps we should allow enlightenment to grow on its own -- in a well informed and free society.

        I can answer two of your questions I think:

        She returns from isolation, according to her constitution, for the benefit of others. No such schism could possibly evolve. And she doesn't want to convert anybody to her Way. That's futile. Rather she helps the UEO along their own paths.
