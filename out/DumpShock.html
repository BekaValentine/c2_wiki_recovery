        Dump Shock
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DumpShock.html">DumpShock</a> - the stress of rapidly and unexpectedly leaving the <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term actually comes from the <em>ShadowRun</em> table-top role-playing game, but it holds true in the real world. In Shadowrun, it refers to the disorientation you get when somebody unplugs your head from the 'net.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the real world, <a href="DumpShock.html">DumpShock</a> is the disorientation somebody gets when they are in the <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a>, and some external stimulus breaks you out of it.  Such stimuli include somebody coming up behind you and saying something to you, a phone ringing, a dog tugging at your leg, or the power going out.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a>, you often leave the physical world behind. When I am there, there is no body, no peripherals, often no mind beyond solving the immediate problem - just a nameless mind in seemingly telepathic communion with the computer. When somebody stops by to say "hi", I break out of it and instantly develop fingers, toes, eyes that can't focus well, ears, mortgage payments, and all that assorted stuff that comes from being a human being. The discontinuity of it is jarring, and I often physically lurch.
      </p>
      <p>
        You don't get <a href="DumpShock.html">DumpShock</a> if you can prepare for it. If you decide to leave the <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a> due to an e-mail, difficulty solving the current problem, or something coming from either inside you or from the computer, you just let go, take a deep breath, and return to the world of the living. But when you are not prepared, you get the jarring <a href="DumpShock.html">DumpShock</a>.

        After beginning to write Kubla Khan in the summer of the year 1797, the Author was unfortunately called out by a person on business from Porlock, and on his return to his room, found, to his no small surprise and mortification, all the rest had passed away! <em>(Thanks, of course, to </em><a href="DirkGently.html">DirkGently</a>, who managed to save the whole history of the world in the process)<em></em>

        I'm so glad to hear I'm not the only person who gets this reaction when someone bangs open the computer room door and says something. -- <a href="ShaeErisson.html">ShaeErisson</a>
