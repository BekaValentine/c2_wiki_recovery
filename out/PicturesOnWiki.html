        Pictures On Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's nice to see pictures once in a while, such as the neat little sketch in <a href="SingleThreadedAgentPattern.html">SingleThreadedAgentPattern</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To post them what I mostly do is put them on my site and point to them. It'd be nice (or would it) if there was a directory on wiki where they could go. Or, for that matter, I could make a directory on my site that we could all use. What's the <em>right</em> idea? -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Simply type the URL of an image to include it on a wiki page. Press <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> (below) to see how this picture gets included.
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="http://c2.com/wiki/agent.gif" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki embeds an image when the URL ends in gif, jpg, jpeg or png.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki readers expect pages to load quickly, even over modems, so include only small images (less than 10k) and do so rarely.
      </p>
      <p>
        It works nicely.
        For example this picture resides on my site:
        ---Harry
      </p>
      <p>
        <img src="http://www.zicht.com/appelpeer.jpg" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Although images can be hosted anywhere, you should prefer locations that will promise persistence beyond, say, the end of the term. If you lack such facilities, contact one of the following regular Wiki authors who are willing to host well drawn and relevant artwork:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Complicated pages are best prepared and hosted on their own sites and only referenced here on Wiki. I have explored automatic upload schemes and abandoned all of them as inferior to this last alternative. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
