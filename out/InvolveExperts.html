        <em>Problem:</em> Code and design inspections are not rigorous enough to be effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Context/Forces:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are doing code and/or design reviews
        </li>
        <li>
           You may or may not have <a href="FormalStandards.html">FormalStandards</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           There is no clear idea of what to inspect and how to review designs and code
        </li>
        <li>
           The team is convinced of the validity of their ideas
        </li>
        <li>
           There is evidence of <a href="GroupThink.html">GroupThink</a>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Solution:</em> Involve Experts in the review process. <a href="InvolveExperts.html">InvolveExperts</a> add something that the pattern <a href="InvolveNewbies.html">InvolveNewbies</a> does not, in that experts are are typically aware of more potential issues. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The rationale is that
        it is useful to involve experts from other projects and domains. Often the people on the project cannot look at it with new eyes,
        and although newbies help, getting another expert to attend the review definitely identifies the interesting areas that have been
        hidden. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Resulting Context:</em> Code and/or design reviews have been exposed to other experts with different and fresh insights.
