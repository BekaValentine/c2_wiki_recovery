           <strong>Commitment to XP / On-site customer</strong> -- It helps a lot for there to be some management or customer support for Extreme programming for it to work well.  An involved customer on site an involved marketing person on-site can be invaluable. See: <a href="WhoIsTheCustomer.html">WhoIsTheCustomer</a> <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a>

           <strong></strong><a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> Definition and Estimation<strong> Stories for chunks of functionality the system will have and rough estimates for how long each will take to implement. Estimates of how long it will take to build each story are done by marketing and development together.  There are directions for how to do this in the XP books.

           <strong></strong><a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a><strong> If each of us own all the code, we can work on it, modify it, and improve it.  Test first programming keeps us from breaking the code while we do this.  Most importantly, people do not become too attched to ?their? code.  Collective owner ship seems to be a cause and effect of the other techniques.</strong>

           <strong></strong><a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> <strong> A spike solution is used when not enough is known about a technology or user story to be able to estimate it.  The team stops what they are doing and investigates this in a proof of concept kind of mode until they understand the technology enough to estimate tasks in it. </strong>

HAving developers sign up for tasks that they want to do or think will be fun to do. 3. Having the selector estimate how long eash of these tasks will take. 4. Reshuffling tasks if it looks like some developers have too many and some too few.  ONe important thing is that a developer working on a task must have been the one to make the estimate on the task.</strong>

           <strong>Technical Specifications</strong> Detailed specifications on how the system will work technically.

Constant refactoring until the design is simplified optimally and keeping it that way allows very rapid reactions to chaning business limates and company and customer needs.  To be able to use refactoring however one needs to have a number of techniques implemented, especially test first design (and YAGNI and continuous integration, and pair programming etc.). This is what the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingEnablingChart.html">ExtremeProgrammingEnablingChart</a> is all about. See <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>

           <strong>Extreme technical support</strong> extreme technical support becomes possible once the technical support staff have data coming straigh out of the development process, systems that are simple for people to use, and a large suite of tests to track dowon problems.  Under these conditions, the support staff can do the more high value work of wokring on the most difficult problems that crop up and finding out what customers think of the product.
