        Requirements Document
      </h1>
      <p>
        For those who would like to see a sample requirements document, with use cases sketched out at several levels, I posted one  as the Oct 11, 98 update at <a href="http://members.aol.com/acockburn">http://members.aol.com/acockburn</a> (can now be found at <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Sample_system_requirements_document">http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Sample_system_requirements_document</a> ).  I got many of the non-obvious questions from the requirements document template posted by SuzanneRobertson of the AtlanticSystemsGuild.  However, hers had 36 chapters, and while thorough, was too intimidating to fill out on a less-than-critical project.  So I abridged that and put it into a form I would be willing to stand working with.  You will see it is still fairly intimidating for a casual project, but has some interesting questions for any project's starting staff to ponder.  I am thinking of moving the use cases to the end, since they form most of the bulk.  Comments welcome (that's why I posted the document and this note) --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        To present an alternative to Alistair's Requirements doc (which looks pretty good), this outline is based loosely on the IEEE Standard. 830-1998 IEEE Recommended Practice for Software Requirements Specifications.

        It's pretty basic, and isn't perfectly tailored to XP, but seems to form the basis of most requirements specifications that I've seen. -- <a href="DaveBeer.html">DaveBeer</a>
