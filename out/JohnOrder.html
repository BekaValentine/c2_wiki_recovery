        By trade, I am currently a PHP/Postgres developer, but I am an amateur gameboy advance developer whose intentions are to go commercial as a game developer.  Otherwise, I'm honestly a pretty boring guy.  :)  I read too much science fiction, own too much anime, and drink nearly enough caffeine.  I look up to better programmers than myself, which unfortunately is pretty much everybody, it seems.

        My real drive in life is game design, and I fancy myself to be good at it.  Whereas I realize that nearly everyone that says this is rather borked, I've spent the time to study the art, and am coming to the conclusion that a good game design should be representable roughly mathematically, with little or no name tokenization.  I hold great awe for Tom Jolly, Sid Meier, and Martin Korth.  In my opinion, much as with programming, simple and novel game designs are usually the best.  Also, I enjoy a good game of Dvorak or Nomic.
