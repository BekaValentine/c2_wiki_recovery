        Or, ask them if customer would rather have working software or more paper.

        "We don't want too many superstars here. You'll all kill each other."
        Of course, my co-worker's immediate response was "Well, I guess I'll tone it down a bit, then." 
        I laughed, I cried, I bit my tongue.

        Frequently, it is a question of expectation management. This could be a mismatch between developer priority and business priority. You aren't giving us enough information about the situation to declare it a <a href="ProgrammerHell.html">ProgrammerHell</a>. :)
