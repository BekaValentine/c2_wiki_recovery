        Developer Story
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DeveloperStory.html">DeveloperStory</a> is similar to a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, but is written by a developer to describe a <a href="FeatureLet.html">FeatureLet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In others' ;) words, a <a href="DeveloperStory.html">DeveloperStory</a> is a story about an increment of work done toward the completion of a feature (called a <a href="FeatureLet.html">FeatureLet</a>).  Each <a href="DeveloperStory.html">DeveloperStory</a> is written on a card, and describes a chunk of partial functionality that is valuable to a tester.
      </p>
      <p>
        This would only be relevant in an process bridge (See <a href="AgileBridge.html">AgileBridge</a>).

        Q: Is there a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> that drives this feature?
      </p>
      <p>
        Response:  In our trials, we did not have <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>.  A prototype system was used in place of Requirements.  A <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> could make a good <a href="DeveloperStory.html">DeveloperStory</a> if the functionality it described were completed at the time of integration and that were all that had to be tested.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: Does a <a href="DeveloperStory.html">DeveloperStory</a> add benefit the <a href="FeatureLet.html">FeatureLet</a> does not?  Why would I want to read a story when I can read code?
      </p>
      <p>
        Response: A <a href="DeveloperStory.html">DeveloperStory</a> is the description.  The <a href="FeatureLet.html">FeatureLet</a> is the thing described.  I did not want to call it a feature because it is really "a part of a feature that I did not implement in full, so one should expect errors when you do this and this."
      </p>
      <p>
        Still valuable for testing when using GUI automation tools.  For example, I could write a script to go and click a button..  Later, I'd tie this script into a routine to verify the dialog box that came up.

        What is the purpose of a developer story?
