        Seam Framework
      </h1>
      <p>
        JBoss Seam is a powerful new application framework for building next generation Web 2.0 applications by unifying and integrating technologies such as Asynchronous <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and XML (AJAX), Java Server Faces (JSF), Enterprise Java Beans (EJB3), Java Portlets and Business Process Management (BPM).
      </p>
      <p>
        For me, the more interesting part of Seam, is that, lazy loading works in Hibernate, and acts as a new kind of glue-framework, that makes <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> easier to user, by changing the way applications are programmed... they are stil layered... but it is IMHO a much more flexible layering

        Are we finally reaching <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a>?
