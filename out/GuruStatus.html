        Guru Status
      </h1>
      <p>
        Guru can't really be applied to what you're referring to. A guru is a person who starts a religion or the high spiritual leader of a religion, not every preacher/teacher figure. The term originates from Sikhism, where it refers to the reincarnation of the first leader, the sacred text or God. Gurus have people seek them out, and tend not to actively seek the status. Confucius even said that he was merely compiling what had been said before. Maybe ElderStatus or PreacherFigure would more aptly describe what you are doing. -- <a href="BethanyAndresBeck.html">BethanyAndresBeck</a>

        The term "guru" is commonly used among computer people for an expert in some technology or skill that no-one else understands. Others do seek such people out, precisely because they are the only ones who can provide answers to certain questions. And the gurus don't seek such status. The spiritual connotations are ironic (and intentional). -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a> (likewise taken from <a href="SurvivingGuruStatus.html">SurvivingGuruStatus</a>)

        I was told by a friend from India that "guru" simply means "teacher".

        Doesn't the word 'guru' have a long enough history in the English language that it can be considered an English word at this point? It certainly has a specific enough connotation that is different, though related to the Hindu and Sanskrit meanings of the word; and certainly the implication of esoteric knowledge and kindly teaching are appropriate. -- <a href="LarryPrice.html">LarryPrice</a>

        <em>If that's true, then it's in good company--'rabbi', 'maestro', and 'sensei' are other examples of words that acquired more-specific connotations when adopted by English.</em>

        Here is an entry [1] for "guru" in the <a href="JargonFile.html">JargonFile</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        guru n.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Unix] An expert. Implies not only wizard skill but also a history of being a knowledge resource for others. Less often, used (with a qualifier) for other experts on other systems, as in 'VMS guru'. See source of all good bits.

        Guru <em>is</em> a teacher. In case of Sikhism, this word has further meaning. But in Sanskrit (from which it originates), it means a teacher.
      </p>
      <p>
        (What is the "further meaning"? Is it relevant?)
        The further meaning is as a spiritual leader. It's not relevant here.

        I read (can't remember where) that guru means 'to point'.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like this definition. A guru can teach you some knowledge but cannot transfer wisdom. You have to take your own journey.

        In the realm of software, a guru is not one who necessarily likes hard problems (though does not avoid them). To a guru, though, the most important hard problem is to find the angles from which problems cease to be hard.

        A software guru is one who can practice useful elements of the craft that are beyond anyone's ability to explain in language yet (if ever). Furthermore, the guru is capable of sharing this knowledge to a sufficiently interested student or colleague through an intuitively driven process of demonstration, metaphor, vocal inflection, facial expressions, and subtle responses to questions and suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every software guru has a somewhat different way of apprehending the subject, so gurus are also useful as gurus to gurus. Pretty much no-one who has worked at software has a total lack of software guruness. To the best gurus, every rank amateur is a valuable guru, regardless of what serious omissions of understanding they may also possess.
