        Fix On Failure
      </h1>
      <p>
        You didn't hear it from me, but a certain auto company's Y2K testing of manufacturing software turned up a single defect that would have shut down plants. <em>For </em>
        <strong>one </strong>
        <em>day.</em> They're glad they found it. Civilization would not have fallen had they not. But they're really glad they have a giant full-time Y2K testing lab.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It's not fixed until you test it:
      </p>
      <p>
        I inherited a project that handled 2 digit Y2K issues with logic like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        if year2 = 0 then<br/>
        ! This is a NULL date, which requires special application processing...<br/>
        else if year2 > 50 then<br/>
        year4 = 1900 + year2<br/>
        else<br/>
        year4 = 2000 + year2<br/>
        end if<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Careless logic:  It fails for all dates in the year 2000 itself (but works for 2001 to 2050).
        Fix was to change the first line to "if year2 = 0 and month = 0 and day = 0 then ..."
      </p>
      <p>
        (The input could not be changed to 4 digit years, because you can't change the ANSI X.12 EDI standards that easily.  ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, unaware of implementation techniques such as the above, upper management was claiming that this software would handle all 4 digit dates well into the future -- a highly misleading claim.
        (...wait until we hit the "year 2050 crisis!")
