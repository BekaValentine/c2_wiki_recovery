        Dave has been developing hardware and software solutions for more than 20 years in domains ranging from environment control systems to electrical energy trading systems.

        Dave has 6 years of Smalltalk experience (various flavours), at least 4 years of C++, and over 5 years of Java. After all that.. he's decided that Smalltalk does, indeed, rock and is again devoting himself to its mastery.
