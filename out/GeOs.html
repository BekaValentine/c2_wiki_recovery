        The first time I ever saw GEOS, it was running on and Apple II, and working pretty much like <a href="AppleMacintosh.html">AppleMacintosh</a> did, but on much more limited hardware, and in full color.  I was very impressed that they managed to pull off this feat.  Since then, GEOS has become available on other platforms, including 8086 PCs and portable devices.
