        <a href="BruceWilcox.html">BruceWilcox</a> and his wife, SueWilcox, wrote <a href="EzGo.html">EzGo</a>. That does nothing to sum them up at all.

        <a href="BruceWilcox.html">BruceWilcox</a> is a damned smart guy. I had the pleasure of talking with him on <a href="news:comp.ai.games">news:comp.ai.games</a> and collaborating with him (and others) on a book on artificial intelligence in games (unfortunately, it never shipped).

        <dd>I am a pioneer in the field of Computer Go, having written a series of commercial Go programs during a 20 year period. I spent a couple of years as a department manager at Bolt, Beranek and Newman labs in Applied Real-Time Vehicular AI, where I worked on a tank platoon ambush advisor and the Pilot's Associate demo programs. I currently work as a cross-project AI resource for The 3DO Company.</dd>

        More news: It appears Bruce headed off to Japan to build the ultimate Go game. But, according to my source, that news is two years stale (Dec '99). He was missing at GDC this year. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        In the world of the <a href="GameOfGo.html">GameOfGo</a>, Bruce is known as an iconoclast who, through the love of a fighting style of play, popularized perhaps the first wholly original <em>fuseki</em> (like a chess opening) seen in Go in centuries, called "The Great Wall".  See <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?GreatWall">http://senseis.xmp.net/?GreatWall</a> for details.

        <a href="http://senseis.xmp.net/?ReflectionsOnRiscIgoByBruceWilcox">http://senseis.xmp.net/?ReflectionsOnRiscIgoByBruceWilcox</a> is also worth a read for the in depth design of one of his earlier Go programs.

      <p>
        Bruce is a computer Go pioneer. He wrote the first Go program for sale to the public: Nemesis. His latest program is called Ego, with a demo version called Ez-Go. His <a href="EzGo.html">EzGo</a> theories originate from his Go programming experiences.
