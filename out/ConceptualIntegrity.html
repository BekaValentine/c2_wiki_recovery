        Conceptual Integrity
      </h1>
      <p>
        In 1975, <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a> said: <em>I will contend that </em><a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> is <em>the</em> most important consideration in system design. It is better to have a system omit certain anomalous features and improvements, but to reflect one set of design ideas, than to have one that contains many good but independent and uncoordinated ideas.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1995, Brooks still hasn't changed his mind: <em>I am more convinced than ever. </em><a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> is central to product quality. Having a system architect is the <strong>most important single step toward conceptual integrity</strong>...after teaching a software engineering laboratory more than 20 times, I came to <strong>insist</strong> that student teams <em>as small as</em> four people choose a manager, and a <strong>separate</strong> architect.<em></em>

        <strong>Discussion:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        According to <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a>, "<em>Conceptual integrity in turn dictates that the design must proceed from </em>'one mind<strong>, or from </strong>a very small number<strong> of agreeing </strong>resonant<em>' minds</em>". To me, a <em>very small number</em> would only mean the entire team only when that team is a <em>very small number</em>. In my opinion, <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> is a required ingredient for achieving the principle (I think espoused by <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>?) that "<em>a system must have a powerful metaphor that is uniformly applied throughout a system</em>". While not enough on its own, the <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a> used by XP is a step towards achieving <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> in that system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> does <strong>not</strong> mean one shouldn't <strong>include</strong> <em>many minds</em> (or even the entire team for that matter) in the Analysis & Design process. This is a <em>very</em> important detail that shouldn't be discounted by those who wish to do away with the role of architect. Team input in Analysis and Design is absolutely <strong>essential</strong> for (1) establishing TeamGel, (2) ensuring the soundness and quality of the analysis, and (3) refactoring the design into something more polished. In fact, the earlier the architect or design-team can include the entire team (or domain-team leads for very large teams), the higher quality the design will be. The DesignTeam <strong>must</strong> be open to and accept criticism, <strong>the  architect(s) must be egoless</strong> (see <a href="EgolessProgramming.html">EgolessProgramming</a>).

        However, if there is <em>no final word</em>, no one-mind fighting off the democratic compromises that can reduce a vision to its lowest common denominator, then it will be difficult to achieve <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> and the system may run the risk of becoming an <a href="AmorphousBlobOfHumanInsensitivity.html">AmorphousBlobOfHumanInsensitivity</a> (due to <em></em>TooManyCooksInTheKitchen<em>). It is important to realize that you can be </em>inclusive<em> (or team-oriented) without being </em>everyone-designs<em> or </em>anti-architect<em>. Said another way, </em>it is possible to have an architect and have team collaboration on a design at the same time<em>. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also important to note that on a small team, the design-team may in fact be <em>the whole product team</em>. Another approach would have the architect role and the coach or technical/team lead role (i.e. the <em>final say</em> or <em>tie-breaker</em>) be filled by a single individual in order to ensure <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a>. As is mentioned in much of the <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a> literature, there is no requirement for a <em>1 to 1</em> or even a <em>1 to N</em> cardinality between roles and people. A single person could hold <em>many roles</em> just as a single role could be held by <em>many people</em>.

        Can we identify specific, well-known examples of <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a>?
        I'm starting a list here... please feel free to make additions 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unix (based on the notion of a "file" (e.g. directories, devices, filesystems, named pipes and sockets are all sort-of files)
        </li>
        <li>
           Smalltalk ("everything is an object", and the small set of other accompanying principles)
        </li>
        <li>
           SQL ("all data is in tables", with keys and constraints)
        </li>
        <li>
           Lisp ("everything is a list")
        </li>

        Do you see <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> as a synonym for UniformMetaphor? I'm not sure I don't, I'm just curious. I <strong>think</strong> that I view <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> as a means of achieving (or at least maintaining) a UniformMetaphor. I'm not sure, though. --<a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> and UniformMetaphor are very closely related... We can consider them, and much of the topic of ArchitecturalQuality, as the minimization of design complexity.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Less complexity = fewer possible combinations of features/ structures
        </li>
        <li>
           Fewer possible combinations = more of them work, less to go wrong
        </li>
        <li>
           Thus, less complexity = more reliable
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        UniformMetaphor however is a *single level* of structure, reaching a local minima of complexity by running everything through the same metaphor. Eg, shared memory thru the file system. <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> might use multiple levels or layers to form a minimal-complexity functional structure. Eg, presenting shared memory/  inter-process comms with a distinct API.

        In one of the keynotes I heard from <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a>, he listed the existence of a <em>fan club</em> as a way to distinguish <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> from <a href="DesignByCommittee.html">DesignByCommittee</a>. Examples he mentioned included the Mac, but I don't remember the others. Another example design mentioned included the Global Positioning System, where the <a href="ChiefArchitect.html">ChiefArchitect</a> was dividing <em>spare nanoseconds</em> to those software components that turned out to need just a little more time than initially thought. The <a href="ChiefArchitect.html">ChiefArchitect</a> had the complete system in his head, and exactly knew what he was doing. -- <a href="ArieVanDeursen.html">ArieVanDeursen</a>

        The <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> is a far better example of <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a> than SQL. SQL is a mess with regards to orthogonality, parsimony, consistency and even logical correctness. -- Jon Heggland
