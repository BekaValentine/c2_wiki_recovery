        Just another software developer enthusiastic about <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> stuff. Also guilty of Hackerdude.

        He Started thinking about "why we do things the way we do them" when he picked up the wonderful <a href="PragmaticProgrammer.html">PragmaticProgrammer</a> book. Since then he's looked to work with people who both a) Have that book on their desk, and b) It is <a href="VeryWellThumbed.html">VeryWellThumbed</a>. Also semi-fan of the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> crowd and the <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> ideas.

        David has been programming since 1989, in pretty much all languages. He's a self-taught programmer, who started as a business database programmer (DBase) and kept going. He's "forgotten" many languages, including AdabasNatural (a Cobol-like substance), the whole range of XBase, and Delphi. He's still hacking around in Java, C/C++, <a href="MozillaXul.html">MozillaXul</a> and Eclipse.

        He used to hate Macs, then he used a MacOS X. Now there's a Mac (cube) at his desk, although admittedly as a secondary test machine (and he can't stand the one button-mouse shortsightedness). A similar story goes with <a href="SunSolaris.html">SunSolaris</a>.
