        Linear Shuffle Summary
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here's an attempt at a summary of the <a href="LinearShuffle.html">LinearShuffle</a> page. There's lots more discussion on that page, but much of it is redundant and needs to have <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> applied to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, the objective is to take an array and shuffle it in linear time. Here's an obvious algorithm that's wrong:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Icon:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        procedure shuffle(x)<br/>
        every !x :=: ?x<br/>
        return x<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>C:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        void shuffle(int *x, int n)<br/>
        {<br/>
        int i;<br/>
        for (i=0;i<n;i++)<br/>
        swap(x,i,rand(n));<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Short, elegant, clear, and wrong. These routines do not produce each of the possible <em>n!</em> orderings with equal likelihood. A simple proof goes like this. If <em>n=3</em> then there are three swaps, each with three possible targets, giving 27 possible results. However, <em>3!=6</em> and 6 does not divide evenly into 27, so some of the outputs must be duplicated. Explicit numbers are given on the <a href="LinearShuffle.html">LinearShuffle</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        A correct version can easily be produced by developing a proof along with the code. It can run forwards or backwards, depending on your inclination.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the forward version. We assume that the elements from <em>0</em> to <em>i - 1</em> inclusive are a shuffled permutation of the elements from 0 to i-1 from the original array. At each stage, we swap the next element, <em>i</em>, with some randomly chosen element from the shuffled sub-array, thus extending the sub-array an element at a time, maintaining the invariant, and eventually terminating.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Could someone explain exactly why the invariant is maintained?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We assume elements <em>0</em> to <em>i-1</em> are shuffled and we want to extend this to element <em>i</em>. This is done by swapping the element element at location <em>i</em> with a random location from <em>0</em> to <em>i</em> inclusive. I'm not trying to be rude, but I can think of no more polite way to ask this: What part of this needs further explanation?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        void shuffle(int *x, int n)<br/>
        {<br/>
        int i;<br/>
        for (i = 1; i < n; i++)<br/>
        swap(x, i, rand(i + 1));<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And here's the backwards version. From those elements we have, choose one at random and remove it. Repeat until there aren't any left.
      </p>
      <code>
        void shuffle(int *x, int n)<br/>
        {<br/>
        for (;n>1;n--)<br/>
        swap(x,rand(n),n-1);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I've deliberately left the proof of the algorithm as a clear indication rather than a laborious step-by-step formal verification to show how a mathematician thinks about proofs. The code needs to be checked against the definition of the algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        In all the above, <em>rand(j)</em> is assumed to return a uniformly distributed random number from <em>0</em> to <em>j-1</em> inclusive. Yes, we could pass in <strong>void *</strong> and a <strong>swap</strong> function making this effectively polymorphic but this version works on <strong>int</strong>s for simplicity.
      </p>

        Question: How would you write <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for the above routines?

           <em>Correction made to the forward version where there was an off-by-one error. Analyzing the case where n == 2 shows the current version to be correct. Kudos to the person who found the error - how long has this code been here without anyone bothering to check it?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Correction made to the backwards version where the evaluation of parameters in a function call was undefined. More kudos due.</em>
