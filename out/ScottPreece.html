        I work at the Motorola PCS Urbana-Champaign Design Center,
        where we build operating systems and frameworks for the software platforms
        that power Motorola cell phones.

        I am a software architect for our software platforms, working especially on
        user interface areas. I also do a lot of work on standards, including representing Motorola
        in the CELINUX Forum Architecture Group.

        Before coming to Motorola (or, rather, to the Gould Electronics shop that was later
        sold to Motorola), I did information
        retrieval systems research at the University of Illinois
        Coordinated Sciences Lab. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My PhD work was on information retrieval using 
        SpreadingActivationNetworks; it pre-dates the Web, but had some interesting speculation
        about web-like retrieval structures..

      <p>
        I come to the Patterns movement with a little <a href="PatternSkepticism.html">PatternSkepticism</a>;
        too many people are using "pattern" to mean too many things
        for me to feel that there's a foundation for changing the
        software world, yet, but I think there's the kernel of an
        idea here that could move us towards real engineering.
