        Flat Cluster Project Team
      </h1>
      <p>
        Project Teams are the basic unit of organization for <a href="FlatClusterDevelopment.html">FlatClusterDevelopment</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A team consists of one or more developers who have decided to work on a project made available by the Scout Team.  A Project Advocate must endorse the formation of the new team.
        </li>
        <li>
           To join a Project Team, a petition is made, and all existing members of the Project Team must make a unanimous vote for election.
        </li>
        <li>
           A person may leave the team at any time they choose.  Re-entry into the team after leaving requires petition and voting.
        </li>
        <li>
           The team must at all times have a Project Advocate, and a Project Leader.  They are elected by vote of the team members and serve a term of two weeks before the next vote is placed.  It is perfectly acceptable for the same person to hold the position for several terms in a row.  Candidates for the Project Advocate must be chosen from a Scout Team.  Candidates for the Project Leader must be chosen from the membership of the Project Team.  A Project Advocate or Project Leader may not be elected against his/her will, and may resign from his/her position at any time (doing so would require an immediate election to fill this position.)
        </li>
        <li>
           While the Project Advocate serves his/her term with the Project Team, he/she is considered to be a member of the team, and may participate in the voting process.  However, the Project Advocate is not eligible as a candidate for Project Leader.
        </li>
        <li>
           A Project Team, upon conclusion of a project, remains intact and may seek endorsement to begin another Project.  Maintaining the completed project remains a priority of the team.  The team may split into two Project Teams if the Maintenance of a completed Project requires a dedicated team.
        </li>
