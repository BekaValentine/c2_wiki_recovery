        Copulist Society
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="CopulistSociety.html">CopulistSociety</a> is a <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> in which each participant's Commission depends on the behavior of all the other participants. For example, each participant might join the society with 100 stones <em>that can only be assigned to others</em>. They assign and reassign their stones per Term based on their interaction with the other members of the Society.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the simplest case this might be a matter for the conscious choice of each participant. A <a href="QuidProQuo.html">QuidProQuo</a> buddy strategy would then permit each participant to obtain a Commission of 100 stones. But <a href="QuidProQuo.html">QuidProQuo</a> is not stable; disagreements and the earning of respect would soon result in a more meritocratic, or at least populist assignment of Stones. If <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> were to become a <a href="WikiStoneSociety.html">WikiStoneSociety</a>, Ward himself would soon amass a very large Commission indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another kind of <a href="CopulistSociety.html">CopulistSociety</a> would result if the assignment of stones was not a conscious choice, but depended instead on some automatic metric. For example, on the ratio of reads to edits that follow someone's edit. An edit that improves a page generally results in fewer followup edits to reads; readers who agree with the page don't generally edit it. An edit that harms a page generally results in an immediate correction, and few folk read such a page afterwards. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course in a <a href="WikiStoneSociety.html">WikiStoneSociety</a> the problem is then the question of just what amassing a large StoneCommission would be good for. It's generally thought that anything that detracts from the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> is not good for wiki, so the notion of <a href="EditModeration.html">EditModeration</a> based on Stones is not an attractive one ...
