        Multi Frame Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        Problems of significant complexity can often not be related to a single <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a>, and must instead be considered and decomposed with respect to multiple frames.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MichaelJackson.html">MichaelJackson</a> coined the term <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a> to describe patterns in the problem space (cf; design patterns).  Jackson documented a handful of frames, pertaining to basic problems like control, information management and the construction of virtual artifacts.  Simple applications may be covered adequately by a single <a href="ProblemFrame.html">ProblemFrame</a>, but more interesting ones can be analyzed and treated as <a href="MultiFrameProblem.html">MultiFrameProblem</a>s.  For each part of the problem, the frame that fits it well suggests likely candidate methods for developing the software.
      </p>
      <p>
        One interesting observation is that while Jackson considers the set of frames to be extensible beyond the ones he documented, this is rarely required because most problems that don't fit a single Jackson frame can be modeled as <a href="MultiFrameProblem.html">MultiFrameProblem</a>s.  So in a sense, the vocabulary is complete, or very close.
