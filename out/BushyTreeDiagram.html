        Bushy Tree Diagram
      </h1>
      <p>
        An interesting and (apparently) fairly well known diagram from the 1989 paper "The Xerox Star: A Retrospective", showing the family relationships of a number of information systems from <a href="VannevarBush.html">VannevarBush</a>'s <a href="MemexVision.html">MemexVision</a> to the Macintosh II among many others.

        The whole paper is at <a href="http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2003/cmsc434-0201/Handouts/XeroxStar.pdf">http://www.cs.umd.edu/class/fall2003/cmsc434-0201/Handouts/XeroxStar.pdf</a> (PDF) and <a href="http://www.digibarn.com/friends/curbow/star/retrospect/index.html">http://www.digibarn.com/friends/curbow/star/retrospect/index.html</a> (HTML).

        JohnRedant, BruceDamer and others later produced a revised version, bringing its coverage up to the year 2000 among other things:

        In the source page, <a href="http://www.digibarn.com/stories/desktop-history/bushytree.html,">http://www.digibarn.com/stories/desktop-history/bushytree.html,</a> the tree has an imagemap with links to many of the projects shown.

        The diagram is quite <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a>-centric, but there's probably good reason for that, over and above the original paper's XeroxStar focus...

        <em>You could probably find fault with quite a few details in the diagram(s) - no </em><a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> or <a href="LogoLanguage.html">LogoLanguage</a>? no link from <a href="SketchPad.html">SketchPad</a> to <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>? - but it seems valuable both as a general overview and as a source of pointers to many now-obscure systems. It's interesting to see how the graph links together modern-day systems as diverse as <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, <a href="HyperTextMarkupLanguage.html">HyperTextMarkupLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>/<a href="JavaPlatform.html">JavaPlatform</a> and <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> were added, it would link up to <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, and down to the <a href="AppleNewton.html">AppleNewton</a>. There are similar diagrams with narrower focus (only <a href="ProgrammingLanguages.html">ProgrammingLanguages</a> or only <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a>).  -- <em>Certainly; one of the reasons I like the Bushy Tree is that it cuts across those (and other) categories.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Silly but half serious question: Is the tree called "bushy" because of the branching or because the root is <a href="VannevarBush.html">VannevarBush</a>? -- <em>Shurely a pun? The moniker seems to be </em>DigiBarn's coining, a quick Google doesn't turn up any other sources for it.<em></em>

        Also, IIRC, the Cedar project (where Modula-2 was born) eventually begat the <strong>Oberon System</strong> project too, which also draws from Simula too.  --SamuelFalvo

        In 2008 the Bushy Tree begot a new WikiaWiki, the BushyTreeWiki : <a href="http://bushytree.wikia.com/wiki/IEEE_Bushy_Tree">http://bushytree.wikia.com/wiki/IEEE_Bushy_Tree</a>
