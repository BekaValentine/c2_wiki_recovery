        <em>Fine idea. The influence of the "old high-content pages" can only do good. If your random page selector is clever enough to find them of course.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I also think it is a good idea. Perhaps you should add a link from the <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a>, <a href="StartingPoints.html">StartingPoints</a> or <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> (to ensure we <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a><strong>'s notice it!).</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Seriously spiffy! I'd prefer to see more pages listed; I would happily be a <a href="RandomPagesJunkie.html">RandomPagesJunkie</a>. -- <a href="ShaeErisson.html">ShaeErisson</a>

        <em>Good idea. I don't see the need to have the link at the top of </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, though, as <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a> will show up in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> whenever your script is run. Thanks for a new way of looking at Wiki.<em></em>

        Wonderful!

        It would be interesting to sort them by category. Many are home pages, which frankly don't interest me. Many are uncategorized, which we might take as a prompt to add categories to them. (This supposes the category system is useful, of course.) -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
        <em>That's not </em>'really<em>' random,is it?</em>

      <p>
        <em></em><a href="WikiBase.html">WikiBase</a> gurus, how about adding a new script that would randomly select some categories, then randomly select some pages within each category, then randomly select some pages not in any category, then display all the titles in a nifty clickable list?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or you could just select some random pages........... Although, RandomCategories might be cool! -- <a href="IsaacFreeman.html">IsaacFreeman</a>

        Is there anything in the wiki now for listing the most-referenced pages? That might be a good way to gauge the overall interest in a page. Who knows how well that might correlate with "high-content". Also, is there any way currently to find orphan pages? [<em>See </em><a href="TopTen.html">TopTen</a> and <a href="http:orphanWikiPages.'']">http:orphanWikiPages.'']</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="GoogleMyWiki.html">GoogleMyWiki</a> suggests most-referenced as a metric for <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> to rank its hits.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I imagine the home page of the most prolific author would come out tops, if they always signed their work. I'm not sure this is a good metric for quality. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        Have you considered setting a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie for the script so that people get a hint that the page is machine-generated? -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        Gosh ... it would be fun to have a page that would pull up 5 random links every time anyone loaded it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You can now hit </em><a href="RandomPage.html">RandomPage</a> five times to achieve a similar effect.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But <a href="http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl?random=WikiWiki">http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl?random=WikiWiki</a> does not give one a list of links to choose from, it actually just brings up an entire page randomly. It would be very nice to have a local script at c2 that would generate a random list each and every time it is run by a user. i.e.: <a href="http:''''''Random''''''Pages">http:''''''Random''''''Pages</a>

        When <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a> was refreshed bi- or tri-weekly, I thought it wasn't quite often enough. Now I think it is perhaps a bit too often. -- <a href="OleAndersen.html">OleAndersen</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How so? I was a bit disapointed by the lack of randomness in the </em><a href="RandomPage.html">RandomPage</a>. If you want to remember which page it listed, write it down and use that until you want a new random page<em> -- </em><a href="IsaacFreeman.html">IsaacFreeman</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Or just save the complete page as "RandomPages.html" (file / Save As) then open it in <a href="NotePad.html">NotePad</a> and paste this code (be sure to include the < >s when you copy): <BASE href=<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?</a>> in between the <HEAD> and </HEAD> tags at the top of the page so that the links will work correctly, then save your changes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The trailing "wiki?" in the url in the Base tag shouldn't be needed.

        <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a> on C2 Wiki should be exactly like <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a> on <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>, on the Search page.

        Has the <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a> script changed recently? I used to look at the edit changes to get both the current list and the previous list but this no longer seems to work. -- <a href="JamesKeogh.html">JamesKeogh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're mistaken - the changes show the previous content due to editing from a different ip address, not the previous list. What you thought was the previous list was probably a list restored some time ago after the page was spammed.</em>
