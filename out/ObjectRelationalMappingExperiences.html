        Object Relational Mapping Experiences

      <p>
        The <a href="ObjectRelationalToolComparison.html">ObjectRelationalToolComparison</a> offers a great comparison of features, but little in the way of subjective or objective data as to how well these things really work.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, Jakarta's <a href="ObjectRelationalBridge.html">ObjectRelationalBridge</a> sounds like it offers all of the features <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> does, but it's open source and free.  If anyone who has used <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> before (which is a very mature and robust product) and has since used the <a href="ObjectRelationalBridge.html">ObjectRelationalBridge</a>, it would be great to know your experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ObjectRelationalBridge.html">ObjectRelationalBridge</a> isn't as nice as <a href="HiberNate.html">HiberNate</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ObjectRelationalBridge.html">ObjectRelationalBridge</a> is also as good as Hibernate.

        In general, there seems to be a complaint that ORM's work fairly well if one designs the DB to fit the way a particular ORM works; but if dealing with DB's that were designed outside of the influence of ORM's, they can be a bear to make fit. In other words, there is something we can call an "ORM-friendly schema", and using an ORM for a non-ORM-friendly schema is asking for either project failure or heavy expenses.  (There seems a similar issue with <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>-friendly schemas.)
