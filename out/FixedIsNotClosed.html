      <p>
        <strong>Fixed is not Closed</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers who work on bugs need feedback to know if the changes fixed the bug as reported. Those changes need to be verified by a third-party and the work on the bug brought to resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A fixed bug is not a closed bug. Once the programmer has made code changes and checked in the results, that programmer can mark the bug fixed, but cannot close it. The user who entered the bug is responsible for verifying and closing the bug if it really is fixed. The resolution of a bug should be different from the status. "Will not fix" or "Unable to reproduce" are among the other resolutions besides fixed that can close a bug.
      </p>
      <p>
        The customer who submitted the bug should close it, or, if there is an dispatcher role, that can be where fixed and closing are coordinated.
