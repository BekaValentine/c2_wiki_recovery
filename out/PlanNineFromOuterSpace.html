        Despite popular belief, this is far from the worst film ever made.  Plan 9 is a cheap film, a film that tries to do more than it ought, but at least it tries.  It has brought more joy to the world than "Town & Country", "Love Affair", "Bugsy", "Dick Tracy" and "Ishtar" combined.

        PNFOS is a great movie, with or without beer, but for all the wrong reasons.

        I love the scene where the guy is running from the aliens, and you see a shot of him running from in front.  And a shot from behind (hey, waitaminute -- it's night now).  Then front (day again).  Then back (night)... --<a href="JasonFelice.html">JasonFelice</a>
