        <strong>Refactoring Live!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a> and <a href="LeoScott.html">LeoScott</a> presented a free class the first week in September, 2000 (6:30pm to 9pm on the 5th, 6th and 7th). Our intent was to have the students see us do refactoring (and testing), talk a little bit about refactoring and then do refactoring. We wanted them to leave with a gut feeling that refactoring is a faster and easier way to do code.  -- <a href="LeoScott.html">LeoScott</a>

        We had a first meeting!  Wayne and I met in an informal manner!  We talked about what practices worked (or not) for us a our workplace.  Thanks Wayne for sharing your experience with me!  I hope you will be able to bring some of your colleagues in the next meeting!  Pascal, what about joining us the next time? --- JeanMarcHeneman

        We had a great meeting.  I was surprised to learn that the only part of XP that Jean Marc's team isn't doing is pair programming.  At my work, where I've secretly replaced Folgiers Process with XP Instant, I've found group ownership to be very difficult without pair programming, but Jean Marc hasn't had any trouble with group ownership.  Neat!  -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>
