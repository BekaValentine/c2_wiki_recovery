        The Boy Next Door
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TheBoyNextDoor.html">TheBoyNextDoor</a> represents management's lack of respect for the art of software development. Sometimes management use people like their "friend's son" as a reference in a serious discussion, or as a second opinion. And they believe it is sufficient evidence that a programmer is doing something wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, <a href="TheBoyNextDoor.html">TheBoyNextDoor</a> represent the belief that software development is about hacking and that code is all that goes into it. It is the same problem you'll discover when you talk to a <a href="CowboyCoder.html">CowboyCoder</a> about product development. They tend to believe that _the code is the product_. They also tend to believe that writing 100 LOC only will cost the company the effort spent writing the 100 LOC. It is in fact a widespread misconception among management that code is for free. People thinking like this forget that in a product 100 LOC spawn of into far more activities than just _writing the code_. Documentation, support, educational efforts, marketing material, sales material, etc. cost far more than the actuall 100 LOC. Still, the argument is that <a href="TheBoyNextDoor.html">TheBoyNextDoor</a> would finish this in a couple of days and he told me that there are tools on the internet that can do that for you automatically.

        On the other hand, if <a href="TheBoyNextDoor.html">TheBoyNextDoor</a> happen to be a full blooded professional programmer, I guess you are out of luck. Know the difference.
