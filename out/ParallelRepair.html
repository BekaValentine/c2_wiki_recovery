        Parallel Repair

      <p>
        Parallel repair is a way to repair messy wiki topics (and other things) by creating a parallel topic. The parallel one is worked on piece by piece until it meets general approval. The old page is then archived and the fixed one takes its place. Pick one or a few topics to fix at a time rather than go too wide.
