        I am VERY interested in getting into another Extreme Programming project.  I ran the XP team for Sage Systems (company went under due to lack of funding of Energy startups), and participated as both the manager and as a developer.  We didn't implement everything (no pair-programming for example), but did use most of the methodology.  It was GREAT!  The business partners LOVED it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So.  I'm looking for another one.  I am interested in either full-time in the San Francisco, East Bay area, or contracting anywhere (on-site or remote).

      <p>
        I'm a programmer who lives near Waltham, Massachusetts.  I want to find an XP job in a Java environment near here.  I've been a programmer for decades and when I read Kent Beck's book "eXtreme Programming eXplained - EMBRACE CHANGE" it gave me hope that there might be a shop where productivity is valued over ego.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I got my first job as a programmer, I was thrilled that someone would actually pay me to do something I loved to do.  However, time has taught me that I get paid for all the non-programming stuff:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Generating schedules which only work because you KNOW the dependent project won't be done when they say.
        </li>
        <li>
           Office politics.
        </li>
        <li>
           Helping a new person get up to speed only to have them 1) leave or 2) publish your ideas as theirs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Explaining to the clueless boss why his "great" idea is stupid.
        </li>
        <li>
           Writing specifications which are rarely read and which are NEVER updated to reflect the final version.
        </li>
        <li>
           Being forced to maintain code which should have been tossed years ago.
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'd program even if I didn't get paid for it (However, I do have a family so I need to get paid.).
