        I am a <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a> at The TOVA Company in <a href="PortlandOregon.html">PortlandOregon</a>, mostly <a href="WorkingFromHome.html">WorkingFromHome</a> porting an <a href="MsDos.html">MsDos</a> program to <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>. Their business is a Continuous Performance Test (CPT) for <a href="AttentionDeficitDisorder.html">AttentionDeficitDisorder</a>. It is accurate enough to titrate dosage of medications such as <a href="RitalinDrug.html">RitalinDrug</a>, avoiding the all-too-common problem of overmedication.  Our company uses and helps develop <a href="IkiWiki.html">IkiWiki</a> for both our internal documentation wiki and our public web site. It was chosen for its integration with <a href="GitVersionControl.html">GitVersionControl</a>.

           As of 2014, migrating bugs into <a href="TracProject.html">TracProject</a> and specs into <a href="TracWiki.html">TracWiki</a>. <a href="IkiWiki.html">IkiWiki</a> gets overloaded when you have five years of bug history. A compiled website just isn't going to perform like a bug database.

        I bookmarked <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>, and use this great place to learn about <a href="AgileProcesses.html">AgileProcesses</a>.

        Once upon a time, I hacked Unix at <a href="ReedCollege.html">ReedCollege</a> along with <a href="BillTrost.html">BillTrost</a>.  BartMassey was my Physics TA, and I now work on rockets with him.  Small world!

               Since <a href="DeepBlue.html">DeepBlue</a> beat Kasparov in 1997, more and more top chess programs on commodity multi-core systems have surpassed World Champion level strength. First came Fruit and Rybka in 2005. Then Houdini surpassed Rybka in 2010. In 2014 the lists are topped by Komodo, Stockfish, and Houdini. Stockfish is even <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, both the program itself and its distributed testing framework Fishtest. The official WCCC hasn't kept up; the defacto world championship is Thoreson's Chess Engine Competition: <a href="http://tcec.chessdom.com/">http://tcec.chessdom.com/</a>

               In 2010 we flew active roll control! But high speed aerodynamics are tricky; it actually rolled the opposite direction from how we turned the canard fins!

            <li>
               2014: Fins work great, payload is 5xGoPro cameras for 360-degree video! Looks fabulous when seen with an OculusRift!

        I have also worked at at Extensis, working in downtown <a href="PortlandOregon.html">PortlandOregon</a>. I coded in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>, and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, mainly working on a consumer Mac/Win image database called Portfolio. I was especially interested in <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, <a href="UnitTestingLegacyCode.html">UnitTestingLegacyCode</a>, and <a href="LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign.html">LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign</a>. Our project had at least three <a href="TestingFrameworks.html">TestingFrameworks</a> all devoid of tests. :( Make that four, and we're finally getting tests written. :)

        The company's first use of <a href="IterativeDevelopment.html">IterativeDevelopment</a> was a great success.  Both of our major product lines produced featureful and robust product revisions on the scheduled release dates.  We even did away with our <a href="BetaTesting.html">BetaTesting</a> phase.  I attribute this as much to <a href="ManagingExpectations.html">ManagingExpectations</a> as improved engineering.

        I've been salivating over the aerodynamic Aptera vehicle (<a href="http://www.aptera.com).">http://www.aptera.com).</a> I'm hoping they start selling it in Oregon before my Prius wears out.  I put a deposit down on the home-grown Arcimoto SRK (<a href="http://arcimoto.com/).">http://arcimoto.com/).</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Aptera went under (poor mgmt), I gave my Prius to my sister (now <a href="CarFree.html">CarFree</a>!), bought an electric bike for my wife, and Arcimoto is working on the 7th of seven planned prototypes before production (fingers crossed!)
