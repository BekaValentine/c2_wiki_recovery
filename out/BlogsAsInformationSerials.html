        Blogs have become the current information serial. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They present information, opinion, illustration, and ads, for more or less "targeted" audiences, in a paradigm of PersonalPublishing, which has come to replace some, but not all, of what we looked for in the the near present and far past in our magazines and our journals. They are presented in a serial form, from daily, to weekly, to monthly and longer periods. Most are then made available through the same portal as period archives, dating back years, if not to the origination of the blog. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From the millions of blogs available, the task of the modern information junkie is to sort out and evaluate blogs we find match our information and entertainment templates. Such can be done by discovered and invented processes, or by a programmed process, or reliance upon results attained by search and other means. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Important to keep in mind is how we are going to anchor, store, manage and access information we  have acquired.
