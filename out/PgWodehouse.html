        P. G. Wodehouse (1881-1975) was an English humorist who wrote novels, short stories, plays, lyrics, and essays, all with the same light touch of gentle satire. He is best known as the creator of the irredeemably dim and unflaggingly affable Bertie Wooster and his invincible valet Jeeves, but Wodehouse also produced multi-volume story cycles on Blandings Castle, Mr. Mulliner's extended family, Mike and Psmith, the Oldest Member, Uncle Fred, and the Drones Club. (All this is in addition to his many stand-alone novels, short stories, essays, reminiscences, and plays.)

        Throughout his stories, Wodehouse presents a view of the world which differs from -- his fans would say, improves upon -- the focus most people have. For a variety of reasons, pigs, newts, and statues of the Infant Samuel at Prayer play significant roles in the Wodehousian view, while such things as death, taxes, and work are crowded towards the O. P. wings.

        Anyone seriously interested in the possibilities of reuse should examine Wodehouse's works closely. Everyone else should simply read them
