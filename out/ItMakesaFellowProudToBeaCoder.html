        It Makesa Fellow Proud To Bea Coder

        The heart of everyone in this department swells with pride<br/>
        For the land's elite, the dregs of which, are coding at his side<br/>
        For the fascinating processes and procedures that we fight<br/>
        And the strange and buggy software that we're called upon to write<br/>

        Now Frank, he is a GrayBeard who wrote programs for <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a><br/>
        He <em>clearly</em> knows more about programming than either me or you<br/>
        He thinks that GUIs are a bunch of hype<br/>
        He longs for punchcards and teletype<br/>

        Johnson is a process guy who comes from JPL<br/>
        He's never written a line of code, I guess it's just as well<br/>
        His designs are clearly perfect, he cries<br/>
        (Implementation's left as an exercise)<br/>

        Is using EJB<br/>

        Prasad is a new college hire, with energy to match<br/>
        He thinks that we should redesign the enterprise from scratch<br/>

        "And I'll have it done in a couple of days"<br/>

        Wei-ling is the solitary woman on our team<br/>
        And the single guys are all in love with her, it seems<br/>
        But they have no chance of getting near<br/>
        She's dating a doctor, or so I hear<br/>

        Steven is a hacker, who once had to do hard time<br/>
        For breaking into Citibank (though he didn't steal a dime)<br/>
        He never comments or tests his code<br/>
        "If it compiles, it's ready to load!"<br/>

        Our manager is the bitter, broken type<br/>
        Passed over for promotion years ago<br/>
        He's counting down the days<br/>

        But his resume's outdated, and he hasn't kept the pace<br/>
        A senior analyst back in his day<br/>
        Now he writes scripts in VBA<br/>
        It makes a fellow proud to be<br/>

        What luck to be allowed to be a co-o-o-o-der! (is it five yet?)<br/>
