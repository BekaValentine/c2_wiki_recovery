        Graph Viz Is Too Dynamic
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="GraphViz.html">GraphViz</a> is great for visualizing trees and graphs, however even a slight change to the tree structure and the diagram will come out very different looking.
      </p>
      <p>
        For software maps, or diagrams that need to remain relatively stable, <a href="GraphViz.html">GraphViz</a> is too dynamic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If the tree structure changes, of course the diagram changes.  I'd like to know what you mean by "slight change" and "very different" in this context.  Could you post samples? --</em>

      <p>
        Laying out graphs in 2D in general requires arcs to overlay each other (provably; it requires a 3D space to avoid such); minimizing the number of such intersections can require arbitrarily large movement of projected nodes. A single addition or deletion of an arc can therefore lead to arbitrarily large changes in layout. Similarly to a lesser extent with other aspects of layout.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid large jumps on the output upon small changes in input would require hysteresis from one output to the next; a program like <a href="GraphViz.html">GraphViz</a> would need to remember what it had done the last time, and make only small changes on output on successive runs, rather than recalculating layout from scratch.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't gotten around to using <a href="GraphViz.html">GraphViz</a> in particular, but the above concerns apply in general to any such program.

      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="GraphViz.html">GraphViz</a> provides a firm system to constrain its layout. For example, if you draw a tree, and if you specify an in-order fan-out to place nodes in their DOT file order, and if you specify a rank for each node, the location of each new node becomes totally predictable.
