        Net Present Value
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Net Present Value</em> (NPV) is a calculation of the value of future cash flows in present-day currency.
      </p>
      <p>
        A dollar in your hand today is considered to be worth more (or possibly less) than a dollar in a year's time, because of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Inflation</strong> - The value of a "dollar" (or whatever unit of currency) generally decreases over time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Opportunity Cost</strong> - If you receive the dollar now, you can spend it on something valuable or invest it and earn interest.  If you don't receive it for a year, you can't do whatever you would have done with it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Risk</strong> - The person or company that says they're going to pay you a dollar in a year's time might go bankrupt and not pay up.  The project that you're expecting to generate millions in revenue might fail.  The economy might tank.  Etc. Etc. Etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By calculating future income in today's dollars, one can get a better idea of the real value of a project, and make meaningful comparisons between different strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never invest in a project with negative NPV, unless there are strategic or other compelling reasons to do so.  However, remember to also consider the <a href="CostOfDoingNothing.html">CostOfDoingNothing</a>.

        NPV is one of those reasons that managers are always pushing to get software projects completed as soon as possible.  Getting paid today is better than getting paid tomorrow.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The formula for calculating NPV is
      </p>
      <code>
        NPV = future_dollars * (1 + discount_rate) ^ (- number_of_periods)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        For example, with a discount rate of 10%, one dollar to be received a year from now is worth
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          00 * (1 + 0.10)^(-1) = 0.90909
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        in today's dollars.  A dollar to be received three years from now is worth
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          00 * (1 + 0.10)^(-3) = 0.75131
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Discount rates are based upon inflation, interest rates, and uncertainty.  A risky project has a higher discount rate than a less risky project.  The discount rate is sometimes called the <em>hurdle rate</em>, because a project with a high discount rate needs a larger payoff to be worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
        What must keep in mind is that all of the factors used to determine this value, ie discount_rate (interest_rate, inflation), number_of_periods, are estimates, as is the calculated value. 
      </p>

        Another way to look at NPV is to ask "How much money in a bank today would it take to generate the specified cash flow?".  Sometimes this is useful, sometimes it is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, to generate $1.00 in one year, if the current bank interest rate is 10%:
      </p>
      <code>
        x + .10 x = 1<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          1 x = 1
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        x = 1/1.1<br/>
        x = .909090(...)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Same answer :)
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach is especially useful for evaluating continuing, constant cash flows. For example, what is the net present value of $20,000 per year (starting now, for eternity)?  At 10% interest, you would need $200,000 in the bank to generate said stream.  Hence NPV = $200,000.
