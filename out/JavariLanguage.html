        Very cool thing. It adds C++ like const modifiers, only much betters to Java language. Unlike other language research this is very limited in scope and quite possibly not a far fetch to be "mixed-in" next versions of Java (or C# for that matter).

      <code>
        class Account {<br/>
        /* <strong>this-mutable</strong> */ Account peer;<br/>
        <strong>final</strong> int x;<br/>
        <strong>assignable</strong> doesntMatter;<br/>
        <strong>readonly</strong> int <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <strong>readonly</strong> Account getPeer() { return <br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The readonly properties will do a transitive-closure to the object graph, so that it cannot be subverted through calls like composite.getPart().modifyStateOfThePart(). This is a complain I had a long time about java, that they dropped the const keyword from C++, Javari's concepts are that and much more .

        <em></em>MichaelErnst presented a paper about <a href="JavariLanguage.html">JavariLanguage</a> at <a href="OopslaOhFour.html">OopslaOhFour</a>, by the way.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ernst's paper on Javari at <a href="OopslaOhFour.html">OopslaOhFour</a> is an earlier proposal that includes only the <strong>readonly</strong> keyword. The <a href="OopslaOhFive.html">OopslaOhFive</a> paper adds mechanisms to control assignability and also to deal with generic types more effectively.

        Instead of <a href="AddingEpicycles.html">AddingEpicycles</a>, why don't they give every object a .freeze and .thaw method, so you control its constancy at the object's interface, not at the interface of its containing object?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Because that is something else entirely. .freeze and .thaw are dynamic, whereas these are statically checked and enfored (for some </em>TypesMatter).<em></em>
