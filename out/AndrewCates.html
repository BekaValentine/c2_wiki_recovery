        I live in Cambridge UK and work for this <a href="http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/children-charity.htm">http://www.soschildrensvillages.org.uk/children-charity.htm</a> and am especially concerned about the Aids Africa orphans: <a href="http://aids-children.org">http://aids-children.org</a>

        My best friend is <a href="DuncanHarris.html">DuncanHarris</a>. But I note he only says in return that he knows me! However, he's a nice guy even if he disowns me.

           He says that after that infamous incident in the pub, even going this far was pretty big of him.

        I think Wiki is very interesting and although I am most interested in the evolution of ideas and rules, and the principles of Wiki in general than in programming history (but I am a mathematician and kind of program badly). I think I'll stick a wiki up somewhere soon.

        I started a brief discuss on the nature of belief systems and how they evolve but it is too difficult to know where to start so I've given up on that one. But I am still a studier of beliefs and cultures :o)

        Also I own MazeWiki

        Hello Andrew, you left a note on <a href="RolandKaufmann.html">RolandKaufmann</a>.  I do not recall meeting you, although we might have had some e-mail contact.
        Would you like to discuss <a href="MathQuizOne.html">MathQuizOne</a> Q3? Happy Easter, Roland.
