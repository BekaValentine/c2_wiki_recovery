        A fabulous English weekly newspaper with international editions.

        <em>This newspaper tells the truth as it sees it, which is free-market Adam Smith style.  It sometimes suggests that drugs should be legalized (but regulated and, of course, taxed).</em> Also, voluntary prostitution.

        What publication tells the truth other than the way it sees it? It's also socially liberal (in the wider  non-US-pejorative-meaning of the word), fairly fiscally conservative, pro-gun control, pro choice, pro-selective schools, and supports the idea of a war on Iraq. In some of these it can construct a good argument, in some it's determined to ignore most evidence that doesn't support its position. And - despite concentrating largely on the world of business and the West - it has a wider international coverage than any of its US competitors.

        An excellent read. I've been a subscriber for years.

        Once one gets used to the magazine's general opinions on politics, it's written in such a way that one doesn't have to agree with it to understand its points and be educated by it. In my opinion, at least. -- <a href="BrentNewhall.html">BrentNewhall</a>
