        I added the quotes to greatest above. If you read the lists under <a href="GoodArchitect.html">GoodArchitect</a> <a href="BadArchitect.html">BadArchitect</a> and honestly apply them to Frank you would have to call him a <a href="BadArchitect.html">BadArchitect</a>. But his architecture has been applauded world wide. This raises the question, "Which type of Architect produces the best architecture?" in either software or buildings. History of both fields suggests that <a href="BadArchitect.html">BadArchitect</a> s are in the lead. -- <a href="ThirdWaveDave.html">ThirdWaveDave</a>

        Frank Lloyd Wright built the S.C. Johnson office building in Racine Wisconsin. A graceful highrise made of brick and glass. He also designed the futuristic office furniture to go in the building.

      <p>
        Standing alone, it is a beautiful building. Unfortunately, it is smack dab in the middle of the S.C. Johnson factory campus and it is surrounded by some of the most drab, depressing architecture of the last 100 years. In the context of its environment, it looks horrible. Or at least tragic.
