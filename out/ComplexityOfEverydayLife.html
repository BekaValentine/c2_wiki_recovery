        Complexity Of Everyday Life
      </h1>
      <p>
        Donald Norman wrote a think piece in the
        July 19, 1996 issue of the Risks Form (comp.risks).
        He leads off with
      </p>
      <code>
        "I am alternately amused and terrified by the ever-<br/>
        increasing complexity of everyday life.  Technology <br/>
        provides more and more functions essential to our<br/>
        life. More and more artifacts pervade our lives and<br/>
        make themselves essential to our lifestyles.  Many<br/>
        of the new technologies involve communication<br/>
        networks that interconnect large numbers of systems. <br/>
        These lead to an increase in the complexity of<br/>
        societal interactions and the sheer number of<br/>
        contacts among people. As a result, the number of <br/>
        potential weak points increase, and thereby the<br/>
        dangers."<br/>

        There's not much new in the rest of the article, but
        Norman does take a lot of what we already know, and
        wraps it together into a thoughtful piece.

        Given recent problems with the West Coast power grid,
        AOL outages, and intermittent domain name server
        corruption on the internet, Norman's article is timely.
