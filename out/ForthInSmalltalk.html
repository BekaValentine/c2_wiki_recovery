        Forth In Smalltalk
      </h1>

        <em>Ahh, Forth.</em>

        It must have been ten years ago that I tried
        to explain the essence of Smalltalk to my brother, a Forth            
        programmer.  We found common ground by programming -- one day in   
        Forth, another in Smalltalk.  In Forth we wrote the essential
        Smalltalk: object identity and method dispatch; in Smalltalk
        we wrote the essential Forth: dictionary, words and builds-does.
        We both showed off our respective environments with great skill,
        pride and confidence.  Oh, if only all programming could be
        so educational. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
