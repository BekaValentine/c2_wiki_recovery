        Fat Book

      <p>
        All I see in the computer section of bookstores today are <a href="FatBook.html">FatBook</a>s -- each is over a thousand pages, and full of screen shots and such -- usually with a lousy index.
      </p>
      <p>
        I long for the days when you could learn everything you needed from <a href="SkinnyBook.html">SkinnyBook</a>s, like K&R or for that matter, almost anything <a href="BrianKernighan.html">BrianKernighan</a> wrote.

        The rise and rise of GUIs probably has a lot to do with this. For example, here's an extract from page 1 of  <a href="ManagingProjectsWithMake.html">ManagingProjectsWithMake</a>: "The command <strong>$ make program</strong> indicates that you want to "make" a version--usually the latest version-- of <em>program</em>". Now imagine how many half-page images would be needed to illustrate the same sentence if the book were, instead, ManagingProjectsWithVC++6

      <code>
        Exactly none:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        "1. Select Build --> Build from the menu."<br/>
      </code>

        Haha! Right. It could be done that way, but how likely would it be that it were? So, an interesting question is why the <a href="FatBook.html">FatBook</a>s provide so many pictures when text like that above would do?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's how I do it all the time. I think the pictures are there to pad out the book, justify a big price tag, and increase visibility when on bookstore shelves.</em>

        It's difficult to understand how anyone could learn much about <em>programming</em> from a book packed with mouse event scripts. <em>Or command lines for that matter.</em> Except that command line commands very often are short programs.

        I've decided that <a href="LotsOfScreenShots.html">LotsOfScreenShots</a> is definitely a bad thing.  --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        See <a href="UmlDistilled.html">UmlDistilled</a> for an example of an informative and influencial book that is also thin in spite of being about (in part) pictures.
