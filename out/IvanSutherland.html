        Ivan Sutherland

        Ivan wrote <a href="SketchPad.html">SketchPad</a> which introduced a half dozen
        or more wonderful concepts to the field of interactive
        computer graphics.  <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> once asked Ivan how he had
        been able to solve so many hard problems so early.  
        Ivan replied that he
        just didn't know that they were supposed to be hard.

        He was later involved in very early <a href="VirtualReality.html">VirtualReality</a> and 3D modeling work at the <a href="UniversityOfUtah.html">UniversityOfUtah</a> and elsewhere.

        He received the ACM <a href="TuringAward.html">TuringAward</a> in 1988:

        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>For his pioneering and visionary contributions to computer graphics, starting with Sketchpad, and continuing after. Sketchpad, though written twenty-five years ago, introduced many techniques still important today. These include a display file for screen refresh, a recursively traversed hierarchical structure for modeling graphical objects, recursive methods for geometric transformations, and an object oriented programming style. Later innovations include a "Lorgnette" for viewing stereo or colored images, and elegant algorithms for registering digitized views, clipping polygons, and representing surfaces with hidden lines.</dd>

        Sutherland seems to be dyslexic: he admits to difficulty with spelling, and didn't learn to read until the third grade. He says that this led to his interest in computer graphics: <a href="http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1712558627021572786#9m45s">http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=1712558627021572786#9m45s</a>
