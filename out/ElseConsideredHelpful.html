        This example better illustrates the need for an "elsif" construct than just plain "else".  (And also the need for whitespace!)

        First: Thank you for this Page. We need it to keep the balance (like with every refactoring that has a reverse refactoring). It reminds us of the OverDoseEffect.
      </p>
      <p>
        But still: when I was reading the first example (sorry I'm unfamiliar with VB) my thoughts were (in this sequence)
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Damned, he has found a good counter example."</dd>

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"ok if that badlynamedthingthere is a date ..."</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"... then it gets formatted and somesuch ..."</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"ok, I think I understand that."</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Why is he not returning now?"</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"There must be something more about the variable that he wants to do, regardless whether it is a date or not"</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Whatever that is, it is not in the opening else block."</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Goto end of block. Where is that block ending?"</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Ah, lots of else-ifs here. Is he going around returns?"</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Nothing after the end of my block. All that parsing was for nothing." <em>Disappointment</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"The second solution isn't nice to read either, but some of the effects stem from the lengthy syntax and the bad indentation <em>[that has improved now]</em>. Anyway, I can understand every block in isolation. That's better localized code, that's easier to parse (mentally) and easier to break into parts for the next refactoring we're doing."</dd>

        It happens that I'm not doing anything between the final "End If" and "End Sub". But I could. Tomorrow, I may decide to add some code there <em>(which is why </em>MultipleExitPoints can be really annoying and confusing)<em>. And I can find other code that uses "else", where the "End If" is followed by other code, or the entire "If-</em>EndIf" block is in a loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the second example, I find it's easier to understand each statement in isolation -- until I get to the "xmlElmt.Text = CStr(pvValue)" statement at the end: While it looks like "unconditional execution" <em>(to one unaccustomed to the FORTH idiom mentioned on </em><a href="ElseConsideredSmelly.html">ElseConsideredSmelly</a>)<em>, it's really executed "in all cases other than the ones mentioned above." </em>(I find this "do X when none of the other rules apply" logic common in business requirements.)<em> In this case, the final "else" happens to be the most common case. But in other syntatically similar cases, the final "else" can be the least common case, making "unconditional execution" very far from the correct understanding.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the 63 lines of this function (in the original production code) argue more strongly for its refactoring than the presence of "else" or "ElseIf" clauses.
        Even if I pulled the entire If-ElseIf-EndIf block to another subroutine, I'd still use the ElseIf syntax. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>"</em>ElseIf" is a "select-case" -- for use when, due to limitations of the programming language, you can't do select-case.<em> -- </em><a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        We can eliminate all "else" clauses by doing early exits from the subroutine.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me this is the clearest. It keeps the indenting to reasonable levels and simplifies the tests because each test gets to assume more and more facts. It's a natural kind of filtering waterfall. Lots of nested if-then-elses make the relatively simple logic much more complicated.  -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Also, we can eliminate all "else" clauses by using polymorphism.  A professor of mine explained that if you have too many else clauses, you probably need to use a polymorphic object whose subclasses implement the different clauses.  Seems to me "else" clauses (and for that matter "if" clauses") can be replaced with an indexed call to a polymorphic class.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This appears to be a far better argument.  I agree that the clarity of the code code be improved greatly by through polymorphic classes.  I find it difficult to determine if "Is Nothing", "IsNull", and "IsEmpty" are variations on a single case and why they differ from "</em>IsMissing."  It would be much clearer to use a class factory to create the appropriate PropertyElement object (with a clear name!) and then be able to call Write on that object.<em></em>
      </p>

        Unfortunately, all four of the different varieties of nullity (Nothing, Null, Empty, Missing) here are VB's fault. Still, it seems to me like some sort of canonicalization should be happening upstream. Unless this is the only client of these values, I bet there's lots of testing for nullity elsewhere in the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Date formatting surely wants to be factored out. Is this the only place in the software that dates are converted to strings?
      </p>
      <p>
        The "create the XML Element and write pvValue type information into it" part of the routine should be separated from the part that actually computes the serialization.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I reckon we want something along the following lines. Please excuse any flubs arising from the fact that I don't know much VB.

        This is a beautiful example of the sort of thing that would be easier in a language with <a href="GenericFunction.html">GenericFunction</a>s. (Because you want to do this via polymorphism, but in a conventional OO language you don't have any way of attaching polymorphic behaviour to built-in types like Date.) The only one I'm familiar with is <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> (though <a href="DylanLanguage.html">DylanLanguage</a> has them too), but here's how the code might look in a hypothetical VB-with-generic-functions.

        That's painfully verbose, largely because VB <em>is</em> painfully verbose. But it's very
        clear. And a lot of the verbosity is because of having to deal separately with Null,
        Nothing, Empty and Missing; if those cases can be canonicalized upstream then the code
        becomes correspondingly shorter.
