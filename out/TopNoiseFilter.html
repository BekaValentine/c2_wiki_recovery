           That's purely anecdotal claims.

Ironically, it was generally VB and MS-Access that were its main competitor, and those two tools are royal pieces of crap in terms of elegance and reliability. (I believe you implied C++ was a main competitor, which does not jive with my experience at all. Customers were almost always migrating their xBase to VB and Access, with <a href="PowerBuilder.html">PowerBuilder</a>, Paradox, and Delphi distant seconds.) Your experience with it appears to be based on a single specific product category or niche. I used it for a wide variety of projects. Further, if it didn't fall out of style, many of its weaknesses would be fixed or shored up via new R&D spending. Faddism made its demise a self-fulfilling prophecy.

           Systems programmers often have no sense of proportion regarding user needs and would probably over-engineer some parts and under-engineer others, and use techniques that a new maintenance programmer would likely scratch their head over. Their sense of "good" software is based on a remote world view. They become systems programmers for a reason: usually because they don't like the messy grey requirements world of cubicle-ware.

        I'm a little offended by that because I consider myself a highly logical person. Perhaps your question had no logical response, at least not known to man.

"Logic" in the strict sense is not always <a href="TheRightToolForTheJob.html">TheRightToolForTheJob</a> when dealing with <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, unfortunately. Many want software engineering to be about rigorous and definitive science and math so much so that they <strong>inject false rigor</strong> into the discipline, using <a href="ArgumentByElegance.html">ArgumentByElegance</a> or false canons instead.

           <em>The study of fallacies, of which </em><a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> is an example, is a part of logic, so how is it orthogonal? As for your paraphrase, you did include some information about logic. However, it wasn't relevant to the surrounding text except as a lead-in to the <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a>. As for fixing my statement, it's indeed trivial to fix since it doesn't need fixing.<em></em>

           Whether <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> is a fallacy is irrelevant here. Your summary assessment implies addressing logic is not there (regardless of what else may be included).

           <strong>It's made to appear that my responses are also irrational</strong>. It depends on what we are calling "logical" (i.e. definition of "logical").

We are arguing over excessively expansive generalities here such that we'll likely get nowhere. The devil's in the details.

        I replied to something that was an <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> attack, I would note. <a href="GoldenRule.html">GoldenRule</a> anyone? Plus, the question frequently comes up in these discussions, "how can so many academics be wrong?" The explanation I offer requires giving a motivational model of their behavior, which can be viewed as an <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> attack (and perhaps "is", depending on the definition one uses). If somebody devotes a lot of time and attention to something, it's human nature to "protect" the value of that time and attention, often in irrational ways, regardless of whether you are an academic or not. Humans are humans. It's often seen in the scientific world that proponents of a theory are intense defenders of their own theory, even when such theories later turn out to be wrong. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some claim various "negative" models of my motivation also, such that I'm allegedly a "post-graduate flunky" who lashes out at academia as revenge over a negative experience in college. If such is true, I'm not consciously aware of such motivation. I try to call things as I see them, but admit that hidden human bias may be sneaking in somehow somewhere. I'm only human, just like you. Complaints about my content and my counter-claims don't appear to be backed by solid textual and clear-cut listable logic evidence though, but rather a form of "if you were smart like me, you'd just see that you are wrong". The <strong>specific and explicit train of logic doesn't have to be document-able to some</strong>, and to me, this is stupid. "You'll just feeeeeel it if you get smart enough" is bullshit. Fuck feelings, write it down in <a href="ItemizedClearLogic.html">ItemizedClearLogic</a>! --top

        If you feel vague round-about scattered obtuse logic is "better" than <a href="ItemizedClearLogic.html">ItemizedClearLogic</a>, then we'll have to disagree on that. Most <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> I'm sure will find that an odd stance. And <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> statements, I as interpret the term, can be on-topic. If the pattern of writing behavior is the subject of discourse, then speculations about the motivation and psychology of the author is on-topic. Granted, it may also be rude and uncomfortable, but sometimes categories overlap. Others have (rudely) speculated on my motivations without complaints from others. I smell a double-standard. If broken-taillight-syndrome is happening (explained in <a href="TopOnWhyTopIsHated.html">TopOnWhyTopIsHated</a>), then the <strong>motivations of the accuser matter</strong> and are on-topic.

        "It's extra work" is fucking copout. I didn't claim something was "clearly and logically better/canonized".
