        <strong>Addressing the question of "What is an </strong><a href="ImpedanceMismatch.html">ImpedanceMismatch</a>?"  ...and its use in the ImpedanceMismatchMetaphor:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a metaphor, based on <a href="ElectricalImpedanceMismatch.html">ElectricalImpedanceMismatch</a>.

      <p>
        So, the original definition, of an <a href="ElectricalImpedanceMismatch.html">ElectricalImpedanceMismatch</a>, led to the ImpedanceMismatchMetaphor, used in...

      <ul>
        <li>
           BusinessImpedanceMismatch describes the occurrence where the ability to change a corporation is misaligned with the ability to change software systems, or vice versa.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="DatabaseImpedanceMismatch.html">DatabaseImpedanceMismatch</a> = incompatibility between the design of database(s) and application host language(s).  Database processing is based on set operations -- a concept not generally supported in host languages.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RelationalHostLanguageImpedanceMismatch.html">RelationalHostLanguageImpedanceMismatch</a> = general incompatibility with host languages (not limited to OO) -- such as the fact the NULL values are not supported in most host languages.

           <a href="TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatch.html">TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalImpedanceMismatch</a>: The impedance caused by the <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a>. There are many differences between what can be done in SQL and what should actually be possible in relational algebra. A better relational language (like <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>) could eliminate this impedance. The big question here is, how much of the <a href="ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch.html">ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch</a> is in fact caused by the impedance between SQL and a true relational language (or  pure relational algebra).

        Between development languages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           With multi-dimensional arrays, like A(X,Y,Z) -- In FORTRAN, the "X" dimension changes most rapidly, as you "scan through physical memory, but in most other languages "Z" changes most rapidly.  So, when doing cross-language in-memory data passing (such as between C and FORTRAN), programs of one language must declare and use array arguments in the opposite order of programs in the other language.
        </li>
        <li>
           Calling conventions:  In "C", the caller pops arguments from the stack after a return, but in other languages (like Pascal), the subroutine unwinds the arguments from stack on return.

      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="BusinessSystemsAnalyst.html">BusinessSystemsAnalyst</a> is usually concerned that a system design can be changed (after production implementation) easily enough to match how he foresees business conditions changing.

      <p>
        SerializationImpedenceMismatch: when the serialization formats of two processes don't match, usually due to a version incomparability.
