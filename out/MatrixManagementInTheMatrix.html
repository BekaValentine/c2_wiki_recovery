        Matrix Management In The Matrix
      </h1>
      <p>
        Management puts you in a tank.  You stay in that tank.  Life is an illusion.  Management is an illusion.  Once you realize this, you can jump twenty feet in the air, dodge bullets, and generally Get Things Done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this just <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a>, or is this how <a href="MatrixManagement.html">MatrixManagement</a> really works?
      </p>
      <p>
        But what you've got to realise is there is no tank and that it is not you who can "jump twenty feet in the air, dodge bullets, and generally Get Things Done" but it is you that bends the world around you to make others believe this.
