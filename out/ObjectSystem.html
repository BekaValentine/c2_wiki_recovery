        Object System
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="ObjectSystem.html">ObjectSystem</a> is a collection of interacting and static logical 'objects'.  In a traditional <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>, this would include processes, the scheduler, files in the <a href="FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a>, <a href="DeviceDriver.html">DeviceDriver</a>s, and so on.  In a broader sense, it could include WebPages, external services (or even 'service clouds'), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with objects in the real world, what constitutes 'an' object in an <a href="ObjectSystem.html">ObjectSystem</a> depends upon both the distinctions we (as observers) wish to make and the degree to which the system interface conveniently supports manipulating a 'view' as a single object.  (As an example: just because we can logically treat the 10th byte of every file in a particular directory as an organized collection-object with certain mutable properties doesn't mean the tools available to us allow us to do so in practice.)
      </p>
      <p>
        One would generally discuss an <a href="ObjectSystem.html">ObjectSystem</a> in the context of an <a href="ObjectBrowser.html">ObjectBrowser</a>, much as one discusses a <a href="FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a> in the context of a file or directory 'browser'.   In this case the <a href="ObjectSystem.html">ObjectSystem</a> constitutes a set of browseable objects.
