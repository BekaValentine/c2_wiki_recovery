        Kents Talk At Xp Immersion Two
      </h1>
      <p>
        Kent showed up dressed in overalls and a baseball cap on backwards, presumably representing the everyman worker for his talk Wednesday night, which was mostly about <a href="FredrickWinslowTaylor.html">FredrickWinslowTaylor</a>, and how everything stupid in software development can be traced back to his methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        "In the past, man was first. In the future, the system must be first." was the opening quote from Taylor.
      </p>
      <p>
        With his last slide Kent suggested that the predominant software development paradigm has been a Taylorist approach to BuildThings. He contrasted this with a post-modernist paradigm for XP as a Conversation. Sounds like we could express the <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a> for XP as <a href="ConversationMetaphor.html">ConversationMetaphor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        During Q&A, Kent said that humility is the key attribute of a good XP programmer.

        Humility appears to be a recurring theme on Wiki as well. <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=humility">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=humility</a>

      <p>
        <em></em>BenFranklin said that <a href="HumilityIsKey.html">HumilityIsKey</a> to business success. It would make sense that it applies to programming as well.<em></em>
