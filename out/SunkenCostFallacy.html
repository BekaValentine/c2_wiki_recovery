        Sunken Cost Fallacy
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hundreds of soldiers have died trying to take Hill 459. And our generals have a new plan to win the war without it.
      </p>
      <p>
        But we are going to take that hill tonight, so those soldiers won't have died in vain!
      </p>

        <em>Didn't Bush use this reasoning to justify staying in Iraq longer?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Decisions should based primarily on current and forward costs-versus-benefits, not prior ones.</em>
