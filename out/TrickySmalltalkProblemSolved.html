        Tricky Smalltalk Problem Solved
      </h1>
      <p>
        An old friend sent me a note recently asking for advice
        about a problem he was having with Smalltalk.  He explained
        the situation well.  It involved inconvenient binding of 
        <em>super</em> in an exception handler that was providing
        the default behavior in a double dispatch.  I didn't have
        a slick fix, so I had to get philosophical ...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I worked through your problem and see what is going wrong.  
        I haven't faced the same thing and solved it so I have 
        nothing clever to offer.  I have found my self caught 
        in similar fixes and here is what I've learned:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Smalltalk has some sophisticated features that are so fundamental that they almost never let me down.  They include: message dispatch, inheritance, garbage collection.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Smalltalk also has some clever features that can be real timesavers when used sparingly and within proven idioms.  Examples include: super, perform:, blocks, doesNotUnderstand:, value, processes, asSymbol, deepCopy, Behavior, weak pointers.  (Can you add to this list?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Whenever I am surprised by Smalltalk's inability to do something, I eventually end up doing more of the former and less of the latter.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You know, I've also found that I can impress beginners by 
        dragging out one of Smalltalk's neat little features.  
        But, to impress Smalltalk pros I have to show them a 
        clever use of plain old objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this helps should you have to yank the
        machinery and replace it with something that, at first, 
        seems stupid and repetitive.

      <p>
        This sounds a place to apply a pattern I have I'll call
        "Refactor Problem Expressions".
      </p>
      <p>
        I assume, from your description, that the problem method
        contains an expression like:
      </p>
      <code>
        "..."<br/>
        super doSomethingWith: anArgument.<br/>
        "..."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and "super" is binding to an inconvenient receiver.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to replace the "super" with an indirection, like
        this:
      </p>
      <code>
        "..."<br/>
        self doubleDispatcher doSomethingWith: anArgument<br/>
        "..."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now, the implementation of "doubleDispatcher" can be
        experimented with until you like it. Of course, there is
        probably a better name than "doubleDispatcher" that you can
        use.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of the pattern is to isolate the problem
        in its own method that you can hack on while you find your
        favorite implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the existence of this problem usually means
        that the original expression is hard for a reader to understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I might refactor again, into something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        "..."<br/>
        self doubleDispatchWith: anArgument.<br/>
        "..."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and put this indirection in the "doubleDispatchWith:"
        method, like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        doubleDispatchWith: anArgument<br/>
        ^self doubleDispatcher doSomethingWith: anArgument<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now, you can rename "doubleDispatchWith:" into
        something that names the operation you were trying to do,
        and the code becomes even easier to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time, I find that the "extra" indirections have,
        in fact, helped me identify and provide the seams and hooks
        that should have been in the original method.
