        Dead.

      <p>
        <em>Er, or not!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I think NOT!  
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm inclined to agree. I saw him serving at the chip shop on the corner of my street the other day. He was pickling eggs at the time. He swore by Sarsons and not some inferior supermarket own-brand. Well, that's the King of Rock and Roll for you, innit?

        Best X-Files quote... "He's the kind of person who still thinks Elvis is dead."

        Or, from <em>Men in Black</em>: "Nah, Elvis isn't dead. He just went home."
      </p>
      <p>
        Heh. I thought he'd just left the building.

        According to <a href="MostlyHarmless.html">MostlyHarmless</a> he wasn't abducted, he went willingly.

        The "<strong>ElvisLives</strong>" cultural phenomenon presents a unique opportunity to observe an Osiris- or Jesus- style resurrection myth as it actually develops. Again. -- <a href="PhilipCraigPlumlee.html">PhilipCraigPlumlee</a>

        Even if he didn't die as reported in 1977, you'd think at least by now he'd have fallen down some stairs or something. How long will the rumors of his survival persist? -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        Elvis is dead you idiots the king of rock'n'roll music died in 1977 age 47

      <p>
        <em>More like 42 years old! Does anyone have a clue as to when the guy who </em>'made<em>' Elvis, Colonel Parker (who went 50-50 with the King) died? Elvis was pretty docile with the Colonel who was a father figure to him. Elvis was raised without a father.</em> "Colonel" Tom Parker died in Las Vegas in January 1997, aged 87.

        Are you sure (that he is dead)? Most people have evidence that he is dead. Are they really just suspicions? I mean how old is he now? 150 yrs? And he sang love songs. Ewww!

      </p>
      <p>
        Had he been alive today he would be only 69 years old (2004-1935).
