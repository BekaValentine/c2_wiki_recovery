        Clipboard Alert
      </h1>
      <p>
        Any time you copy and paste code, THINK!  It's almost always a sign of a mistake -- If you have information to duplicate, there are usually dozens of better ways to do it.

        I've seen clipboard replacements for Windows that do all kinds of snazzy things.  What about one that detects copy and pasting of anything more than a single symbol, it could have a little angry avatar of <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> pop up and frown at the programmer.

        However, cut and paste should be OK, since then the programmer is refactoring.
