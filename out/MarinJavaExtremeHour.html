        Marin Java Extreme Hour
      </h1>
      <p>
        The next meeting of the <a href="MarinJava.html">MarinJava</a> Discussion Group will be this coming
        Wednesday, January 26th, 2000 at 7:00pm at Royal Ground Coffee in downtown San
        Rafael, Marin County, California, USA.  (Marin County is on the other side of the Golden Gate Bridge from San Francisco.)
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll be trying the <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> exercise.  We'll attempt to spec, design and ship a hypothetical product within one hour of ideal engineering time, using all the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        To prepare for this exercise, please check out the <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> page for general information, and the <a href="MarinJavaExtremeHour.html">MarinJavaExtremeHour</a> page (this page) for information specific to our group. You may also want to review some of the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> resources listed on the <a href="MarinJava.html">MarinJava</a> website <a href="http://www.jera.com/marinjava/">http://www.jera.com/marinjava/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Definitely plan on showing up for this one. I'm still kicking myself for
        missing the <a href="SiliconValleyExtremeHour.html">SiliconValleyExtremeHour</a> last December.

        So far, we have several candidate ideas for a product:
      </p>
      <p>
        Automatic diaper changer (an <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a> -- others might call it a "nappy changer").  Just the thing for yuppie scum: all the fun of a baby, but none of the mess or smell.  When baby needs a change, just lower him/her into the automatic diaper changer and let the machine do the rest.  Possible product liability issues mean a high quality process and extensive testing are essential.
      </p>
      <p>
        A programmer beverage delivery system.  At most software companies,
        programmers get free soda.  However, programmers waste valuable time
        getting up from their computers and walking to the break room to get soda.
        Management would like an automated system whereby programmers can request a
        beverage from their desk and have said beverage delivered to them in a
        timely fashion, thus allowing programmer to work uninterrupted.
      </p>
      <p>
        We also toyed with doing a real (but <em>tiny</em>) software product, but decided the infrastructure issues were too complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any other suggestions?
