        I'm a software developer in the Seattle area.  About me: computer games, patterns, science fiction ( especially HardSF ), C++, Lua, wintel, <a href="DataHand.html">DataHand</a>.

        I think that Wiki is brilliant, a new paradigm.  My first visit was at least a year ago, and at the time I didn't "get it".  I was looking for software patterns and found things like <a href="BodyFollowsEyes.html">BodyFollowsEyes</a> which confused me.  This time, I'm actually contributing.  Subversive!

        <a href="ReflectiveArticulation.html">ReflectiveArticulation</a> was my first attempt at writing.  Hopefully I didn't make too much of a hash out of it.  :-)
