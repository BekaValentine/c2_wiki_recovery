        Requirements Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        You must:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Know what is a requirement (this is a difficult task)
        </li>
        <li>
           Know which are your requirements
        </li>
        <li>
           Allocate them to software, hardware, people
        </li>
        <li>
           Know when they change
        </li>
        <li>
           Know the effects of the change
        </li>
        <li>
           Trace requirements
        </li>
        <li>
           Know their status
        </li>
        <li>
           Know how important they are to your customer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then you manage them.

        Contour is made by Jama Software, it's a web-based tool for requirements management and collaboration.

        I've been playing with <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> recently, and quickly saw the potential of a wiki as a requirements management tool. The dynamic nature of wiki seems to have great potential as an RM tool, particularly since it can allow all stakeholders to be active participants in the process of gathering and validating requirements. However...
      </p>
      <p>
        I am by no means an expert in requirements management, but here are some of the issues as I see it (coming from my <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> viewpoint).
      </p>
      <p>
        Traceability:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pro: Links can be placed in pages to link (trace) to their source requirements
        </li>
        <li>
           Con: There is no automatic way to get a traceability matrix, showing which links are suspect
          <ul>
            <li>
               Many wikis' data storage formats are simple enough that it should be very little trouble to make a script to do this.  I don't know about <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> specifically, though.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Content:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Con: Entry and editing of non-text (e.g., pictures, tables, etc.) requirements is clumsy at best
        </li>
        <li>
           Con: Refactoring can be clumsy - multi page views would be nice to facilitate movement of content from one page to another
          <ul>
            <li>
               Sounds like a browser problem.  Try <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> -- the tabs should help significantly.  There are also a number of browsers that can split the display between different pages -- maybe <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> can do this as well.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        History (CM):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Con: Can't tag specific versions of a requirement set as a "release" while changes to the documents continue
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I wondered if anyone else has thought about wiki for RM, and not surprisingly, a quick Google search turned up this interesting link:

        Users landing on this page should take a look at <a href="http://RequirementsTeam.com.">http://RequirementsTeam.com.</a> Yes! this is a shameful ad by the developer who is struggling to get exposure.
