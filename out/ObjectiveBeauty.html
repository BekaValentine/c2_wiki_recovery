        Objective Beauty
      </h1>
      <p>
        To someone who said objective beauty exists, but couldn't define what it was, see Blake Gopnik's February 8, 2004 article on the subject in the Washington Post:

        Some flaws in the article
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Article has few scientific details(what was the control experiment, how many subjects were tested)
        </li>
        <li>
           Brain activity is easy to see, hard to qualify. The article did not tie that to other attempts at EKG/MRI brain activity experiments
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>You only said that because the skeptical regions of your brain increased their activity.</em>
      </p>

        Not necessarily. It might have been purely anti-social. ;)
