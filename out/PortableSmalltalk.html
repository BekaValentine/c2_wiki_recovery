        Portable Smalltalk
      </h1>
      <p>
        PS, standing for "Portable Smalltalk" or more aptly "Peter's Smalltalk", was PARC's first and only implementation of Smalltalk-80 on a conventional (rather than microprogrammed) processor.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was developed by <a href="PeterDeutsch.html">PeterDeutsch</a> and <a href="AllanSchiffman.html">AllanSchiffman</a> circa 1982
        although Peter did almost all of the work in the end. They published a paper about it in the 1984 ACM Principles of Programming Languages conference called "Efficient Implementation of the Smalltalk-80 System".  <a href="http://www.daimi.au.dk/~ups/OOVM/papers/deutsch-schiffman-popl84.pdf">http://www.daimi.au.dk/~ups/OOVM/papers/deutsch-schiffman-popl84.pdf</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        PS pioneered <a href="JustInTimeCompilation.html">JustInTimeCompilation</a> (which the paper calls "DynamicTranslation"), <a href="InlineCaching.html">InlineCaching</a> for message sends (i.e., polymorphic function calls) and multiple context (i.e., reified activations) representations. Subsequent implementations of the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and Smalltalk-like languages would use all of these techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        PS was written entirely in <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> for the Motorola 68000. It was originally targeted to a bare metal (no OS) SUN-1 workstation hand built by Allan from Andy Bechtolsheim's second set of PC boards. Later it would be rehosted on the SUN-2 running SunOS and shipped as <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a>'s first product, Objectworks version 2.3. It wasn't portable, of course, but the successor implementation -- <a href="HighlyPortableSmalltalk.html">HighlyPortableSmalltalk</a> -- was.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other people who worked on PS were Mike Braca, Bob Hagmann and Mike Roberts. The port to the Sun-2 was done by Ron Carter and Russ Pencin, then of Xerox in Texas, later of <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a>.
