        Since 1986, I have worked in various software development roles within both large companies with established development processes and startups feeling their way forward. Companies that I have worked for include LogicaPLC, SeerTechnologies, IchatInc and NcrTeradata.

        I first heard about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> this year and I am eager to apply it to my team. So far we've adopted <a href="DelphiUnit.html">DelphiUnit</a> tests and are looking at how we can implement <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> into our build process.
