        On January 16th 2006, as the result of a steward decision regarding his continuing misbehavior following a six week SoftBan, <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> was banned from <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.

      <p>
        Such decisions are undemocratic, erratic, irrational and inexplicable. They don't benefit Wiki.

        Hi David,
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought it appropriate to move this here, since it is really a meta-discussion about the creation of <a href="WhatIsSoa.html">WhatIsSoa</a> rather than discussion about SOA itself:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Fine. You may have some implementations that claim to be "Service oriented" without use of Xml </em><a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>. However are you also claiming that it is not worth mentioning XML within your 30,000 ft high-level technical description of SOA? If so, I would like you to invite <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a> (stated profession of <a href="SoftwareArchitect.html">SoftwareArchitect</a>) to concur with you on this. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>, after many days of inactivity following response to GH observations<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        XML <em>is</em> appropriately mentioned on <a href="WhatIsSoa.html">WhatIsSoa</a>, albeit in a humorous fashion, and further addressed in more detail under <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> where it belongs. I see no reason to otherwise sully an accurate, broad, long-term, universal definition with technology de jour, especially as it is not a required component of an SOA. That said, I would certainly not object if someone wished to add content regarding XML or anything else, as long as it is accurate and fits within the context of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        As this is a Wiki, and as I rightfully claim no editorial control over <a href="WhatIsSoa.html">WhatIsSoa</a> or any other except my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a> is free to alter it as he sees fit. As are you. As is the entire population of the Internet. However, it seems awfully presumptuous of me to explicitly "invite" someone to contribute. That's tantamount to <em>requesting</em> that he or she contribute, and as I am not the boss of anyone here, it is not my place to do so. Indeed, it even seems slightly rude to do so. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> <-- for later attention by dl. If DV is reading and cannot wait, pls let me know
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hi David. I am reading, but will happily await a response at your convenience. No rush.</em> -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> <- Hi Dave, I can give you a "quick incomplete feedback for you to consider". Besides XML (which GH mentioned) I "think" something similar to [loosely coupled systems] "maybe" worth inclusion. I have done lots of readings (and yes lots of MS / others market techure) and that aspect seem to stand out. There could be others. In business terms (easier understood by me) it gets back to "on demand". But I am busy in other "learning and doing" things now and so cannot interact with you in a "considered" fashion. -- dl
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well! As I've mentioned before, I think XML is dealt with in an entirely appropriate and adequate fashion. As for "on demand," I've spent the last twenty-five or so years hearing variations of the underlying sentiment ascribed to everything from COBOL to APL to "PC technology" to Java, so I don't think SOA deserves to be considered "on demand" any more than everything else that's (effectively) been called "on demand." That said, please feel free to include something similar to [loosely coupled systems] on </em><a href="WhatIsSoa.html">WhatIsSoa</a> as you see fit. I'll edit it if, and as, I see fit. That's how this here "Wiki" thing works.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> <- Dave I have added an external reference that talked about loose coupling, in the <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> page that I hope is worth your time to wander by. I do not have original information in any technical topics, although I do form views once I have read a few that are not EchoChambers of each other. -- dl for DV

        Hi David. Thanks for the hello. I'll definitely be singing RubyLanguages praises whenever I see the chance. It seems to already have reasonable support in these parts. -- <a href="RobbieCarlton.html">RobbieCarlton</a> <a href="DeleteWhenRead.html">DeleteWhenRead</a>

        Hi David,
      </p>
      <p>
        This originally appeared on <a href="DotNetDevelopmentMethods.html">DotNetDevelopmentMethods</a> and has been (quite rightfully, IMHO) removed, but I still think the question is interesting...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           ... Nobody cares about developers. -- dl
        </li>
        <li>
           dl, you consistently paint a grim picture of a development environment in which developers are the lowest slime on the food chain -- seemingly less empowered than part-time janitorial staff -- who neither choose their own tools (the <em>executives</em>, of all people, choose these?) nor does anyone care about them. Please let us know where you work so we can avoid it! -- DV
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My response to your "nobody cares about developers" quip was originally meant to be snotty, but I am genuinely curious: Do you really work in an environment where developers are so deprecated, or was "nobody cares..." a bit of colourful hyperbole? -- DV
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I am going away for a day or two. It is not appropriate for me to remark on my existing situation. However "Nobody cares" is a <a href="HaHaOnlySerious.html">HaHaOnlySerious</a> remark. My experiences are developers get treated best in large software producing firms or academic institutions, or real small shops where the developer makes or breaks the entire IT setup. Anywhere else IT is an expenditure, after <a href="DotComBust.html">DotComBust</a> and YtwokExperiences. You can read similar experiences from "trade press", and even in recent posts by other technical people here at C2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        BTW you can help me get a nuts and bolts person interpret the puzzling SG remark I pasted into the <a href="ProxyPattern.html">ProxyPattern</a>. I want to dig deeper as "everyone" is against RPC and remote objects, etc., etc. Thanks -- dl

        Mr. David Liu,
        You are such a busy BossyBoots about anything you can think of, almost like one of those clever little <meta> thingies that are so cute and like to be everywhere. Are you finding this to be an effective tool for your self? I would almost hope so, even though I find it to be an observable waste of effort in some cases. I hope you either make a lot of money for your employers or will do so in the future, for your self. You certainly have a lot of energy and bounciness if nothing else.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Thanks for your unsigned contributions and yes lots of wasted efforts too. Now - any technical topics (e.g. practical stuff in <a href="InformationSecurity.html">InformationSecurity</a> and/or <a href="InteractionDesign.html">InteractionDesign</a>, query I had outstanding such as those in <a href="ProxyPattern.html">ProxyPattern</a>) I can learn from you / your friends contributions here? <a href="CategoryPhysics.html">CategoryPhysics</a> cannot keep my stomach filled.

           I would have preferred if you have given me an opportunity to view the <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> for the technical pages before you apply your changes. How about write in my homepage for a list of pages you intend to work on? Or create a section in my page on the new wordings of your changes so I can apply (or argue with you if I do not agree)? Reasons I may disagree could be
          <ul>
            <li>
               technical contents that have not changed for a long time (e.g. over two years). If the "bad grammar" stayed on that long maybe the bigger problem is TemporalContext changes.
            </li>
            <li>
               And at least once in Nov, I chanced upon a discarded external site material. Found some material of interest to me, wrote about that here, and subsequently another frequent contributor found it worthwhile to add additional related remarks.

The main <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> / <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> pages are a mess, but these got improved when I first started to contribute (I created a <strong>WebServicesOriginal</strong> to bookmark a prior version before I applied my knife to the page).

        David,
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the above comments, since I was the original person to criticize you immediately above, I have been asked to inform you that <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>'s officially designated wiki stewards have now put you under a "SoftBan", which basically means that you are officially (via the authority Ward delegated to the stewards) required to stop posting altogether to c2 wiki for a period of not less than 6 weeks (in round numbers, that would be no sooner than January 15, 2006).
      </p>
      <p>
        The point of this is not so much to punish you, as it is to try to find a way to force you to think about your attitudes and actions. During the period of the SoftBan, the idea is that you could use that time to reflect on ways in which you have acted and spoken inappropriately from the point of view of the community. It is a "time out". Stop and think, deeply; use this period of time to reflect and grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you choose to ignore this requested, and un-enforced SoftBan ("unenforced" is why it's called "soft"), then you may become subject to a "<a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>", where stewards may cut off access to c2 wiki from any and all IP addresses that you appear to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may be subject to a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> even after 2006-Jan-15 if you continue to exercise any poor judgement which wiki Stewards view as antisocial.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of this is currently intended to say that you are permanently persona non grata; the intention is to tell you that you have been ignoring feedback that is essential for you to react to rather than ignore, and that you are now officially on notice that you may not continue to ignore such feedback, while continuing to participate. You may accept feedback, and change your ways, and continue to be a participant here, or you may ignore feedback, not change your ways, and then be excluded from participation here, first by soft measures, and eventually by increasingly hard measures, if necessary - it's up to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a personal note, as I said recently on <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>, I would like to like you, but you have made that increasingly difficult recently, and it's up to you from here on out.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not currently banned in any sense from <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>, as far as I know, so that is, at least for now, an outlet for your voice. You have already received feedback <strong>there</strong>, as well, that appropriate behavior is demanded.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        I do not think <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a> has the authority ever had the authority to suggest any type of ban on anybody. However I did not (and do not) want to start an argument and I was busy (and still busy), so I left things as they were. Doug if you are ever a steward here, I will consider requesting Ward to remove you from that list, subjected to your future behavior at this site. Notice served 16Jan 2006 -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> should simply respond to Costin below, because he says he doesn't want to argue, and I certainly don't, either. But onlookers should note that <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> did not bother to read the description of SoftBan (by following that link to our Meatball sister site), which is extremely short, and one cannot help but see that it says regarding SoftBans:
          <ul>
            <li>
               "It can be applied by anyone whom the community trusts, rather than just a <a href="SysOp.html">SysOp</a>."
            </li>
            <li>
               "It can easily be repealed by a person with higher CommunityAuthority"
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           ...in light of which, it doesn't matter whether I have any authority <strong>whatsoever</strong>, or even whether I have any community trust at all; all that matters is to observe that no one at <strong>all</strong> contradicted me after I put the SoftBan into effect, whether or not my claim that I had backing was true. Therefore everything David is saying here is simply (rather hostile) noise.
        </li>
        <li>
           I furthermore point out that I <strong>explicitly</strong> asked David not to regard the SoftBan as a punishment, but as a period to reflect upon complaints from the c2 community, so as to find a more constructive course upon return from the SoftBan. I see from the tone of his comment, upon return, that he did not take me up on that opportunity for constructive reflection, which I think is <strong>quite</strong> unfortunate. This does not bode well for the future. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        David, even if I found at the time that Doug's intervention might have been a little bit blunt, you are in no position to give notice to anyone here. You are intruding and polluting this wiki, and I do not even want to go into details as to what were the driving forces that trigered the incident - it was not by chance, it was an accident waiting to happen. So if you do not get your act together, you can count on me to see to it that you get permanently banned from this site. After all, you owe many of us an explanation as to what are you really doing (or trying to do) here. Why don't you start with that? -- Costin

        Nice post XXX. For many years, I have wrestled with what I call this imbalance between my spiritual/nature side and my computer side. I have spent years out in nature with my Native American Medicine Men teachers and then I return to work and I wonder what the hell I am doing here. I tend to go in cycles. I will spend months obsessed with the spiritual side and do no computer activites after work and then swing the other way and obsessively devour books and play with Linux until 6 in the morning. I have been unable to find a balance between the two. But also, I find, as you did, in the scheme of things, this computer stuff is relatively unimportant. There is so much out there and so much to do.

        And even besides that, I wouldn't trust e.g. <a href="McNealy.html">McNealy</a> to talk about Sun issues, because anything he said would be self-serving. I trust my own opinions about Sun over whatever <a href="McNealy.html">McNealy</a> has to say.

      <p>
        <em>David, I'm curious as to why you cut out Costin's comments. His comments were apt, appropriate, and probably reflective of the thinking of a number of us who have been reading </em><a href="WebServicesSecurity.html">WebServicesSecurity</a>, <a href="SoaIsNightSky.html">SoaIsNightSky</a>, <a href="BoilTheOcean.html">BoilTheOcean</a>, and similar pages. Therefore, I shall weigh in with a similar comment: What is it that you are trying to convey? What are you trying to accomplish?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As someone who is going to start teaching an undergrad course on </em><a href="DistributedComputing.html">DistributedComputing</a> and <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> early next year, I've been boning up on the subject area. What I've read both on-line and in various books on the subject is generally very clear and understandable. <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> and <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> essentially involve straightforward architectural designs and technological approaches, without any need to overcome conceptual, mathematical, or theoretical hurdles. Descriptions of these should be straightforward; indeed, I would hope that pages here would further clarify these already readily-understandable subjects. Unfortunately, though I don't wish to be unkind, and even though your pages have been improving, they are still strangely - for lack of a better word - surreal.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your lack of clarity does a certain disservice to these topic areas, as they </em>'should<strong> be easier to understand, even for non-programmers, than more difficult topics such as, for example, </strong><a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a>, which I picked at random. As it turns out, <a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a> is much easier to understand than <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a>, and that just shouldn't be the case.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>First, I'd like to know why you evade my questions and the questions of others? I've asked you questions here - what it is that you're trying to convey and what it is that you're trying to accomplish - that you've ignored.

        <em>Second, I have created a </em><a href="WhatIsSoa.html">WhatIsSoa</a> page.<em> I have looked at the </em><a href="WhatIsSoa.html">WhatIsSoa</a> page and it is quite good. Mind you it does not adequately reflect other equally important views of Soa, including but not limited to <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a> considerations. For example it may be equally valid to start with an opening statement like "SOA (long name) is an architectural style meant for the implementation of computing services on demand by business, in a more cost effective manner as demanded by a cost conscious operating environment. This is to be achieved by .....". Second comment on SOA is that it may worth your efforts to go retrieve the first internet archive of the main page. I don't think I was the one who started it, but anyway at that moment in history there were also "unknown contributions" by other parties which I feel oblige to include (where possible) in a rewrite.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Good heavens! Do you not realize that your so-called "opening statement" is babble, as opposed to a useful description of essential detail, with <em>no</em> clarification of what the "architectural style" actually <em>is</em>? <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a> considerations <em>might</em> be of value in a discussion of SOA justification, but certainly don't belong in a technical overview of what SOA <em>is</em>. Furthermore, "on demand," "cost effective," and "cost conscious operating environment" are meaningless marketese. They have no objective meaning, at least not without appropriate qualification <strong>and</strong> quantification. Your so-called "equally valid" statement is, in fact, grossly <em>in</em>valid in the context of the technical and (hopefully) largely no-nonsense nature of this Wiki. If you cannot see the difference, then there must be a profound gulf between your approach to Wiki contribution and (I suspect) that of virtually every author <em>and</em> <a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a> here. Furthermore, there are no "views" of SOA, except for the usual journalistic make-a-debate-out-of-nothing opinionated rubbish that is all about fulfilling a wordcount and has no place in a technical forum. SOA has a clear definition, and I have provided it. End of story. There is ample room in my definition for <em>technical</em> refinement and rational expansion, but the so-called "views" you mention do not exist except in some journalist's imagination. As for the "internet archive" of "the main page," I can't see any reason to bother looking for it. If the community didn't see any reason to keep it, then I don't see any reason to look for it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So let me ask again: What is your purpose in presenting these pages? What do you do? What is your experience and/or interest in SOA or any of its connected technologies? I have to say that at this point, your contributions look like those of (a) an MSc student trolling for thesis material; or (b) an unemployed non-technical project manager hoping to glom enough useful buzz-phrases to score a job in the field, neither of which indicate the slightest bit of experience in the area. Please don't take this as an insult, because it isn't; it's simply the impression your edits convey. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Third, </em><a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a> isn't particularly complicated <strong>if</strong> you have an understanding of language internals, but it is certainly obscure if you don't, and no amount of explanation will help until you do. By contrast, <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> is conceptually simple and can easily be understood by non-programmers. I doubt that <a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a> would make sense to anyone who isn't a programmer.<em> A "simple" concept serve no purpose if implementation in the real world is much more involved.

           <em>Get some sleep and meanwhile I stay away from technical pages till next week.

I should really restore his previous "polite" message just to show the contrast. I have not find ways TheCostinChallenge can be responded to in a civilized manner so I have responded in the manner I have responded.

        With due respect I do not think any one person here can do SOA type pages justice, not even <a href="DonBox.html">DonBox</a> of <a href="SoapProtocol.html">SoapProtocol</a> fame. This is because SOA has taken on a life of its own, and there are multiple viewpoints that have different degree of validity. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That does not mean CC, EH, or another highly skilled technical person cannot create better pages than what is already here. <strong>I highly encourage anyone (or team of contributors) with sufficient energy to lead a rewrite of </strong><a href="CategorySoa.html">CategorySoa</a> and / or <a href="CategoryWebServices.html">CategoryWebServices</a> pages.<strong></strong>
          <ul>

               OTOH, my concern about having highly technical people getting really into this (controversial) topic is the problem with <a href="SelfSealingBelief.html">SelfSealingBelief</a>. Maybe your <a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a> wiki, when fully implemented, does have a better solution. But we do not have the luxury of better technology at this time.

      <p>
        <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>, this site <strong>is by and for "technical" people</strong> so all of a sudden you put yourself outside this community. If no one person can do these pages justice it is certain that you do such topics a great injustice by having the balls to consider yourself competent enough to approach the subject without heeding the most elementary principle of on-line geek culture: <a href="HowToAskQuestionsTheSmartWay.html">HowToAskQuestionsTheSmartWay</a>. So there's no "we" you can talk about here, there's only you, <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>, who forms a (more and more irritating) singularity.

      <p>
        Furthermore, you put yourself in an irredeemable troll mode when you suggest that I should go to sleep! It is you, rather, who should WalkThePlank. I'm not one to pamper people with delicate speech, but while I was willing to give you the benefit of the doubt by allowing you some unconscious and unwilful incompetence, lately you are more and more in wilful troll mode, so it would not be a great loss to this wiki if you just walked away. I have no desire to waste my time conversing with you in back-room and backwards channels, if you cannot even get the point of having a frank conversation in the public space that you find so convenient to pollute, it's better that you should leave this wiki. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        When you have highly motivated teams and people skills are aligned to their roles, then great results are achieved even with poor processes. Capabilities lie within the people and the teams, otherwise all companies who pay for an expensive <a href="EnterpriseResourcePlanning.html">EnterpriseResourcePlanning</a> package will get instant boost in their capabilities.

        From a product perspective, <a href="ComplexEventProcessing.html">ComplexEventProcessing</a> (CEP) is a category of infrastructure software complementary to financial trading systems, market data systems, and <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> (BPM). The term "CEP", in its usage suggested here, was arguably coined in 2002 by StanfordUniversity professor DavidLuckham in combination with mainstream industry analysts (Gartner, Forrester), and has been also used by several vendors in the space (APTSoft, NEON Systems, TIBCO, etc.). As of 2005, it has become a more mainstream term and is considered to be an important component of any advanced <a href="BusinessActivityMonitoring.html">BusinessActivityMonitoring</a> (BAM) solution.

        <em>Not being used by knowledge workers</em>

        Sourced from the 2002 article at DMreview <a href="http://dmreview.com/article_sub.cfm?articleId=5676">http://dmreview.com/article_sub.cfm?articleId=5676</a> link, knowledge workers were not using the portal due to usability and "integrity of contents".
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are my take from the details of the problem described.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Usability - it appear "portal administration" is under-funded, amongst other concerns
        </li>
        <li>
           Integrity - it is a matter of credibility. There is insufficient trust, sometimes rightly so, largely due to the limited scope of the portals. It is a chicken and egg problem common to a lot of <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a> projects.

        Earlier this year I read there is renewed interest in organizations to using <a href="PortalSoftware.html">PortalSoftware</a> to deliver information. However the big players like <a href="SapCorporation.html">SapCorporation</a>, <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> etc are also viewing these products as gateways to increase use of their IT products.

See "Portal Proliferation " at <a href="http://www.cio.com.au/index.php/id;1003039612;fp;4;fpid;4">http://www.cio.com.au/index.php/id;1003039612;fp;4;fpid;4</a> , titled "Portals At the Crossroads".
      </p>

        <li>
           The capabilities of the belated JSR168 for portal / portlet interoperability was seen as insufficient.

        While seeking information related to solutions for information and records management, I came across this note at <a href="http://webservices.sys-con.com/read/250507.htm">http://webservices.sys-con.com/read/250507.htm</a> , article titled
        "Managing SOX in the Age of SOA"

           "... Instead of a portal, the company now has a Customer Web Service hub to which customers can connect directly using their ERP systems "
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        "Intranet - demand high as ever"
      </p>
      <p>
        It appear to me the structure provided by a <a href="PortalSoftware.html">PortalSoftware</a> is exactly the kind of thing that knowledge workers want to avoid. The knowledge workers spend a lot of time interfacing with information in application systems, emails, ERPs that they are comfortable with. Using a "technology push" mechanism to impose new rules is very hard to achieve. I once had a discussion with an user area who needed something quickly, the portal was not adopted due to concern over the learning curve involved. The "rudimentary authoring" limitation in the article below was suggested as a reason intranets will not go away.

        This approach focus on needs of the company to constantly evolve its processes to respond to changes in the business environment (regulatory and legislative requirements, competitive forces, partnering opportunities, etc).

        [ISBN 0-385-51725-4] While Senge's book frames the issue and primes management for a pattern-based view of the world, it's my personal opinion that his approach to finding these patterns is a bit haphazard, and I certainly feel his diagraming style could use some help. I'd really like to see some convergence between the tech-centric and business-centric worlds (isn't this one of the things we are supposed to get from ObjectTechnology) and a well defined method of documenting patterns across the two might be a nice starting place.
