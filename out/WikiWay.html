        This is an excellent way to capture, store, and disseminate project knowledge. I will use it religiously moving forward and encourage others to do so also.

        Leave a message on the homepage of an individual. It is a good Wiki Way to communicate with them directly. If it is meant for one time reading, precede message with <a href="DeleteWhenRead.html">DeleteWhenRead</a>.

        Isn't this the real problem with Wiki: the temptation to edit another's work is very strong (Johnson, wasn't it?) and how can we trust that someone won't misrepresent us somehow? Does the <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a> spirit of collaboration really work, is what I'm asking, I guess. <em>See </em><a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>.<em></em>

        Well, what *is* the wiki way? If wiki means quick, then the wiki way is the quick way, as opposed to the slow way. But is that it? At Wikipedia somebody tried to define the wiki way as everybody's right to propose new policies

        But I don't think that is enough.

        I think one important aspect is allowing everybody to work in parallel without one person blocking another person's work.

        This would be to management what the REST principles are to API designing (<a href="RepresentationalStateTransfer.html">RepresentationalStateTransfer</a>)

        The wiki way is about radical collaboration while preserving everyone's contribution.  The idea is to add and refine, rather that delete another's input.  Subtract only when a greater <strong>synthesis</strong> is made that simplifies the conversation.  --<a href="MarkJanssen.html">MarkJanssen</a>
