        Hellooooooo...I'm Sean.  Thanks for stopping by.  My interests include scuba diving, hiking, skiing, and just about anything outdoors.  I spend most of my time in front of a computer writing software for a large insurance company.  Some of the toys I get to play with on regular basis are JAVA, CORBA, EJB, XML, and just about anything else you can think of that a Web Shop would need to support online transactional capabilities.
