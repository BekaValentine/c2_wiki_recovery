        Here is a generous offer by <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Here is an idea ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Take all your knowledge of afm control and separate from that knowledge 
        the basic operations that are present in all afm applications. Make 
        sure this includes every time critical algorithm that has to be written 
        in careful c++. This is the start on your model.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now fork your codebase so that you can refactor aggressively. Get a 
        copy of python and lean how it likes to work. Write some unit tests in 
        python that make calls on your model in a pythonish way. Refactor your 
        forked c++ modules until the python tests pass. Repeat this testing and 
        refactoring until writing typical afm applications is embarrassingly 
        easy. Announce that this is model driven development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some tips....
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep the ui for this stuff very simple. Make sure that you can use 
        python's immediate mode to write non-trivial applications in a few 
        lines. Let this drop results somewhere and use a few cgi scripts to 
        browse current and past results. Call this a results database browser 
        and feature its simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write some demos of the afm's most valuable features. Ask the guys in 
        marketing what people on an exhibit floor would understand and love in 
        just a minute. Write demos that do this and let them use them. Show 
        them how to hack python.
      </p>
      <p>
        Figure out how to exploit python's keyword arguments to make little 
        demo scripts look beautiful. Call this a domain specific language. 
        Emphasize how python's abstraction capabilities are both more 
        straightforward and more powerful than graphical input.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just in case, write an alternate library that will run your demos but 
        capture calls in a data structure instead of running them. Use some 
        graph drawing software like Dot to draw pictures of these structures. 
        Show these to the marketing guys and ask how they would use them to 
        sell afms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll leave you to post these ideas on wiki if you think there is any 
        merit to them. Mostly I'm trying to suggest things that are both 
        relatively easy (assuming one has real domain knowledge) and offer 
        open-ended power. The marketing connection is just to give you practice 
        wielding that power once you have it. Otherwise you might not 
        appreciate what you've done. Send me some pictures that you make this 
        way. If this saves the company and you end up rich and famous, send me 
        an afm. Best regards." -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> 9/19/04
