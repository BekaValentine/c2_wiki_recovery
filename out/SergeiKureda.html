        Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm Sergei Kureda, a former Russian nuclear physicist, now a Kiwi (== <a href="NewZealand.html">NewZealand</a>) Java developer, so by joining the Wiki I can drastically increase representation for both countries here. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1991, I found this site, and was fascinated about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>; since then, I am preaching it to everybody who happens to be in hearing range.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But this site didn't exist until 1995!!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oops. I mean 2001 of course, somewhere in October.
      </p>
      <p>
        I Introduced as much of XP as possible in our company (it is not easy to do pair programming when you are the only developer :)) and am now looking for chances to run it in bigger scale. 
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. I have nothing to do with the Kuredu island resort (Maldives)(<a href="http://www.vermillionmaldives.com/resorts/kuredu.htm).">http://www.vermillionmaldives.com/resorts/kuredu.htm).</a> Which is a shame.
