        Geek Night Fifty

      <p>
        <a href="GeekNight.html">GeekNight</a> tonight has moved to a pub off Oxford St. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As such this is a <a href="GeekNight.html">GeekNight</a> PubEdition/Special(TM). Partly for Charles' departure (this city rather than shuffling off : mortal coil). Partly because Erich Gamma is in town at Logica/CMG on some BCS/XtC talk thing and the pub is next door. The ticket is restricted to early respondees only, so the pub seems appropriate for those that just want to hang for the post-show drinks. Many of our OSS activists friends will be there, so we might have some geeking fun. We think "The Champion, 13 Wells St" is the pub.
