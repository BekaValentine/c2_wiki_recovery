        any experience, your eyes have their silence:
      </p>
      <p>
        in your most frail gesture are things which enclose me,
      </p>
      <p>
        or which i cannot touch because they are too near
      </p>
      <p>
        your slightest look easily will unclose me
      </p>
      <p>
        though i have closed myself as fingers,
      </p>
      <p>
        you open always petal by petal myself as Spring opens
      </p>
      <p>
        (touching skilfully, mysteriously) her first rose
      </p>
      <p>
        or if your wish be to close me, i and
      </p>
      <p>
        my life will shut very beautifully, suddenly,
      </p>
      <p>
        as when the heart of this flower imagines
      </p>
      <p>
        the snow carefully everywhere descending;
      </p>
      <p>
        nothing which we are to perceive in this world equals
      </p>
      <p>
        the power of your intense fragility: whose texture
      </p>
      <p>
        compels me with the color of its countries,
      </p>
      <p>
        rendering death and forever with each breathing
      </p>
      <p>
        (i do not know what it is about you that closes
      </p>
      <p>
        and opens; only something in me understands
      </p>
      <p>
        the voice of your eyes is deeper than all roses)
      </p>
      <p>
        nobody, not even the rain, has such small hands
      </p>
