        "PR-Squared is a new electoral system designed for the UK's House of Commons. It typically elects a majority government; it elects one local MP from each constituency each of whom is dependent on the local vote; yet it still ensures that equal votes mean equal seats.". It may have been designed for the UK, but it would work anywhere; it combines a kind of proportionality with a geographical link between voter and representative.
