        Brian Ball
      </h1>
      <p>
        Brian Ball lives in Oakland, California with his wife of nearly five years.
      </p>
      <p>
        He loves international communication, culture and languages, most likely due to his travel abroad since being a foreign exchange student in Recife, Brazil during the latter part of the 80's.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's conversant in Mandarin, Portuguese, Spanish and English and has to learn something new every day.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's got several web projects "in the works" and is now completely distracted, having just found Wiki!
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheers!
