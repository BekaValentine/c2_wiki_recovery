        Vb Wiki

        Implemented a <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a> in Visual Basic 5.0 by <a href="KeithDerrick.html">KeithDerrick</a> to run on Win95 under Microsoft's <a href="PersonalWebServer.html">PersonalWebServer</a>. The pages are stored in an Access database.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to use Wiki on our intranet to provide a communal logbook to our design team.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we're a Microsoft shop, and the implementations of Perl I could find for Win95 didn't handle DBM at all well. Add the fact that I'm Perl-illiterate and couldn't make head nor tail of the <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s, and you can see why I went my own way.

        Sadly, this place also has a mistrust of freeware and shareware. I'm not sure they'll let me put it into the public domain either 8(

        I've now implemented a version of Wiki in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>. It works much the same with some enhancements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No tabs are needed - I only support bullet lists and these are indicated by a * as the first character of the line - ** for level 2 etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can happily mix bold and italics within a line, as often as you need.
        </li>
        <li>
           I added an "Append" text box to the normal View page so that you don't need to go to the edit page to just add a comment.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wiki links are more flexible, and you can force a link by "quoting" it with @ characters.
        </li>
        <li>
           I added links to Recent Changes and a list of all pages to every page.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Recent Changes list is non-editable and generated dynamically to show all pages edited in the last week.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can get away with entering most HTML constructs directly into the raw page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think the text parsing was the greatest challenge in the absence of a regular expression engine for VB.

        BTW: There is a <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> engine for <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>! Check out "Microsoft VBScript Regular Expressions"! -- DarenThomas

        My thanks go out to Stephan Schmid, of EazyWare in Switzerland for his excellent VB5-CGI ActiveX Objects package which let me do it in VB5. This package is available at his home page <a href="http://www.eazyware.com/vb5-cgi/">http://www.eazyware.com/vb5-cgi/</a>
