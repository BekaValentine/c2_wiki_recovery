        Kanban System
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Kanban is a card containing all the information required to be done on a product at each stage along its path to completion and which parts are needed at subsequent processes. These cards are used to control work-in-progress (W.I.P.), production, and inventory flow. A <a href="KanbanSystem.html">KanbanSystem</a> allows a company to use <a href="JustInTime.html">JustInTime</a> (J.I.T) production and ordering systems which allow them to minimize their inventories while still satisfying customer demands.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="KanbanSystem.html">KanbanSystem</a> consists of a set of these cards, with one being allocated for each part being manufactured, that travel between preceding and subsequent processes. The <a href="KanbanSystem.html">KanbanSystem</a> was developed more than 20 years ago, by Mr. Taiichi Ohno, a vice president of Toyota, along with <a href="ShigeoShingo.html">ShigeoShingo</a>, to achieve objectives that include:
