        Improve Databases Or Else
      </h1>
      <p>
        A discussion that grew out of <a href="FearOfAddingTables.html">FearOfAddingTables</a> about alleged proper ways of designing databases and application type systems that are not being followed.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Page name changed from goodDatabasesAreForGeniuses to <a href="ImproveDatabasesOrElse.html">ImproveDatabasesOrElse</a>. Still arrogant.. but took away "genius". 
      </p>
      <p>
        I command everyone to improve the software industry through force, by using threats in the page title. I think imperatively. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem <em>today (year 2008)</em> is that a genius (or really really competent person) can barely create a strong, reliable, and well thought out database with the tools available. Someone less of a genius has it worse - people throw everything into one table, use nulls, lack foreign keys, use plain text files, XML databases (<em>pfff</em>), multi valued databases (<em>pfff</em>), and other <em>crap</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to have a migration path available.. so that the unreliable databases like config files and unnormalized tables (myIsam) can become better relvars (tables). A semi genius would have built a good reliable database on day one, <em>if he had the proper tools available</em> and if <em>the current tools didn't permit him to do such silly things</em> with his database. We need to take it further and make it accessible to even the laymen to build databases that are really relational and properly designed. Documentation and websites for the products needs to educate users instead of providing just hype and incorrect information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The good news is that <em>most data</em> stored in poor form can actually be normalized.. and there really are partial migration paths popping up (such as products inproving their DB's each year). But that isn't enough - some of it is getting worse, or it is improving at a slow pacee. It isn't the end of the world, but it could be a lot better.  The relational model.. most people <a href="JustDontGetIt.html">JustDontGetIt</a> or even know of it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Database designers, engineers, and laymen need to be encouraged with proper products, docs, and websites (and education, it is all related). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, people maintain unnormalized designs, abuse nulls, are afraid to create foreign keys. They are lazy or they simply don't have time at that moment in attention. Or they see it as too much overhead and too much work, because our current databases are heavy handed bastardized SQL. Our tools encourage us not to design databases properly - and what we are encouraged to do, is what we do (even smarter competent people are still encouraged by their tools).
      </p>
      <p>
        Main problems: current databases <strong>permit us to be lazy</strong>, <strong>permit bad design</strong>, <strong>allow unconstrained data</strong>, <strong>have poor type systems</strong>, and <strong>permit sloppy integrity (if any)</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> Maybe what we need is something like </em>TrueRelationalFileMaker or TrueRelationalBento with <a href="TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapping.html">TrueRelationalToPseudoRelationalMapping</a> capabilities <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That can help and also languages/systems inventions that make the database more accessible and easier to just use and design things correctly.. the database should be thought of as a data structure or variable right in our programs (relvar vs table). <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> and <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> seems like it is headed this direction.

I've been developing DBMSes in object oriented languages since the early 90s, after developing my first DBMS in the late 80s using C.  I'm still developing DBMSes in OO languages and wouldn't have it any other way, though these days I use the OO language to create a distinctly functional-flavoured set of internals.  Object oriented databases, however, are still -- as they have always been -- of marginal popularity for general-purpose database systems, but appropriate (and doing well) in certain niches.  <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> is a purely client-side DBMS-interface technology; yet another implementation of the <a href="RecordSet.html">RecordSet</a> idea.

LINQ is also pure client-side technology; a re-invention of <a href="EmbeddedSql.html">EmbeddedSql</a> for <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>.  I'm not sufficiently familiar with JPA to comment intelligently; though J2EE has always been in its own strange world of reinventing the DBMS in the application server, in what appears to be an attempt to deprecate those nasty, ugly, confusing SQL DBMSes in favour of nice, clean objects.  (And, even more cynically, what appears to be Sun's attempt to sell application server hardware.)  As such, like <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> in general, it can be considered an attempt to deprecate the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> in favour of pure object models, rather than integrating, leveraging, and improving them equally, as <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> (and <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>'s "D" specification) attempt to do.] -- DV

               [I think the value of easy migration paths is over-emphasised.  Speaking for myself, I switch when an entire suite of technologies makes it worth jumping ship, and then I don't attempt to keep a foot on both decks.  For example, I switched to Linux as my primary desktop environment when it clearly became a viable alternative to Windows for software development, not because Wine or <a href="VmWare.html">VmWare</a> made it possible to run Windows applications under Linux.  (I don't have <a href="VmWare.html">VmWare</a> or Wine installed.)  In the 80s, I switched from <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> to a custom C-based DBMS when the C-based DBMS clearly wiped the floor with <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>; it was actually cheaper to migrate whole <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> apps to the new system than maintain any ties to legacy <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>.  When a technology represents an end-to-end improvement, developers will make a wholesale switch, and indeed the entire history of computing is proof of this.  It's why we're largely developing on PCs instead of mainframes, mainly coding in Java/PHP/C#/C++/Perl/whatever instead of COBOL and Fortran, using SQL DBMSes instead of CODASYL (or <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>), and almost entirely <strong>not</strong> using technologies to migrate from the old-tech to the new-tech.  In most cases, no such technology existed.  Certainly, there are areas where migration paths are valuable -- <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> as a way of leveraging legacy mainframe systems in modern SOA environments, for example -- but these are niches rather than technological drivers.] -- DV

        Use a product and create a company to educate people and offer proper documentation and education with the product. The problem is simply time, luck, and other such things.

        {By migration, I don't mean keeping all backwards compatibility and offering the perfect migration path.. as that isn't possible - I mean we simply need to make it easy for someone to <em>try</em> the relational model (instead of just PDF files that explain why everyone is wrong, etc.) We need also to tell people that yes, they can export their existing data from their current SQL database, plunk it in a relational product and try it out - even if that means they have to change <em>some</em> of their current data (such as changing nulls to defaults). Data <em>is migratable</em> by its very nature. I do not mean keeping nulls, keeping SQL flaws, or even trying to follow Dataphor's path exactly.}

      <p>
        {One idea is for example to compete with SQLite.. offer a nice alternative to SQLite and say <em>why don't you try our relational database that is embeddable and easy to use?</em>. When people choose tools like SQLite they aren't looking for a huge setup like Oracle.. so easing them into the relational model first is what I meant by migration.  i.e. not requiring them to just take all their huge Oracle databases that they've invested into and magically change over to a new paradigm. First, ease them into it and let them know about it by making a nice SQLite style product which many people can use without any fear. Tell them on the side that there is <em>also</em> a relational alternative to MySQL and Oracle <em>planned</em>, in addition to the SQLite style small starter database. The idea is not to just continually fight people with academic revolutoinary fire, as Fabian does.. but offer a real solution to get them going.  It needs to be easy to setup, easy to use, or people won't convert/migrate/try it. For example, right now, all we have is a bunch of PDF files, and no actual product to prove the relational model can work. The easiest way to get people started is not to yell at them and tell them all their Oracle and MySQL databases need to be immediately converted over to <em>the</em> relational model. Rather we have to offer solutions to <em>satisfy people's curiosity</em>. Try this.. download this.. no .Net requirement, no existing database requirement, no hard stuff to setup, no hosting company required to try the DB, it just works. Might be hard to accomplish, but that is a good way to get people interested.<em>.}</em>

        At the risk of tooting my own horn, the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> is very close to this.  It's trivially installed, requires no configuration, is easily embeddable in Java applications, and is entirely self-contained except for requiring a Java run-time environment.  What it lacks are several things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A beginner-friendly administration and interaction front-end...  The current front-end client is command-line based.  It should be replaced (or augmented) with a user-friendly, click-n-go UI that is perhaps closer to Microsoft Access in flavour.
        </li>
        <li>
           It lacks easy integration of existing SQL DBMSes, though this is a work-in-progress.  
        </li>
        <li>
           JDBC/ODBC drivers, which would make it possible to use with existing client-side products, use it to build dynamic Web sites and desktop clients, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I believe the primary target competitor should be Microsoft Access; the product should be a user-friendly desktop DBMS that works equally well as a DBMS server.  This represents a significant opportunity, as there is really nothing like Access in either the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> or commercial arena, and Access is often a beginner's introduction to database technology.  Access also containts a bucket of flaws that could be addressed at the same time. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

For now and forever, I'll get to point to this fine example of how you'd like others to treat you.  And 800 pages of <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> would hardly be one massive definition - it is far more likely to be one page of definitions mixed with about 799 pages of explanation, references, and credits - pages that you'll forever refuse to read because your "utter arrogance" leads you to believe you'd actually comprehend a definition (and especially the significance of its subtleties) without context.

           Perhaps.  Or perhaps you're too busy building 'nirvana' in your head to pay attention to evidence.  Not that you'd care about evidence anyway, since <a href="ObjectivityIsAnIllusion.html">ObjectivityIsAnIllusion</a> is the excuse you built <em>just in case</em> someone actually provided objective evidence.

          [The products that people use! I think Top is basing his arguments on the tools he has chosen which do not support strict typing, integrity, etc. People tend to protect the tools they are using that they've invested a lot of time in. This is one case where academics are a good reference point since they don't have a bias with certain products (at least good academics don't teach <em>specific</em> products).

           Incorrect, as usual. I started out with type-centric languages. I used to be a <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> fan. But over time I found dynamic usually better once you change the way you think. My first dynamic exposure came when I had to use VB-script (not VBA). VB-script does not accept type declarations. I thought it odd at first, but it grew on me. (Well, I take that back, I used a minicomputer OS scripting language that had dynamic typing in the early 90's.) --top

Writing your own functions that verify all is okay at run time <strong>is bloating up your code</strong> just like declaring things bloats up your code too. Type systems exist so that if you forget what your type is (especially with side flags and other hacks) then at least you've got some automated integrity happening (in the database, and/or in the application too). The more automated checks, the better. The more you manually have to check yourself, the less efficient you are in keeping integrity.

        <strong>Geniuses don't abuse nulls, but lazy people do.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An example genius design is something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://web.onetel.com/~hughdarwen/TheThirdManifesto/Missing-info-without-nulls.pdf">http://web.onetel.com/~hughdarwen/TheThirdManifesto/Missing-info-without-nulls.pdf</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        He gets rid of the nulls in a clever design.. but regular people just go ahead and abuse the nulls since they aren't genius enough to avoid them..
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of creating a table with some definitive descriptions in another <strong>relvar</strong> (table) like:  
      </p>
      <code>
        employed<br/>
        unemployed<br/>
        selfEmployed<br/>
        noEntryYet<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We have people <em>instead</em> doing:
      </p>
      <code>
        TRUE  (employed)<br/>
        FALSE (not employed)<br/>
        NULL  (not sure, self employed possibly, or not applicable, or not entered yet)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This abuses the NULL because <em>it is available to us</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A <strong>genius</strong> would <strong>not abuse a null</strong> because he is already a genius and knows not to abuse a null.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yeah, let's abuse ID's instead. That'll fix it.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Normalization is not abuse, it is for geniuses.. and it is tough.. it is hard. Hence the page title name. An alternative is an Enumeration that is not part of another table...
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        TYPE workStatus = (employed, unemployed, selfemployed)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The problem with the above enumeration though is that it is not something we can query and change as part of the database.. it is more like a BOOLEAN in some respects in that it is more fixed (but not as fixed, it is more like a byte or integer). But some times we don't need to query it.  Pure relational wheenie wouldn't allow a enumeration type (which just maps to a byte or integer at an implementation level) since it could lead to three value logic.. but it may also be something that stops people from using nulls when they don't have to, and avoids creating several different tables as in Hugh's page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Since not all people are geniuses, the idea is that we shouldn't give them <em>too many</em> chances to be silly.. we should hit them with a whip and ban them from doing silly things. NULLS give people too many chances to be silly. Date, Darwen and all have several articles that debate the usefulness of NULLS. Codd at one point (the original relational model maintainer) almost appeared to be okay with 3 valued and 4 valued logic in his later writings.. but I personally think that is because he never understood what an enumeration was.. in my opinion enumerations are superior to some silly 3 or 4 valued logic.. and in my opinion even skinny tables are better than NULLS 
      </p>
      <p>
        A genius like <a href="FabianPascal.html">FabianPascal</a> says to someone else that <a href="YouJustDontGetIt.html">YouJustDontGetIt</a> so and so's design is <em>wrong wrong wrong wrong</em>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we make them get it, easier, then? How do we make database design something that people can get?
      </p>
      <p>
        Geniuses can also multi task and see the multiple relvars at once or multiple tables with foreign keys at once.. while others <a href="JustDontGetIt.html">JustDontGetIt</a> and just see values, rows, columns, in the form of an HTML table.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yeah right, and I suppose geniuses can use Go To's also because their huge multitasking brain can handle all those wild jumps. Indented blocks is for single-tasking limited brains. Enjoy your Go To's, dear genius. Forget relational even, and go pure graphs. Didn't they used to say to </em><a href="GraceHopper.html">GraceHopper</a>: "High-level languages are for girls, real men use assembler"? --top<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A smart programmer uses the high level language and visualizes the Go To statements in his mind or in his assembler window <em>only</em> if he needs to dissect the code into <em>what the CPU is really doing</em>. High level languages were invented to <em>ban</em> people from <em>Go To</em>, just as banning NULLS bans people from doing bad things.

        <strong>Big Change Pivoting on The Trivial</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with the skinny-table approach given is that table design hinges on null existence. If we change a column to "required" per business rules such that it can no longer be empty, the above suggestion would dictate changing the schema via adding or merging tables. This makes the schema anti-change-friendly. The existence or lack of a required column is too trivial to hang a design on. It's like designing a house layout based on hair length. "Required" should be a simple switch that one can toggle on and off without having to refactor the entire schema for up or down. --top

        <em>Is there a </em>SkinnyTablePattern on this wiki? I think it is a pattern (serious, it is). I assume you mean normalization causes skinny tables.. which it does.. but at the same time if you don't see them as tables and consider them just lists of stuff, tuples, etc., it isn't as bad that it is skinny (i.e. people fear creating more tables because that's too much overhead with too many ID fields? An enumeration type solves that issue but the problem is then you cannot query the actual enumeration and find out what enumerations are available.. but do we need to?)<em> </em>

        It is not normalization, it is *excessive* normalization. <strong>Skinny tables are frighteningly close to </strong><a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a>s:<strong> pointer pasta city.

        There's something quite frightening in the notion that your selfish personal preference might play so large a role in a field that is fundamentally about meeting user requirements, especially the implicit requirements of reliability, stability, consistency and accuracy.  Likewise, a cabinetmaker might have a personal preference for jagged edges, exposed splinters and spindly legs; or a cook may favour the gamey stank of slightly-off meat; or a toy designer may like intricate and easy-to-swallow small parts.  That does not mean such dangerous abberations should be foisted on naive and unsuspecting users!  That you find "skinny tables annoying" -- as if it reflects some generally valid principle without any apparent reference to industry best practices or user requirements -- smacks of professional incompetence.

           I shall, but first, let us clearly distinguish "type-less" -- or more accurately, dynamically-typed -- databases from "type-less" (er, dynamically-typed) programming languages.  By in large, issues with the latter can, to a certain degree, be addressed with <a href="UnitTests.html">UnitTests</a> and the like.  Whether this is a good idea or a bad idea, however, is a completely separate topic not to be dealt with here.  This is strictly about so-called <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> in database contexts.  Now, imagine that a table of the form <strong>pay_rates (employee_id_pk_fk, hourly_salary)</strong> exists in our brand-new <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> payroll database, freshly purchased from TOP Software Inc.  We presume the attributes of our table are "type-less", in keeping with the tenets of <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a>.  All afternoon, we enter the hourly salaries for the 10,000 employees of our company and prepare to generate paycheques overnight.  Lo and behold, when the employees arrive the next morning to pick up their cheques, it turns out Employee #1324's hourly_salary was mis-keyed as 8,98 instead of 8.98, paycheque generation failed with a java.lang.NumberFormatException, there's nary a cheque to be seen, and our factory is burned down in the ensuing employee riot.  This could have been trivially prevented had the database supported static types, because the mis-keying would have been caught on entry.  QED.  (Epilogue: The lazy, negligent developer who thought to save a few minutes development effort by using "<a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a>" is hoisted up the flagpole as a warning to anyone who would dare consider fewer database constraints "better" than more.) -- DV

People are too lazy, by nature, to write these checks for every data item.. and it bloats up your code.

Then I may plop this integer into a database. Whoa, the database also accepts an integer. Perfect, matching up. But wait... if I had just done a getCgiVarNoTyping and plopped it into a "no types" database, it could contain injections of all sorts. The mindset of knowing that <em>this is an integer coming in and should stay as one</em> is more secure than the mindset that <em>this is just a string or blob,  all data is a blob</em>. The mindset of <em>let's be lazy, get this work done with a string now</em> isn't as secure as knowing precisely what is happening with the type. If someone finds a flaw in your getAsInt function, you've got another protection.. the database itself which only accepts an integer. Doing all these checks yourself with unit tests and your own functions is great.. but humans don't have time and let things slip through even if they try hard. Furthermore, if you accidentally happen upon a flaw in your application code, the database should help warn you. But not with one that doesn't know anything about what you are putting in the table.}

        An anecdote: I'm currently dealing with a system that has lots of skinny over-defined tables.

           I am not claiming there are not bad wide-table designs.

        Wider tables are at least easier to study when trying to figure out what is where because you don't have to hop from table to table. <strong>I'll take a wide-table mess over a skinny-table mess any day</strong>.

           But wide tables cause your screen and eyes to be damaged from scrolling trauma. A human can only focus on so much screenspace at a time. With more tables that are normalized,  one can see what data is related to what - in more modules (tables).  
        </li>
        <li>
           Why is it that programmers have no problem creating applications with separate lists, arrays, objects - but as soon as when it comes to databases all of a sudden it must be one huge large global mudball? Think about tables as not <em>just</em> tables,  but a method of organizing data. Even Excel spreadsheet users try and keep data within one page.. scrolling sideways isn't fun. They end up creating more workbooks and sheets that link to each other... and they are naturally trying to normalize their excel sheets without realizing it is time to move to a real database.

        <em> It depends, if you system is only for OLAP (better to have big tables) or OLTP (better to have a very normalized database)</em>

        <li>
           Well, I recommend to stop thinking in <strong>tables</strong>. The table is <strong>just a view</strong>. OLAP can be done with normalized tables by simply viewing all the tables with the values plunked in place. Methinks that people are <em>confusing the view with the model, again</em>. If there arne't tools out there that make normalized tables easy to view in different ways, then once again that proves the entire point of this wiki pageL to improve databases (which includes the tools we use to view them). The idea that one should not normalize his database because it offers a better wide view is naive. This wide view can be represented with a normalized database. Claiming that it is <strong>better</strong> to have big tables should make the dbdebunk quote of the month.

        Maybe there is a "proper way" to do skinny tables right, but this is clearly not one of them. It appears the problem is that its hard to create divisions (classifications) of things that fit the domain well and stay fitting the domain. It is a form of <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>. Skinny tables create (at least) a 3-level hierarchy:
      </p>
      <code>
        dataabase -> table -> sub-table<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Domain classification hierarchies are difficult to get right, perhaps impossible if the domain is not really tree-shaped. True, it's not really a hierarchy because one can have cycles via use of foreign keys, but the problems of shoehorning a domain that you do not fully understand or will change into these three items appears to be an artificial endeavor. <strong>Wider tables make fewer grouping assumptions, and thus flex more.</strong> If you want specific narrow views, then make them, but don't gum up the originals to get it.

        <li>
           <em>Sigh.</em> <strong>More flexibility</strong> is available when normalization has been done. Being able to query what available cities there are in a state, versus not being able to, is an example. Apparently you do not understand normalization.  Any thin table can be grouped with other tables by plunking the data into that other table through noramlization. This provides much more flexibility than an unnormalized wide table. I suggest you do some reading on normalization  and how it offers more ability to (sanely) query what you are looking for (which is ultimately what a database is for, and hence more flexiblity when you can query tables that are <em>related</em>)

        I believe in <a href="PutClassificationsIntoMetaData.html">PutClassificationsIntoMetaData</a> rather than hard-wiring them up front because almost nobody gets them right up-front, and even if you are the one genius who does get them right, nobody can really tell that up front without tons of onsite visits to prior installations, and even that assumes the list is has not filtered out the misses. People usually don't put their failures on a resume. Most of the time such an expensive background check is not worth it.

           Normalizing a table helps so that if things change, you have options. You do not understand normalization based on your above comments. Getting it right in the first place is exactly a problem in wide tables.. because if you have old orphaned fields that don't map to anything, then you can't sanely manage your data since you didn't get it right. Normalization helps you in the future when you didn't get it perfectly right with your wide table.. you can add more fields to your thin table and they affect your other tables and offer you ways to sanely upgrade your database. A wide table is just an excel spreadsheet.

        I am not dismissing the possibility that there are good choppers out there, but I know of no sure way to find them. And, all of the skinny-table installations I've encountered didn't find them (or all their documentation was burned such that we never knew why they sliced and diced the way they did, and so it appears somewhat random). <a href="BetterOnlyIfDoneRight.html">BetterOnlyIfDoneRight</a> syndrome?

           Could you please refrain from using white trash talk, such as <em>chopping</em>? Normalizing a database, if you understand normalization, is not called <em>chopping</em>.  People do not slice and dice things for random reasons. Please study normalization before making ludicrous comments like the above. Even <a href="ConstantTable.html">ConstantTable</a> is an example of what whoever here calls <em>chopping</em>.
