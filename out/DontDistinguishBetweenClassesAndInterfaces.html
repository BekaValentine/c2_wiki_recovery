        Dont Distinguish Between Classes And Interfaces
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've seen many people say you should have a convention for naming interfaces differently from classes. So Dictionary should be called iDictionary or DictionaryIF. The convention  is used a lot by people used to COM and <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a>. But I don't encourage the practice. I would tell you why but Josh explained it better, so I moved his comment over here. -- <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd add however that if the convention for the framework you use, the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> framework for example, is to have I prefixed to all interfaces, it's probably a good idea to go with the grain and write your code the same.  Though I agree in principle, in practice I want my code to look like the rest of the framework.

        I used to place an "I" at the end of the names of my interfaces.  But as I continue to learn more about the rhythm of refactoring, I'm starting to see the wisdom in making class and interface names look the same. Here's why: during development you know that you could use an interface to make something really flexible (vary the implementation) but there may be no real need to vary the implementation today.  So instead of "<a href="OverDesign.html">OverDesign</a>ing" by anticipating too much, you stay simple and make the thing a class. (<em>In other words, use </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> to <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>, because <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> right now.<em>).  And somewhere you write a method signature that expects an object of that class type.  Then, a few days, weeks, months later, there is a definite "need" for the interface.  So you convert the original class into an interface, create an implementation class (that implements the new interface) and let your original signature (or signatures) remain unchanged. -- </em><a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I interpret </em><a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> and <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> oppositely (not a word, but it should be!) in this case.  I tend to <a href="WriteInterfacesBeforeClasses.html">WriteInterfacesBeforeClasses</a>. -- <a href="MarkAddleman.html">MarkAddleman</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Exactly, I think the above fails to keep in mind one of the most important design principles, "always (try to) program to an interface, never to a class. -- JÃ¼rgen Hauser</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But you can program to an interface and still write a class.  An interface is just a set of methods; classes have those too.  Josh is suggesting that you write a class with the signature your interface expects, use only those methods (access control and <a href="SingleResponsibilityPrinciple.html">SingleResponsibilityPrinciple</a> help here), and then down the road, if you <em>need</em> an interface, you create one with the same signature as the class and rename the implementing class.  All your existing code works fine, because the class and interface have the same signature, and you can then define new classes that implement the interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've used this pattern to create <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s for classes that weren't designed with testability in mind.  Emulate the signature, rename the original class, then test away.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        This is a strong point, but I can't help but think that it is extremely tied to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.  Under less extreme conditions, I could see how someone might want to differentiate their interfaces from their classes using a scheme like <a href="InterfacesShouldBeAdjectives.html">InterfacesShouldBeAdjectives</a> in order to provide a cue that something is an extension point or <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a>.  As such, I would expect interface names to be differentiated from class names more in frameworks.  I haven't really looked at the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a> yet, but I thought that I've heard that it distinguishes.

        <a href="ErichGamma.html">ErichGamma</a> and I recently wrote JTest [<a href="JavaTest.html">JavaTest</a>] together. [Latest version is called JUnit; see <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> or <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a>.] It is a Java transliteration of a <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> I wrote for <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> a few years ago. The interface is just called Test. The subclasses are <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> and <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>.

        <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> has a <a href="DesignBurp.html">DesignBurp</a>, in that when a class inherits from another class it uses "extends", but when it inherits from an interface it uses "implements". The language distinguishes between them in other ways, too. The designers apparently thought you should know what kind of thing you are dealing with. That's the thought that's echoing in these naming conventions.
        -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I could argue the reverse conclusion, though.  If the file uses "extends" and "implements" to distinguish the two types, why do I need to redundantly code the information into the name?  The information is explicit in the file declaring the class or interface and explicit in the file using the class or interface.  The name doesn't tell me anything that is not already coded into the file! -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        Regarding <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>' comments above: someone might want to differentiate their interfaces from their classes using a <a href="NamingConvention.html">NamingConvention</a> scheme.  Is the <a href="NamingConvention.html">NamingConvention</a> really the best place to bring the distinction between interfaces and classes to the attention of the programmer? Or would it be better if the programming environment (<a href="ClassBrowser.html">ClassBrowser</a>?) brought this information to light? Do any <a href="JavaIde.html">JavaIde</a>s do this already?

        <a href="VisualAgeForJava.html">VisualAgeForJava</a> does highlight the distinction between classes and interfaces in their development environment.

        By listening to other developers' discussions of interfaces with adjectives as names that one is not distinguishing between classes and interfaces, but instead one is putting an implied "Object" after the adjective.  That is, in a conversation one will talk about a "Cloneable Object" not just a "Cloneable."  So, I think the question comes down to "Should something like "Cloneable" be named "CloneableObject" or should we just accept that a type with an adjective name has an implied "Object" appended?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I personally prefer not to develop by convention, so I lean toward using "CloneableObject" as the name of the interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="HankRoark.html">HankRoark</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Notice, that in everyday English, '*able' words can be used as nouns (e.g., 'an unmentionable'); technically, any noun name could also be appended with 'object'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of adjectives are useful sometimes, but they may not be the way to name interfaces in every case. Adjectives seem to cast the interface -- and implementing objects -- in a passive sense: "You can do this action to this object." An object that implements Cloneable is an object that can be cloned.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there are plenty of cases where you want the implementing objects to do something much more active. Look at the Collection family of Interfaces in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>: They're all named things like List, Set, SortedSet, etc. If you were completely unfamiliar with the Collection classes, you might first try to instantiate these interfaces, but you'd learn pretty quickly.

        Here's a thought.  This is highly dependent on the Domain being the source of your key abstractions.  Instead of naming the interfaces something special, name the interfaces to match the abstraction and suffix the implementing classes with Impl.  Example: You have a WidgetFactory abstraction (<a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> pattern), you name the interface WidgetFactory and the classes MotifWidgetFactoryImpl and WindozeWidgetFactoryImpl.  FYI in JBuilder the project window doesn't differentiate between classes and interfaces but does in the structure window. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Been through this argument in the Forte environment at a previous company, not <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, and fun to see the same debate here.  In the above example, the need to distinguish really doesn't exist.  You can have the interface as WidgetFactory and the two implementations as MotifWidgetFactory and WindozeWidgetFactory.  Where we ran into the naming convention debate was when you have a single implementation of an interface, and in that case we settled more or less on this convention - giving the interface the simple, easily remembered name and suffixing the implementor.  However, in the light of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, I see that building an interface where there is only currently a single implementation gets into the YAGNI deal.

      <p>
        The reason that JBuilder doesn't differentiate between classes and interfaces in the project window is because it's showing neither classes nor interfaces there, it's showing files. This is, clearly, a big difference, especially since you can have more than one class per file. -- Addaon

        I think a naming convention, if any, should be based on use rather than <em>interface</em> or <em>class</em>. <em>Cloneable</em> and <em>Serializable</em> are indeed interfaces, but more so, they are <em>marker</em> interfaces that can be mixed and matched together. Something like <em>Test</em> in <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> is being used more as a base protocol or base class, so it makes sense for it to be simply named <em>Test</em>. Just my two cents... -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        So the distinction is not 'class' vs 'object' as such, but 'construct that describe a thing' vs 'construct that describes a behaviour'.  I like it.  In the <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a> we call the latter `<a href="MixIn.html">MixIn</a>s'.  Whether they have implementation or not is a side issue; whether they're supposed to live on their own is the deciding factor.

        The java.* hierarchy already has a few patterns for this, mostly from the collections and <a href="JavaSwing.html">JavaSwing</a> classes.  I'll use "Something" as an example of the pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something - an interface that everyone should use as parameters and return types.
      </p>
      <p>
        AbstractSomething - a partial implementation that has lots of functionality, and the end-user just has to fill in the blanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        DefaultSomething - a reasonable basic implementation.  Usually extends AbstractSomething if it exists, else implements Something.
        <em>I like to use "GenericSomething" as the name for this (or something very close). A GenericSomething can be instantiated (and this makes it different from an AbstractSomething), and most often is specialized for individual situations. -- </em><a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

        An interesting variant on this is for <a href="JavaBean.html">JavaBean</a> listeners with the <a href="AdapterPattern.html">AdapterPattern</a>, but that is a bit <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>. -- ChrisDailey 2002-02-12 
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmm - I don't think this is off topic at all. The classes in question are implementations of interfaces, and it could be argued that instead of DefaultSomething we should use SomethingAdapter, because the class is a kind of 'identity' adapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is more off topic - what about preserving some kind of use (alphabetical) ordering in IDEs? Using AbstractSomething etc. will mean that all the Abstracts will be grouped together rather than the Something-related code. Is this desirable?

        IMHO, the reason you shouldn't distinguish between classes and interfaces is that <em>the only time your code cares is when you instantiate new objects</em>. If you distinguish between the two in the naming of the objects, odds are you distinguish between the two when you think about them. The differences between classes and interfaces matter syntactically in the class definition (a convenience to aid the compiler implementors), and semantically only in that you can instantiate (some) classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You are wrong. In single inheritance languages like </em><a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, you need to distinguish them. You can't just willy-nilly decide to change an interface to a class; it'll break any existing class that already inherits from a different base class, but implements that interface.  Every concrete class implementing an interface very much cares whether it's a class, or an interface; that semantic difference, matters a lot.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once an object is instantiated, the only thing that you care about after that, from the point of view of client code, is the object's type. In particular, you only care about the type you wish to use. Every user-defined class in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> has at least two types, both of which are classes. Many classes have several types. As a developer, you should chose the one that is most appropriate, and not focus on the one that happens to correspond to the underlying object's class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of using the <a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a> to differentiate between classes and interfaces, use it to highlight factories, and move the creation logic to those factories. Then, you can free your mind from these petty differences and focus on what's important.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an aside, the argument put forward above that you should be able to easily determine what are classes and what are interfaces so you know which to extend and which to implement is a bit spurious. If you don't know enough about a type to determine if you extend it or implement it, you have no business doing either. :) In any case, the generated <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> will sort out the differences for you.

        Correct. IDEs give the option to extend classes but to implement interfaces. If you (like me) don't use an IDE, then use the <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> and your own knowledge. If all else fails the compiler will tell you, or you'll get a <a href="RuntimeException.html">RuntimeException</a> in your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s if you are instantiating dynamically. You should know the API well enough before you instantiate, and in any event you will find out within a few minutes at most. The most important thing is to communicate your intentions clearly in your code; call <em>WidgetFactory.configure(properties)</em> to configure a factory from properties, or <em>WidgetFactory.getComboBox()</em> - generic actions that apply to all widget factories - but <em>MotifWidgetFactory.getAMotifOnlyWidget()</em> to get a widget that only exists for Motif and show other developers that this is exceptional code.

        In Java, I usually prefix my interface names with an 'I', because I've found that I commonly need <strong>both</strong> an interface and a class, which it would be convenient to name the same thing.  When creating some API, I need the class to provide default behaviour for the API, and the interface to make sure other people can implement it even if they need to use something else as a base class.  So I might have an IMonitorExtension interface and a default implementation of it called MonitorExtension.  Of course other conventions are possible (AbstractMonitorExtension, BaseMonitorExtension, etc).
