        <dd>"... A few turnings later and I was thoroughly lost. There is a school of thought which says that you should consult a map on these occasions, but to such people I merely say, 'Ha!  What if you have no map to consult? What if you have a map but it's of the Dordogne?' My own strategy is to find a car, or the nearest equivalent, which looks as if it knows where it is going and follow it. I rarely end up where I was intending to go, but often I end up somewhere that I needed to be. So what do you say to that?"</dd>

        He also describes the method one must use to leave Cambridge, namely, to circle round and round and round the one way system until he achieves "escape velocity" and heads off in some random direction.

        <em>This isn't that far from the truth, at least for the centre of Cambridge...</em>

      <p>
        Yes it is. Cambridge's one-way system is reasonably obvious. Oxford, however...

        This is the <a href="MagicRoundabout.html">MagicRoundabout</a> in Swindon (near London).  And yes, that's a central roundabout (travel anticlockwise) surrounded by five other roundabouts (travel clockwise).  If you stare at it long enough, you can see the logic behind it, but any newcomer to it will just want to scream in terror and run away.

        <em>Swindon isn't really that near London. It's about 100 miles, which by UKian standards is a reasonable distance.</em> -- <a href="RobHarper.html">RobHarper</a>

        The difference between Americans and the British is that the British think 100 miles is a long way, whereas the Americans think 100 years is a long time. -- Anon

        This actually manifests itself in the way one can navigate a wiki by <a href="WikiStalking.html">WikiStalking</a>. Find someone who seems to know the space and follow them. In a wiki you'd do this by following their back-links. When learning an unfamiliar field of knowledge you can do this by finding a book you like/which seems to have a good grasp of the area and following the bibliography and references back to it. Try it on <a href="CiteSeer.html">CiteSeer</a> sometime. It's quite effective. -- <a href="AdewaleOshineye.html">AdewaleOshineye</a>

        I use this method to research music. Do I like the song? Then I investigate the artist and possibly remix artist and anyone mentioned with any connection to them on <a href="http://www.discogs.com/">http://www.discogs.com/</a> --and it's led me good places. -- <a href="RobRix.html">RobRix</a>
