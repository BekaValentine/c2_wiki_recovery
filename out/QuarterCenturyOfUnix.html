        A gripping tale of how a system grew from a PDP with 4kB of core to today's 4GB workstations.  It does a pretty good job of conveying the spirit and design in which the system was conceived.

        The book pretty approachable to the nonspecialist -- it doesn't assume you know what an ioctl(2) is, or even ls(1).  But I'm not sure how interesting it would be to people who don't like Unix at least a little bit.  It's more enjoyable if you can think `wow, imagine dc(1) running off a paper tape' as you go.

        We now have a GigaSecondOfUnix, measuring from the time(2) epoch. The clock struck 10^9 seconds in September 2001. 2^30 seconds (the computer engineer's <em>Giga</em>) is a while later.
