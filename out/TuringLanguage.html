        Turing Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A toy language created for teaching/learning programming.

        One of the worst languages I've ever had to tackle. Come on! Drawfillmapleleaf??? -- <a href="RobHarwood.html">RobHarwood</a>

        Well, given that the language was written at the University of Toronto, such a function is very necessary. How else would a beginning Canadian programmer be able to show their patriotism. There is also a drawfillstar function for those south of the border :).

        In all seriousness, Turing was created for teaching purposes. it was the first language I was ever taught (in grade 7 at that), and I was able to write some pretty complex programs for it before I moved on to C. Turing is quite simple, and has very specific error messages. A great language to learn programming IMO. Nowadays I hear they use visual basic. -- <a href="DrewCrampsie.html">DrewCrampsie</a>

        Example taken from above site:
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a complete Turing program that repeatedly picks a random number from 1 to 6 until it picks a 6.
      </p>
      <code>
        % Roll a die until you get 6.  (This line is a comment)<br/>
        var die : int<br/>
        loop<br/>
        randint (die, 1, 6)<br/>
        exit when die = 6<br/>
        put "This roll is ", die<br/>
        end loop<br/>
        put "Stopping with roll of 6"<br/>
      </code>

        It was a pretty nice language. It sawed off most of the nasty things about Pascal. I once designed a language which borrowed much of its syntax. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        Nice features. Definitely non-C.
