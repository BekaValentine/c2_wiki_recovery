        Organization Culture

      <p>
        <a href="OrganizationCulture.html">OrganizationCulture</a> is a <a href="StrategicManagement.html">StrategicManagement</a> (interpret long term) issue and it is a key consideration in many <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a> initiatives, large and small.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an interview on a 2003 book analysing the failed fortunes of DEC located at <a href="http://www.businessworldindia.com/sep1503/indepth_edgar.asp,">http://www.businessworldindia.com/sep1503/indepth_edgar.asp,</a> the author revealed his motivation for the book was to share views regarding the immutable DEC culture, which caused its rapid rise, but later also contributed to its demise due to unwillingness (lacking <a href="TheHeartOfChange.html">TheHeartOfChange</a>).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It was said in the above source that good Business Managers did exist in DEC, but they had to leave as the company was run by Engineers used to thirty years of success.
        </li>
        <li>
           In response to using a new <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a> to help effect change, the author suggested culture does not change quickly enough, not in the DEC case.
        </li>
        <li>
           At the end there are tips offered to how <a href="CulturalChange.html">CulturalChange</a> can get supported as a strategic initiative.

        <strong>Culture as a limiting Factor</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes organizations want to acquire capabilities through hiring new people with proven records elsewhere. And there are instances the tactic had not worked, even after multiple attempts. The blog at <a href="http://blogs.bnet.com/leadershipnow/?p=379">http://blogs.bnet.com/leadershipnow/?p=379</a> suggest one reason is that the existing culture run on a "Oral Tradition". See Quote below:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Injecting even highly competent professionals into a work culture that is fueled and governed by the oral tradition of the Camp Fire school of self-management sets them up for failure</em> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think in a fast changing world we will see less <a href="BusinessProcess.html">BusinessProcess</a> (and people) stability, and more reliance on the Oral Culture is inevitable. The blog advocate better documentation of key processes (and their intent) to facilitate communication. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Other mitigation methods include better management of meta-data, and invest in work simplication projects from time to time.

        <strong>CULTURE - The </strong><a href="SoulOfAnOrganization.html">SoulOfAnOrganization</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CultureIsTheManifestationOfLeadership.html">CultureIsTheManifestationOfLeadership</a> is valid so long as we recognise their are different tiers of management and so there are local subcultures. I have heard people remarked that we have "dozens of companies under the same brand". For example, the <a href="HumanResources.html">HumanResources</a> function may all refer to the same set of policies, but execution and interpretation can be different.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where there are differences in culture between different management layers, it create extra barriers for StrategyExecution. This may be a characteristic of larger companies that is hard to change.
