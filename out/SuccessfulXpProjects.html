        Successful Xp Projects
      </h1>
      <p>
        There does not appear to be a central place where <a href="SuccessfulXpProjects.html">SuccessfulXpProjects</a> are documented. This page, <a href="SuccessfulXpProjects.html">SuccessfulXpProjects</a>, is intended to be that page.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is a list of Success Stories of projects that use <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is different from just <a href="CompaniesDoingXp.html">CompaniesDoingXp</a> because we are documenting projects that meet the following criteria:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The project made a sincere effort to adopt the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices</a>. See AreYouDoingXp.
        </li>
        <li>
           The project completed releases that were subsequently put into use.
        </li>
        <li>
           The project was considered successful by the customer and the rest of the team. See <a href="DefinitionOfProjectSuccess.html">DefinitionOfProjectSuccess</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When someone asks, "Where can I go to see examples of successful projects that have been completed using XP", this is one page that can be used as a response.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is not saying that <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is the only factor contributing to the success of these projects, simply that <a href="ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices</a> practices were used and that the project was considered successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please contribute examples of projects that meet the above criteria that the members of the project are willing to share.

        A recent "Field Report" from Computerworld describes several projects successfully released by Sabre Airline Solutions predominantly using <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> practices:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/story/0,10801,91646,00.html">http://www.computerworld.com/softwaretopics/software/story/0,10801,91646,00.html</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Summary at the end of the article:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Productivity gain: 42%
        </li>
        <li>
           Quality: Defects cut to 1/5
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I seem to recall hearing that </em><a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a> was involved with this project, but am not sure where I heard this. Is that correct? -- <a href="JasonNocks.html">JasonNocks</a><em></em>

      <p>
        Was the <a href="AtsProject.html">AtsProject</a> considered successful?
        The <a href="AtsDiary.html">AtsDiary</a> indicates "ATS Iteration 5 was released on May 3rd, on time and on budget. Positive feedback from all concerned so far. Management is very pleased."

        <em>XP pundits may argue that the 42% productivity increase experienced by Sabre, or the 50% productivity increase experienced by </em>JetDirect, or the order of magnitude reduction in defect rate experienced by Symantec (just to name a few data points) are the result of using XP.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems like these would be good projects to document further. These seem to be fairly clear signs of success (productivity increases, lower defect rates), and apparently these projects used <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. If anyone has further details, please expand. The Sabre project is documented somewhat at the link above, but I am unfamiliar with the references to changes at JetDirect or Symantec. Anyone have further info? Cheers, -- <a href="JasonNocks.html">JasonNocks</a>

      <dl>
        <dt>Background</dt>
        <dd>XRT, Inc., with U.S. headquarters in King of Prussia, PA, contracted <a href="SourceXtreme.html">SourceXtreme</a>, Inc. to update an application that interfaces different Treasury / Cash Flow financial systems in use by large-scale corporations. The project had a tight budget and critical deadlines. The codebase was written in a mixture of French, Dutch, and English. The project involved adding a new set of features to two modules as well as fixing a number of problems with the existing codebase. The original codebase had no automated <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s or <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and had been largely unmaintained for a number of years.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Timeframe</dt>
        <dd>2 months. The project started in September, 2003 with a firm deadline of the end of October, 2003.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>Result</dt>
        <dd>The client received 2 Releases within this timeframe providing the most important features and bugfixes and was completed within the alloted budget. During this project, a suite of automated tests emerged. This was one of <a href="SourceXtreme.html">SourceXtreme</a>'s first projects trying to fully use XP. The team was very pleased with the results. <a href="SourceXtreme.html">SourceXtreme</a> has since delivered additional contract work, on this and a new project.</dd>

        If you wish to document projects that ran into issues and how these issues were overcome, that is excellent information to capture. Please add a different page to describe those projects, perhaps IssuesFacedAdoptingExtremeProgramming.
