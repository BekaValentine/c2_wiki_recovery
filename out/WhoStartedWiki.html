        Probably best to look at <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> before going further.

        <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> invented the wiki concept, wrote the implementation, invited the first round of authors and hosts this wiki (c2 = Cunningham and Cunningham). That's why this particular wiki instance here is sometimes called <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> (I hope I got all of that correct).

        No, it's all just a big scam. Martians passed wiki technology down to us, and they are using Ward as a cover (see <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> for the gory details). What else did you think?!?

        Notice that on Ward's <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> (at least as of this writing), there is no explicit claim of creation or ownership of the Wiki or of Wiki in general. But there are clear indications that he is at least the Maintainer of the GrailWare.
