        Inspired by discussions about exceptions, I scanned the Java source for JDK
      </p>
      <ol>

          1.5 and came across the following example of code that would be clearer

      <p>
        if written as if no exceptions could occur. <a href="YouReallyArentGonnaNeedThis.html">YouReallyArentGonnaNeedThis</a>!

        ...<br/>
        } catch (InternalError e) {<br/>
        throw new InternalError();<br/>
        }<br/>

        Maybe. However, the code is not a no-op. The exception object includes information - for example, a dump of the stack which it is created, and a description string. By replacing an old exception object with a new one you discard some information about the true point-of-error. Perhaps this was deliberate <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If so, how else would you write it? Or would you just add a comment?

        Agreed, it is not a no-op. But I don't think it was
        intentional <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a>. If it were, I would 
        include a comment or <em>something</em>. Hard to say exactly as 
        I have no clue why I am hiding the true point-of-error 
        anyway!

        I found it in the clone() method of SimpleTextBoundary
        which extends BreakIterator. BreakIterator defines clone() 
        following Sun's usual idiom:
      </p>
      <code>
        public Object clone() {<br/>
        try {<br/>
        return super.clone();<br/>
        } catch (CloneNotSupportedException e) {<br/>
        throw new InternalError();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Basically, they are following what I call the 
        ImpossibleException idiom. The compiler believes that 
        the body of the method can throw a <a href="CheckedException.html">CheckedException</a> 
        (CloneNotSupportedException), but the programmer knows 
        better. She chooses to <a href="ConvertExceptions.html">ConvertExceptions</a>, in this case 
        converting it into InternalError. This buys her two things. 
        First, she is <em>adding</em> information: the bug in the 
        <em>library</em>, specifically. Secondly, clients of 
        BreakIterator aren't burdened with catching or declaring an 
        ImpossibleException.
      </p>
      <p>
        SimpleTextBoundary follows suit, sort of:
      </p>
      <code>
        public Object clone() {<br/>
        try {<br/>
        return super.clone();<br/>
        } catch (InternalError e) {<br/>
        throw new InternalError();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But this isn't the ImpossibleException idiom! It adds 
        nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        My guess is that the author of SimpleTextBoundary 
        originally coded the catch clause as in BreakIterator, but 
        the compiler complained that CloneNotSupportedException 
        wasn't thrown within the try block. He investigated finding
        that BreakIterator threw InternalError instead and changed 
        the catch accordingly.

        One should also note that <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a> is 
        inappropriate in this situation. An InternalError when 
        attempting to clone a SimpleTextBoundary should be reported 
        to the vendor as a bug. The programmer charged with 
        addressing the bug has (a small amount of) additional work 
        in order to locate the cause of the bug. --<a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>
