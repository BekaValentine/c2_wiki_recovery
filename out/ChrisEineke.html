      <p>
        My name is Christopher Eineke and I am a German-Canadian (recently immigrated) living in Exeter, Ontario, Canada. I am pursuing a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science at Carleton University in Ottawa, Ontario. Unfortunately, I am right now in my summer holidays and unemployed.

        I started to play around with my gramp's C64 at the age of five in 1988.  Now I am 22 years old, using Gentoo Linux on my eMachines M6811 laptop and recently got interested in Computer Graphics/Game Programming.

        <em>Why is it that everyone around here is interested in CG/GP? Either that or languages! It's like some sort of social disease everyone's caught. How's it transmitted? Is it an STD?</em>
