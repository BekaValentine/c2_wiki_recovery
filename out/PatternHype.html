        Pattern Hype
      </h1>
      <p>
        Every idea needs it's supporters.  And support based on
        feelings and emotion or simply the credibility of the 
        supporter is reasonably called hype.  
        But there is good hype and bad hype. 
        Here are examples of pattern hype.  
        You decide which is which.

        At the D.C. OOPSLA, I asked everyone in the patterns 
        workshop to write
        <em>Ask me about patterns</em> on their badge.
        I know I'm not the only one that did so. 
        Several conference goers told me they had already
        had interesting conversations with other workshop
        attendees before me. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        I was at a 2 hour seminar last fall where a number of 
        people, including me, were first introduced to patterns.
        Some of them were involved in a new project.  It would 
        take more fingers than I have (10) to count the number of
        people who left talking about how patterns were going to 
        be their salvation -- their magic methodology.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most, if not all, now see them as a useful resource, not
        as the only "tool" they need.

        Computer Aided Pattern Engineering (CAPE -- vs CASE) or should it be called Pattern Aided Software Engineering?  I have talked to some people who, in earnest, look forward to the day when we can generate software systems by inputing patterns.  There may be  merit to some of these efforts, but the idea can backfire and cause people to become skeptical of the patterns (remember when expert systems were all the rage and <strong>was</strong> AI to many people, or when high level management thought that CASE tools would eliminate the need for programmers).  What do you think about <a href="PatternAidedSoftwareEngineering.html">PatternAidedSoftwareEngineering</a>?

        Technology sometimes overtakes yesterday's patterns,
        so they're tomorrow's automatically generated code.
        At that point, they cease to be important to me as
        patterns.  The literature becomes less important,
        because the knowledge can be captured in a tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can think of examples of assembly language patterns I
        used 25 years ago, which compilers know how to handle today
        (things like register allocation).
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I can't name many of these patterns that
        have become automated.  And I think the very best patterns
        can never be automated, because they call on uniquely
        human expertise.
      </p>
      <p>
        My greatest concern isn't automation per se,
        but the opportunism that comes from
        automation.  That will give rise to an industry of tool
        vendors and lots of PhD theses based on pattern automation.
        This all ties into <a href="PatternHype.html">PatternHype</a>:
        It's easier to make money
        selling a tool than it is selling good ideas.
        At worst, these efforts will lead people to do bad things,
        as is the case with many contemporary CASE tools.
        At best, they sidestep the moral imperatives of human
        comfort and aesthetics that are the core of what
        patterns mean to me.

        Part of the bad hype stems from a lot of <a href="PatternsMisconceptions.html">PatternsMisconceptions</a> (which in turn, lead to a lot of "bad hype" and more <a href="PatternSkepticism.html">PatternSkepticism</a> - its a vicious cycle). I've started a separate page for identifying many of these <a href="PatternsMisconceptions.html">PatternsMisconceptions</a>. Please contribute to it so we may better help others to understand not only what patterns are, but also what patterns are <em>not</em>.
