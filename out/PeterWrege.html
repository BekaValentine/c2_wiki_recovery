        <em>Ah, someone with ethology background! Maybe you can answer a question that's been plaguing me for years. The classic phrase "innate releasing mechanism" assumes that the pattern in question is waiting to be </em>'released<strong>, rather than waiting to be </strong>triggered<em>'. Is this significant? Or is that just a sort of random historical accident that that terminology is used?</em>
