        Transactions Vs Exceptions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here I am writing some data-centric code. Tum tum tiddle ... oh dear, this call might fail. Now if I'm living in an enterprise world like the one described in <a href="DnaVsOo.html">DnaVsOo</a>, I have a choice. I can throw an exception, or I can <a href="SetAbort.html">SetAbort</a>. The two seem to overlap - when do I do one, and when do I do the other?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Call </em><a href="SetAbort.html">SetAbort</a> if the call failing will invalidate the transaction you're participating in. Use your normal judgement regarding whether or not to throw an exception.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This divide seems to run deep. Components generally <a href="SetAbort.html">SetAbort</a>. Library objects generally throw exceptions. "Use your normal judgement" might work for my code, but what do I do about the code I use - how do I account for the fact that sometimes it'll pre-empt my exception-handling, and sometimes it won't? Or that maintenance programmers might change that without being aware of my code's usage?
      </p>

        Another approach is to use the <a href="CommandPattern.html">CommandPattern</a> to encapsulate a transactional unit of work and to execute the command wrapped in an exception handler. The exception handler can handle an exception by performing a <a href="SetAbort.html">SetAbort</a> if necessary. This can simplify the flow of control (i.e. no need to return a status code that <a href="SetAbort.html">SetAbort</a> has been performed.) Commands that can recover from some kinds of exceptions may intercede with their own handlers that retry the command when possible. -- <a href="PatrickLogan.html">PatrickLogan</a>

        <em></em><a href="JohnVlissides.html">JohnVlissides</a> and <a href="RichardHelm.html">RichardHelm</a> wrote up a transactional <a href="CompoundCommandPattern.html">CompoundCommandPattern</a> in a recent <a href="CppReport.html">CppReport</a> that does much of that. (<a href="http://www.research.ibm.com/designpatterns/pubs/ph-apr99.pdf)">http://www.research.ibm.com/designpatterns/pubs/ph-apr99.pdf)</a> BTW, if you squint your eyes so that everything you see gets a little fuzzy, <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> and <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>. Tests aren't exactly transactional, but much of the structure in that <a href="CompoundCommandPattern.html">CompoundCommandPattern</a> is in the <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a>.<em></em>
