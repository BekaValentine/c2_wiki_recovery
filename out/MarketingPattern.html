        Marketing Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="MarketingPattern.html">MarketingPattern</a> is a pattern also known as a MarketingStrategy.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> software being used to promote a PaidSoftwareProduct that has more features than the <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> product. Often times the <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> product is CrippledShareware that has a limit in some way, for example, a time limit you can use the software before you have to purchase the PaidSoftwareProduct, or the inability to SaveYourWork in order to prevent FreeRiders from indefinitely using your software. For example, a TrialVersion. This is known as <a href="ShareWare.html">ShareWare</a>, although some <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> software doesn't have a PaidSoftwareProduct or a ProfessionalVersion, or has one but is not CrippledShareware. Contrast with <a href="FreeAsInFreedom.html">FreeAsInFreedom</a> or <a href="LibreSoftware.html">LibreSoftware</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Offering different versions of your software, but concurrently, where some will have greater feature sets and a greater cost. For example, <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> XP has a Home and Pro version, where the Pro version contains more features but costs $100 more.
