        Death From Perfection

        Assuming this means when a project fails because the team is trying to achieve some unreasonable perfect solution. <a href="DoTheBestYouCan.html">DoTheBestYouCan</a> would be a better alternative.

        More likely the failure comes from investing resources out of proportion with any possible benefit. Often you will be more successful if you do much less than you could. The art is in knowing what is valuable. The best strategy is to ask. Effectively asking questions isn't all that easy which explains why so many projects fail.

        A project once sank man-years of effort trying to get a little help screen to automatically pop up when needed (as specified in the requirements). As a high paid trouble shooter to the at-risk project I suggested that users be required to push a button to get the help. This was coded overnight and the project was saved. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        There were lots of circumstances that concealed the simplicity of the situation. As an outsider I was expected to ask questions, and ask I did. That's all.  -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
