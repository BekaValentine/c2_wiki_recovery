I have done my best to discourage dialog in favor of dissertation which offers a better fit to this medium. I've been overruled.

        If <a href="MrPlato.html">MrPlato</a> lived today, he might be the first one to create a state-of-the-art dissertation based on an online dialogue, or better, multilogue. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>

        Note that Plato's Dialogues were authored and were not ad hoc discussions or debates, i.e. dialogue was used as a literary and philosophical device. Some are more like screenplays and soliloquies.

        <em>What is an example of a dialog vs. a dissertation?</em>

      <p>
        This page is an example of a dialog.  How would you turn it into a dissertation form that still works?  I don't know.

        <em>Are dialectic and dialogue the same thing?</em>

        <em>Can a Wiki dialogue be a transient state on the way to a collaborative Wiki dissertation? (transient implies the initial dialogue </em>not dialectic<em> disappears)</em>

        One reason that we don't see dissertations on a <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a> yet has an economical background, that can be verified on <a href="http://www.dissertation.com/.">http://www.dissertation.com/.</a> But that doesn't exclude that on a special purpose <a href="EcommerceWiki.html">EcommerceWiki</a> such a dream can be realized, even in combination with ongoing dialogs. -- fp
