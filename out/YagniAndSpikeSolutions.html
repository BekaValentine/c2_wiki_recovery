        To what extent do <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> interact with <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>s?  You say that you need a database because you did a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> and you know that you won't scale to what the users ultimately require without one, but you put off doing anything about it because YouArentGonnaNeedItYet?
      </p>
      <p>
        In that case do you even need to do the <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>, if you already know that FlatFiles won't do the job?  Isn't skipping that extra research work the <a href="SimplestThing.html">SimplestThing</a> (see also PerlVirtueLaziness)?

        Does this fit within a more general discussion of YagniAndSystemArchitecture?  Some discussion of system architecture found in <a href="YagniIsBologna.html">YagniIsBologna</a>.  See also <a href="CanAnArchitectureEmerge.html">CanAnArchitectureEmerge</a>.
