      <p>
        I trained as a mathematician, and now work for a large computer firm in Hursley, England, Europe (that's outside the US, guys).
      </p>
      <p>
        I have strong interests in Software Engineering, Transaction Processing, Recreational Mathematics and Number Theory, Barbershop Singing, the Z Specification Language, and Coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have lesser interests in Java, Functional Programming, Chocolate, Walking, Labrador Dogs, Teaching and Coffee.

        OK I have added a comment or two to a page on this Wiki, so this isn't my only page.
        I am still struggling with <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> on Windows NT (with Z language support) to write a large, fairly mathematical report. Maybe I can get help here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work, of course, occupies my every waking moment.
