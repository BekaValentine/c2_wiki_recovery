        Windows Xp
      </h1>
      <p>
        The first of the 21st century <a href="WindowsOperatingSystems.html">WindowsOperatingSystems</a> from <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a>.<strong>, released October 25, 2001.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2004 <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> SP2 is released, it has the "night and day" difference in <a href="SecurityManagement.html">SecurityManagement</a> features Microsoft <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a> was advising users, a first product of the <a href="TrustworthyComputing.html">TrustworthyComputing</a> initiative.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the six months after SP2 release, companies that use <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> are slowly changing over to using SP2. And MS has up the stakes of SP2 adoption by:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           warning users that in Apr05 SP2 will be automatically streamed to remaining users of <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> (only if automatic update is turned on?)
        </li>
        <li>
           advising users that next version of <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> with better security will only be available to SP2 users
        </li>
        <li>
           making future technology preview products (e.g. <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a> Avalon beta) dependent on the use of SP2
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A separate section below is reserved for further information on the SP2 release. Maybe in future it merits its own page if the <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> camp is split.

      <p>
        For users of previous <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> OS wishing to upgrade to <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a>, please remember there is this <strong>product activation</strong> scheme in <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> that can make future hardware upgrade painful.  Also worth noting is that the <strong>Automatic Update</strong> feature, if turned on, can introduce unwanted changes.

        Linux isn't the only answer to a Microsoft Monoculture, but it is the most publicized one. With hundreds of thousands of developers behind it and the myriad of projects for it, it is inevitable that Linux will be an underdog success story. Linux for the desktop keeps getting better and better, and you can't beat having a proven high-performance enterprise server as your desktop O.S. (have you seen the demos for LookingGlass yet?). Microsoft's supposed saviour, <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a>, won't make its much publicized debut until 2007. By then, millions more people would've grown sick of M$ licencing and business practices, and Linux will be such that Microsoft will need a much better <a href="DeusExMachina.html">DeusExMachina</a> to hold on to its monopoly.

        Good points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All Windows users will be running on something based on Windows NT. So they'll all have the same security, file-systems, drivers, etc. The end of the DOS lineage. (Not that Windows ME has much DOS left in it anyway, but it has lots of historical differences from NT.) Very important for developers, because we're back to a single definition of the basic Win32 stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
           The kernel changes originally made for Terminal Services seem to have been integrated into a single kernel type that will be used in all versions, from home to server. The new application is allowing home users to suspend their session, let someone else use the computer, and then reawaken their suspended session and carry on. Contrast with logging off: this way, no applications get shut down, so an interruption is less inconvenient. Again, important for serious users, because it means Windows is finally multi-user to a similar level to UNIX.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bad points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Aside from the above, it's mostly cosmetic stuff, and looks pretty shallow. More ammo to those who think Microsoft is all about marketing. e.g. Apparently, the <em>My Pictures</em> folder will "allow" us to order prints over the Internet. Oh <em>please</em>...
        </li>
        <li>
           Windows 2000 needs about twice as much memory to do the same thing as NT 4.0 (e.g. building/debugging my programs!) Will memory usage go up again for XP, or down? It's too early to say. <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> has been known to produce a new version of an OS that requires less memory than its predecessor, but it's a rare event!

        <em>Fortunately, my umbilical cord didn't work, so I have been "safely" treated to many examples of the functionality blackhole. I'm not paranoid, I just want to do what I want to do on "my" computer. But so far XP has told me that much of my paid for software will not work (Visio, pre-Microsoft being one). I get windows that pop up and won't close unless I accept or decline something; then threaten/promise me that they will automatically transmit as soon as a connection is made. Thankfully, my trusty old machine remains connected and it looks like it will be for awhile. I see a partition and Linux coming soon for my new XP box. My goal is to completely wean myself from the MS teat, I just can't take it anymore. Please wish me luck!</em>

        Since apparently troubleshooting Windows XP "powered" laptops has somehow become part of my function description, here's a question: What to do if logging in "suddenly" doesn't work anymore? Is there something like Linux' single-user/runlevel 0/rescue mode? And if so, how is it activated? -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

        <em>As I understand it, if you hold down Shift at the right point during startup you can get it to stop doing automatic actions. Exactly what you're stopping depends on when you push it - if it's after login it won't run the stuff in the Startup group, if before login then it will start up in Safe Mode, or something like that. YMMV.</em>

        Thanks! In save mode, one can change/discard passwords? Run applications? -- sh

        Also useful... the Administrator account defaults to no password, no remote access, (and using the user list form of login) no direct means of access. But it's still there; given the right key combo on startup, you can log in to a console through that account, and once given the console, you can pretty much do anything you need to do.

        With the integration of single point world wide network sign-on into Windows XP, I can't help but think that my privacy is being nibbled away.

        Nibbled away? Chomped up in one bite, like Pac-Man.

        Could someone please explain to those of us well out of the Windows loop what "integration of single point world wide network sign-on" means? Thanks.

        <em>Microsoft has this thing called "</em><a href="DotNetPassport.html">DotNetPassport</a>" which, when you sign on to it, gives you access to Microsoft web services (like MSN, <a href="HotMail.html">HotMail</a>, and Messenger). XP has Passport integrated into it such that when you log into your XP user account, it automatically signs you into Passport as well. This integration is possible with other Microsoft OS's, if you have <a href="WindowsMessenger.html">WindowsMessenger</a> installed, but now it is installed by default, which I guess scares some people. But it's really nothing new, as far as I can tell, and you can turn it off if you don't like it. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a><em></em>

        "If you don't like it," quotha. Heh. Yeah, we're just gonna install this little security camera in your bedroom to make you feel safer. But you can turn it off if you don't like it.

        <strong>Q.</strong> Can laptop with preinstalled XP be reconfigured with new partitions (and partition manager) without upsetting the existing installed system and program settings? If so, please provide web reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am hoping to setup another Microsoft OS (e.g. W2K server) on the laptop in a separate partition
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong>  Yes, so long as you have some repartitioning software which can adjust the sizes of ntfs partitions.  Partition magic will do the trick, as will Bootitng (google should find them easily enough).  Just resize the partition to make room for a new one, create the new partition, and install windows onto that... it should automatically handle creating a boot menu so long as you make sure to install to the correct (new) partition.
