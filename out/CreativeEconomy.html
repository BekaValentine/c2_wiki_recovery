        Creative Economy
      </h1>
      <p>
        The idea of the <strong>creative economy</strong> is that we're at a 5000 year turning point of human history. Coming from a history of <em>expansion</em> and <em>growth</em> and transitioning toward one of <em>interconnectedness</em> and <em>collaboration</em>. All the way from <strong>Conquest</strong> to <strong>the </strong><a href="EndOfGrowth.html">EndOfGrowth</a><strong>.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Internet and the rise of communications technologies is a harbinger of that transition. The only way to generate new value for the next 5000 years isn't through continued extraction from the Earth, but by making a creative economy. Napster and such proved that there is untapped value in <a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a> culture and we just need to make a platform to <em>unify</em> it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a> is an important step in that direction. Imagine if the whole web was wiki. We need "<a href="WikiVersionTwo.html">WikiVersionTwo</a>". Wiki needs a <a href="PerItemVoting.html">PerItemVoting</a> system and <a href="UserRanking.html">UserRanking</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ultimately, in order to scale, the OSI network model will have to be revamped to get out of <a href="ClientServer.html">ClientServer</a> architecture and into <a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a> - which is the natural way for people to connect and interact.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Technical complexity is easier to manage in a single building. </em><a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a> is only more economical if the computation costs are high, which often they are not for communication. Thus, I disagree that <a href="ClientServer.html">ClientServer</a> is a problem or bottleneck. It's one of the reasons why we are moving away from dedicated email clients to web-based email. - t<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue isn't the economics of computation, but the economics of <strong>Attention</strong>. Just like the <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a>, <a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a> fits one's natural social predilections. See <a href="AttentionEconomy.html">AttentionEconomy</a> and <a href="http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pangaia/index.php?title=Microcosm.">http://sourceforge.net/apps/mediawiki/pangaia/index.php?title=Microcosm.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The hope is to make a <a href="HackerSpace.html">HackerSpace</a>, actual places where people can come together and build things together, transform their communities with ideas of <strong>sustainability</strong> and replace the again <a href="IndustrialEconomy.html">IndustrialEconomy</a>.

        <em>But ideas are cheap (</em><a href="BrainsAsaCheapCommodity.html">BrainsAsaCheapCommodity</a>, <a href="IdeasAreWorthless.html">IdeasAreWorthless</a>). Collaboration is about being "in the know", kind of an informal socialism. Collaboration is not creativity.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Collaboration can result in creativity by the <em>synergy</em> of previously unconnected parts. Perhaps you missed the <a href="UserRanking.html">UserRanking</a> and <a href="PerItemVoting.html">PerItemVoting</a> - with these two simple tools, I can build a beautiful fractal economy of knowledge. See <a href="GlassBeadGame.html">GlassBeadGame</a>.

        [Build it, and we'll see. Ideas, dreams and visions are a dime a dozen. Only implementation counts.]
