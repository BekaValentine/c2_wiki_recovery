        I have had two <a href="MomentOfUnderstanding.html">MomentOfUnderstanding</a> events in my programming life.  The first was when I was nine and my older brother bought his first computer.  The Atari 400.  The first time I wrote
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Print "Hello World"
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           GOTO 10
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I knew what I wanted to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second experience was in December of '95 when my older brother gave me a copy of the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> book by the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a>.  and I finally grasped the year of Smalltalk I had taken in college.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since then I have been waiting for the the next <a href="MomentOfUnderstanding.html">MomentOfUnderstanding</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently interested in:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Building frameworks for change.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Self describing systems.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I have been using Smalltalk in an academic and professional setting since 1994.

        For the past 2 years I have been doing Java development for a commercial software company in the DC area.  I have <a href="TestInfected.html">TestInfected</a> other developers and hope to have the next project done with better test coverage.
