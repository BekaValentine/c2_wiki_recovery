        I would pay money for a browser plugin that scans web-page source with a list of domains to ignore. For example, you could set it to ignore anything from the domain 'doubleclick' and whenever the browser hit a reference asking for data from doubleclick, the plugin would tell it not to bother loading it.  -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

           A simple, manually-intensive solution is to edit your hosts file (/etc/hosts, C:\windows\hosts, or C:\winnt\lmhosts[.sam]) to "ignore" the offending hosts by redirecting them to a spurious address.

Unfortunately this product is hard to obtain because Symantec bought all the rights and swallowed the thing into their larger grosser toolset, but if you're on almost any variety of <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> (except XP I think) it works well for ad-blocking, cookie-killing, and some but not all anonymizing. As a personal firewall it's a little behind the times, but if you supplement it with, say, ZoneAlarm, you may start to feel like you've got just a little control of what goes in and out of your 'puter. And for all your porn needs, yes, it will happily block <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> too, either completely or just the popup windows.

        I'd also like a one-click browser configuration to allow a given domain to open new windows in a script that runs at page load time.  Until I click this box, no domain is allowed to open new windows in a page load script.  This would completely eliminate most pop-up and pop-under ads without having to maintain a blacklist.

        <strong>Discussion of ad avoidance (ethics, economics, etc.)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To be fair, though, such a system would need to be able to let the site that you're viewing know that you've disabled the ads (so that they could then turn around and say "Okay, well you can't see me either, then"). Otherwise, you're viewing the site for free, as opposed to the "payment" you make by at least being exposed to ads. Compare it to free-to-air TV; nobody says you have to watch the commercials, you just have to put up with them interrupting your favourite shows.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't think I have any responsibility to notify broadcasters or program producers that I'm using time-shifting technology to skip the ads they sent me for free, in order to view the content they sent me for free.  Same thing applies to web sites: if I never explicitly agreed to either watch their ads or notify them that I'm not watching their ads, then I have no obligation to do either thing.  Same thing also applies to promotional seminars: I don't have a responsibility to buttonhole the speaker and let them know I'm not currently in their market, nor do they have a right to buttonhole me and interrogate me about my upcoming purchase plans.  If I really like the site or speaker, I may then look for a way to sponsor it or support their sponsors, or swap cards and all that; but the switch from being in the audience to becoming a prospective customer is MINE to make.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Agree. To continue the TV analogy, the airwaves are public domain.  If I choose to videotape the free programs in order to fast-forward over the free ads, that's ok. Don't get me started on why cable de-scramblers are illegal though.  -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        <em><shrug></em> Suit yourself. The only thing you're really doing is hastening the day when the ad-supported sites you frequent are no longer viable as a free-for-view service. As an ethical issue, suppressing banner or inline ads is really a mild form of theft. If you don't want the ads, the right thing to do is not to use the service. (Suppressing popup ads and site-trappers, OTH, is merely trying to save your sanity). If you go <em>back</em> to a ad-supported based site, that's certainly an agreement to put up with the ads. -- rw.

        What many of us are really doing is hastening the day when commercial entities stop trying to make the Web a TV set, so we can go back to how it was when it all started.  I'll take a hand-written, volunteered, carefully crafted page
        over all the glitzy bumpf any day.  Witness this wiki.  --<a href="AlainPicard.html">AlainPicard</a>, feeling particularly ornery today.

        <em>I'm generally willing to view material that originates from the site I'm viewing.  (I ignore it, but I let it appear.)  What I don't want to allow on </em>'my computer<strong> are ads or other material from third party sites.

        <em>You have no contract with the content providers; they offer their content for free, so there's no legal obligation to do anything for them in exchange. Therefore being selective in which of their links you follow isn't theft; it's an expression of aesthetics.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nobody says you have to follow the links. However, the facts of the matter are these:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Putting up a web site does cost a bit of money. Putting up a high-quality web-site, updated regularly, with interesting information costs a lot of money.
        </li>
        <li>
           Many sites want to recoup that money somehow.
        </li>
        <li>
           The current method of choice is internet advertising. The sooner this is discredited, the sooner other methods (such as subscription or micropayments) will take hold.
        </li>
        <li>
           Internet advertising means that the site you are trying to reach is free-to-view. Most other methods won't be.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Conclusion: if you want free-to-view web-sites, don't do things that will discourage internet advertising. -- rw.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no point in advertising unless people actually read the ads and buy the stuff advertised. If you don't read the ads, even if you let them come up on the screen, it's not going to work.  Advertisers are in the process of figuring this out. Personally, I'll take the micropayments if it comes to that. It is disingenuous to call these "free-to-view" sites whether you pay monetarily or in your valuable time and bandwidth wasted on useless ads. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        Metaphor: blocking internet banner ads is like watching public television but not pledging any money.  This has a slight EthicsSmell, but is not illegal.

        Question: what about people who never purchase online? If they block ads, aren't they actually saving money for companies that advertise online, because they reduce unnecessary load on the company's servers? Are these folks' actions more consistent[1] than those who neither purchase nor block ads?
