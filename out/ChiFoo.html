        <em>Ward extracted these sentences from wiki and wrote a couple of his own to make an abstract for his upcoming CHIFOO talk June 20th, 2001 ...</em>

        "Wiki is a web site written by its users. People like you and me. Anyone can change any page or create new pages. Read the <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a> to find out how, and then go to the <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a> to try it yourself."
      </p>
      <p>
        "The site and the software were created by <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> for the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a>. It is home to
        an <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>, as well as a large volume of related discourse and collaboration
        between its readers."
      </p>

        <strong>'Wiki</strong>' exploits a small <strong><em>handful</em></strong> of clever ideas to engage the organic and self organizing properties of humans. The result has been dubbed <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. Here is how some humans try to describe it:
      </p>
      <p>
        "<a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> is typing in a bunch of book titles and coming back a day later and finding them turned into birds in the Amazon!!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Writing on Wiki is like regular writing, except I get to write so much more than I write, and I get to think thoughts I never thought. "
      </p>
      <p>
        "Its like being on a really good <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> project, where you wake up the next morning to find your bugs fixed and ideas improved."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It reminds us of minimalist Japanese brushstroke drawings; you provide the few, elegant slashes of ink, and other minds fill in the rest."
      </p>
      <p>
        "It befuddles and enlightens."
      </p>
      <p>
        In this talk Ward will explain what makes <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>, why it worked for the pattern community, and why most attempts to do more will spoil it for everyone.
