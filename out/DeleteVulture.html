        Delete Vulture
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a> is not in the habit of marking pages for deletion. Rather, the <a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a> circles over <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, spotting pages which look as if they are likely to be deleted. When the "(deleted)" marker appears, the <a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a> swoops down to second the <a href="PageDeletion.html">PageDeletion</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="DeletionConventions.html">DeletionConventions</a> is to wait about 24 hours before seconding a <a href="PageDeletion.html">PageDeletion</a>. Waiting is necessary for a couple reasons: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It allows time for all <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s to be found and fixed.
        </li>
        <li>
           It allows time for several other <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> to ponder the proposed deletion of the page. One of them just might restore the page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One might also imagine a <a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a> as someone whose habit when wiki-ing is to turn to the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a> pages and systematically second the deletion of every "(deleted)" page in the lists. But unlike a <a href="DeleteAngel.html">DeleteAngel</a>, the <a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a> does so without bothering to examine the missing content of the pages or check and fix their <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a vulture in nature, the <a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a> is not evil, though his/her presence can make <a href="RecentChangesJunkies.html">RecentChangesJunkies</a> feel uneasy. The <a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a> is not a <a href="WikiGremlin.html">WikiGremlin</a> but a zealous <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a> with a taste for dead pages.

        The following compressed discussion concerns differences of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and newRecentChanges with respect to deletes:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Two-phase delete is a vestigial feature.</em>  In the old days, <a href="PageHistory.html">PageHistory</a> didn't exist, and two-phase delete was the only way (aside from offline backups) to recover page content after deletion.  That is no longer the case, of course.  If <a href="RecentChangesJunkies.html">RecentChangesJunkies</a> are concerned about pages disappearing without their review, they are free to use <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> with the ?del=1 option.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> very good, just reversed a delete of WelcomeVisitors because the size of change looks suspicious, but I also agree that it lacks the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> that yield information regarding confidence levels. Also using <a href="PageHistory.html">PageHistory</a> to restore is cumbersome and if the delete on the last day of the month is not discovered quickly, the history would be gone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s make a point of checking and fixing <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s. That's a lot easier to do with a semi-deleted page before it disappears into the <a href="PageHistory.html">PageHistory</a>. Plus, the <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a> indexer is updated only once every 24 hours. It's satisfying to finish a page deletion <em>after</em> the indexer has done its job. So a two-phase delete is still a useful feature. It means, "Sometime in the next 24 hours or so you should make sure the <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s are fixed." 
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see how that complicates fixing backlinks.  Using <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>?del=1, click the most recent diff link, then click the page title twice.  The same search is performed as would be if the page still existed.  But in most cases of page deletions, I would recommend fixing the backlinks first - or, depending on the circumstance, leaving the links in place for future <a href="AccidentalLinking.html">AccidentalLinking</a> use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> doesn't tell who edited the page most recently. Knowing that gives me a clue how much further work might need to be done. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Spam is easier fought with <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> because of the ability to see patterns, as you acknowledged.  But in the case of vandalism, it is also helpful.  You can see a pattern of alternating "+" and "-", to indicate a revert war, or alternating "new" and "delete" to indicate a delete war.  That information is lost on <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> and <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.  Further, the last-edit <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> has no guarantee of accuracy - vandals can easily forge it.  It is not a reliable tool for fighting vandalism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> have different features. I find <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> less useful for what <em>I</em> like to do.
