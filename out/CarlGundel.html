        Hi!  I've been building software in Smalltalk since 1988.  I chose Smalltalk for use in developing a soup to nuts shop floor control system.  We built this system which was continually developed even as people were using it (changing the engine while driving the car).
      </p>

        I've also been involved in other interesting Smalltalk projects like:
        - A CNC machining simulator
        - A popular version of BASIC (see <a href="LibertyBasicIsWrittenInSmalltalk.html">LibertyBasicIsWrittenInSmalltalk</a>)
        - A prototype system for scheduling and verifying fissionable materials in the Former Soviet Union
        - Software for Frontline Labor Management (see <a href="http://www.kronos.com)">http://www.kronos.com)</a>
        - The open source Smalltalk called Squeak
