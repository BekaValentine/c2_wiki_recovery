        Time Boxing
      </h1>

        Think of <a href="TimeBoxing.html">TimeBoxing</a> as a train schedule. Every 15 minutes, a train leaves the station. It carries whoever arrives. Periodic <a href="TimeBoxing.html">TimeBoxing</a> says that a release happens every TimeBox, and carries whatever features can be finished. The releases <strong>always</strong> happen, on time. The project then measures (in some form) the content of each release. <a href="TimeBoxing.html">TimeBoxing</a> need not be periodic -- it simply says that the date of the release is held constant, and the content allowed to vary.

        It seems this is applicable to a larger degree to ongoing and continuous software development, such as that of a product which is undergoing ConstantChange, and which is being released in new versions, patches, and upgrades which represent the state of the art. Examples: <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a>, Linux, Perl, Windows, ProductivitySuites such as Word, Excel, Access, <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a>, Outlook, etc.. This does not imply that it can not be applied to less continuous products, or products in the early phases of the <a href="SoftwareLifeCycle.html">SoftwareLifeCycle</a>.

        <em>For better or worse, </em><a href="TimeBoxing.html">TimeBoxing</a> is simply an alternative to FunctionBoxing. I know of no arguments that make it more or less suitable for the examples given above -- it is simply a different approach to managing deliverables.<em></em>

        Well, the failure modes seems to be different, which might be significant. Looks as if a TimeBox delivery will always occur, but might contain no increment in value, whereas a FunctionBox delivery might never happen. So, we might ask, which kind of failure is easier to manage (i.e., change into something less likely to fail): deliver in one second from now, or deliver as soon as you have proved that P=NP?
