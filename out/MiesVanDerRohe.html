        Apprenticed under his father (Mies) as a stonemason; he never academically trained as architect. Post WWI; a contemporary of Walter Gropius, worked under various Berlin architecture firms. Architect; Berlin 1918-1937; then Chicago, where he died in 1969. Design philosophy: "Driving to the Essence of Things". Designed a chair (for Barcelona '29); thin steel frame, very comfortable, very famous, often copied.

        The aphorism "<a href="LessIsMore.html">LessIsMore</a>" is, by superficial scribes, ascribed to both (Ludwig) Mies Van der Rohe and R. Buckminster Fuller; both did exemplify its concept, in their respective designs. However, if M.V.d.R. or B.F. ever laid claim to coining the phrase, well .. then they were just "EmbracingAndExtending" or "innovating". The phrase, in English-language literature, dates to an 1855 poem by Browning; which poesy puts it on the lips of painter Andrea del Sarto (actual historical figure; 1486-1531).
