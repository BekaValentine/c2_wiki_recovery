        Collateral Effects

        This is the same as <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You call a method that supposedly shouldn't change the state of the program (ProgramState = the state of all objects in a program) and the bloody method does some unexpected change in ProgramState.
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is a program with <a href="HeisenBug.html">HeisenBug</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is the point of the above to say that all programming should be pure functional, due to the known deleterious effects of every kind of side effect, including I/O and especially assignment?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No. Pure functional does not exist. Even Lisp and Haskell programmers use contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or is it just a rant about people doing unexpected mutators in addition to the ones you expected?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Mutators are supposed to change the receiver. <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s usually occur in an unrelated place.
