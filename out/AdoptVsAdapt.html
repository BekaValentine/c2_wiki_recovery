        Adopt Vs Adapt
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think "adoption" is the wrong metaphor for what you do when you change culture. When you adopt a child, you get a bunch of hidden history with current and future manifestations. When you give birth to a child, you get to screw them up yourselves, but at least you have a chance of seeing the connection between your parenting and their behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        The values are the DNA, the XP12 are the parts of the newborn, and from there you get to grow the kid however you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of giving birth instead of adopting, I think your adaptation of the newborn so as not to be instantly rejected is masterful. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>
