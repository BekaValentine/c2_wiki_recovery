        Salmon Mousse
      </h1>
      <p>
        The group equivalent of being hit by a truck. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The team all go out for dinner, eat bad salmon mousse, and die. Also, any other reason for mass loss of developers. Not exactly common, but teams have been known to defect <em>en masse,</em> or you could just have bad luck and a number of people leave about the same time for different reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        So named from a skit in the <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> film <a href="TheMeaningOfLife.html">TheMeaningOfLife</a>, where a dinner party of British suburbanites is visited by Death.
