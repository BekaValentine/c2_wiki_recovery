        <strong>Negative publicity</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I know from email that the following sentence, copied from an earlier version of <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>, was written by <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a> and expressed his view on Why. This ascription of identity is left anonymous as a tiny joke.

        <dd>It ended up seeming cheeky, condescending, hostile to all but a very select few, and hopelessly stuck in enormously detailed contemplation of sentimental trivia about the host's favorite historical figures, primarily <a href="WinstonChurchill.html">WinstonChurchill</a>.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        I think it was more varied than that. But I completely agree that there wasn't nearly enough variety for a self-styled PluralismWorkshop. Even the many disagreements were mostly boringly predictable. That's why we're determined to introduce some fresh perspectives, starting with an intelligent UK Muslim one. If they'll have us.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for Why's claimed enormously detailed contemplation of <a href="WinstonChurchill.html">WinstonChurchill</a>, would anyone like to guess where exactly Winston comes in our ranking of people pages by citation? See TopicalThemes for some of the many other live themes, where Churchill doesn't even get a mention. There are also various critical pages like ChurchillTheParanoid which are the very opposite of sentimental, with the mistakes of Churchill described there being far from trivial. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, as I've said on Why recently, I feel that I've been helped by Tom's critique in this area. ClaimedObsessionWithSixtyYearsAgo has some later reflection on it. This has made me think more about <a href="WhyHistory.html">WhyHistory</a> matters, how it relates to today and how important it is to be balanced in telling it. Indeed I feel I have learnt from Tom's perspectives in a deeper way than that. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

      <p>
        I remind you Richard that you do <strong>not</strong> own <strong>this</strong> forum or this page. I resent your focus on forcing people, specifically <a href="KathyBracy.html">KathyBracy</a> and me, to identify themselves. I also resent your assumption that you have the right to force a particular page to remain just the way you deem it best (on this wiki). Such behavior, in addition to being an example of <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a>, also provides, at least for me, a credible explanation for at least some of the personal hostility that you seem to attract here.

        <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> announced the intention to create a <a href="SiteOfChristianPages.html">SiteOfChristianPages</a> seeded from some from Wiki in November 2000. Migration of initial pages was carried out by <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a> and myself and led to some initial discussion. <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> suggested moving the <a href="CategoryEasternThought.html">CategoryEasternThought</a> pages from Wiki in late 2000.

        Thanks very much for doing it Pete. <a href="JoshuaGrosse.html">JoshuaGrosse</a> has kindly moved the pages related to the JesusSeminar. Some of us could probably use a few remaining Christian-related pages like ReligiousWar, <a href="OpennessOfGod.html">OpennessOfGod</a> and <a href="JohnPolkinghorne.html">JohnPolkinghorne</a> in the next quarter.

        <strong>Summary of the Eastern page dispute</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people argued that it was always advisable to leave the eastern thought pages here, on the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a>, where they could be maintained by a bigger, "more open" community. Eastern philosophy has been an explicit influence to patterns and <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>s, these folk argued. Just as evangelical Christianity has influenced the development of patterns and <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> - take the example of <a href="KenAuer.html">KenAuer</a> - some of us replied.
      </p>
      <p>
        Concern was also expressed about alleged abuses of power by the Why ForumHosts, who had locked pages to discourage those who refuse to adopt Why community norms such as RealPeoplePlease from contributing. See the latest Why editions of <a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a> for an example of the latter. That didn't seem like an appropriate manner to conduct pattern work and thus have charge of eastern pages, to some on Wiki, including a number who preferred to remain anonymous.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WhyMigrationDiscussion.html">WhyMigrationDiscussion</a> was penned in the aftermath of the dispute about Eastern pages, to draw attention to the deletion of important signed testimony at that time. The important argument about the general benefit of having wikis with <a href="DifferentHostingPolicies.html">DifferentHostingPolicies</a> that was part of my own signed testimony has now been restored and expanded in that page. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

      <p>
        <strong>Whether to move WTC pages to Why</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I strongly urge participants here to move these pages wholesale to <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>. Not only would that be more appropriate a place than here, but you would also benefit from the 1000 pages of theological discussion there, many of which are relevant. Alternatively, those that continue to write here should do so fully with the expectation that these pages will be deleted in the short term. I don't think that's too much a penalty. I doubt anyone will want to see any words they wrote this week echo throughout the eons. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        We were grateful for the clarity and charity of that contribution from Canadian soil. There's further clarification of our own easy-come, easy-go attitude on TheRealSunirShah:

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>For avoidance of doubt, I offered Why as a possible place for it, but certainly didn't and don't feel it right to put any pressure on Ward or the rest of the community about it. It's still a sensitive time for those in the USA and elsewhere. But I did appreciate your words about it, then and now.</dd>

        <strong>What fits on what wiki?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Worth Considering: Since expressions concerning religion must be considered a free speech issue, and because religion plays a vital part in many people's everyday life, expressions regarding its influence on people, patterns, and the history of programming should include those rights and not be shoved aside for the convenience of those having opposing views. Reduction of and opposition to these rights does not seem to reflect the <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a>.

        <em>I have no objection to discussion of religion, or anything else. Sadly, my experience is that many of those wishing to express opinions are not actually prepared to listen to the opinions of others.

      </p>
      <p>
        From <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a> in <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>:

This may have been true once but is not true any more. <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> is past the point where it would serve well as a <em>fork</em> of this wiki as it has its own structure, content, community and direction. Moreover, it wouldn't be really fair to do that as it's not at all clear that the community wants to (or should) dissolve its meta discussion on a foreign wiki with foreign texture.</dd>

      <p>
        Quite so. And I say that, based on just these two quotes, Wiki as a whole has learnt a thing or two during the WhyEpisode. The highly generous might even choose to attribute a little of that to some of our efforts on Why. In any case, we clearly live - quite a relief in my case - and learn.
      </p>
      <p>
        And Why is, of course, reopening soon. See the interview with SulemanAhmed this week as a taster of what may follow. We have badly needed the intelligent Muslim perspective. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        Mind if a lurker in this community shares his opinion? Richard, I think it all boils down to this. The religious pages that formed the foundation for Why were created here on Wiki. While they were here, they were a common resource... but they were off topic. Thus, despite all the controvery about moving the pages, you were entrusted with these public resources as a steward. In some ways, people expected Why to serve as a public trust. However, because Why was not shaping up the way you liked, you threw up gates and made it a private club (perhaps temporarily?), and most people feel you don't have the right to do so; it seems to them that you've abandoned stewardship and opted for lordship. Suddenly, the people who had contributed to Why found themselves barred from their contributions (in a "look-but-don't-touch" kind of way). In short, your plans and actions have cut out a good many people with much of themselves invested in Why. -- <a href="StephenGilbert.html">StephenGilbert</a>

        <strong>Concur.</strong> When I found the barriers to contribution put up on Why I left and did not return. Oh, well. And another point, as long as I'm on this soapbox -- if you are going to call it a Wiki, shouldn't it be open to all, as the Wiki concept implies? Isn't it a bit of false and misleading something-or-other to call it a Wiki? The term "private Wiki" seems like an oxymoron, too. A Wiki is open, period.
