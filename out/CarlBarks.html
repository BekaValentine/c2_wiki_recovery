        He was an artist and writer for Disney; I don't know what-all he did, but it included many of the UncleScrooge comics.

        Barks's Scrooge comics were amazing.  They took the Disney universe into great realms of world travel, mystery, suspense, and ethnic/ethical/economic conflicts.  Easily the most sophisticated things to come out of Disney, ever.

        Plus:  I don't know whether Barks invented the JuniorWoodchucksGuidebook or inherited it from a predecessor, but that has to be one of the most useful books ever, right up there with the Hitchhiker's Guide. That book had everything a young duck could need! - <a href="RjLesch.html">RjLesch</a>
