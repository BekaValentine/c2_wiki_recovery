        Screen Scraper
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ScreenScraper.html">ScreenScraper</a>s ignore the underlying structure of an interface or application
        to just parse the human oriented display.  They are often the simplest method of
        interfacing to a legacy application and can be very useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        Screen Scraping often lives atop legacy systems that assume an 80x24 (or 80x25) display. Display type and fonts aren't an issue, because the scrapers deal with characters, not glyphs. Geometry is a non-issue if the legacy system in the "life support" phase of its lifecycle, with a never-again-to-be-changed <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sort of communication with legacy systems is often the domain of technologies like LU 2.0 HllApi (an API for reading 3270 and 5250 screens called the <a href="HighLevelLanguage.html">HighLevelLanguage</a> API -- meaning <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>) and was extremely common between 1990 and 1999 when client-server systems were in vogue.  Since then other options for communication with legacy <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a> systems have come into play, such as TCP Sockets, MQSeries and even <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a>.

        The phrase is also used for some
        <a href="GuiTesting.html">GuiTesting</a> tools which attempt to run at the <a href="ScreenScraper.html">ScreenScraper</a> level.  E.g they
        watch a test developer click, remember (x,y) locations and characters typed, and
        then record the actions in a script for later replay to provide a test.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not work (see <a href="GuiTesting.html">GuiTesting</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        First, any variation in geometry, display type, fonts, etc invalidates
        the replay and at least requires editing the recorded script.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, any redesign of the GUI screen to have different functionality,
        layout, etc will require redoing the test creation effort.  Hence this
        technology can not provide a useful level of <a href="RegressionTesting.html">RegressionTesting</a> across
        releases.
