        <em>Well, for a start:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>One man could form his own house, which could form its own canton, which could form its own nation, and so make that man a representative in the chamber of the </em>WorldGovernment. Sure he'd have no significant voting power but he'd have a hell of a soapbox. Heck, everyone would do it - you'd be back to a free-for-all. To a lesser extent this seems a problem at every level.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               This only becomes a problem at the WorldGovernment level. So it would have to have a quorum requirement - framing based on a minimum amount of social money in your canton.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I like the upside-down jurisdiction thing, but why this particular number of levels of hierarchy?</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               People aggregate this way. Family, tribe, nation, known-world - a natural hierarchy throughout human history.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What's wrong with being in more than one canton/house/thingy? Lattice structures should work fine given the </em>social money<em> mechanism. Anyway weren't you the bloke who said </em><a href="MultipleInheritanceIsNotEvil.html">MultipleInheritanceIsNotEvil</a>?<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Sounds reasonable - again, quorum levels may be important. If you're not contributing at least a single socdollar to a house, why should it have you?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Why use </em>SocDollars? If SocDollars are for sale anyway, why not use real dollars?<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Very good question! Real dollars have lots of extraneous ontologies we don't need here - debt, interest, derivatives, exchange rates, and so on. Nevertheless there is a way to define a SocDollar in terms of a real dollar: one socdollar is the investment of one real dollar for the period of one day. Normalize it to the <a href="BitStandard.html">BitStandard</a> and you have <a href="HyperCurrency.html">HyperCurrency</a> ... or maybe ditch the tokens and use <a href="SwapDollar.html">SwapDollar</a>s instead.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        Where this page differs from the <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> idea is that it specifies a particular social structure and purpose. It also ditches a lot of the <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> mechanisms for compositing societies. The <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> idea was to avoid representatives altogether and use a kind of Auction instead. The idea here is to use representatives for decision making but to scope them in time and power. The <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> needed some kind of admin/adjudication/representation function anyway - I just shuffled all that off into StoneCharter to leave the thing as open as possible. If you like, <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> is a generic, abstract social mechanism; <a href="WikiWikiGovernment.html">WikiWikiGovernment</a> is a specific proposal for a concrete <a href="NewWorldDemocracy.html">NewWorldDemocracy</a>.
