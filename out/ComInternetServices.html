        <a href="ComInternetServices.html">ComInternetServices</a> is a mechanism that allow <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> <a href="ComponentObjectModel.html">ComponentObjectModel</a> objects to communicate with other objects on a different device, over internet.

        I believe the services were offered at around the time <a href="DistributedInternetArchitecture.html">DistributedInternetArchitecture</a> was made available.

        With <a href="ComInternetServices.html">ComInternetServices</a>, it is possible that <a href="RemoteProcedureCall.html">RemoteProcedureCall</a> over HTTP can be made between machines with <a href="WindowsOperatingSystems.html">WindowsOperatingSystems</a>. It appeared that there is no need to use <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DistributedCom.html">DistributedCom</a> (Com over the wire) by itself enabled remote object invocation over the lan, whereas <a href="ComInternetServices.html">ComInternetServices</a> is deployed using <a href="DistributedCom.html">DistributedCom</a> that uses the Tunneling TCP protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of security, I think it is compatible with the SSL (<a href="SecureSocketsLayer.html">SecureSocketsLayer</a>) technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        This mechanism is supposedly less resource intensive than the <a href="VirtualPrivateNetwork.html">VirtualPrivateNetwork</a> alternative. The other technology available at the time was <a href="SoapProtocol.html">SoapProtocol</a> based messaging (via <a href="SoapToolkit.html">SoapToolkit</a>) and again the alternative is much more resource intensive.

        <em>Anyone got information to share whether this is still a serious technical alternative in 2004, in light of security bulletin alerts (e.g. MS03-039), and in comparison to other MS technologies such as </em><a href="DotNetRemoting.html">DotNetRemoting</a>?<em> -- dl</em>

           Perhaps my question is partly answered in <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/webservicesdcom.asp.">http://msdn.microsoft.com/library/default.asp?url=/library/en-us/dndotnet/html/webservicesdcom.asp.</a> I note that async comms was mentioned there for <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>, but who relies on async COM, anyone yet?
