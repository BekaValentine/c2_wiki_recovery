        Developed by Canadian company AVRO, the Arrow was built to defend Canada from air attack over the <a href="NorthernCanada.html">NorthernCanada</a>. Since this area is cold and vast, a normal jet just wouldn't do. What was needed was dual pilot jet capable of supersonic speed (mach 2) with a large flight range. This was simply not available, and no country was willing to design such a craft. AVRO took on the project to build the supersonic jet in the early fifties.

        Before the first true functioning craft was ready, (previous air flights were done with a weaker engine) the project was cancelled. For some reason, the project was not left for re-evaluation, but was destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        This cancellation and destruction set back Canadian aviation <em>(and arguably the Canadian economy)</em> and it has never fully recovered. The design team had scattered and moved on (to work on the Concorde and NASA Gemini Space Program.)
      </p>
      <p>
        After the cancellation and destruction, less capable aircraft were later purchased from the US, at a higher cost than what the Arrows would have cost. Stupid, stupid, stupid politics.

      <p>
        <em>Remember however that politics and waste isn't the sole province of politicians. I know someone who was a draftsman for Avro at the time and directly experienced the waste and mismanagement which led to the cost overruns that the politicians used as an excuse to kill the project.</em>

        Moral: Just because your project is so great that it is 'obviously great' don't pretend it can't be canned.
