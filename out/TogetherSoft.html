        I am evaluating <a href="TogetherControlCenter.html">TogetherControlCenter</a> and find very interesting functions and uses. Can someone give feedback about using it in a real project?

        <a href="TogetherSoft.html">TogetherSoft</a> Control Center isn't just a UML modeling tool.  It is a full development platform that supports the software development process from requirements through testing.  It supports bi-directional updates between UML models and project source, so changes that you make to a model simultaneously update the corresponding project source (and vice-versa).  It can retro-engineer an existing project from its source which is very handy when you're trying to understand an undocumented application (which, of course, never happens).
      </p>
      <p>
        Control Center is built in Java, so it runs under any Java-enabled platform.  The main distributions are: Windows, Solaris, Linux and generic Unix.  It requires a hefty machine.  I'm currently using a 2.4GHz Pentium 4 machine with 512MB ram and that works well.  The license is (very approximately) ~$1000/seat.

        TCC has a full-featured editor that is somewhat reminiscent of IntelliJ's IDEA.  Matter of fact, the rumor-mill says that IDEA was developed by a group of programmers that spun off from Together.
