        "Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex, intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple, stupid behavior." --<a href="DeeHock.html">DeeHock</a>, VISA System (requoted from <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>'s <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopment.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopment</a>)

        The practices-based process I use for cleaning my room is:
      </p>
      <code>
        A place for each thing, each thing in its place<br/>
        Have what you use, use what you have (i.e. throw out or give away stuff)<br/>
        Worst mess first<br/>
        Do big cleanings with other people<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When I compared this process to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and <a href="AgileModeling.html">AgileModeling</a>, I noticed several "types" of rules.  Of course, these are not hard and fast catagories, there are more categories, and rules do not always fit nicely in one category...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Rules defining "what is caught up"
        </li>
        <li>
           Rules defining "what is next"
        </li>
        <li>
           Rules that act like "tools in a tool box", and are used on an "as needed" basis
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Examples</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Rules defining "what is caught up"</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        A place for each thing, each thing in its place<br/>
        Have what you use, use what you have<br/>
        <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a><br/>
        All unit tests run<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Rules defining "what is next"</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Worst mess first<br/>
        Worst thing first<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Rules used as needed</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Do big cleanings with others<br/>
        Creating several models in parallel<br/>
        Updating models only when it hurts<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Another workable rule is "all that is needed to impose order on a confusion is to stabilize one thing."
      </p>
      <p>
        When addressing chaos, it doesn't matter <em>which</em> thing you fix first -- just fix <em>one</em> thing.  Then you can fix the next thing.  As you proceed, priorities can be established, but to get started, just do one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        If everything is moving, just get one thing to hold still.  Then another.
      </p>
      <p>
        This assumes that you're not <em>keeping</em> an existing order, but establishing one.
