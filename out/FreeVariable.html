        Free Variable
      </h1>
      <p>
        Note: The following is not a definition of <em>actual</em> <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a>s as seen in mathematics, but that of top level lexically scoped variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <em>free variable</em> is a variable used within a function, which is neither a formal parameter to the function nor defined in the function's body (and in scope at the point of the variable's use).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in this C function, <em>printf</em> and <em>phase_shift</em> are free variables.  The first is a standard library function; the second had better be defined by the programmer; else this function is in error.  <em>angle</em>, being a formal parameter, is not a free variable; nor is <em>x</em>.  
        The first use of <em>sin</em> is a <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a>; it too is a standard library function (one which returns the sine of the angle).   The second use of <em>sin</em> (in the if statement) is not, as a local definition for <em>sin</em> is provided (which shadows the library function).  
      </p>
      <p>
        We could argue that "double", "if", and "int" are <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a>s as well; but those are keywords so we'll ignore them.
      </p>
      <code>
        void silly (double angle)<br/>
        {<br/>
        double x = sin (angle + phase_shift);<br/>
        printf ("The sine of the angle, phase shifted, is %f\n", x);<br/>
        if (angle > 0)<br/>
        {<br/>
        int sin = 7;<br/>
        printf ("There are %d deadly sins, %d if you count "<br/>
        "pointer arithmetic\n", sin, sin+1);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
