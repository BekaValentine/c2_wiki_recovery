      <p>
        Trust on the Internet and the role of Trusted Intermediary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of Trusted Intermediary (<a href="PayPal.html">PayPal</a>, c2it).
      </p>
      <code>
        - banks act as Trusted Intermediaries in pre-Internet<br/>
        culture.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        EBay (feedback function, proxy bidding function).
      </p>
      <code>
        - are there more general examples of eReputation?<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I've been using PGP for 10 years now and conduct thousands of
        dollars in business on the Internet but I have yet to find
        the 'Web of Trust'. Crypto-authentication is just a building block.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML/XML allows more_better_faster exchange of data and
        information, but they also are just building blocks.

        Other things I am interested in:
        Decision / design management tools.
        I feel like large organization are now managing schedule, release dependencies in a very sophisticated way, and there is a good culture and tools around how and why we do this. Some organization are getting good at managing requirements (requirements traceability etc). Not many orgs manage design decisions very well. I have not seen good tools to support decision traceability (design / architecture support, implications etc).
