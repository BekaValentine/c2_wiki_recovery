      <p>
        I'm a Smalltalk person, and I've been doing this for a little over 10 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went to <a href="CarletonUniversity.html">CarletonUniversity</a> in what I think of as its glory days, where I studied with the likes of <a href="JohnPugh.html">JohnPugh</a>, <a href="WilfLalonde.html">WilfLalonde</a> and <a href="DaveThomas.html">DaveThomas</a>. I did both a Bachelor's and a Master's there (computational geometry in Smalltalk/V Mac).
      </p>
      <p>
        I worked for <a href="TheObjectPeople.html">TheObjectPeople</a> for almost 8 years, most recently as the architect (which means not coding much) on the TOPLink family of object-relational mapping products (Smalltalk, Java, <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>). Since the absorption of <a href="TheObjectPeople.html">TheObjectPeople</a>, I've left and am now working for Cincom on <a href="VisualWorksSmalltalk.html">VisualWorksSmalltalk</a>. TOPLink was bought by <a href="WebGain.html">WebGain</a> and then picked up by Oracle.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote a column for many years for TheSmalltalkReport until its untimely demise. I've also given a presentation called "Secrets of the ENVY Masters" at the ESUG Summer School, Smalltalk Solutions, and at OOPSLA '98.
