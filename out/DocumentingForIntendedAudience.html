        Documenting For Intended Audience
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes it is difficult to determine what documentation should exist for a project, and what each document should contain.  One good solution to this is to look at who you would expect to be the future audiences of documentation, and develop a document for each audience group.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, where I work, some groups (each with their own set of documentation) include:
      </p>
      <code>
        - Regulators<br/>
        - Technical Support Staff<br/>
        - Clients<br/>
        - Employees<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course, it is frequently possible to cut-and-paste portions of text or graphics from one group's documentation to another group's copy.
      </p>

        Generally if you're going to write technical documentation of any kind, you should get answers to these two questions pretty early in the game:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Who is going to read this?
        </li>
        <li>
           What job are they going to do with the information?
        </li>
      </ul>
