        <dd>Screen real estate is at a premium, therefore we should make as much use out of it as we can. One way of doing this is to decrease the font size on our code windows. Unfortunately decreased size also means decreased clarity.	'We need to re-engineer the alphabet so that it will be clear at extremely small sizes.'</dd>

        I can't wait for someone trained in typography to look at this font, and write about all the insanity I'm seeing but don't know how to articulate.

        All I can say is, the letter "F" looks like the number "3", and I can't tell the difference between the "I" and the "T".

        If I saw a page of <a href="ProgFont.html">ProgFont</a> being labored upon by a programmer when I was young and considering my career options, I can say for certain that I'd never have joined the ranks.  BASIC was mystifying enough when I was eleven.

        Coincidentally with a similar name, some interesting fonts that are small which still use the English language are ProgyOptiS, ProgTinyT, and friends..
        They can be seen here in a screen size war:
