        Ivory Tower

        Normally used as a picture of secludedness and absence of communication, as in "academics doing their own thing in their ivory tower".

        I don't have an <a href="IvoryTower.html">IvoryTower</a>. I just have a <em>sanctum sanctorum</em> from which I dispense good code (and posts).

        <em>African or Asian Elephants?</em>

        I always thought that an ivory tower would be a normal tower covered in ivory panelling, rather than a tower made entirely of ivory.
