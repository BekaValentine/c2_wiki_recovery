        Wiki Passionate Flair Up History
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are often periods of "flairups" on wiki driven by one or more individuals who are passionate about a given topic, often pushing <a href="OneTrueWay.html">OneTrueWay</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a rough drafty time-line to get started:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           2003 - <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> ?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           2005 - <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           2006 - <a href="InvasionOfTheRelationalWeenies.html">InvasionOfTheRelationalWeenies</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           2008 April - Normalization, Form, and <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <em>Gee, the word </em>'flair<strong> is </strong>very<strong> inflammatory. Please delete this page, Top, it is almost as bad as </strong><a href="BrainDamage.html">BrainDamage</a>. But I see you wrapped it in some nice olives and cherries to make it an ExtraLongVerboseTitle<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't feel it was inflammatory, but let's propose some alternatives to see if we can find a consensus:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Surge... ?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I am mocking you - and sarcastically pointing out your over sensitivity to any page that I create. Drop it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        MY oversensitivity? I have an urge to say something, but I shall drop it.
      </p>

      <p>
        Shouldn't it be flare and not "flair", unless you are discussing the number of pins with witty sayings we are wearing on the colorful shirts the restaurant management provides for us?.....
