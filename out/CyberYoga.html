        <em>Uh, first? What about Dos, Vim, EMACS, Unix, C++, Java, VB </em><a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, XP ... we are all acolytes of one kind or another here. Nothing new under the sun.<em></em>

        Not to mention, Kibology nor the Usenet Oracle. You might even neglect to mention <a href="TheChurchOfTheSubGenius.html">TheChurchOfTheSubGenius</a>, since that came before computers took hold. Or forget about Discordianism. You might really choose to totally ignore <a href="HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy.html">HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy</a>. And we all never heard about <a href="MurphysLaw.html">MurphysLaw</a>. (Honestly, I certainly had never heard of the Religion of CHI until today.. honestly, all jokes aside)

        WhatIsLogologie
      </p>
      <p>
        Logologie is a religion of reason. It is free of devilization and has many things common with Buddhism. Its main subjects include the entire
        abandonation of brutality and of senseless brain destruction. Its main goal ist the preservation and development of this mankind by teaching
        sovereignous- holistical thinking. 
        (See <a href="http://www.informatik.fh-hamburg.de/~windle_c/Logologie/e_index.html">http://www.informatik.fh-hamburg.de/~windle_c/Logologie/e_index.html</a> for more.)
