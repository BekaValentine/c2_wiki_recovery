        While thinking about how Wikis can be made to be aware (have information about) the content and navigational properties of one of its pages, I came upon a scheme whereby the <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> can be made to account for characteristics, which either by default configuration, and/or special configuration will cause certain operations, modifications and storage and retrieval events to occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is accomplished by either including code in the <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> to do so, or delegation via an ExternalArtifactory (process) to carry it out. 
      </p>
      <p>
        While working with several of my special projects dealing with <a href="PersonalInformationManagement.html">PersonalInformationManagement</a>, I found certain things about the pages included in the process which were derived during and because of (every time) its discovery process. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought, why do the same processes of discovery over and over, when more times than not, there have been no change in the discoveries found this time than existed last time. Why not create <a href="ArtifactComprehension.html">ArtifactComprehension</a>? The time saved in the process and loading of a page and information about associated pages and links in an Information Space consisting in thousands and tens of thousands of pages, will become more significant because discovery can be done OnceOnly during the first loading of the a version of the page, or when newly encountered internal linkages, or external links require a new comprehension to be made. 
      </p>
      <p>
        How this may be accomplished and the clever programming necessary to accomplish this need not be made here. (<em>I am in the process of structuring and processing using a process I call Artifactories, executed when special flags, messages or markers are raised in the loading of the markup text during the Artifactory _ </em>CreatePageFromMarkup.<em>)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This scheme is surely plausible in other existing or planned WikiSchemas. Is something like it be already in use in a Wiki of which you are aware?
