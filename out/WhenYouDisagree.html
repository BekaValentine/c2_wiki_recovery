        When You Disagree
      </h1>
      <p>
        In a mind set which includes placing value on the opinions and stances of others, <a href="WhenYouDisagree.html">WhenYouDisagree</a>, consider why. Unless you consider yourself to be infallible, it could be that you may be disagreeing from the wrong platform. Some beliefs, even those strongly held, may require the challenge of disagreeable options, perhaps the greatest of which is to change ones mind. The rational mind considers things from a lesser emotional stance than one which is unyielding and which stubbornly holds to a position of no change. On the other hand, you just may hold an opinion which is strongly based in rational truths and the disagreement is one which leads you to convincing the other in the error of their way.  In either case, the disagreement might be a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> in that it leads to correct thinking.
