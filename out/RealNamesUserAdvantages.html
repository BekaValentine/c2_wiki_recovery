        The Original page came from <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a>, a wiki respected by most <a href="RegularContributors.html">RegularContributors</a> of most <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a>. The wiki term <a href="BarnRaising.html">BarnRaising</a> need careful thoughts and backed up by actions, if <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is going to be anything more than a CoffeeShopWiki.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> <strong>was</strong> much more than a coffee shop.<em> When I joined here, there were lots of good material, but lots of out-dated material. I have seldom seen </em><a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> based collaboration, and lots of <a href="NarcissismOfSmallDifferences.html">NarcissismOfSmallDifferences</a>. <a href="DeclineOfCivility.html">DeclineOfCivility</a> accompanied by decline in the use of <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>s. And I am convinced <a href="RealNamesUserAdvantages.html">RealNamesUserAdvantages</a> is much underrated.

           But <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> can still be useful for <a href="ApplicationDevelopment.html">ApplicationDevelopment</a> (amongst other serious purposes), if people in their field of expertise go and review / update technical pages that have TemporalContext. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Taken from their CategoryRealNames page:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em></em>'No single issue in <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>'s history has received as much attention as <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>s<em></em>'

      </ul>
      <p>
        The following points taken from the <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> page of the same name, should allay most concerns regarding RealNamesUserDisadvantages, with annotations added.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Trust - Other people need to exercise <a href="TrustButVerify.html">TrustButVerify</a>, and decide how best to collaborate with you.
        </li>
        <li>
           History of cooperation - leads to Reputation. And encourages <a href="PlayNiceBehavior.html">PlayNiceBehavior</a>.

           Copyright - See <a href="ChangingSignedContributions.html">ChangingSignedContributions</a>

        <em>I think it is important to note that Ward's preference for </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> has always been for contributors to NOT sign their work. When a contribution is signed, it implies that the author does NOT want that contribution "refactored", edited for content, or similarly changed. The drift towards signed contributions is therefore, in my opinion, an important factor in the growth of <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> exchanges -- it is nearly impossible to refactor or gnome a page filled with signed contributions. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>
