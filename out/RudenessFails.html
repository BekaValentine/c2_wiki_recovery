        Rudeness Fails
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>[This is a heated debate about the uses of rudeness. The heat was started by the words 'general' and 'simply' in one sentence. You may check the links at the bottom for more balanced accounts.]</em>

        In general, <strong>rudeness simply doesn't work. It does not "fix" people.</strong> I've seen rudeness make the problem worse far more often than helping the situation. I don't have any <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> to show this, but my observation and various books I've read on the subject have born this out. (I'm still rude sometimes, but I accept it merely as a personal catharsis, not a solution to the problem itself.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who want to make a case that it does work are welcome to present it. Sometimes it will work once or twice, but it's a weapon that loses its strength on each usage. <strong>Used sparingly</strong> and with proper timing, it can help; but it's not something to rely on as your primary persuasion tool and has longer-term consequences. (There perhaps are individuals who enjoy abuse overall, but they are the exception.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The art of persuasion is difficult, especially for us techie types who are often under-socialized by choice or nature. But if you really want to persuade people and change their behavior or outlook[1], you have to do it the careful, patient, and smart way. There's no shortcuts. I'm just the messenger.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, rudeness is overused on the web such that if it had any impact if used sparingly, it's rendered moot by the excess one finds on the web. Wolf has been called repeatedly.
      </p>

        <em>[Please note that to have top create such an argument boggles the minds of those who understand the concepts of "irony" and "hypocrisy." Apparently topper does not. Sorry, man, but that's how it is, eh?]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe you missed the statement above: "I'm still rude sometimes, but I accept it merely as a personal catharsis, not a solution to the problem itself." The topic is in response to the suggestion that rudeness fixes people and thus it's justified as a common teaching technique. Yes, I am rude sometimes, but do not claim or expect it to change other people's behavior or mind. Thus, there's no irony.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I've rarely seen rudeness applied as a 'persuasion' tactic. Complaining about rudeness on the basis that it doesn't work as a persuasion tactic strikes me as similar to complaining about bricks on the basis they can't fly under their own power.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If you are saying that there are many reasons to be blunt, then I agree. This topic mostly addresses the case where rudeness is used as some form of persuasion or behavioral "fix" incentive.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anyhow, this whole 'art of persuasion' issue always bumps into ethical dilemmas. Lies, sophistry, and fallacy often do "work" as persuasive tactics, especially when expressed with passion, or when convincing oneself (humans are far too prone towards confirmation bias). Should one measure the quality of an argument by how persuasive it is (how well it "works"), rather than by how reasonable it is?
      </p>
      <p>
        If one refuses to accept that the ends justify the means in persuasion, then one also might refuse to fight fallacy with the sort of fallacy or illogic that the opposition might grok. This can lead to much frustration, which is often expressed via rudeness. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In many cases, being "right" in a vacuum is of little use, especially if collaboration is required to implement an idea. (Those who are so certain they are right are often not right, but that's another topic. Certaintude for situations with many variables is a smell.) If you are sufficiently satisfied with merely "being right", then there's little use of communicating such on this wiki anyhow, or at least debating.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Being 'right' and being 'reasonable' (in the sense of 'reasoning') are two very different things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Almost everyone thinks they are reasonable.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed. Many people are <a href="UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt.html">UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt</a> when it comes to 'reasoning'. Many people don't even recognize 'reasoning' as a skill or something that can be performed incorrectly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reasoning is a skill; one <em>learns</em> to be reasonable the same way one <em>learns</em> any other math, and the foundations for this skill are traditionally taught as part of Geometry, advanced Philosophy courses, discrete mathematics, diagnostics, and many other courses. According to my dictionary, being reasonable means being agreeable with 'sound' judgement, logical, not exceeding the limits of reason - which implies that one can <em>justify</em> inferences without unsound or illogical steps. It has been my observation (as an assistant to an undergrad course in discrete mathematics) that many people have troubles grasping 'reasoning' - even among those aiming to become programmers and engineers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The widespread incompetence in reasoning isn't too bad for day-to-day stuff - those not skilled at reasoning may be quite skilled at reaching correct and verifiable answers by other means (intuition, search, pattern matching, <a href="ExploratoryProgramming.html">ExploratoryProgramming</a>, etc.). Reasoning is sometimes overrated in practice; it's really important for <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> (especially when attempting to improve cross-cutting properties of existing systems), but <a href="AgileMethodologies.html">AgileMethodologies</a> don't rely upon it. However, this incompetence really hurts when it comes to technical discussions. People can't 'reasonably' argue from intuitions - that would be a contradiction in terms.
      </p>
      <p>
        Merely 'thinking' you are reasonable is intuition. Intuition does serve as a good <em>first</em> filter <em>if</em> one has experience in the domain, but any person competent in reasoning knows that the trick is to <em>reconstruct</em>, <em>justify</em>, and (where possible) <em>verify</em> one's inferences, habitually. Reasonable people <em>know</em> they are reasonable, because they can justify it. Reasonable people also <em>know</em> they could be wrong, because they can justify that, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The tricky part is when we encounter topics with </em><a href="TooManyVariablesForScience.html">TooManyVariablesForScience</a>. It would be nice if we could simply apply math, formal logic, and direct scientific experiments to all debates, but because of the variable quantity and funding problem, we can't, or don't know how yet. We have to make assessments based on lots of information, but also with lots of incomplete information.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I usually cut people some slack when dealing wish such issues. I may not agree, but I will </em>'respect their opinion<em>' if they made a good effort to justify their opinion and counter mine. I don't see that from the other party. They are filled with certaintude about their opinions on variable-heavy topics and accuse the other side of committing formal or objective fallacies. Certaintude in the face of many variables is just plain smelly. - t</em>

        Tags like '<a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>' also "work" to at least caution others in the potential audience, even if they strike the immediate recipient as rude.

Anyhow, you present a <a href="FalseDichotomy.html">FalseDichotomy</a>: appeasing the stubborn incompetent in order to avoid potential 'retaliation' versus 'accepting war' in order to place education, reasoning, culture, <em>civilized behavior</em> above the complaints of the stubborn incompetent, the sophists, the vociferous ignorami.

               It harms this wiki in general. It makes it appear as if it's full of rude arrogant know-it-all fan-boys, which are too common on the web already. We have to learn to not only control our emotions, but also learn to not rationalize the negative emotions by wrapping them in legitimate-sounding justifications. Warn readers via the actual facts, not your <strong>personal summary conclusions</strong>. <strong>Warning doesn't scale</strong>. If all parties engage in it often, it creates a wasteful mess. Everybody thinks themselves are "right".

               You define rudeness as "acting like a practitioner". But this wiki is not meant for only academics. Practitioners are needed to keep academics honest, to <a href="RaceTheDamnedCar.html">RaceTheDamnedCar</a>. Like most other insults, you stretch the meaning of it far beyond normal English to conveniently place my style into its camp. I <em>could</em> redefine certain annoying behaviors of yours to also be "rudeness", but it would only dilute the term. Further, even if true, two wrongs don't make a right. Me committing sin A does not give you license to commit sin B. I generally only perform "traditional" rudeness out of retaliation or as a personal catharsis, and do so sparingly. I'm pretty sure that if you marked up "traditional" rudeness with two colors for each side, my debate partners' rudeness would clearly exceed mine.

You are erroneously <strong>re-projecting a philosophical difference into "rudeness"</strong> for some reason, perhaps as a red herring to distract from your frequent name-calling sin. A philosophical difference is NOT rudeness. And whether I am guilty of not RacingTheDamnedCar is a separate issue which I will not address here. (Hmmm, how does one race <a href="TypesAreSideFlags.html">TypesAreSideFlags</a>?) And my arguments ARE reasonable. You just ignore them because they are not your pet technologies. You are blinded by the pursuit of your overly-complicated God Language because you dig them as a hobby.

               [Sadly, your arguments are <em>largely</em> not reasonable. Sometimes (like <a href="TypesAreSideFlags.html">TypesAreSideFlags</a>) they are almost comical. Your reluctance to educate yourself means -- to use an analogy I've used before -- you either wind up arguing the merits of wooden pistons, or deprecating forged aluminium pistons, to racing engineers. Unfortunately, just like arguing the merits of wooden pistons to racing engineers, the engineers' attempts to explain how ridiculous wooden pistons are in terms of centripetal and centrifugal forces, metallurgy, materials, gas pressures, and so forth, make no sense to you. When the engineers appeal to your layperson's background and point out that wooden pistons will break, swell and burn in seconds doesn't help, because you know so little about engineering that you're convinced the engineers are wrong. When the engineers suggest you try building an engine with wooden pistons, you claim to be busy with other projects, not an engineer, etc. And on it goes. It also doesn't help that you <em>start</em> the trouble by insulting the engineers' work. Phrases like "overcomplicated <x> because you dig them as a hobby" does nothing to help your case, and you've done <em>precisely</em> what you deprecate -- you've insulted someone because they prefer something else.]

               <a href="TypesAreSideFlags.html">TypesAreSideFlags</a> is not a good example because it's about definitions, not about tools being "objectively better". And the wood pistons could not compete in a race, they'd burn up or blow apart. Let the results do the insulting, not your mouth. Thus, the yapping before the race is a moot point. Further, <strong>until the race is done, each side should be respected</strong>, even Mr. Wood. Prove somebody wrong with results, not preliminary jabber.

               [What a page is about is irrelevant. Your argument (the substance of which was that "types are side flags") was characteristically unreasonable, as unreasonable and as based in ignorance (in the lack-of-knowledge sense) as advocating wooden pistons. It's nice you're aware they won't work -- thus saving us an unpleasant side-argument -- but that isn't relevant here. They're an analogy, not a point for discussion in and of itself. As for suggesting that "Mr. Wood" be respected until, presumably, a race is run with wooden pistons, that <em>is</em> ridiculous. Wooden pistons are recognisably ridiculous to anyone with knowledge of racing technology. Anyone who argues otherwise clearly knows nothing about racing technology. Unfortunately, some of your arguments are precisely analogous (<a href="TypesAreSideFlags.html">TypesAreSideFlags</a>, for example) -- they do nothing but highlight your lack of knowledge: Simply replace "racing technology" with "<a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>".

You have no more insider knowledge about MS than me, you have no thesis/theory on predictions of MS's behavior, yet you treated my assessment of MS's behavior as if you did, calling it "illogical".

If they are fallacious, then use something close to formal logic to deflate the arguments. Surely smart and reasonably-articulate academics could do that. Perhaps Mr. Woody may even expose some untested assumptions made by the academics. Why leave them untested? Thus, <strong>both parties may learn something even if one party is wrong.</strong> Good communication is like this.

                   If you want to debate him properly, then use your expert engineering knowledge to bash his arguments left and right. Create a model of wood under estimated stresses, for example. If he disagrees with the model, then ask which givens he disagrees with (such as assumed temperature of combustion chamber), and focus on that aspect using standard western reductionism (similar to <a href="StepwiseRefinement.html">StepwiseRefinement</a>) to isolate where the difference are. If's he's truly a crackpot, you should corner him pretty quick. If he has good counter answers for all the stuff you throw at him, then perhaps he deserves a listen. I've been in debates like that both where I win and I lose. But 80% it comes down to <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> unfortunately. For example, someone claimed I'd have to change code in every module in a book/media library example to add new "media types" using P/R. In the end it turned into <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> over "types". Somehow they weren't "types" if tracked via tables instead of formal language types in his view.

However, we are planning for the future, and the industry has to decide whether to continue to try to put all effort into HTML++ or also put some into other approaches in case HTML++ can't bend sufficiently. Neither side has a certified peer-reviewed formula that says their path is right. You cannot prove with hard logic that HTML++ will sufficiently bend. Thus, don't demand hard logic from me. I propose a hedge whereby two very different paths are taken (extending versus starting from scratch) rather than put all eggs in the HTML++ basket. I believe I made a reasonable argument.

           {You have not made a convincing case that there <em>is</em> a "Microsoft issue", <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. Sure, you can make a decent argument that Microsoft will attempt sabotage, but you have not made a case that Microsoft can <strong>succeed</strong> at sabotage in such a way that (to be relevant to the argument) leaves GML - as it will stand at the time of sabotage - at a significant advantage, nor have you convincingly argued that GML is significantly less vulnerable than HTML++ to the sabotage (indeed, the majority of 'sabotage' plans you list in <a href="LimitsOfHtmlStack.html">LimitsOfHtmlStack</a> aren't even specific to HTML++). There is a step missing in your argument as a whole: you provide no strong causal relationship between the probability of Microsoft attempting sabotage on HTML++ and the relative value of <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a>. In that sense, the whole sub-argument is <em>no better</em> than my above explanation that the blue default background color is for security, in which I provide no strong causal relationship between default background colors and security... which, not coincidentally, is why I raised the above analogy.}

           I've given plenty of evidence that MS may succeed in sabotaging HTML++. I cannot read your mind so I cannot evaluate the thought process (or lack of) in your head that makes you say otherwise. <strong>You are like a vending machine without prices: I keep feeding it loads of quarters and it gives me no feedback other than "insufficient money given"</strong>. I can't tell whether it's broken or irrationally greedy. MS has clearly been selfish and sneaky in the past and you've offered no reason to suggest that they'll just stop.

               {Arguments, points, and evidence are not like coins in a vending machine. Add two quarters to a vending machine, and you're another step closer to buying an unwholesome meal. Add the same points twice to an argument, and you're no closer for doing it the second time. Example: repeatedly saying that Microsoft has a history of sneakiness is <strong>not</strong> cashing in each time as an additional contribution to your argument, since I have already accepted that Microsoft will 'attempt' to undermine competitors, including HTML++.}

           Further, keep in mind that the probability of any one hurdle does not have to be high for HTML++ to fail. Even if there's a 75% chance that MS won't be able/willing to sabotage HTML++ and a 75% chance that vender and version differences won't significantly hinder the utility and maturity of HTML++ and a 75% chance <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> can handle the task of acting like a <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> language, if you multiply those all together you get about a 40% chance of one or more of them happening, sticking us with a shoddy tool. 40% is plenty enough to trigger looking into a hedge.

           {"HTML++ and the relative value of <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a>" is, of course, the value of GML "relative" to the value of HTML++. And the only described hurdle that is <em>relevant</em> in context of your assertion that there is a "Microsoft issue" is "Microsoft attempting sabotage". Pointing at other hurdles is <em>not</em> relevant, <em>not</em> a cogent defense that there is a "Microsoft issue", and therefore must be rejected. If you want to buy one "Microsoft Issue" from my vending machine, you need to use the <em>correct</em> coins. It is my impression that you lose track of the sub-argument very easily, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. Did you not, above, demand we focus on the Microsoft issue?}

        <li>
           I'm pointing out that I agree that MS may fail at an attempt to sabotage any given standard or competitor, but that certainty is not necessary to reach the level to trigger a hedge. Your wording <strong>implies</strong> that I need to show with near certainty that MS would succeed in sabotage. I wanted to make sure that near certainty is not a requirement. The context does matter when it comes to the full model of failure. It is a contributor to the failure chain and it's position in that failure chain affects the impact amount it needs to assert to affect the outcome.

           Again again, current OSS attempts <strong>keep making the same mistake: "extend/bend things originally meant for e-brocures</strong> to be desktop-like and/or CRUD-friendly", and the result keeps failing. I am not claiming I have a sure-shot fix. I'm just pointing out the reasons for the repeated failure and suggesting that a complete change in strategy is worth a college try. We cannot build the future by finding the magic formula. It takes trial, error, failure, and also failure analysis.

        <strong>Scope of Illogic</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe there's a misunderstanding about "illogical". Are you saying that my argument itself is "illogical" because I won't consider your favorite technologies (YFT), or are you saying that I as a person am illogical for not considering YFT? The first one makes no sense. I was comparing GML to HTML++, not to YFT. Failing to compare to a third option (YFT) is not a fallacy in the debate text itself, for I never set out to compare it to YFT (other than side comments, which was a social mistake). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Neglecting to compare to YFT may arguably be a "decision error" on my part as a human being, but that's a different animal. I made no clearly-identified logical pivotal fallacies in my comparison between GML to HTML++. Whether I personally am illogical for not considering YFT, I won't even consider that at this point, other than ask why your prerequisite-heavy <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> should get a hearing before some other prerequisite-heavy <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>. But I do request that you be clear about whether my statements are "illogical" or me as a person. Or is the vagueness part of an intimidation tactic? - t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I say your argument is "illogical" because you fail to reasonably justify that your designs achieve your goals. Your attempt to develop from a vacuum, neglecting alternative technologies and the concerns addressed by them, is perhaps "unwise", but not by itself "illogical".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are specific about where evidence lacks, I'll be happy to flesh it out. The problem is that you are either rarely specific enough or find some way to tie it to some favored complex tool that has little to do with GUI's. I'm trying to remove issues that tie into your favored tool kit to see if I can tease out specific examples of allegedly poor reasoning to understand what makes you so eager to claim it all heavily flawed. I'm not seeing something that you are (or think you are).
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, what is a specific example of flawed reasoning assuming we are <em>only</em> comparing GML to HMTL++? If none of the world's IT problems can be solved "logically" without using your fav thingamabob, then let me know now so that I can end my attempt to figure you out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My primary argument on GML has always been the same: your answer to </em>"why?"<em> is unsatisfactory. "Illogical" refers to specific sub-arguments, none of which are especially focused on GML (the word only appears twice in that page). </em><a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> refers also to specific arguments - i.e. your attempts to argue 'security' benefits that are unrelated to security, your prophecies that Microsoft will somehow break HTML++ even worse than where GML is <em>starting</em>, your dubious anti-fanboyism marketing tactics, plus some meta-level argument about argument. Every time you start trying to answer <em>"why?"</em>, sound and valid 'reasoning' gets left behind. The broad differences between GML and HTML (e.g. the four-column approach) are left unjustified.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Even your one reasonable sub-argument that GML is more </em><a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly on the basis of having a few extra widgets is unsatisfactory, since that saves me perhaps 20% of the ugliness associated with a <em>typical</em> <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>: I'll still need scripts to validate inputs; I'll still have server-side and app-developer ugliness to bind inputs to the correct server side operations; I'll still need to support accessibility (multi-lingual, blindness, text search), still need to support hints and auto-complete, still need to support 'undo', still need confirmations and conflict resolutions, still need to support progress bars, alerts, and other forms of real-time updates; still need to support persistence or session recovery and mobility. I have no reason to believe GML is <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly in any but the shallowest of senses. I am left wondering why you don't just tweak HTML to add a few widgets and call it a 'new standard' (goodness knows we have enough standards) - that, at least, would have easy implementation since you could easily use <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> or <a href="GoogleChrome.html">GoogleChrome</a> as a starting point for the client, and many existing tools could adapt readily to use the new standard.<em></em>
