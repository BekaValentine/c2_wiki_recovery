        Terry Winograd is the author of the <a href="ShrdluProgram.html">ShrdluProgram</a>, a classic <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> program which is sometimes known as "Blocks World".  The focus of this program was to be able to understand natural language in the context of a world of blocks.

        Terry later refuted the idea that the hard AI problem could be solve by the application of rules to a formal representation.  The resulting book <a href="UnderstandingComputersAndCognition.html">UnderstandingComputersAndCognition</a> explains his concerns.

        His focus today is on <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a> design, with a focus on the theoretical background and conceptual models.
