        Lazy Programmer
      </h1>
      <p>
        This idiom is related to the <a href="EinsteinPrinciple.html">EinsteinPrinciple</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be worded as "Do as little work as possible to get the task completed, but no less."
      </p>
      <p>
        So, complete the task by trying to write the minimum amount of code that satisfies the requirements and passes all the tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        That means not falling prey to the <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a> syndrome and instead embracing the work of others to lessen the amount of work you have to do. It also means embracing standards so that there is more potential to leverage others work.

        In a different vein, this can mean a programmer that practices <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a> and <a href="SomeoneElsesExample.html">SomeoneElsesExample</a> programming. The programmer does not take the time to understand the code, but simply forces pieces together with minimum effort. Anything more than cursory testing can be ruled out altogether.
