      <p>
        Here we discuss the relation between <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> (FP) and <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> (OO(P)). Is it possible to combine both? And why would one want to do that?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In the impure <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> and <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, it is possible to create your own object system. As I understand it, the <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a> was also the first in any language to receive an ANSI standard, even before <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> (!), and it has some interesting abilities not found in the object systems of other languages (e.g., <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a>).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There is a concept of "FunctionalObjects" (a.k.a. <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>s). Such an object, instead of changing state, returns a copy of itself with changed state. You see them quite often in "non-functional" people's programs, too...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It's been a few years since I've looked at <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> but it's very unlike <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. <em>Functional</em> means no <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s so that a function's behaviour is entirely determined by its arguments. The grand benefit is that if you test a function once then it will always work. The downside is that the entire state of the program must be passed on the stack to every function <em>[Wrong. Much of the program state is on, or accessible via, the stack, but not </em>passed<em> to every function.]</em>. <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s (<a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>?) hide this from the programmer somewhat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, you can pass the entire state, but then you are not really taking advantage of functional programming, because then the result of the function still depends on the complete state. Rather, you want the result of a function to depend only on a small set of explicit input parameters. Moreover, I think that limiting <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s is a good idea in any programming language - side effects are a very good rope to hang yourself with. The problem is that when you take a look at a language like <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>, that does non-strict evaluation, then if you have side effects (which you <em>can</em> have in most implementations, if you really feel like it), you will soon find out that the hang-yourself-with capacities of side-effects are greatly amplified.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It depends on how you characterize OO. One useful definition is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Abstract data types
        </li>
        <li>
           Polymorphism
        </li>
        <li>
           Inheritance/delegation
        </li>
        <li>
           Automated memory management
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words, identity and mutable state don't get a look in. This fits conventional OO languages like <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, but can also fit functional (and logical) languages too. I would argue that it captures the essence of OO, as compared with previous paradigms, better than stateful definitions. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Actually it fits everything but stone age Pascal, C, Fortran, Cobol and Algol.  This definition is about as useful as "There are only OO languages and macro assemblers."  I take this as more evidence that OO is no paradigm but merely a set of conventions.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The original definition of OO as far as I can remember it contained three elements:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Encapsulation
        </li>
        <li>
           Inheritance
        </li>
        <li>
           Polymorphism
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That's it, no more and no less. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Encapsulation" is a misunderstood word; some people say it implies information hiding and some it doesn't. Personally I like to keep the notions separate, but Encapsulation + Information Hiding = Abstract Data Types. So I doubt we disagree fundamentally here.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Inheritance" excludes delegation; I think this just expresses ignorance of how cool delegation is (reasonable in an old definition, but there's no need to perpetuate it). They are very tightly related, especially if you have direct language support (which most common languages don't).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Polymorphism" - no argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automated memory management is something I throw in to wind up the <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> crowd. (I'm sure I got it from an article in the early <a href="ByteMagazine.html">ByteMagazine</a> special edition, which will have predated C++.) So really we're pretty close.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I need object identity as a core concept. I need to have inheritance and polymorphism to construct frameworks. They can be mimicked with some sort of delegation, that's all right with me. But these three things I feel I must have. I haven't seen them yet in a </em><a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>, and have doubts it can be done. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree. My take on much of FP is that it is a way of eliminating identity. Face it, identity only matters when something changes. If a thing can't change then any other one that looks the same will do. I'm skeptical of FP for large-scale systems. I wonder about maintainability. OTOH, I find myself programming in a more ValueOrientedProgramming style recently. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I actually like delegation much more than implementation inheritance and wish that there was a popular non-interpreted language that supported it. You got me on <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>. I think that the ideal system would have garbage collection be <em>optional</em>. I think that you can do that if the references are more than just pointers, but that's a different discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, since you guys brought up identity and functional programming in the same breath: have you looked at the stuff I've been writing about <a href="ObjectFunctionalPatterns.html">ObjectFunctionalPatterns</a>? I suspect that object identity is a basic assumption of OO - not part of its definition, but only because nobody thought to question the assumption at all. Now that it's been questioned I think that it's undeniably part of OO. Of course with identity comes mutable state and with mutability comes the concept of time and ordering - all undoubtedly important to OO whether they are part of its definition or not. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Who said that object identity <em>wasn't</em> encompassed by FP?  It is, it's just that FP defines "identity" as "state."  A number object holding a hex 0x01 has the same identity as any other number object holding a hex 0x01, and a different identity from objects which don't hold numbers, or number objects holding, say, 0xFF or 0xDEADBEEF.  If it bugs you, think of it as every object using the <a href="InstanceFlyweightPattern.html">InstanceFlyweightPattern</a>, except the compiler can ignore that to give you more speed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>From what I understand, what they mean by object identity is pretty much that it isn't using the </em><a href="InstanceFlyweightPattern.html">InstanceFlyweightPattern</a>.  I.e. that there is more to its identity than its state.<em> </em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Everyone, take a look at <strong>O'Haskell</strong>. An object-oriented functional language based on <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>. Having seen mostly examples with imperative-style programming so far, which perhaps may not seem too worthwhile, I am not yet ready to pass judgment on this.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, taking over some things from the <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> world is cool regardless:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Two types of polymorphism.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Most <a href="ObjectOrientedLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedLanguage</a>s associate polymorphism with subtyping. Most FP languages make use of <a href="ParametricPolymorphism.html">ParametricPolymorphism</a>. (Sure, there are templates in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> for this but it is not really the same.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In an OO-FP language you (should) get both. This particular language also has some other basic foundations, such as built in concurrency. (All objects are active objects - running their own thread).
      </p>

      <p>
        My take: <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> is about minimizing state, and <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> is about managing it. You don't want to do stateful objects in a <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>-free language, but you can gain the <a href="AdvantagesOfFunctionalProgramming.html">AdvantagesOfFunctionalProgramming</a> in any language. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some languages make it easier than others, of course. For example, iterators always struck me as a needless multiplication of entities; I'd rather be mapping a function over the collection.

        How do you characterize OO? AFAICT, the characteristics all OO languages have in common are object identity, and InclusionalPolymorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>OO (Inclusional) Polymorphism</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most OO programmers probably think of polymorphism in the <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> sense, which is substituting a sub-type where a given type is expected. This is inclusional polymorphism (see also <a href="LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple.html">LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple</a>, this is something similar, if not the same thing). However, there are a number of types of polymorphism:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ParametricPolymorphism.html">ParametricPolymorphism</a>: a.k.a templates or generic types. Where we expect objects to be the same type, but we don't care what that type actually is (e.g., collections). This is a way to specify related types that is orthogonal to inheritance.
        </li>
        <li>
           Function-dispatch: calling the appropriate method given the type of the argument. Inheritance provides a means for defining type-relationships, which is a concise way of specifying to which types functions apply.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So-called "inclusional" polymorphism is merely a degenerate form of <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> that only allows polymorphism on the first parameter to a function. <a href="OperatorOverloading.html">OperatorOverloading</a> is the same as defining a method that takes the same number of arguments as the operator, so is also the same as multiple dispatch.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two above items both show that polymorphism is merely a way of defining types, and how functions apply to those types, so in fact we have only one kind of polymorphism.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> supports only inclusional polymorphism (through class inheritance and/or interfaces). <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> supports inclusional (single and multiple inheritance), parametric (templates), and <a href="AdHocPolymorphism.html">AdHocPolymorphism</a>. The interesting thing with C++ is the use of <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> to allow a given type to be a sub-type of many (possibly unrelated) types. Java uses interfaces, and Ruby uses <a href="MixIn.html">MixIn</a>s to the same end.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>OO Feature Check</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some (for example, see Booch's <em></em><a href="ObjectOrientedAnalysisAndDesign.html">ObjectOrientedAnalysisAndDesign</a><em>) will claim that an </em><a href="ComponentOrientedLanguage.html">ComponentOrientedLanguage</a> should have some or all of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Inheritance
        </li>
        <li>
           Inclusional polymorphism
        </li>
        <li>
           Delegation
        </li>
        <li>
           Encapsulation
        </li>
        <li>
           Modularity
        </li>
        <li>
           Abstract datatypes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (How is delegation a separate characteristic? Someone help me here because currently I simply see delegation as an consequence of inclusional polymorphism.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Inheritance is a </em><a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You only need it in languages such as <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a> because it is the only way to achieve sub-typing. EmeraldLanguage (<a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/dsg/emerald.html">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/dsg/emerald.html</a> <em>[</em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 2005-08-31]<em>- alt, see </em><a href="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~norm/emerald.html">http://www.cs.ubc.ca/~norm/emerald.html</a> (2007-01-23)) is an example of an <a href="ObjectOrientedLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedLanguage</a> which does not have any form of inheritance, yet I consider it to be OO because it supports inclusional polymorphism (and object identity). Emerald uses contra-variance to achieve sub-typing; see <a href="ContraVsCoVariance.html">ContraVsCoVariance</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've read claims that behavioural reuse (as opposed to interface reuse) through inheritance is just as important. However, you can achieve behavioural reuse through composition, so you really gain nothing. Composition also reduces dependency, which is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> (composition is advocated by the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book).
      </p>
      <p>
        Many languages support encapsulation, modularity, and abstract datatypes, yet they do not claim to be OO. Examples: <a href="MlLanguage.html">MlLanguage</a>, <a href="ModulaTwo.html">ModulaTwo</a>, (old, pre-OO) <a href="AdaLanguage.html">AdaLanguage</a>, Oracle's <a href="PlSql.html">PlSql</a> (The version bundled with the 7.3 RDBMS. Later versions of Oracle (8) have added objects/classes etc. AFAIK PL/SQL was inspired by Ada.) So I would say that these are not defining characteristics of OO languages, though clearly desirable (and apparently ubiquitous - can you name an OO language which does not support these concepts?).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> Feature Check<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some modern <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s also support these concepts, and also inclusional polymorphism. <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> looks like it supports inclusional polymorphism through type classes, but it doesn't (not yet, anyway. Type classes are exactly that: classes of types, i.e., they are not types. You could best think of them as constraints on types.) Haskell is also not OO because it has no notion of object identity.
      </p>
      <p>
        FP deals purely with data. You can think of a purely functional program as creating, copying, and passing around many immutable objects. (Because objects are immutable, everything can be passed by reference [<a href="PassByReference.html">PassByReference</a>]. All storage is allocated on the heap, so the stack is only used for passing pointers to heap objects.)
      </p>
      <p>
        FP languages also differ significantly in that they treat functions (and LexicalClosures) as <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> objects, so they can be passed to other functions like objects/data. FP is typified by <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s: functions that take functions as arguments and return functions. This can be achieved in OO languages (see <a href="BlocksInJava.html">BlocksInJava</a>) but it's somewhat cumbersome, and there is no static type checking (anyway, weren't these ideas were inspired-by/borrowed-from FP languages? - see <a href="FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign.html">FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign</a>). I am aware that <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> supports lexical closures, but again no static type checking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> can support the missing OO concepts (object identity and state) through Monads. Most (all) aspects of <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>-based programming can be modelled with Monads, while still retaining <a href="ReferentialTransparency.html">ReferentialTransparency</a>, which is one of the claimed <a href="AdvantagesOfFunctionalProgramming.html">AdvantagesOfFunctionalProgramming</a>. (See <a href="OnMonads.html">OnMonads</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Monads are not the only abstraction in functional programming, and they are not the most useful one. I wish this misconception would stop being parroted.</em>
