        There are KnowledgeTools we can use which fit: "YouCanLookItUpIfYouNeedIt" which is simply DocumentedKnowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can play an important part in the knowledge we need from time to time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Particularly useful for programmers are repositories such as APIs and other such ImplementationKnowledgeBases.
      </p>
      <p>
        This works only if
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There are well-known or easily constructed keys for the knownledge items. Examples are every-day words or combinations thereof.
          <ul>
            <li>
               WikiWords are a good example. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Problem is that sometimes there is no 'right' or obvious word for a topic.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           There are few possible mis-hits for the keys. Little ambiguity. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Means that if I search for a discussion I had on this wiki I often cannot find it because there are just too many discussions with overlapping topcs.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Therefore some indexing is needed. I could find my discussions if I'd categorized them.
        But then I need to find the proper index. I may know my own indexes. But not all of them, particularly on TheInternet.
