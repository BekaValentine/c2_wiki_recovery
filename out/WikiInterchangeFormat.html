      <p>
        <strong>Scheme employing XML</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An envisioned implementation method for existing <a href="WikiClones.html">WikiClones</a> would be to simply provide an alternate CGI access script (a <a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a> server script) which would convert a requested document from the clone's native format to <a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a> and deliver the document to the client. The client wiki or application could then use the structured <a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a> data directly, or convert to another desired format. An appropriate Xml <a href="WikiBrowser.html">WikiBrowser</a> might use the format directly (such a built-for-purpose browser could also provide desirable features such as wysiwyg editing). The <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a>'s traditional HTML delivery script would remain unaltered.
      </p>
      <p>
        An edit script might also be provided for accepting edited content in <a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a> and converting to the clone's native format.
      </p>
      <p>
        Issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A standard XML format (DTD?) would have to be agreed upon. An implementer might choose to add non-standard tags to his pages. He would do this with the understanding that the non-standard tags might be ignored or mis-interpreted by clients.
        </li>
        <li>
          It would be left to the client to determine how to handle non-standard tags. A good strategy is probably to render unrecognized tags as verbatim text.
        </li>
        <li>
          I think the markup for internal wiki links should include both the original text of the link (remember, the text may not fit the client's local link pattern), and an absolute URL to the actual wiki page referred to. It would be left to the client to determine what to do with this information (should the link be made local? Should the link text be mangled to local format?).
        </li>
        <li>
          As implied above, some imported links may need to be mangled to work with the local wiki. This is especially an issue if an edit script is provided.
        </li>
        <li>
          Many others...

        <strong>Seriously Complex</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This proposal and the examples seem seriously complex to me. Isn't there something profoundly simple, like wiki itself?  Take a look at the problem you are trying to solve: You don't like the syntax of A HREF and you want to replace it with something else.  Take a look at the proposed solution: You're trying to define an interchange format and a wiki name server. Perhaps it would be enough to use A HREF links to one central host with a page per wiki with the appropriate redirection (like home.pages.de or the like). The goal is to leverage URL namespace instead of devising YetAnotherNamespace.

        <strong>Forward and Reverse Compatibility</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't slap me for saying this, but XML - or anything like it - allows applications to be forwards, backwards and laterally compatible.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I mean by that is that if the <a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a> (WIF) changes, or that other Wiki implementors decide to extend the basic format with their own custom tags (like text colour or copyright notations), they can all still attempt to communicate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if WIF 2.0 is defined in the future, older Wikis won't be cut out of the picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're going to go and redesign the web (which is what you're doing), might as well do it so we don't have to do it again.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Example of a strategy</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        An example of where this strategy works really well is in our applications where I work. The object model I defined was designed from the get go to support XML and it turned out to be so wonderfully good that it allowed us to move the same save files back and forth between sibling applications. This is before I was introduced to <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [We don't actually use XML, but something like it.]
      </p>
      <p>
        It's may not even be necessary to define a DTD because you don't have to strictly parse the XML. Just anything where the set of attributes is flexible and you have a concept of parent-child relationships is sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something like
      </p>
      <code>
        <PARENT><br/>
        <PARENT-ATTRIBUTE-1>value</PARENT-ATTRIBUTE-1><br/>
        <PARENT-ATTRIBUTE-2>value</PARENT-ATTRIBUTE-2><br/>
        ...<br/>
        <PARENT-ATTRIBUTE-n>value</PARENT-ATTRIBUTE-n><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <CHILD><br/>
        <CHILD-ATTRIBUTE-1>value</CHILD-ATTRIBUTE-1><br/>
        <CHILD-ATTRIBUTE-2>value</CHILD-ATTRIBUTE-2><br/>
        ...<br/>
        <CHILD-ATTRIBUTE-n>value</CHILD-ATTRIBUTE-n><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <GRANDCHILD><br/>
        ...<br/>
        </GRANDCHILD><br/>
        </CHILD><br/>
        <CHILD><br/>
        ...<br/>
        </CHILD><br/>
        ...<br/>
        </PARENT><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        can be easily dynamically interpreted from context. A DTD is necessary only if you want to impose more complex forms like value constraints.

        <strong>Problems of Translation of more complex methodologies to simple generic methods</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The point here is that many people author their own Wikis because they want to innovate (and usually in the direction of greater complexity). I'm not sure that all the possible innovations can be fitted into the plain Wiki syntax without getting ambiguous parsing. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not necessary to restrict ourselves to a single format. Plain HTML (ie what the human reads), and plain Wiki (ie what the human edits) could be made available alongside XML. (Whether this is a step towards simplicity or away from it is another matter. I suspect it is the <a href="SmallestShield.html">SmallestShield</a>.) -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

      <p>
        <strong>Forward Tolerant Standard</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the tricks of designing a forwards-tolerant standard is to define it so that any version can at least read and parse the content (simple SGML or XML will provide this), and find the boundaries of things. Then when a version finds a 'thing' it doesn't understand, it becomes a local matter how that version handles this 'thing', that it found. In a wiki case, it might just put it up as plain text. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of wiki, the important item to be parsable is the link. Wikis have different rules for allowed characters in the link name, so the mechanism must allow some of that (e.g. this wiki might convert spaces to underlines, or some other character for the hyperlink to be rendered).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Handling Unknowns</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A better way to handle unknown XML tags would be to embed them in such a way that if the page is rerendered as XML the unknown data is not lost.  This could be a special embedding syntax or something structured on top of a generic comment syntax (like the way Java Script is embedded).
      </p>
      <p>
        My vote would be wikis in the original style to agree on the form
      </p>
      <code>
        [<a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>: ... ]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        as a generic extension syntax and for
      </p>
      <code>
        [<a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a>:<SOMETAG>]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>

        <strong>Using Regular Expressions</strong>

      <p>
        Why don't you just embed the <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a> <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> in the XML? That way other non-similar Wikis can use that to figure out where to put the links without breaking anything. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

      <p>
        I'd rather not force all Wiki's to be written in Perl, or to have to support Perl's regular expression syntax. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted that Regular Expression syntax is not exclusive to Perl and that it's use is fairly standardized in various Language implementations.

        <strong>Publish an Interface?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the idea that Wikis publish an interface where you can always get the following pieces of information:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           raw format for the page (i.e. what user would see in editor)
        </li>
        <li>
           plain text list of linkable words for a page
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any Wiki engine (or any piece of software, for that matter) that wants to host a page from an "open" Wiki would render the pages with almost no formatting except for links.  Of course, if you are writing a Wiki engine, and you notice that your users tend to view a lot of pages from certain other Wikis, you can add formatting libraries to your engine that work with the format from the other Wikis.  You might even only support a subset of features, such as bold and italics, and leave the rest of the page unrendered. See <a href="StorageLinkingPresentation.html">StorageLinkingPresentation</a> too. -- <a href="SteveHowell.html">SteveHowell</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        +1 for that. Getting access to the raw pages would make writing <a href="WikiMode.html">WikiMode</a> much easier (for emacs/w3) as I wouldn't have to strip out the html around the textarea, or unescape chars encoded in the html. -- <a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>

        <strong>Why Not just use HTML or a subset</strong>
        My XML knowledge is not that deep - but could we not just take same form of HTML (XHTML, whatever) as a <a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a>? I mean basically we just have br, h1 ... h6, lists, bold and italics, maybe tables and links. I think if a server put out a page just using this subset of xhtml, it should be possible to build the WikiMarkUp, once the page is retrieved. And if the html were nicely made, even the xml people should be smiling. Maybe one has to place some extra info in the anchors, like page="<a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>" or page="external".

        <strong>Low Tech Solutions or Necessary Complexity</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Running the fledgling Perl Patterns Repository at <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net,">http://wiki.slowass.net,</a> it is very frequently in my interest to link here. I've played with three low tech solutions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           URLs that get expanded in-line. Abuse issues but cool effect.
        </li>
        <li>
           Links of the form: C2 <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> get turned into links to that word here.
        </li>
        <li>
           Recognizing words defined here but not there from the .cgi here that dumps the catalog index.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Planning for the future can take the form of saving pennies, or futile fretting over an upcoming interview. Categorization is left to the reader. However, jumping wholesale on one solution without playing with it first is avoiding experimentation and therefore avoiding feedback from the system: 
        <a href="http://wiki.slowass.net/?PlanningIsNpComplete">http://wiki.slowass.net/?PlanningIsNpComplete</a> - a complex solution *might* be required, but *only* if it is NecessaryComplexity. Excessive complexity will do as much damage as over simplicity of the protocol. Having a vested interest in this, I argue for a simple but rich protocol: providing a standard suite of .cgi programs takes advantage of the HTTP API and uses the rich namespace conventions of the URL scheme. New .cgi programs can always be added that offer more power at the cost of more complexity, and people can support the HTTP based API piecemeal. A simple, initial API could take the form of merely listing, one per line, as HTML links, each word defined on the site. Programatic fetching for pages and doing more complex processing would always be an option for doing more intensive investigation of another Wiki in addition to other machine-specific interfaces. I hope people working on this problem can benefit from the work I've done on the subject. Feel free to contact me. -- <a href="ScottWalters.html">ScottWalters</a>

        It seems to me that the <a href="WikiCreole.html">WikiCreole</a> effort will accomplish many of the goals stated above, but without the XML baggage, and, hopefully, with more attention
        to preserving <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. -- <a href="RaphLevien.html">RaphLevien</a>
