        All Some Folks Know
      </h1>
      <p>
        If all you have is a hammer then everything tends to look like a nail [<a href="AllProblemsLookLikeNails.html">AllProblemsLookLikeNails</a>].  For example, <a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        When interviewing programming candidates with self-said "experience", ask them to cut some code in any text editor. Just a simple task, like sort this array, or parse an arbitrary sentence for, say, tokens that end in "d".  
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that all of what many folks know ain't much.  But <a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a> is here to stay and you are permitted to give thanks for pre-dating it.  You may be able to parlay the knowledge of creating code into income well into your old age if you need to.
