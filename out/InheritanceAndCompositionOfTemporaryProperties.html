        Inheritance And Composition Of Temporary Properties
      </h1>
      <p>
        One concept which I have given some thought to, but which I've never seen addressed in any existing language which I know of, is the possibility of an object <em>temporarily</em> belonging to a category. <em></em><a href="PredicateTypes.html">PredicateTypes</a>, maybe?<em> To give a real world example, a person may join the Army, and for the duration of their enlistment be classified as a soldier; but before enlistment, and after mustering out, they would no longer be a soldier. To further break it down, a soldier can be an enlistee, an NCO, or an commissioned officer (USAian terms, as I know them; insert the correct terminology for different nations), and may have a given rank within those categories. Both rank and category may change over their time in the military; yet when they are no longer in the military, they would no longer have those qualities at all (though career officers often keep their rank after retiring). </em>

        Now, the conventional approach would be to create a class Person, and a subclass Soldier, instantiate the individual as a Soldier, and then upcast them back to Person afterwards, ignoring the 'extra' attributes. This doesn't seem quite satisfactory, however; It treats the soldier as a different type of person from a 'default' civilian, rather than as a Person who has temporarily gained, lost or changed certain attributes. Nonetheless, it is clearly a case where a category, with common properties and inheritance of type, is involved.

        I have never seen this sort of temporary categorization (which I've termed a 'role') addressed in either patterns or language constructs, yet it seems to be an obvious issue. Does anyone know what work, if any, has been done on this topic?

        A parallel issue exists in composition, where an object may have a component which is added on after it's creation, even if it might not have been designed for it; consider the various modifications possible to automobiles, many of which are unique and could not have been anticipated by the original designers. Unlike roles, these 'customizations' are specific to a given object, and do not represent a category with shared attributes. While a permanent customization can be easily deal with (especially in a prototype based language, as you can simply change the single object alone), the case of a temporary customization presents the same issues as mentioned above with roles. Again, I was curious as to what work, if any, has been done to deal with this issue.

        <em>Something like </em><a href="StatePattern.html">StatePattern</a> might be the ticket.<em></em>

        DynamicInheritance, a la <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a>, is also a way of achieving this.  <a href="PredicateClasses.html">PredicateClasses</a> (in <a href="CecilLanguage.html">CecilLanguage</a>) is something similar, if you can formalize the constraints for switching "roles" fully.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>
