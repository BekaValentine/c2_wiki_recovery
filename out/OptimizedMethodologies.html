        Optimized Methodologies
      </h1>
      <p>
        Optimized Methodologies fit the situation so well that you dare not change them for fear of being worse off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimal policies are always a small part of the possible options. Mathematically, they are of measure zero and so unlikely to occur by chance. Like being on the tip of a mountain peak in earthquake country, change often leads to a big drop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimality also requires one single, well defined objective, value, or measure of quality.

        Contrast with <a href="AdaptableMethodologies.html">AdaptableMethodologies</a> and <a href="AdaptiveMethodologies.html">AdaptiveMethodologies</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pejorative use of Optimized and its contrast with Adaptive is found in publications by <a href="JimHighsmith.html">JimHighsmith</a>.
