        Automatic Delegation For Java
      </h1>
      <p>
        It would be very helpful if Java had a syntax to explicitly specify delegation, something in the lines of:
      </p>
      <code>
        public class SomeClass extends SomeSuperClass, delegates Interface in interfaceImp{<br/>
        InterfaceImp interfaceImp;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        or 
      </p>
      <code>
        public class SomeClass extends SomeSuperClass, implements Interface {<br/>
        delegate Interface to InterfaceImp interfaceImp;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        This has been implemented as a native Java API, though it's still in a proof-of-concept phase. It's called Delegator and can be found on
        <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/delegator/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/delegator/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've currently (begin 2005) started development again as a masters thesis so more should be available in the coming months.

        If you use a good IDE like <a href="IntellijIdea.html">IntellijIdea</a>, it will take a lot of the burden off your shoulders. For instance, IDEA has a feature called Delegate Methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But, as much as I love </em><a href="IntellijIdea.html">IntellijIdea</a>, it would be useful not to clutter the source code with the delegation functions<em></em>

        Shouldn't this be required too?
      </p>
      <code>
        public class SomeClass extends SomeSuperClass, implements Interface {<br/>
        delegate Interface to InterfaceImp interfaceImp;<br/>
        public SomeClass() { interfaceImp = new InterfaceImp(); }<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        because I understand that the <em>delegate</em> keyword is meant to be a short hand for
      </p>
      <code>
        public class SomeClass extends SomeSuperClass, implements Interface {<br/>
        private InterfaceImp interfaceImp;<br/>
        public SomeClass() { interfaceImp = new InterfaceImp(); }<br/>
        public ReturnType interfaceMethod1(Object param1) { return interfaceImp.interfaceMethod1(param1); }<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So the interfaceImp has to be instantiated first.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose the case for method clash can be resolved as multiple inheritance in C++, i.e. clashed methods have to be explicitly declared.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note that Java doesn't provide a way to resolve collisions between methods from different interfaces.  I find this disturbing.  If methods have the same name they get the same implementation, no matter what context (interface) they are declared in.</em>

        Many years ago I thought this was a good idea.  Since then I find myself rarely delegating behavior.  I'm not exactly sure why.  Perhaps it's a side effect of more refactoring. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        I'm a big fan of delegation, and concepts like <a href="DelegationInheritance.html">DelegationInheritance</a>; which is why AutomaticDelegation is one of the ideas I'd like to have implemented in <a href="DefnLanguage.html">DefnLanguage</a> (i.e. MyFavouriteNonexistantProgrammingLanguage). -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>
