        Knowledge Map Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        The game is a <a href="KnowledgeMap.html">KnowledgeMap</a> that is distributed across various information sources on the web.  There are N animals each having M characteristics.  N and M are unknown.  The puzzle may have ambiguous or conflicting information and you can change the game or the rules if you like.  You are invited to put a node in your personal or corporate web space (not here).  The game has no solution, however, you can make inferences about the animals based on the information in the knowledge net.  The information may be textual or pictorial.  As the game evolves, some of the links will become broken and the information at the referenced nodes may change.  You may put other information at the nodes if you wish including commentary.  If you want to have some fun you can figure out how to automatically walk the knowledge net and feed the result into an inference engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The game model is an illustration of <em>what we already have in the Web.</em>  Replace Animal with an arbitrary topic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A sufficiently good inference engine should be able to at least:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Calculate a TrustIndex and advise as to whether its value is increasing or decreasing with time.  Ideally, I would like a metric that would provide a score incorporating the concepts of Position, Velocity and Accelration so I would know what to expect now as well as in the future.
        </li>
        <li>
           Reconcile or rationalize the inconsistencies that would appear in the set of all results, ideally capable of flagging the subject as being a member of certain 'like' sets (Troll, Fact, Pleasure, ...) with an indicative Probability and a Confidence level.
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>
      </ul>

        I found something that is a bit more structured unstructure called the <a href="NomicGame.html">NomicGame</a>.  Probably one of those things that's fun after you get the hang of playing it, and all of the other players are adept.  I'm reminded of the conversations in <em>Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead</em> by TomStoppard -- <a href="KirkKitchen.html">KirkKitchen</a> ...heads again!
      </p>
      <p>
        Try <a href="MorningtonCrescent.html">MorningtonCrescent</a> instead - the 'web' you play on is pre-defined as it is (usually) a London tube map.

        <em>I like to </em><a href="AssumeGoodFaith.html">AssumeGoodFaith</a> first, then wait for <a href="ThingsInThrees.html">ThingsInThrees</a> ...<em></em>

        I've read the above several times and still don't understand what the purpose and practice are.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What do I do?
        </li>
        <li>
           How do I "win"?
        </li>
        <li>
           What does it achieve (apart from sinking arbitrarily large amounts of time)?
        </li>
        <li>
           Where do I start?
        </li>
        <li>
           Why should I "play"?
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>What do I gain by participating?</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm reminded of the saying (attributes?)
      </p>

        Please, explain this "game" to me. For reference, I have played and feel I do understand <a href="MorningtonCrescent.html">MorningtonCrescent</a>.

        <em>I believe game is more in the sense of </em><a href="GameTheory.html">GameTheory</a> than ThingsDoneToPassTheTime, although one could probably do that as well.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I got exactly the opposite impression, that this is something to pass the time, like <a href="MorningtonCrescent.html">MorningtonCrescent</a>, as opposed to something genuinely to study, as in <a href="GameTheory.html">GameTheory</a>.  I still await a sensible, comprehensible exposition.
