        Let The Client Decide
      </h1>
      <p>
        Yes, we have expertise. Gobs of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, we have experience. Decades of doing this stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, we have seen something like this before. Not this exact thing, but close enough for rock 'n' roll.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, we have the book education. We don't sit on our hands between contracts, you know. We've accumulated enough travel miles going to trade shows, seminars, and professional conclaves to pay for that in-ground pool in the back yard. Our technical library would sink the Titanic, and most anything else we need is a Google search away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please, please, please do it as we tell you. No? Okay. No problem. We Bill By The Hour.

        You know, sometimes you can lead a horse to water, break its legs, force its face under -- and <em>still</em> not get it to drink. A parched, dying horse. A dried out, desiccated, withered prune of a horse. Stupid horse isn't gonna drink no matter what.

        Once you've exhausted your repertoire of Dale Carnegie-inspired persuasion techniques you've done your due diligence. It's all in your weekly reports, anyway. If the client decides to switch modes from Ask The Expert to Do It My Way then you are stuck.

        Meh.
