        Whew. I just worked through a major refactoring that fixed a long-standing bug in behavior of an object. It was kind of cool: every time I saw that I broke a whole bunch of tests, I backed up to the last "good" version and tried something else. The unit tests steered me into making a string of several painless changes that lead to the correct behavior!

        It's great when this happens. I think you've just reminded us of a basic tenet of refactoring - that for it to be painless you've got to have <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. My problem is that I'm currently working on a code review with a company where I've recommended some major refactoring to a project. The problem is they don't have <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and I have explicitly told them <em>not</em> to start the refactoring until they have the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. So now I have to convince their management to give them a couple of weeks in which <em>no new code</em> will be written so that they can write the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. <em>Sigh...</em> -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

        When I am BehindOnMyTests, I write <em>some</em> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s before refactoring. Otherwise, I have an excuse to never start refactoring. If things start breaking, I back up and write more tests.
