        Never Write Recently

      <p>
        <em>Recently (Oct 23, 1941), a lot of pages/comments have been appearing that say things such as</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Recently blah has been in the news
        </li>
        <li>
           Blah has changed recently
        </li>
        <li>
           Recently, the court case has taken an interesting turn.
        </li>
        <li>
           Recently, 486DX machines have taken home computing to great new speeds.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The very next time that somebody edits that page, the term "recently" no longer has any context. Use a date, use a month, use SOME frame of reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        The word recently should be restricted to conversations, and never used in a document (ie. a wiki page).
