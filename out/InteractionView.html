        <strong>Context:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You are building a large complex system which will have many bits of code much of which depends on one another.  You are defining one of <a href="MultipleArchitectureViews.html">MultipleArchitectureViews</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you explain the dynamic aspects of the system behavior?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It may be hard to understand how a particular piece of software interacts with the rest of the system without having a higher level view. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="DeliveryView.html">DeliveryView</a> of the architecture does not describe the dynamic behavior of the system.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Define a of system interaction view of your system architecture. This <a href="TypeModel.html">TypeModel</a> describes the key objects that exist in the system at runtime and how they interact to produce the overall system behavior. An <a href="InteractionDiagram.html">InteractionDiagram</a> is a good way to describe the interactions between the components.  At the highest level, the components may be the <a href="BusinessArchitecture.html">BusinessArchitecture</a> and the TechnicalArchitecture.
