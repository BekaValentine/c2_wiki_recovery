        Shame this page was marked for deletion.  The term <a href="BaseClass.html">BaseClass</a> engenders interesting discussion.  It's <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> for "superclass" - the class on which another's implementation is "based".  But subclassing/extending/deriving one class from another should be motivated by more than just basing a class's implementation on another's.  Class hierarchies are of higher <a href="InternalQuality.html">InternalQuality</a> when they follow is-a-kind-of relationships.

        In addition, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> people often use "base class" to mean "class not intended for direct instantiation".  I could use "abstract" to convey that, but the <a href="JavaLanguageSpecification.html">JavaLanguageSpecification</a> uses "abstract" to mean "incomplete".  Should only classes with no subclasses be directly instantiated?  There's lots of room for discussion here.  How about we don't delete the page. -- <a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>
