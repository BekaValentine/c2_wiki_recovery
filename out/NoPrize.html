        In seventies Marvel comics, if you wrote in to spot a mistake (<em>On page 5 Hulk has torn his pants. But on page 9 they're untorn again!</em>) the editors would not respond. But if you made up a back-story they would award you with a <a href="NoPrize.html">NoPrize</a>. It generally arrived by mail in no envelope with no stamp and was printed on no paper ...

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>On page 7 where Betty is slung over Hulk's back she's actually darning his pants with a portable sewing kit.</em> Yes! You win a <a href="NoPrize.html">NoPrize</a>! Excelsior!
