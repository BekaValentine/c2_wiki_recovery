        New Information Thin Client Limitation
      </h1>
      <p>
        You are building a typical CRUD user interface: For which tasks should you get involved in with the server ?  I believe that there is no good reason for object/data creation to involve server communication. I believe server communication is fine for the URD in CRUD, but, why involve the server on creation if you still haven't clicked on the "save" button? If at the end you decide to click "Cancel" you have wasted time and resources talking to the server about something that was not going to be persisted. This reduces scalability and on slow networks creates a perception of bad performance that it is hard to justify with the end user. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When building a </em><a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a>, involving the server is an option, when building a <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a> is an obligation, it doesn't matter if  you require it, you are forced to communicate with the server for everything.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        On first sight, it is not easy to see the difference between building an application based in the NewThinClientParadigm (also known as HTML) and using something with full <a href="ClientServer.html">ClientServer</a> support, after all, if you add <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> to the mix HTML/Javascript becomes a typical <a href="ClientServer.html">ClientServer</a>  solution (with no real difference when compared with <a href="BorlandDelphi.html">BorlandDelphi</a>, <a href="JavaSwing.html">JavaSwing</a> or <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a>). <em>{A.K.A. </em><a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a>}<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So the path is there, and has been walked before, define all (or most) of you information with your Client side language, and user the server side only to answer queries to the database or run batch processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, people resist to that... and in this resistance they build stuff like RichFaces, IceFaces,  AspNetAjaxExtensions, etc, because they want to be able to define their UI on the server, bound to server side controllers, that are safe inside the server, and can't be tampered by malicious clients. And they build great stuff (the latest and greatest could be <a href="AribaWeb.html">AribaWeb</a>). But as all abstractions, this one leaks... horribly.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems like an easy problem to solve: update your UI as a result of user interactions: The user does something, you transmit this something to the controller, he reacts, and some part of you UI get refreshed... so far, so good.... you are reading information stored in the server so you have to go to the server to get it...
      </p>
      <p>
        But then you have to create a new object, this is the leak in of your abstraction:
      </p>
      <p>
        You create a new object, and since it is new, the most efficient thing is for it to exist only on the client (<em>if you were coding with full </em><a href="ClientServer.html">ClientServer</a> support, thats what you would do, wouldn't you?<em>), but you can not represent that in your server based technology... what to do? well, you say, lets just create it by default when you load the "Edit" page after clicking the new button, after all, you need to do a redirect, so you still have to go to the server to fetch the UI... and you go on....</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But then you realize that you have to have a one to many relationship going from you new object to children objects, so you add a button "New Child", while you are coding it you realize that you are going to have to violate your server side principles again, this time with no redirect to justify it, because the UI to capture your new child will be in a floating ModalPanel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now this new child object is going to have to be linked to the parent object, and... where should you do that? You can of course, go to the server again to do it but.... what is the justification? You do not need any old information to create the new object (it is after all new), but, you do need to link it to the parent object... How to justify the performance penalty of going to the server just to link all new objects? Specially if after all you might just hit cancel in the "edit" page of your root new object, and send every new object to oblivion?
      </p>
      <p>
        And so the <a href="ThinClientHasFailed.html">ThinClientHasFailed</a>

        Can anyone understand what this page is trying to communicate?  I'm completely lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Me too, though it's curious to watch how each successive paragraph is is less meaningful than the paragraph preceding it in an almost linear fashion.  I think it desperately needs more explanation, clarity, and perhaps some examples -- especially toward the end.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After re-reading it again, I think the thesis of this ramble is that the thin client has failed because object/data creation can only occur on the client, and not involve server communications.
        <em> The problem is not that object/data creation </em>'can only occur<strong> on the client, and not involve server communications, the problem is that object/data creation </strong>most occur only<em>' on the client, and not involve server communications: Why involve the server, if you haven't clicked on the "save" button? Why waste time and network resources with something that you may end up canceling anyway?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is, of course, patently false, as anyone who's ever used GMail can attest to personally (drafts are saved to the server periodically and completely transparently to the user, so you don't lose too much data even if your network connection goes down).  There even is an AJAX-y implementation of <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> called RainbowForth (<a href="http://rainbowforth.sourceforge.net/)">http://rainbowforth.sourceforge.net/)</a> which works similarly.  Thus, there is <strong>no</strong> <a href="NewInformationThinClientLimitation.html">NewInformationThinClientLimitation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> So you mean </em><a href="GoogleWebToolkit.html">GoogleWebToolkit</a> based GMail is you example of a <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a>? AFAIK <a href="GoogleWebToolkit.html">GoogleWebToolkit</a> compiles Java in to <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> that runs on the client... what is the real difference between that and downloading Thunderbird? (Think it like this, if Thunderbird were written in Javascript, and you could run it with AdobeAir would that be Thin or a <a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a> ? <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe I wrote that the thesis of the article was, "that the thin client has failed because object/data creation can only occur on the client, and not involve server communications."  My argument has <em>nothing</em> to do with whether GMail is or is not a thin client.  What I did use GMail as an illustration for is a client-side program which routinely employed server-side communications as a necessary component of its data creation capability.  By way of (rather obvious to me) extension, <em>any</em> client-side program, thin, fat, clinically obese, whatever, can employ a similar strategy, thus utterly disproving what <em>I thought</em> the original poster's thesis was.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> If your argument had nothing to do with whether GMail is or is not a thin client, then why mention GMail at all?  why you didn't use </em>ThunderBird or OutLook for your argument? <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        At risk of sounding very offensive, I really wish people would learn comprehension.  It really would cut down on the noise and unnecessary confrontation on this wiki, to say nothing of my blood pressure.  I apologize if I'm coming off unusually upset.  It just really irks me when people respond to what I've written, particularly in a manner I interpret as singularly snooty, without fully understanding the entirety of the context.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Comprehension is a two-way street -- it depends on the receptiveness & understanding of the reader </em>'and<em>' the clarity of the writer.  No offence intended, but...  In the above, the latter was somewhat lacking, especially toward the end.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No offense taken.  How could I have made this clearer?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, on to why you'd want to involve the server -- simple.  Data loss through network connectivity issues.  If I'm typing something up on GMail, and suddenly my power goes out, that's OK -- I have a recent snapshot of my composition tucked away in GMail's Drafts folder.  If this happens anywhere that doesn't involve a client/server interaction, I'd be right pissed, to the point where <strong>I WILL NEVER USE THAT SERVICE EVER, EVER, EVER AGAIN, INCLUDING IF PAID.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This becomes increasingly important the thinner the client.  Remember, the Internet is predicated on a dumb infrastructure, and smart end-points.  GMail is one end-point.  My computer is the other.  Either we <em>both</em> have equally smart applications interoperating, or GMail has the smarter, or mine has the smarter.  In other words, the sum total of smarts between GMail and my system must be a constant.  Since scripts running in web browsers have zero access to the filesystem beyond simple cookies (particularly if I disable it, which I would if given the option), it follows taht GMail <em>must</em> be the endpoint with the persistence.  Thus, I fully expect GMail to cache my work-in-progress in the event of a communications failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note the word there: <em>expect.</em>  This isn't a nicety.  It isn't even optional.  It is a <em>requirement.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'm going to second that.  The original author appears to be saying that creating objects somehow violates the <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a> assumptions.  That is just plain false.  There is no reason for object creation to be conceptually different than any other object manipulation.  One could do something similar to what GMail appears to do and create a default object and then manipulate that object into the desired state.  One could also (just as is done with regular object manipulations) provide a form to fill out that gathers the data required to create the object, and create the object when the form is submitted.  Which one is better depends on the situation.  Neither approach makes it any less <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a>.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Nesting object creation changes nothing conceptually either.  One can either include the data needed to create the children in with the data needed to create the parent, or create a default and manipulate, or allow the child to be created without the parent, and when the parent is created link the children to it.  None of those options violate <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a> either.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [I will also second that if object creation is complex and needs to be picked up from multiple locations, the GMail approach is most likely the way to go.]

        This brings something interesting to mind: maybe the definition of a <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a> <em>isn't</em> that which cannot run <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> code.  Instead, maybe a <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a> is simply any client which lacks its own means of persistence.

        Guys, I'm not sure who is involved in the discussion here, or what text you're talking about, but <strong>*I*</strong> am the one who asked how my rebuttal to the original post could have been made more clear, such that someone who asked me if I thought GMail was an example of a <a href="ThinClient.html">ThinClient</a> or other future authors would not misunderstand me in the future.

          Belief doesn't enter into the picture.  There is no belief when you have solid knowledge and experience to back your claims.  I know it works, because I've relied on this behavior many times.  And with my changes being sent in the background (and god said, let there be multitasking!), there is zero latency on my part, so there is zero economic incentive for me to use a fat client.  The GMail interface is the ideal e-mail interface.  I cannot stand to use anything else anymore.

        Of course GMail isn't a thin client -- GMail is the application.  My browser is what serves as the thin client.  Make sure you keep your concepts straight.

        As far as expectations are concerned, well, I hate to be the one to ruin your worldview.  No fat client is ever, <em>ever</em>, as usable as the GMail interface, for the simple reason that the numerous deployments do not talk to each other.

        First of all, Thunderbird is a piece of shit in and of itself.  I'd rather use Outlook over it anyday, and as a die-hard anti-Microsoft proponent, that's saying a lot.  Second, as a person who uses the e-mail interface from numerous consoles (laptop, desktop, sometimes even cell phone), having a consistent, coherent interface across all consoles proves extremely valuable.  No, I'm not going to carry a laptop with me everywhere I go.  No, I'm not going to host a mail server on my own computer at home (it's a violation of my ISP TOS anyway).  No, I'm not going to install an industrial grade UPS for my computer to ensure 99.999% uptime in the face of a power outage either.  And, no, I'm not going to custom write an e-mail client which automagically synchronizes its mail read information across other deployments.  I've got more important things to do with my time.  And, I sure as hell ain't gonna spend the time implementing a Bayesian spam filter with a corpus as big as Google's.
