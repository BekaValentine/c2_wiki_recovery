        The Irishman Responds To Tao
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Irishman comes listens to the Tao also. He returns the next day. His usual smile is a little less broad. His friend asks him what is wrong. "Do I look troubled?, he asks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The friend continues, "Why do you Irish respond to a question with a question?" The Irishman's smile returns, "Do we now?" They both laughed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Irishman says, "Thank you, my friend you've given me an idea. When the Tao asked us to solve the problem yesterday, I should have asked a few questions. Take a look at my output. Do you think it is wrong?"
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>Input:</em> <strong>I came I saw I left</strong><br/>
        <em>Output:</em><br/>
        <strong>Duplicate words: I</strong><br/>
        <strong>Number of Distinct Words: 3</strong><br/>
        <strong>List of words with duplicates eliminated: came saw left</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The friend consoles the Irishman: "I see your point. The problem is common. A Customer does his best to describe a system to a Designer. They both think they understand each other, but in reality they don't."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Irishman asks, "Should I have asked for an example?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The friend finishes, "Yes, that way you have two specifications of the problem. As an added bonus, an example can be used to supply test data to your program. You won't be finished until your output matches the example."
