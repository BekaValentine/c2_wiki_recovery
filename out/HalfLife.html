        Pretty much won every "game of the year" type award for 1998...

        Uses a heavily modified version of the original Quake engine (from <a href="IdSoftware.html">IdSoftware</a>). It is one of the first person shooters to have a real and interesting story line. <em>One of the first, perhaps, but beaten by about 4 years by a creature named Marathon, with literally hundreds of pages of text in its story.  Too bad it was only for macs, eh? (though I guess now it's out for everything at </em><a href="http://source.bungie.org">http://source.bungie.org</a> ) -- <a href="DanUznanski.html">DanUznanski</a><em> It's also good fun in deathmatch networked play. </em>
