        Put See Also At Top

      <p>
        In my opinion, the "see also" list should be at the top instead of the bottom. That way, one can see if they are looking at the right or best page before they start perusing. Perhaps same with categories. Whaddyathink? -- Anon

        <em>As an experienced </em><a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a>, I know where to look. Changing the convention doesn't improve that, even if it might be better from a historic point of view. Compare with books and articles, where references and conclusions are put at the end too.<em></em>

        If it's the wrong page, both the top and bottom should be visible at the same time, thanks to the refactorings of a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>.

        Everything should go at the top so the reader can see everything immediately.
