        Scheduling Myths
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #1.</strong>	The length of a software development effort can be accurately estimated instantaneously based on a one-sentence description.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Corollary #1. Providing an accurate estimate is a no cost operation. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Corollary #2. An estimate provided at the beginning of an effort is just as accurate as an estimate provided near the end.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #2.</strong>	Once a date has been given, tasks can be added at will without affecting the date. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #3.</strong>	Once a commitment has been made, the date can be moved up at will without affecting the commitment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #4.</strong>	The cost of developing software is not a relevant factor in the decision to go ahead. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #5.</strong>	No software actually takes more than a week to develop. Most take a day. We have no clue what developers do with the rest of their time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #6.</strong>	After spending a few days testing software, all possible combinations of OS, browser, language, input files, system state, and user actions should be guaranteed to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #7.</strong>	All discrepancies between how much work remains to be done and how much time is left can be solved by the application of magic <a href="PixieDust.html">PixieDust</a> (aka overtime).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #8.</strong>	The supply of magic <a href="PixieDust.html">PixieDust</a> is inexhaustible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Myth #9.</strong>	Once I receive an estimate, I can just say "do it" and the programmers can do it without any further input from me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>General Corollary A.</strong>	When I receive the software, I expect it to be <em>finished</em>. It should include every feature, even the ones no one ever thought of until we'd been using the software for a month. Plus, it will be totally bug free regardless of the amount of testing done, even if that is zero.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>General Corollary B.</strong>	Even though every other software project in the history of the world took longer than expected, this one is different.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>General Corollary C.</strong>	Once I see that it "looks" like a functioning application (the <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> is done), chock full of cute little pull-down menus, then we can ship it tomorrow.
      </p>

      <p>
        Programmers try as hard as possible to avoid working because they by nature loathe it. See <a href="TheoryXx.html">TheoryXx</a>.
