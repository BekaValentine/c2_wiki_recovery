        Rules Are Made To Be Broken
      </h1>
      <p>
        Rules are rules and designed generally to help us.  When the rules are arbitrary and needless then it's time to say <em>Rules Are Made To Be Broken</em>
        and do something more insightful.  But to reiterate: You must first <a href="KnowTheRule.html">KnowTheRule</a> and second you must be justified in breaking the rule by having a good reason.

        It all reminds me of the moral decision making principles taught by the good Jesuits ... <a href="ThePrincipleOfDoubleEffect.html">ThePrincipleOfDoubleEffect</a> is one of the most interesting and most misunderstood.  --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        On C3, we seem to have evolved one unbreakable rule: you can't break the rules without permission from the team.  If a rule is bad, the team can decide not to follow it, but we don't like it if someone breaks the rule on their own.  An <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> team runs on trust and mutual respect.  That rule needs to be preserved always.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        The <a href="ExtremeRules.html">ExtremeRules</a> aren't arbitrary.  <a href="TheyreJustRules.html">TheyreJustRules</a>, and can be changed, but they aren't arbitrary.  I thank RJ, DW and others for showing me that.  --<a href="BenAveling.html">BenAveling</a>
