        Programming Puns
      </h1>
      <p>
        Writing code, comments, variable names, etc., in the manner that they create a pun.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a common and fun practice, but it can be an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. Making a pun can detract from the readability of the code. (See <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a>s.) Plus, if you work with the code long enough, some jokes can tire to the point of becoming completely annoying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternately, simply a class of puns which require programming knowledge to be understood.

        I frequently add the following commands to my makefile (I am not the originator, I saw this in a makefile myself):

        @echo not war?<br/>

        It is surprising how many people have just happened to type "make love" and be amused at the response!
