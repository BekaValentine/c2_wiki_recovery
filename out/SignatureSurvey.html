        Typically, a browsing mechanism for large, structured programs will expose a small part of the program in response to some form of query, possibly as simple as picking from a list. However, when examining an unfamiliar program one needs to get a feel for the whole program at once. To meet this need, one is better off writing a custom tool for viewing the whole program. Such a tool is easily written as a cgi script which runs on a server, reads all of the code base and then reports a summary of that code as a single html document.

        I recently started bringing the idea of using the signature survey method into the German .NET Community. I wrote a short summary about it, referencing your original article. I summed it up and provided it here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://bitbucket.org/cessor/signaturesurvey">http://bitbucket.org/cessor/signaturesurvey</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I find it an extremely useful tool, although my understanding of why it is useful differs a little from your original ideas. Rather than actually browsing code I reduce it to creating a very flat list. I just wanted to say thank you for a very great idea that today, at a conference, inspired a lot of people. -- Johannes from Heidelberg, Germany

        A version of <a href="SignatureSurvey.html">SignatureSurvey</a> exists for wiki. Try browsing with it and compare it with <a href="VisualTour.html">VisualTour</a> and <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a> ...

        The wikiSig script finds all of the pages cited on a root page and summarizes their structure. It is a shorthand for the structure of the page. It currently uses the following code:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           p Page - a link to another Wiki page
        </li>
        <li>
           C Category - special case of the above, a link to a Wiki Category (eg: <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           S Signature - the canonical signature line (-- <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           H http Link - an external link or an image link (eg: <a href="http://example.com)">http://example.com)</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           | Rule - a horizontal rule.
        </li>
        <li>
           * Bullet - A bullet list (only tabbed unordered lists; asterisk-only, ordered lists and definition lists are not yet implemented)
        </li>
        <li>
           sp Paragraph - a space in the page signature indicated a plain old ordinary paragraph. 
        </li>
        <li>
           .,?(){} Punctuation 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A very simple example is the <a href="PietHein.html">PietHein</a> page. It's sig reads as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        .	.	| H | C <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The best way to grok the <a href="SignatureSurvey.html">SignatureSurvey</a> is to mentally turn it on its side.

        I'm looking at this and thinking it could be very useful for refactoring.  At a glance, you can see all the long pages, threadmess, external links, etc.  But the characters it picks out could be better suited for this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't include (){}.  They result in too much noise when you have, for example, Lisp or C code on the page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Do include [].  This is commonly used to delimit <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Maybe include indented text.  This shows the code examples more reliably than (){}.  Might be non-trivial to implement though.
        </li>
        <li>
           Include formatting changes such as bold/italics.  They're either used as headers (useful for seeing the structure) or to delimit <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> comments (useful for refactoring targets).  
        </li>
        <li>
           Possibly include '-- lowercase' as a signature, instead of just '-- <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>'.  Many people use initials instead of a full signature, particularly for long <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> discussions.  This'll result in some false positives with em-dashes, though.
        </li>
      </ul>

        This reminds me of the people in the movie <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a> <em>watching</em> characters "rain" down the monitor and <em>seeing</em> reality. -- <a href="DaveParker.html">DaveParker</a>

        As an alternative to using html to generate the summary and detailed view, you could use an IDE's cross-referencing ability to move around the code quickly. All you need is a high-level signature view, which can be easily provided through a plugin.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it might not be enough to generate a fixed signature - since the important thing is the active exploring... "forming theories" about the code and "refuting them". So there should be a way to define the signature pattern yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a first attempt at such a plugin for <a href="IntellijIdea.html">IntellijIdea</a> - <a href="http://www.intellij.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/JavaSig.">http://www.intellij.org/twiki/bin/view/Main/JavaSig.</a> It's a simple plugin, that generates a signature for each java source file in the project by replacing a given regex with an empty string. The regex can be modified. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using an IDE has the additional benefit of providing an intermediate view - the fully-folded snapshot of the source file (Ctrl Shift Minus - in <a href="IntellijIdea.html">IntellijIdea</a>).

        It's not a big deal to me, but I think (non-signatory) double hyphens fool the <a href="SignatureSurvey.html">SignatureSurvey</a> script. -- <a href="JoeWeaver.html">JoeWeaver</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You are partially correct. Double hyphens trigger an 'S' result in the </em><a href="SignatureSurvey.html">SignatureSurvey</a> only if the hyphens (surrounded by spaces or not) are followed by a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>. Double hyphens are ignored as long as they are not followed by a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> (with or without spaces).

        How does [the script] work, anyway? It shows no results at all on my homepage, but does on, e.g., <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The vertical axis lists all the pages linked to from that page. The horizontal axis displays the summaries for those pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, take <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wikiSig?PainfulLanguage.">http://c2.com/cgi/wikiSig?PainfulLanguage.</a> You get a list of all links from <a href="PainfulLanguage.html">PainfulLanguage</a>: <a href="AbapLanguage.html">AbapLanguage</a>, <a href="AlistairYoung.html">AlistairYoung</a>, <a href="BackWardLanguage.html">BackWardLanguage</a>, etc. Besides each link is the summary for that page. Take <a href="MalbolgeLanguage.html">MalbolgeLanguage</a> as an example, because that's a fairly short page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The . indicates the end of the sentence. Then there are 2 newlines, represented as spaces, an H for the external link, and then 2 more newlines. Then there's a P (page-link) for <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>, and another period. Then ,. for the sentence about its Turing Completeness. A , after "However", and then Ps for <a href="GeneticAlgorithm.html">GeneticAlgorithm</a> and <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>. The next sentence just has a single P, for <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>, and then there's the rest of the punctuation in the sentence. Then more whitespace, and the final P for <a href="BefungeLanguage.html">BefungeLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically, long strings of punctuation mean dense text. Lots of Ps means someone likes <a href="AccidentalLinking.html">AccidentalLinking</a>, like me. Punctuation + S means <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>. Lots of | (horizontal rules) is also a good indication of <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, or lots of disjoint comments. The length of the sig corresponds roughly to the length of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        This could be a good guide to refactoring. At a glance, you can see long pages that might require splitting, dense <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, unrelated comments, etc. I wish you could get a summary for a page without having to search for one of its backlinks though.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I have no clue why <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>'s page doesn't show up. Maybe it's too long, or maybe some character in it is throwing off the script.
