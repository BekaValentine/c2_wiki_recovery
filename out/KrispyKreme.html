        Krispy Kreme
      </h1>
      <p>
        A donut most notable for the assembly line that produces circle after circle of glazed snack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specially known for their very light donuts -- according to expert sources the secret ingredient is potato flour.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very common in the south, though some have appeared to pop up in NYC lately.
        <em>They've got as far as Montreal now... and Sydney!</em>

        Park in the lot and wait for the sign to light up!

        <em>Also available as a surgical procedure. They stick a tube up a vein in your arm and pump raw </em><a href="KrispyKreme.html">KrispyKreme</a> thru it. This coats the inside linings of your arteries - including the coronary arteries - directly without making you taste the f5s first. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em></em>

        The Kreme has invaded the pacific northwest. Indulging my son, I waited with a few hundred other folks to try these donuts on opening weekend. The line wound through the parking lot, around the building, and through a circus tent style gift shop before entering the store. We bought two dozen, one of which was to impress the folks we were meeting that afternoon. I also picked up a <a href="KrispyKreme.html">KrispyKreme</a> logo aluminum coffee mug. It doesn't keep my coffee that hot, but it does accrue respectful nods. Such is the brand's psychokinetic power.

        I may be alone here, but I hate their so-called "donuts" - more like foamed plastic drenched in granulated sugar.  Dunkin' Donuts is much better, and Tim Horton's is better still. -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

           Donuts made fresh at a cider mill -- still warm, with hot cider.  (It's a tradition in Michigan in the fall).
