        Use More Warnings
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think organizations under-utilize warnings. There seems to be a belief that error messages should be all or nothing. However, in complicated, ambiguious, or fast-changing domains, it is often hard to pin down some rules. I've been in on phone conversations that went on for hours trying to flag product combination and discount problems just right with myraid exceptions and rules. They would fix one thing but break another. I felt a better course of action would be to have the machine identify "suspicous" data and then have a human expert review the results to make a final determination. This would also help them fine-tune the rules. Life is not always Boolean. --top
