        OK just a quick note - I'm working on a V1.1 of this code right now to include a new parsing engine which allows HTML templates, style sheets, valid HTML (!) etc., etc. A beta is already available.
      </p>
      <p>
        <rant> A few people have told me they intend to recode <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> on the back of [some free HTTP server]. Why??? :-) <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> just ain't multithreaded so you won't be able to (easily) handle multiple transactions simultaneously. And it already includes all the HTTP server it needs. If you must use a standalone HTTP server, <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> is almost certainly NOT the best Wiki you can bolt onto it. </rant> Still, I have no problems if people wish to do this sort of thing for their own amusement. :-) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I'll post a note here when V1.1 is released.

           Footnote anchors now work as specified (they used not to in some browsers).
        </li>
        <li>
           The prefixes https: and file: are now allowed.
        </li>
        <li>
           The edit box has "width:100%" specified, which improves its width in certain browsers.
        </li>
        <li>
           The edit box has wrap="soft" specified, so that horizontal scrolling is not required.
        </li>
        <li>
           Page deletion is not restricted to "admin" users. All users can now invoke this function.
        </li>
        <li>
           The wording of the instructions for resolving edit conflict is improved (The text has been changed to refer to "first window" and "second window" instead of "left window" and "right window" since in some browsers windows are showed one below the other.

        <strong>Compilers</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The parser code uses char* and custom string manipulation functions. It does not use STL, so should be reasonably portable. HOWEVER, the socket API calls use the <a href="WinSock.html">WinSock</a> API (calls and error codes) rather than the POSIX sockets API. When my busy schedule allows I do intend to fix this for V1.1. -- <a href="EddieEdwards.html">EddieEdwards</a> <em>Perhaps it should use STL and the C++ standard library? These are a lot more portable than you expect. In particular, all the compilers below support the uses of the standard library that you'd require. It would make the code a lot safer and simpler. This isn't 1998, after all...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tested compiler configurations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Visual C++ 6.0
        </li>
        <li>
           Visual Studio 2002 (Visual C++ 7.0) <em>(</em><a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>)<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Visual Studio 2003 (Code Converted Automagically) <em>(</em><a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>)<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           GCC 2.95 for Win32, using MinGW and Dev-C++ 4 <em>(</em><a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>)<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It also runs under Wine, the Linux windows emulator (tested with <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a> 9.0 and Fedora Core 1). UNIX protects port 80 (and all other ports below 1024) from general use, so you'll either need to run it as root, or else change the port number.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Running it as root just seems wrong. However, Apache does the same thing ( </em><a href="http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/misc/security_tips.html">http://httpd.apache.org/docs-2.1/misc/security_tips.html</a> ), so I guess that's how web servers work.

        <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a> modified the source to include an <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a>-like feature, which Eddie put into the 1.1 beta. For instance, to form a link to this page on this Wiki, you would type "c2:<a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a>" (the "c2" part being the nickname for the C2 Wiki, which is in a user-configurable file).

        I use this <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> on my machine to store my own private wiki pages as well as to save <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s of interest from other wikis. It provides simple features including ISBN, insertion of URLs, <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, Search for content and Pagenames. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be used as a local wiki, and it works on a local area network by using the ip of the host program. Since the source code is made available by its author, modifications, including the one made by <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a> will continue, making it possible to extend its features and capabilities. The executable is small enough (less than 100k) to fit on a floppy disk and leaves enough room for several hundred short wiki pages.

        but what about the licence? I saw postcardware but does that mean I can take the source and make lots of changes and distribute modified binaries/source? That is a bit unclear to me -- <a href="GavinVanLelyveld.html">GavinVanLelyveld</a>

        I don't think so. If you got the permission of the originator after showing him your source and abiding by any restrictions or limitations he might place on the distribution, it might be another story.

        I made a WindowsCE version of <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a>. It is very small (42k), and very quick. (Maybe too fast that IE4 on CE sometime fails to catch the response.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        I will make a patch for CE adaptation if you want to integrate that to v1.1. 
      </p>

        Also, I'm planning to make the following modification: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Separate Header and Footer output routines and consolidate them (in PageFormatting?.cpp) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Modify consolidated Header-Footer routine to read and use template file, so that user can define her/his own header or footer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using CeHTTP (Multithreaded Tiny HTTPD for WindowsCE) for httpServer part. 
        (This will add capability to use <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> as a HTTPD and making other cgi using nScript) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Integrate FTP client so that I can upload wiki pages to a remote server (in .wik format, or .html format)

        Yes. Unzip the first 16 files. Thirteen of these are seed pages. The server's directory name is up to you, but the subdirectory for your pages must be spelt "Pages".

        Ouch and double-ouch! Major potential security hole: buffer overflows, etc. How secure is <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a>, particularly regarding injection attacks? 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're worried, you're probably running a firewall anyway. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But what about those who aren't used to thinking about security? They're the ones who are most vulnerable. What does <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> do to protect them? Does it refuse to answer requests from any machine that's not in its hosts file? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's face it - if you're not thinking about security, but if security does matter, you shouldn't just fix one hole, but instead fix most of the holes by using a firewall.

        It would be great if <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> could export all pages as html files into a local folder.

        Why does the logo icon show up with a border (and a rather thick and distracting one at that?) even when the original image is replaced with borderless ones?

        <em>Does the border change color when you click on the icon?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, it does! I see, it's being treated as a new/visited link, which it is actually ... Is there a way to change this?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes. In EW1.1, go to the AdminLogin menu to edit PageTemplate.html and change <img src="icon.jpg"> to <img src="icon.jpg" border=0> for each icon which acts as a link. You will then have no border (if you still see a border, refresh the page).</em>

      <p>
        If you can't get EW1.1 (Beta 1) to run (especially on Windows XP), i.e., it just shuts down as soon as you open it, try deleting the wikipage with the international characters in its name. This evades a known problem. Also, check for a clash with the server started by default by Windows XP.

        Links
      </p>
      <p>
        A word starting with a capital and ending with a number will make a link: Test1 forms a link. The parser doesn't seem to include the underscore character as part of the link; it stops the link when it sees the underscore. So Test1 and Test1_1 are the same link.

        <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> also includes a nice feature to backup your wiki files. If you use the DumpAllPages link, a binary file containing all your pages will be created. This is much easier than creating a zip archive of all your wiki pages. When <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> starts, it looks for a DumpAllPages file in the server directory. If found, it creates those archived pages in the Pages subdirectory, (overwriting pages with the same name). <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> renames this file with a bak extension afterwards, so it will not create the pages every time it starts. A Pages subdirectory must exist for this process to work. This is useful if you run <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> in 2 locations, and you want to keep your wiki pages in sync; you can just email the DumpAllPages file from one computer to the other.

        <strong>Anonymous user begins at StartPage instead of the "Default Page" defined in Config.wkc?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am using the version extracted from wikibeta110_2.zip (extracts to folder "Wiki 1.1 Beta 1", which looks odd based on the presence of the "_2" in the name of the downloaded zipfile).
      </p>
      <p>
        From reading the comments in Config.wkc, I would think that accessing EW at http://localhost would take me to the page defined as the "Default Page" in the file "Config.wkc". But instead, I always begin at Start Page. Is it supposed to work that way? I have the following in my Users.wkc file:
      </p>
      <code>
        :=r<br/>
        bspuser:abcdef=rw:MspHomePage<br/>
        admin:raelia=rwa:AdminHomePage<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I have the following in the Config.wkc file:
      </p>
      <code>
        ; Default Page - this is the page that the Wiki opens on when<br/>
        ; an anonymous user opens the site<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Default Page=MyDefault<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ; Content Type - this is the string sent in HTTP headers<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Content Type=text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Am I simply misunderstanding how the "Default Page" is supposed to work?
        I would like to have a non-Author begin at the site on something other than "Start Page". -- jc

      <p>
        <em>in the Config.wkc file, then the "root" page works as I expected the "Default Page" was supposed to work. Now I can have all anonymous users start at any page I want (not at "Start Page", which cannot be renamed). -- jc</em>

        linking to internal files and directories
      </p>
      <p>
        It is very useful in a wiki that is going to be primarily for personal use to have the possibility of linking to internal files and directories - for example, file://C:/MyFile. The first versions of Eddies Wiki had this feature but for some reason (is it intentional?) the latest beta doesn't seem to have this ability. Or am I missing something? Many other Wikis (Use Mod, Swiki, Zwiki, etc provide this capability which really makes them very useful as personal wikis, why not the new versions of Eddies Wiki?

        I think it would be nifty to stick the source code for Eddie's wiki on some wiki somewhere, so people could comment on it and explain it to each other (<a href="WikiForLiterateProgramming.html">WikiForLiterateProgramming</a>).
        But I get the impression that C2.com is probably not the appropriate place for that.
        What wiki would be appropriate ?
