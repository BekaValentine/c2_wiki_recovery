        Vb Classic Migration Concerns
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="VbClassicMigrationConcerns.html">VbClassicMigrationConcerns</a> is a page on getting <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> applications reimplemented to run on machines hosting <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> OS.
      </p>
      <p>
        As most of the <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> applications are clientServer type applications, the information discuss here may not apply to situations where other uses of <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> was deployed in other ways (e.g. in <a href="ActiveServerPagesInVbClassic.html">ActiveServerPagesInVbClassic</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Another assumption of this page is not to use (often quite good) <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> tools. Quite often, SystemsIntegration complexities of a hybrid solution are a major concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Assumptions for an </em><a href="EnterpriseApplication.html">EnterpriseApplication</a> solution<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The "migrated" application should have a reasonable chance of being compatible with <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a>, but it is not necessary to use any new WindowsApi.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the application uses data (most do), an acceptable solution will probably have its data hosted in a <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> database.

        <a href="MicrosoftWay.html">MicrosoftWay</a> is to use the most recent release of their product. At this writing, it meant the yet unreleased <a href="DotNetFramework.html">DotNetFramework</a> <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a> using <a href="VbDotNet.html">VbDotNet</a> or <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WebForms.html">WebForms</a> is actually favored by MS over <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a>. However, there will be a greater adjustment by endusers if <a href="WebForms.html">WebForms</a> are to be used.
        </li>
        <li>
           Please note there is a bias favoring use of <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> in Microsoft material. However even in <a href="VisualStudioWhidbey.html">VisualStudioWhidbey</a> there are cases where <a href="VbDotNet.html">VbDotNet</a> can be (perceived to be) a more suitable tool than <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

        For simple cases, a <a href="MicrosoftExpress.html">MicrosoftExpress</a> solution may suffice.

        What is all this talk about future MS OS's busting VB6 applications? If a new OS cannot run VB6, likely it won't run a lot of other existing things also. With Linux eating into MS's market share, I don't think MS would really risk pissing off that many people. I think they are bluffing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Microsoft typically don't bluff about breaking compatibility. They did it more than once to their OS when it served their purposes. They may have put away an unreleased safety mechanism in case user resistance becomes too expensive to manage.
        </li>
        <li>
           In <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> SP2 already there are new APIs introduced in the name of security. I am speculating one way to rid <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> apps is for <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> (7) to break the HTML component used by <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> 6, making it necessary for a rewrite once IE7 becomes widespread.
        </li>
