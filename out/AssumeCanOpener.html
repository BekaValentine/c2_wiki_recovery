        Assume Can Opener

        A chemist, a physicist and a mathematician are stranded on a desert island, and all they have to eat is a can of beans, but nothing sharp enough to open it with.  They each in turn set about devising a method to open the can.
      </p>
      <p>
        The chemist comes up with a method that involves making seawater acidic enough to get the top off, and then  neutralizing the acid with some basic coconut juice from a nearby tree to avoid ruining the food.
      </p>
      <p>
        The physicist comes up with a complicated stick and rock momentum-leveraging apparatus to basically smash open the can.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mathematician scratches his head, and walks around the beach for a while considering the problem. Finally, he comes and sits down next to his fellow castaways and says, "Assume a can opener..."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Would that be a perfectly spherical can opener of infinite density?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Somewhere there is an allegedly real story about a farming productivity simulation that turned out wrong because it assumed spherical cows.}

        We can extend this:

      <ul>
        <li>
           An astronomer: "Wait until August 12, and then there's a 0.0001% chance that a meteorite from a meteor storm will crash down upon the can, spilling it open."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Bill Gates: "Maybe we can walk around the island and trick somebody into giving us a newer can for the older one. We'd still starve, but at least die with the latest can."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Steve Jobs: "Maybe if we paint it all white, a passing ship will notice it and help us open it. We just need to make some paint. I know <em>iCan</em> do it."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           George W. Bush: "Declare a 'war on beans' and then threaten to invade it! It will fear our might, and open up."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Geologist: "Wait until 3 million years. Wind, sand, and sun will fracture these round rocks into sharp edges, then we cut the can open."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lisp-programmer: "Surround each side of the can with coconut shell halves. The sheer volume of shell halves will stir it into action."
        </li>
      </ul>
