        I was surprised when this one came up as not being already in wiki.  It may have a <a href="WikiSynonym.html">WikiSynonym</a>.  The idea is that in XP (as I understand it) you're continuously testing your programs so that you've always got something working.  This is the only thing that can save yourself when you <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>.

        Check out a continual integration/build tool named <a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a> at <a href="http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/">http://cruisecontrol.sourceforge.net/</a> .  The guys over at <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a> were nice enough to release this application that monitors your source control system and when a file is changed, automatically rebuilds your application and runs the tests.  --<a href="AngusMezick.html">AngusMezick</a>

        I am doing research on pushing the envelope even farther on rapid testing feedback.  See <a href="AutomatedContinuousTesting.html">AutomatedContinuousTesting</a>. --<a href="DavidSaff.html">DavidSaff</a>

        I believe there are two different things going on here: <a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a> and <a href="AntHill.html">AntHill</a> are for <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>: ensuring that the work of multiple developers builds and works together. <a href="ContinuousTesting.html">ContinuousTesting</a> (analogous to, and named in parallel to, the ContinuousCompilation feature of some IDEs) is for running tests on the work of a single developer. Also, some company has trademarked "Continuous Testing", which to them means a service that runs user-simulation tests on your web site. -- DaveSchweisguth
