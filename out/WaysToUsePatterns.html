        Ways To Use Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        Though we most often talk about <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, patterns have many uses. This page is a shot at building a taxonomy, not of patterns, but of the domains patterns serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        Early in the days of patterns we talked about two main
        uses of patterns: for teaching and learning, and for
        reference. That splits patterns into two major categories.

        This page probably needs some major reorganization;
        anyone who has the energy shouldn't feel bad about
        throwing this away and starting over.
        I just wanted to get things rolling.
