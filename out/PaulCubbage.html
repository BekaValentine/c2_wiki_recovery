        Information theory and uses of simplicity are some of my thought hobbies. I have a theory of truth based on both. It can be stated that in any information topology, truth is the geodesic line between any two points on or in any flow through the topology. I am putting an essay on truth on a site I'm building and will put the url here (someday). 9/13/2002
