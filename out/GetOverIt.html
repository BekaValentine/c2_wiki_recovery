Instead of deleting the page - please make the page apply to software more (rather than just deleting it, what the eff is your problem?).  If this silly behavior continues, wait - now I get it. It's <strong>extreme programming</strong> and <strong>refactor mercilessly</strong> that's gotten into you hasn't it.  People on this wiki, are irrational, illogical, and quite extreme. Please - don't edit things using extreme programming tactics - it does not work.<em></em>
