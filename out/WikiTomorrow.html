        Wiki Tomorrow

      <p>
        Have you ever read some person on the Wiki say "I'll add this tomorrow." or "I'll expand on this tomorrow."?
      </p>
      <p>
        Tomorrow? The page was last edited years ago! The eternal <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> isn't much compared to the Wiki Tomorrow.

        <em>Can you give an example of such a page? I can't find one.</em>

        [There are lots, but it's not clear how you would search for them, since the phrasings can be highly indirect. For instance, the other day I filled in a URL that <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> only <strong>implicitly</strong> said he would eventually provide, years ago; see the first comment attributed to him on <a href="InterfacesShouldBeAdjectives.html">InterfacesShouldBeAdjectives</a> and my "news flash" after it.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ok, he doesn't imply "tomorrow" per se, but it's the same concept: no followup ever happened.]
