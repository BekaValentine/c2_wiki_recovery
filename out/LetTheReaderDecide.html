        There's a point where it's perhaps better to <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> rather than continue with a debate stuck in stalemate. Each participant has already presented what he or she believes to be sufficient evidence and arguments such that it's pointless to continue trying to convince each other.
