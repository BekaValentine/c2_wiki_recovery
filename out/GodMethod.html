        God Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        A "God Method" is a method that does way too many processes in the system and has grown beyond all logic to become The Method That Does Everything.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Lisp/Scheme Objects, implemented as closures, might qualify as a <a href="GodMethod.html">GodMethod</a>.  Similarly, Records may qualify as <a href="GodMethod.html">GodMethod</a>s in untyped curried languages where a projection on a record is equivalent to passing a parameter to a function.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And that doesn't even touch on <a href="LambdaTheUltimate.html">LambdaTheUltimate</a> systems where <em>everything</em> is a function... and the <a href="GodMethod.html">GodMethod</a> is omnipresent, albeit not omniscient.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        An example of the typical <a href="GodMethod.html">GodMethod</a> that appears, specially  in data oriented aplications is (in Java):
      </p>
      <code>
        public Object execute(Object objects)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or for those that believe in the all powerful string:
      </p>
      <code>
        public Object execute(String objects)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or even (but not much better):
      </p>
      <code>
        public <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a> execute(String objects)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The interesting thing, is that, as need for new processes increases suddenly some programmers realize.. why should I create a new method for each processe if can only add an "if"... I think this is because this kind of programmer has <a href="FearOfAddingMethods.html">FearOfAddingMethods</a>. Another interesting phenomena is that if the process can be specified in some kind of languange then it is almost a sure thing that a <a href="GodMethod.html">GodMethod</a> will appear:
      </p>
      <code>
        public Result execute(RelationaAlgebraExpresion expression)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The thing is that any sufficently complex object graph can represent a kind of language of a domain so there seems to be a fight (or complicity?) between objects graphs and GodMethods...
      </p>

        <em>In Java, I've also seen the related </em>GodConstructor, especially for making Swing objects. Each Component subclass does all the setup of itself and layout of its children within a honking huge constructor. The object then just hangs out in the component hierarchy, delegating events to anonymous event handler objects that were also created in the constructor.<em></em>
      </p>

        It does get worse.  Back in '99, I worked with a VB programmer who insisted on putting all the buttons on a form into one array, so they'd all have the same Click handler.  He'd then use a big If-Then-Else block so that if the array index was 0, it was the Save button, and if the array index was 1, it was the Open button, etc.
