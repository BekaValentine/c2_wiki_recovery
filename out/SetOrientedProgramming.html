        Set Oriented Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Programming with sets. The most well known candidate is <a href="SetlLanguage.html">SetlLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This style of programming follows scientific (especially mathematical) reasoning and exposition most closely.
        Problems are declaratively described as propositions about sets (<a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a>). The constraint-solver then infers all solutions fulfilling a given set of goals.

        The basic operations of a SetBasedLanguage are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           SetComposition e.g. with "{ ELEM | SET }"
        </li>
        <li>
           SetDecomposition e.g. by pattern matching on "{ ELEM | SET }"
        </li>
        <li>
           EqualityTest "A = B" usually implemented with an UnificationAlgorithm
        </li>
        <li>
           MemberTest a primitive predicate "member(A, B)."
        </li>
        <li>
           SetUnion a primitive predicate  "union(A, B, C) for improved analysis (union can be composed from ExistentialQuantification and MemberTest)
        </li>
        <li>
           SetDisjunction a primitive predicate  "disjuct(A, B, C) for improved analysis (disjunction can be composed from ExistentialQuantification and MemberTest)
        </li>
        <li>
           Negation or negated versions of the above primitives.
        </li>
        <li>
           Implicit or explicit ExistentialQuantification or UniversalQuantification.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The difference to <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> is one of focus:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="SetOrientedProgramming.html">SetOrientedProgramming</a> lies the focus on expressivity (in a mathematical sense), whereas
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> strives for high performance with limited expressivity (or at least optimization of special cases), but with sets with high numbers of regular elements (tuples).
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Of course, skeptical table fans are going to ask for an actual example of "limited expressivity". Because representional equivalency can probably be established for the items being compared (ignoring vendor/hardware-imposed limits), it may come down to a debate on style. It could perhaps be argued that tables offer a compact visual representation that raw sets don't.</em>

        <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>: does <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> fit this paradigm?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, but some extensions do (see link above). You could relax the condition somewhat and say lists are really ordered sets only (in which case </em><a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> jumps into the boat too), but then you lose too much semantic precision, I guess.<em></em>
