        Hello. (This is a PseudoNym.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hello.  Do consider </em><a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks... but no thanks. I value the RightToVanish and also anonymity (e.g. I prefer anonymous forum software when using one.). I also use this PseudoNym elsewhere, and I'd prefer the connection.
      </p>

        <em>Forum communities have values too.  This one values taking responsibility for one's statements, which is exactly what fly-by-night dealers of words with false names and the </em>RightToVanish are aiming to avoid.  But, while a few of us might gripe and you might get a little flak for it, we won't (and can't, technologically) forbid you from using a pseudonym.  So... <a href="WelcomeWhatBringsYouHere.html">WelcomeWhatBringsYouHere</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I take full responsibility for my statements, of course, and this isn't a throw-away false name - being that I use it elsewhere too. Anyway, as for what brings me here, an interest in software design, development, patterns and people.
