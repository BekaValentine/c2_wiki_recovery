        Salary Ramp
      </h1>
      <p>
        Generally one can expect salary to increase monotonically over time, whether you change jobs or stay in the same organization
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Many organizations give raises in recognition of good performance
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's easy to feel confident in asking for a certain salary if you're already close to it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your current salary is sometimes considered an indication of how important your employer feels you are
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore:</em> Get onto and up the ramp as quickly as you can -- though not forgetting your other requirements for professional and personal self respect.  If you don't play the game well now you're not only giving away money for this engagement, but you're also limiting your future earning potential.
      </p>

        <em>Discussion:</em> This is overly simplistic, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Right. Here in this office right now are two people whom I know took significant cuts in salary to come here, because the other benefits outweiged the monetary loss.
