Apple events have a C-based programmatic interface in the classic MacintoshToolbox and Carbon, but the <a href="OpenScriptingArchitecture.html">OpenScriptingArchitecture</a> allows scripters to send arbitrarily complex events from theoretically various scripting languages, primarily <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>.

For example, the four required Apple events share an event class of 'aevt', and the Open Documents event (one of the four) has an event ID of 'odoc'.
