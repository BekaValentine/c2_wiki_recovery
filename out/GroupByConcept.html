        Group By Concept
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a>s have to be "normalized' much in the same way databases and object structures are. You group by underlying concept. For example, if I'm editing an address book, the fields of the mailing address should not be interspersed with the phone numbers or email addresses of companies or people. Instead, they have to be grouped tightly together and the tabbing order must flow through the address.
