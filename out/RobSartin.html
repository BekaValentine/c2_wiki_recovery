        Rob was a partner at <a href="OmniscientTurtle.html">OmniscientTurtle</a>, an Agile software consulting firm.

        Previously, Rob was Director of Engineering and <a href="SoftwareArchitect.html">SoftwareArchitect</a> for <a href="ImpartTechnology.html">ImpartTechnology</a> (previously named Terrace Mountain Systems). I probably hate both of those titles more than almost anyone else. Director of Engineering meant that I went to the management meetings most of the time and met with customers. <a href="SoftwareArchitect.html">SoftwareArchitect</a> means I was the one who wrote some of the first code and some of people on the team think that I designed it. They are wrong; we designed the code. It was one of the best examples of an <a href="EmergentDesign.html">EmergentDesign</a> I have seen. In my wildest dreams, I wouldn't have done that well designing the thing from the requirements at the start of the project or writing it alone.

        In prior roles, he developed web/enterprise applications in Java, built software configuration management systems, developed UNIX (HP-UX) commands and kernel, did research on distributed computing at HP Labs, and designed heart monitors.
        For a time, in the late 1980s, if you or a loved one were in a coronary or intensive care unit, there is about a 50%
        chance you were monitored by software I wrote. It was a sobering thought for me.

        Rob organized and  moderated the <a href="AustinPatternsGroup.html">AustinPatternsGroup</a> and the <a href="XpAustin.html">XpAustin</a> group.
