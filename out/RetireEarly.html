        Retire Early

        To paraphrase something I heard long ago, "Ask yourself what you'd do if you could retire. Ask yourself why you aren't doing it right now. Then do it." -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I retired after I graduated from my undergrad. My father got angry at me because <em>he</em> wanted to retire. Said I should get a job. Now, how unfair is that, man? -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I second Sunir.  I find it effective, not even just about retirement.

        I was in IBM Research, striving like any good researcher, to become an IBM Fellow, with a 5-year free period to research anything I might want.  I finally realized that to get there, I had to do research of such a high quality, that it had to on something I really really wanted.  Reversing that argument, I decided, "why don't I just <em>pretend</em> I'm an IBM Fellow, and start a research project on something I just want?!"  Not surprisingly, I got such a project and had a lot of fun and did cool research for 4 years.  Even an IBM Fellow only gets an additional year beyond that.

        Repeat for "what would I do if I were retired / rich / ...?"  How about just pretending that I am retired, and start doing that now? So that's what I'm doing.  Can't particularly see that "retiring" will give me anything better. etc for other activities.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        "why aren't you doing it right now"?  Perhaps it requires more commitment or more flexibility in schedule than a 40 hour workweek allows.
        <a href="WhyDoYouPermitThisToBeDoneToYou.html">WhyDoYouPermitThisToBeDoneToYou</a> discusses working long hours to get "fun" tasks and avoid "boring" tasks; when you retire, (almost) all tasks are fun.  The only problem is one still has to prioritize; there is still too much fun stuff to do.
        You may also find that connection to the internet is not so important, if you are spending your time away from a desk, doing things that truly interest you.

        If I could do anything I want just now, I'd hang out with bright people, telling them about XP, teaching them, and learning from them. Oh, wait - that <em>is</em> what I'm doing. --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
