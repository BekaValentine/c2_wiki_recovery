        Lightning Rod
      </h1>
      <p>
        A lightning rod is a) a metal stake driven into the ground; used to divert lightning strikes and provide a safe channel for the electrical energy contained therein (thus preventing the destruction of buildings which otherwise would bear the brunt of a lighning strike); b) a person whose purpose is to bear criticism and thus protect others (click on the <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> link below), or c) in the context of Wiki (or the net as a whole), a page or other resource intended to attract flames and other noise, so that they won't pollute other pages containing mostly signal.
