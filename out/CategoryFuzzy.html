        If you think these FuzzyCommunity pages are a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>, why don't you help make them not a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>?

        Could someone explain to me how <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> now has all these pages, character for character? While I agree they are better placed there, I do want to make sure people understand the ethical and legal considerations of moving people's writing from one website to another. I certainly don't think moving material off site without permission from the authors is legitimate. I know this wasn't sought, as I wasn't asked to move my writing (not that I would have objected). -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>, Editor of <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>
