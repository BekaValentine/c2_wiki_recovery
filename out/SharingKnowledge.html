        Give a person a fish and you feed him for a day. Teach a person to fish and you feed that person for a lifetime.

        A chinese proverb apparently, and the way I was taught it:
      </p>
      <p>
        Give a person a fish and tommorrow they'll be back for more fish. Teach someone to fish and they don't need you any more.
      </p>
      <p>
        And all I'm saying is a bit cross skilling never hurt anyone and you don't want to be stuck doing all fishing for the rest of your life anyway.

        Not venting or anything. But seriously, some verbose naming conventions in the code I'm looking at would have been awesome.
