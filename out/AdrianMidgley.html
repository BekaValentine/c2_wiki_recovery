        I like Wikis as a work-group tool for medical organizations - it is fair to say that the administration of our local health service dislikes them for very similar reasons. A very good idea, well done that man.

        I have a newish Wiki at <a href="http://www.defoam.net/wiki/tavi-0.22/">http://www.defoam.net/wiki/tavi-0.22/</a> and our local Linux User Group has one at <a href="http://www.dclug.org.uk/wiki/.">http://www.dclug.org.uk/wiki/.</a>
