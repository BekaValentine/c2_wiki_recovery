        Graph Algorithms With Tables
      </h1>
      <p>
        If tables are general purpose data structures could someone show me how you'd represent a graph as a table. Then show an implementation of <a href="DijkstrasAlgorithm.html">DijkstrasAlgorithm</a> using tables. Then compare it to this page: <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html">http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html</a> or any other implementation using the standard EdgeList or AdjacencyMatrix representations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Most graph-like arrangements are done using many-to-many tables. If all the nodes are in the same table, then we only need two columns in our many-to-many table: fromID and toID. Referential integrity and/or triggers can be used to avoid duplicate links.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is beautiful. It perfectly illustrates why people get really angry at top. I asked him to show a solution to a fundamental programming problem: representation of graphs and graph traversal algorithms. I even gave a pointer to a trivial implementation in Python. Instead he hand-waves an answer about many-to-many tables.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>{{It seems to me that top has answered the question that was asked ("how would you represent a graph as a table?"). The mathematical definition of a graph is </em>'already<em>' expressed as a pair of tables (V, E), since sets and relations are special cases of tables. The (fromID, toID) table mentioned above is E (V is only needed if the graph can have isolated vertices with no edges). The list and matrix representations are two possible representations of tables; they're not specific to graphs (more generally, you can use an n-cube to represent an n-ary relation, which corresponds to a hypergraph).}}</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe I'm not communicating well but I'd like to see
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           an sql scheme that represents a graph and
        </li>
        <li>
           an sql select statement that retrieves the shortest path between arbitrary nodes using Dijkstra's algorithm.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>{{SQL is a toy language. You need a more expressive language for this. The Python implementation referenced above is not table-oriented because it depends on a specific edge-list representation for E. It can be made table-oriented by accessing E only using table operations (which is no less efficient, and merges the edge list and adjacency matrix versions of the program).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For example, here's the find_path function so modified, in a hypothetical table-oriented variant of Python:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        def find_path(graph, start, end, path=[]):<br/>
        path = path + [start]<br/>
        if start == end:<br/>
        return path<br/>
        if not (start <strong>in dom</strong>(graph)):<br/>
        return None<br/>
        for node <strong>where</strong> graph(start, node):<br/>
        if node not in path:<br/>
        newpath = find_path(graph, node, end, path)<br/>
        if newpath: return newpath<br/>
        return None<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Here "a </em>'in dom<strong>(R)" tests whether a is in the domain of a relation R, and "for x </strong>where<em>' R(a, x)" loops through the values x such that R(a, x) is true. These are both primitive relational operations. Below I'll use "R.hintIndexBy(n)" to declare a hint that a table should be indexed by the n'th field of each tuple.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You may note that the code still uses array syntax. In this hypothetical Python variant, an array would be equivalent to a relation between array indices and values, and the array syntax would be syntactic sugar. -- David Hopwood }}</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If tables are general purpose data structures (that are as good as hashmaps/dictionaries) then this should be trivial. Of course past experience suggests that top will not write any SQL in response.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I never claimed that SQL could completely solve/implement the entirety of ALL algorithms. You seem to have some misconceptions about my viewpoints. In actual work (as I encounter it), SQL is often used to "pre-process" the information, reducing the workload/amount of procedural code. In some algorithms it may be 90+ percent, in others 10. Whether it can do large amounts with your suggested algorithm, I don't know yet. A possible failure to use it significantly for one particular algorithm does not flatten my claims, for there are jillions of other algorithms. This topic is not really about SQL anyhow.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My point is that this is an entire branch of fundamental knowledge that is very easy to represent using associative arrays and lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Same with tables.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It happens to be both a very important branch of knowledge and something that is <em>very</em> hard to represent with tables. The point I'm making is that tables/relational is a nice data structure whereas lists, associative arrays, trees, graphs, stacks, queues are truly <em>general</em> purpose structures that can be used to represent <em>anything</em>. Tables <em>aren't general</em> purpose because they only work for some niches. Lists, associative arrays, etc <em>are general</em> because they work for all niches. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If that is the case, then why is Oracle such a huge company? I don't think any structure is the "ideal" for 100% of all niches, and I doubt you do either. Tables can represent anything that the dedicated structures can, and bend better to new requirements.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I suspect you won't be convinced my argument I suggest you try to implement graphs. In the python link I provided above they show that an edge-list representation of a graph is as simple as g = {'nodeKey':['otherNodeA', 'otherNodeB']}.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>{{And the corresponding table-oriented code could be as simple as "g = {'nodeKey' </em>'-><strong> 'otherNodeA', 'nodeKey' </strong>-><em>' 'otherNodeB'}" and "g.hintIndexBy(1);" The advantage here is that you can add other indices, or fields, or change to a matrix representation, or add transaction support, or whatever, without changing existing code that uses the graph. A smart implementation could even guess based on usage patterns what the best representation is.}}</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't see link weights in that. Adding link weights to a many-to-many table is trivial.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Algorithms to process that are fairly easy. Any equivalent sql schema would be far more complex and awkward.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>{{Why the assumption that using a table-oriented programming model necessarily has anything to do with SQL?}}</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In closing: please try to implement this so you'll immediately <em>see</em> the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why not just replace the array references with function calls that use SQL or whatever internally? (Array calls don't allow one to change to a different data container anyhow.) The data can then remain the in tables, where it probably sits anyhow already in practice. Whether SQL can be used to shorten the algorithm, I don't know yet. I don't specialize in shortest-path algorithms; I'll have to study the problem more. This is more like a computer science term paper project rather than the kind of stuff I encounter in the real world. It would be interesting to see you guys use stacks, arrays, etc. to nicely implement this: </em><a href="http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/chal06.htm">http://www.geocities.com/tablizer/chal06.htm</a> <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Aaaargh! I can't believe you just did it again. You've hand-waved about link-weights, challenged people to write code (which is here by the way: <a href="http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html),">http://www.python.org/doc/essays/graphs.html),</a> made an appeal to authority and still didn't answer the question. This is increasingly aggravating but I shall try one more time.

           Graph theory underlies huge amounts of business applications from Amazon to DHL to genetic sequencing.

           Implementing a graph and traversing it is so trivial that it can be done in a handful of lines of Python.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Therefore <em>prove</em> that tables are general purpose by showing an SQL schema and some sql that does the equivalent of the Python code linked to. You don't have to be an expert in graph theory. This is first year undergraduate computer science. If the problem can easily be solved using tables then show me how. I'm not asking for miracles just for you to implement trivial functionality. If you can't or won't then say why. Is it because you don't know how to implement algorithms in SQL? Or because you need an English description of the shortest path algorithm? The <a href="DijkstrasAlgorithm.html">DijkstrasAlgorithm</a> page now has links to introductory pages that explain it but I'm quite willing to write out the pseudo code if first year comp-sci is too advanced for you.

        [Bad example, because graphs are fairly easily to represent with relational tables. Easier, IMHO, than the python example. Since <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> won't provide code, I will. I won't use SQL because SqlSucks, but here's the Python example in pseudocode-ish relational model:

        insert(visited, current_cheapest)<br/>
        relax(current_cheapest; project(name; select(edges.from = current_cheapest.node;<br/>
        cross-product(edges; current_cheapest))))<br/>

      <code>
        def relax(cheapest_node; adjacency_set)<br/>
        adjacent_costs = select(current_costs.node = adjacency_set.node; <br/>
        cross-product(adjacency_set; current_costs))<br/>
        link_costs = select(cheapest_node.node = edges.from && adjacent_costs.node = edges.to;<br/>
        cross-product(adjacent_costs; edges; cheapest_node)<br/>

        project(node; select(adjacent_costs.cost <br/>
        < cheapest_node.cost + link_costs.cost))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The start node has to be placed in current_costs with a cost of 0, and then the shortest path to a given node is obtained by following the predecessors table back to the start node. This (most likely) requires a recursive query:
      </p>
      <code>
        while current_node != start<br/>
        current_node = project(pred; select(node = current_node; predecessors))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But we're talking about tables here, not databases, and there's no inherent reason why a recursive query on an in-process table structure would be slower than the equivalent list or map.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you have any idea how slow select(edges.from = current_cheapest.node; cross-product(edges; current_cheapest) is going to be in the absence of a query optimizer like a RDBMS has? You assume some magic compiler for python is going to do that...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this does <em>more</em> than the Python example, because the Python example neglects the cost of each edge (one of the fundamental parts of Dijkstras algorithm). I included it here to show that the relational model could handle it. It would be good to extend the Python example to include costs, just to see how much code it would take then.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've taken a few liberties with the relational operators in the interests of clarity. Min and count, for example, aren't really operators, but everybody knows what they do, and if you need a real equivalent you can see how to do min at <a href="http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CC/354/zaiane/material/notes/Chapter3/node8.html.">http://www.cs.sfu.ca/CC/354/zaiane/material/notes/Chapter3/node8.html.</a> Also, the relational algebra doesn't have insert and update as operators; I define insert to take a relation and a tuple and insert the tuple into that relation, and update to take a relation and an expression and apply that expression to all fields of that relation. And I use an operation I've termed "merge" which updates a tuple if it already exists (setting all fields) and creating it if not. The semantics of these are probably not as clean or well-defined as they should be, but we're trying to express a graph traversal, not extend the relational algebra here.

        In my decade-and-a-half in biz apps, I have <strong>never encountered</strong> a single implementation. I thought such algorithms fall into a category by themselves such that there are dedicated specialists. If I was put in charge of implementing one, I would survey existing algorithms and use what I find. It appears most existing algorithms for such are procedural in nature and not relational. But that does not mean that a relational version cannot or does not exist. More on this below.

        Jonathan you've illustrated my point. Doing what you did using what is the de facto language for real work with databases is so painful you've had to make up your own notation instead. I also wanted to avoid link weights and stick to the simplest possible type of graph so that we can see just how much work it takes to just to represent a graph using SQL/tables. This way topmind wouldn't be able to weasel out of writing code by claiming that the maths was too hard for him. I suppose I should have learned my lesson by now. He's never provided a working program to anyone ever but he always sounds like he will if you just jump through one more hoop for him.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I'll save myself any future aggravation by ignoring him and focusing on Mr Tang's interesting question about the difficulty of adding link-weights to the Python solution (which currently is the only <em>executable</em> implementation anyone has provided).

      </p>
      <p>
        You'll note that this solution which someone else already derived from Guido's original implementation requires several different kinds of dedicated data structures. These would all have to be re-implemented using SQL if you were going from the simple version to the complex version. If you had built the simple version in SQl (which you didn't because it was too hard) you would now have to re-write the whole lot again in SQl (which would be even harder). Thus the claim that tables, sql and databases make it easier to change things is shown to be bogus for any domains that require complex algorithms.

        ["Thus the claim that tables, sql and databases make it easier to change things is shown to be bogus for any domains that require complex algorithms." I'm not sure about that. Adding link weights involved 2 new tables, and an additional column to edges. It did require that the code itself be rewritten, but that was the case with the Python version too. And if I'd properly factored the code (which is possible in relational algebra, because of algebraic closure, but not in SQL), then large segments of it could probably have been reused.

      <p>
        Regardless, it's probably best not to argue further until we have a decent (i.e. non-SQL) relational language. Not having executable code allows one to get away with a great deal of fuzzy thinking (as I'm sure you've noticed), so the discussion has a way of going around in circles.

        I think we need to divide this up into two issues:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Data Structure: Competing with arrays and lists to do basic storage and retrieval of data.
        </li>
        <li>
           Behavior: Using relational languages to do some or all of the processing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think the first has been clearly established. Tables can easily store graphs. Agreed?
      </p>
      <p>
        The second point I already made, but it has been tossed asided for some reason. I never claimed that SQL or relational languages solve all processing all the time (I am not sure they even should). A possible failure of it to help significantly with this particular algorithm means very little. In actual work, the percentage of the behavior part that SQL solves varies widely. If SQL can't provide significant pre-processing, I simply write procedural code around simple Select statements. To get a better picture of what SQL can solve and can't solve we need more data points. Your example is only one point at best.

My point is that if one stays <em>only</em> in the relational/sql model then it becomes very, very, very difficult to express the algorithms that provide useful behaviour (after all data without behaviour is worthless.). Therefore relational isn't sufficient or general purpose because it must always be supplemented by something else. Just like OO isn't sufficient or general purpose because it must always be supplemented by something else. Namely imperative or functional paradigms.]

In "playground-speak", you ignored my example before I ignored yours. I gave you code to compare first. You finish mine, and <em>then</em> I'll finish yours. Otherwise, I will be tempted to accuse you of creating a different example to distract from the fact that you are afraid of the first one.

        [This is the first time you've mentioned challenge 6 in this conversation. This discussion emanated from the claim that tables were sufficient and general purpose data structures. My point has always been that tables are not enough. That you need the vast corpus of computer science to do anything useful and that automatically reaching for a relational solution to problems is unwise because no paradigm is always the best solution.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>"General purpose" and "always best solution" are not necessarily the same thing</strong>. General purpose may not even be possible in an absolute sense. See <a href="GeneralPurposeProgrammingLanguage.html">GeneralPurposeProgrammingLanguage</a>. If you take the absolutist version, then if dedicated structures were general purpose, people would not need RDBMS, ever! {That's not what general purpose means. It means that it can be used to solve any problem. Sometimes that means we can always, the computer science community, use dedicated data structures to build a tool (like an RDBMs) to solve pretty much any problem. We use bricks to build walls and use walls to build houses. We don't use walls to build bricks because that kind of <a href="AbstractionInversion.html">AbstractionInversion</a> is silly. Remember general purpose is only a starting point. Everything can be built out 1s and 0s but we don't use them directly.}

        Dijkstra was pretty good at such algorithms. It may require a relational-version of Dijkstra's mind to produce an acceptable relational version. I probably could not fathiom a procedural solution either without lots of past experience on such problems. YOU did not come up with the Dijkstra algorithm, so why do you expect me to come up with a relational version? Your "challenge" is rigged. <strong>Dijkstra did the hard work for you</strong>. I don't claim to be as smart as Dijkstra on graph problems, relational nor procedural. A nice relational version is still a possibility, but not likely from me. That does not mean that relational stinks because <strong>I couldn't do a procedural (dedicated struc) one quickly either. It is the nature of the problem, not a failing of relational</strong>. This appears to be an intimidation ploy. You are comparing smart apples to dumb oranges (WRT graph algs).

        You did not say which form would satisfy you because you seemed to focus more on SQL than the data container. Anyhow, the biggest problem I encounter in implementing that algorithm is figuring out how to read Python (if I mirror that version), and then finding a way to use recursion with tables. Most languages don't support pass-by-value tables. It can be emulated with a stack-like setup, but that gets kind of messy.

        For my domain as I experience it, tables are a Godsend. You can perhaps accuse me of over-extrapolating my experience in one niche to other niches, but inside is another thing. I *have* used dedicated structures multiple times where table engines were unavailable, poorly implemented, or not permitted. I see no magic in them. They are not change-friendly. I think the problem you encountered <strong>adding weights to your structure is indicative if this problem</strong>. If requirements rarely changed, dedicated structures (DS) may be indeed the way to go. But I see change left and right. That is the world I live in. If your world is different, I apologize for over-extrapolating into it and bothering you. There have been 3 demonstrations of change problems with DS here. I made a decent case WRT change-handling.
        If requirements don't change, perhaps tables are a little more code and a little slower. However, when requirements do change, they handle it better overall. (At least in my domain.{Which consists of building reports on top of databases. And for people whose domain consists only of building static web pages then html is the perfect language. Most of those at least have the sense not to advocate using HTML for everything.})

        Secondly that implementation used weights from the beginning so it did not <strong>adapt</strong> to weights. It had weights already. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I did not mean it that way. If it started out without weights, one only has to add a column to an existing table. This is compared to changing the container altogether (from list to map). The first approach does not require a change to existing data nor any existing algorithm that uses that data (assuming it won't need weights).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thirdly the actual working code that was provided adapted pretty well to the addition of weighting. The only thing missing was some kind of layer that provided encapsulation of the underlying data structure behind an interface. Hmm doesn't that sound like an object?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or a database. A database should be considered an interface, not an implementation.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Really? Is it Oracle? Is it MySQL? Is it MS-SQL? DB2? Postgres? Jet? A tab-delimited flat file? XML? An interface is typically used to hide this. This kind of algorithm shouldn't concern itself with explicit storage details, like which flavor of SQL syntax will work with the chosen tool, or what the magic incantation is to produce a connection to a data source.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is not always possible to map and wrap divergent interfaces one-to-one. Wrapping has limits. For one, interface A may assume a feature that implementation X simply does not support. It would be interesting to see your dedicated structure wrappers, by the way. I bet the more generic they become, the more they will resemble a table interface.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        True, not every implementation provides every feature. It's a question of priorities: for an app, what's more important, the feature or the flexibility? You can either code to the <a href="LowestCommonDenominator.html">LowestCommonDenominator</a>, or add CapabilityQuerys to the code, and hopefully, degrade gracefully.
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you define 'table interface'? If table interface == SQL, then the answer is no. If table interface == associative array of records, well, that's pretty generic, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you need for the algorithm? SQL's main strengths are aggregate queries (summations), relational queries (joins), and interesting subsets (complex WHERE). If the algorithm doesn't need those, then those features don't need to be in the interface. Specifically, these kinds of queries aren't likely to be needed by typical graph algorithms. SQL can't do a topological sort.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps not, but perhaps there are algorithms were it can do a large part of the work. Like I said many times, SQL and/or relational rarely do the entire job in applications I work on, but rather help out a lot with "pre-processing" kinds of stuff. How to do with with graph algorithms, I don't know at this point. I haven't done any since long ago in school, and am thus rusty.</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        The point about putting storage behind an interface is that this is <em>something that is likely to change.</em> Putting it behind an interface keeps this change from cascading through your code. For any particular app, if you're _certain_ it's not going to change, you can go ahead and code to a specific implementation - but in the long run, <em>you're probably wrong</em>.

        Relational thinking generally assumes that any given piece of information may be used by different tasks, people, departments, etc. in the future. Thus, it tries not to build data layouts that are coupled to any particular usage. In my domain this has been a smart assumption to make. (I won't speak for other domains, however; it gets me into trouble.) Future uses of a given piece of information may have nothing to do with graph algorithms. For a few hundred nodes I see no real problem with copying some info into maps and lists for processing, but this may not extrapolate to hundreds of millions of nodes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Database Views can be used to decouple layouts from usage. This point seems to me to be mixing levels of abstraction.</em>

        You do realize that we're talking about encapsulating <em>behaviour</em> behind an interface. Not encapsulating data storage. Graphs can be stored in a large number of ways but the relational model/SQL are not sufficiently expressive to implement the majority of the standard algorithms. The lesson to draw from this is that whilst relational is a good way to store data it's a poor way to express behaviour. Therefore in algorithmically sophisticated applications (i.e anything that requires recursion, graphs, deep maths, etc) databases are relegated to mere data storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd also like to point out that your usage of the word "interface" is unique. That's not what the rest of the world considers an interface. Please define how a database can be an interface? The rest of the world considers a database to be an implementation. Communicating with people who have unique and idiosyncratic definitions of common words is...challenging. Either they're ignorant of the standard definitions or they're iconoclasts who wish to obscure the shallowness of their ideas behind proprietary jargon.

        <em>Mathematical algorithms are already wonders of simplicity, that's what math is all about.

        I did once see an implementation of trees in Relational technology, it was quite impressive how he managed to get node insertion and searches implemented without a recursive query. As I recall, he put two numbers by each node. He counted depth-first, incrementing the count going both down and up, and put by each node both the down and up numbers. Thus he could tell with a simple query whether a needed node was below any given node (target node number between the query node numbers), and could insert using a collect and iterate rather than a recurse. Of course, this is a TREE not a GRAPH, but it was still interesting. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Some dialects of SQL have built-in tree-oriented operations. As far as I know, relational rules do not rule out the addition of tree operations, such as traversals starting from a given node.

        Here is a <a href="ColdFusionLanguage.html">ColdFusionLanguage</a> version of the algorithm that uses RAM tables and lists. I noticed that the Python version does not change the structure that stores the node info, so passing table copies repeatedly as variable/object parameters is not necessary to use essentially the same algorithm. The Python version essentially just queries a "global" (pass by ref) navigational structure, which can just as well be a relational table. (Note that Cold Fusion's internal table engine is a bit buggy because they hastily tried to strap a static-typed addon into a dynamically typed language, but the problems do not show here.)

        Here is an experimental <strong>non-recursive</strong>, non-list cursor-based <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> approach. I used to use similar techniques to traverse trees. Such a technique can be useful if a recursive search would fill up RAM so that one wants to use disk instead. (Note that RAM caching is normally used, so it is not "pure" disk.) Besides, it is easier to stop and re-start such a thing if using tables. This algorithm incrementally fills a work table with path segments, and uses the prior set of segment matches to find the next set and marks them to avoid revisiting them. In a way it emulates a recursive call stack. It does not currently work for invalid paths because it will get stuck in an infinite loop, but could probably be fixed by adding a "unique" check before copying in records from the data table. I couldn't find a way to do that in less than about 12 lines, so skipped it for now. The output could be made cleaner also.

        From the discussions above it seems that relational/set theories are formalized and proven methods that haven't or at least hadn't been fully implemented.  Whereas Object-Oriented techniques/heuristics don't seem to be based on any formal/proven (or even provable theories), but are being fully implemented.  Go figure.

        All the solutions presented here exceed in computational complexity Dijkstra's algorithm. None use a heap to extract the min (sorry a table is not a heap). Some do heinous cross products to get an adjacency list.
        The SQL given above will not terminate if there are cycles in the graph. See <a href="http://www.thescripts.com/forum/thread184469.html">http://www.thescripts.com/forum/thread184469.html</a>
