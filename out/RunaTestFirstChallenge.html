        Truth be told, this isn't even a <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>, it's just an idea sparked by the <a href="BillWakeTestFirstChallenge.html">BillWakeTestFirstChallenge</a>.

        A great way to get people involved in something new is to demonstrate how it's done, why it works, and what the benefits are. Hands-on is preferable.
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        Run a <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a> challenge among a few of your colleagues to get them familiar with the concept of having tests before they code. This will help them realize the benefits of having tests.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Start using tests on real projects to demonstrate that <em>coming up with the tests in the first place</em> isn't really that hard.
