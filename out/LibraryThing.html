        What would we do without the old-fashioned printed books? The kinds that are stored on bookshelves and placed in libraries.

        It is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> that Libraries exist since an individual has neither the space or the discretionary cash to buy every book which are on the reading list.

        While surfing today I discovered and <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a>d some information about libraries all over the world. One library thing I took note of in this search was called that, <a href="LibraryThing.html">LibraryThing</a>.

        It is a <a href="UserNamePassword.html">UserNamePassword</a> with <a href="FreeAndCostPrivilege.html">FreeAndCostPrivilege</a> site. It has the following SelectionsViaTabs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Home | Profile | Your books | Add books | Talk | Groups | Local | More | Zeitgeist 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is what I call a <a href="UserFriendlyMegaSite.html">UserFriendlyMegaSite</a>. It has many users from all over the world. It will be useful for all book, library, and collaborative tasks an individual or a team might want to utilize with regard to libraries and books.
