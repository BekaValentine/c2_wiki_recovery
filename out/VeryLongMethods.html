        Very Long Methods
      </h1>
      <p>
        Similar to <a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a>, but applied to programs written using <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen methods with more than 20 thousand lines (yes: 20000 = 2 * 10^4 lines).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What did these methods </em>do<em>?  Most programs don't even have 20,000 lines, why would you need a method that long?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To protect the innocent, I will just say that the method was the central masterpiece in a non <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> system used for message interchange. On the plus sie, it was a <a href="PluggableArchitecture.html">PluggableArchitecture</a>, so most functions could be plugged into it, the only problem was that since it was not <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>, the central masterpiece had to know all the plugged modules, meaning a high rate of coupling and a central function that was very easy to break. And it was touched on a daily basis, so getting a good build was not easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        An easy solution would be to use <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>. But transforming a 2*10^4 lines method into a well refactored <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> code is not easy.
