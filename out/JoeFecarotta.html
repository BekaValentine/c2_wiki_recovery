        Greetings. I am Computer Programmer, residing currently in beautiful Long Island, NY.  I am most comfortable with PHP and Java, among a dozen other web technologies I use daily. However, Computer Animation is my real passion.  Its unfortunate that there are still so few shops that do that sort of thing.
