        Facilitation Technique
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here are the things I remind myself to do when I am facilitating any
        group.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           don't show off -- you are there to convince them that they are smart, not that you are smart.
        </li>
        <li>
           look to who you want to speak -- also, know who needs to be heard and when
        </li>
        <li>
           let people think -- have them write alone, or discuss in pairs, before speaking to the group
        </li>
        <li>
           don't work too hard -- set easy goals and take breaks. brilliance will happen soon enough
        </li>
        <li>
           make a mental list of what you wish would happen -- revise it at each break
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There may be good books out there. The only thing that comes to my mind is <a href="NormKerth.html">NormKerth</a>'s book on <a href="ProjectRetrospectives.html">ProjectRetrospectives</a>, a specialized kind of workshop. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        IBM used to have a class in JointApplicationDesign (JAD) that taught very effective facilitation techniques.  They provided the book 'How to Make Meetings Work' by Michael Doyle and David Straus ISBN:0-515-09048-4 as part of the course materials.  I highly recommend it for anyone interested in facilitation. -- <a href="MarkAddleman.html">MarkAddleman</a>
