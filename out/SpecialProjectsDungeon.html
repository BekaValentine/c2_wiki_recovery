      <p>
        Where incompetent (or out-of-favor) managers get sent, often as a prelude to getting sacked.  (Though not always). 
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a common pattern (<a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>?) in industry when an upper-level manager is relieved of his/her duties (for poor performance or issues with the boss; see below), rather than being terminated directly he/she is assigned to run one or more "special projects"--some minor project activity usually of low importance to the company (otherwise the project would have a higher profile and not be given the label "special project"--it would be a full-fledged project on its own).  The assignment can serve several purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Gives the company time to decide what to do with the manager.  Another department may take the manager in to fill an opening.  (especially if the manager lost his/her previous post due to a conflict with his/her boss, rather than due to performance issues).  If no takers, then the manager gets the boot.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Provide a subtle hint to the employee that his opportunities for further advancement with the company are limited, and that if he/she wants to ClimbTheCorporateLadder he/she needs to do so elsewhere.  (See <a href="UpOrOut.html">UpOrOut</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Humiliate the manager in order to encourage her/her to resign voluntarily (rather than firing him/her and having to pay a settlement package). <em>This one can expose you to a constructive dismissal suit in the UK</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Give the manager one last chance to redeem themselves--if they successfully manage the special project (not always easy, given the low priority afforded to such projects) they might be given more responsibilities.  Otherwise, HastaLaVista.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that managers/employees who commit acts of misconduct generally aren't sent to the <a href="SpecialProjectsDungeon.html">SpecialProjectsDungeon</a>; they are just canned outright.
