      <p>
        Suggested Pattern for a New <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a> adding to this page: Read this page and <a href="WikiWikiBugsResolved.html">WikiWikiBugsResolved</a> before you write to it. Also check out <a href="WikiWikiSuggestions.html">WikiWikiSuggestions</a>; that bug you found might just be a feature request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes Wiki exhibits behavior that surprises us, and that may or may not be a bug. Try visiting <a href="WikiQuestions.html">WikiQuestions</a> to see if anyone else has seen the same behavior, or perhaps add your question if not.

        <em>Notes:</em> The indexing of this page has been improved to make it easier to find. Edit collisions note from Ward moved to <a href="EditConflictResolution.html">EditConflictResolution</a>. <a href="TooBigToEdit.html">TooBigToEdit</a> discusses the problem of editing large <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> pages with some browsers.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="VisualTour.html">VisualTour</a> seems to be broken, although that seems to be a problem with the server. It returns <em>Premature end of script headers: /home/north/cgi-bin/webdot.cgi</em> (randomly comes and goes)

        <li>
           Capitalized file extensions not recognized as images. <em>Should be easy to fix as well</em>

               The HTML page should start with a doctype. like <em><!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN"></em> (mandatory since HTML 2.0) (see "Why use a DOCTYPE?" <a href="http://www.alistapart.com/articles/doctype/">http://www.alistapart.com/articles/doctype/</a> )

            </li>
            <li>
               Blank lines are rendered as "<p></p>", which is rendered strangely by some browsers (Is it valid HTML?). I recommend using a HTML 4.01 doctype, then *never* emitting the end-paragraph (</p>) tag.
            </li>
            <li>
               most pages seem to have an unmatched closing <em></form></em>-tag.

           When an ISBN link is formed, a space may be generated after the ISBN number, and that space is usually included in the link (10/2001)

           The formatter for diff output doesn't appear to be <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>'d with the formatter for normal output. (<a href="DanglingLink.html">DanglingLink</a>s show with '?' links normally, but as normal links in the diff.)
        </li>

           Multiple indentation (e.g., for bullet points) is processed as one level of indentation fewer if it immediately follows a monospaced line, and the </pre> tag for the monospaced line follows the indented line, causing it to be monospaced as well. (28 Jul 2003, still there 2006/01/18)

        If you go to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki</a> it will display the content of <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a>. All the links work except the referer-based ones: <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s, <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a>, <a href="VisualTour.html">VisualTour</a>, etc. My suggestion for fixing this is to issue "301 Moved permanently" for any URL which resolves to Wiki content but !~ m{(www\.)?c2\.com/cgi/wiki\?.}i . The only side-effect I can think of would be to break access for people who are forced to do some strange form of munging to get past a firewall. (Yes I know the (www\.)? is redundant since the pattern isn't left anchored, but it serves to illustrate lack of prejudice against the alternative URL form.)

        <strong>Excess Spacing</strong>: <strong><p></p> in pre-formatted text</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This Wiki produces invalid HTML for some pages.
        Its handling of pre-formatted text is especially irritating.
      </p>
      <p>
        On page <a href="LongFunctionsDiscussion.html">LongFunctionsDiscussion</a>, someone noted "(Note that Mozilla displays too many blank lines in this example.)" and "visual spacing is a key element of this debate".
      </p>
      <p>
        We have some text that's already just the way we want it. The space character at the beginning of each line *should* tell the Wiki parser to leave it alone. In the middle of that text, there is a single blank line.

        The same thing happens with the <a href="KonquerorBrowser.html">KonquerorBrowser</a> too, so it isn't <em>just</em> a Mozilla/Netscape problem. In any case, I have a lot of difficulty thinking of any way to interpret the spec that would justify this behaviour. -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>by "this behavior", do you mean the allegedly invalid HTML that the </em><a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> is producing, or the strange inconsistencies between web browsers?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I certainly think this is a <em>minor</em> Wiki bug. But, it <em>is</em> a bug. <a href="http://validator.w3.org/">http://validator.w3.org/</a> is very good at telling you if your HTML is valid. By its standards, ordinary Wiki pages have a few problems, all of which, I think, should be fixed. If the code is available, I'd be happy to make the fixes myself. -- <a href="BruceAdams.html">BruceAdams</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I disagree that it is minor. It makes for some ugly-looking and sometimes confusing code samples and <a href="AsciiArt.html">AsciiArt</a>. Perhaps "medium" bug? Why do you rank it low? True, its not a show-stopper, but it's either uglied-up or made editing difficult for roughly 50 pages that I've read or participated in. It has a medium-low per-page impact, but it is a <strong>high-quantity</strong> bug. And, non-IE browsers are growing more common. I'd like to see the cost/benefit analysis compared to other wiki bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I noticed that people are altering their formatting habits apparently to work around this bug, resulting in non-WYSIWYG text in the edit view.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> 2 rendering suffers from this also.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems a re-formatting gnome is going around and "fixing" the spacing in the edit window, which breaks it in Mozilla-based browsers (showing excess space). They are probably using Internet Explorer and not realizing the impact of their spacing "fix".

        <strong><p></p> in non-pre-formatted text</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> uses <p></p> for the empty line between paragraphs. In <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a>, this is rendered as a line break, not an empty line. This makes all paragraphs run together. Readability suffers. -- <a href="RichardCyganiak.html">RichardCyganiak</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And there is no real reason. You could put <P> into the header, </P> into the footer, and <P> or even </P><P> in place of a blank line.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Recent versions of <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a> (checked with 7.02) render <p></p> as an empty line, solving this problem. However, marking up paragraph breaks as <p></p> is still a bad idea. -- <a href="RichardCyganiak.html">RichardCyganiak</a>
      </p>
      <p>

Mac sends CR, windows sends CRLF, and unix sends LF for line ends in this embedded text (while the HTTP request as a whole is only supposed to use CRLF, your submission is often encoded and thus the original macness shines through).

        Jan 2, 2004: Is this a bug? Or am I doing something wrong? I haven't seen this before. I attempted to edit <a href="AutomaticLocking.html">AutomaticLocking</a> the ordinary (and only) way, and when it was saved, all the whitespace was encoded, and all the formatting characters were treated literally. It was like the cgi output from the form submission was not processed. This happened only in a recent version of Mozilla for Linux, and not Firebird. I was able to fix the damage (when others didn't get to it first) by using Firebird. I hope this edit works okay now.
