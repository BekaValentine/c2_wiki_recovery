        Chauncy Gardener
      </h1>
      <p>
        Peter Seller's character in the film "Being There".  A simple minded gardener who accidentally becomes the confidant and advisor to major political figures who mistake his simple gardening references ("after the winter, there is the spring"), for major political/economic insight and wisdom.  Illustrates the danger of simply stated methodologies being elevated to quasi-religious status.  Shows how the meaning of simple statements is in the mind of the listener, not the speaker.

        <em>Simple minded gardener</em> is what I first thought, but at the end of the movie, as Chauncy Gardener is walking on the water, and demonstrates the depth of the water, he appears to look back at the viewer with a very subtle smile on his face.  The phrase <em>childlike not childish</em> comes to mind.

        I believe also this was Peter Seller's last movie before he died.

        <em>Agree.  I believe this to be his finest work.</em>
