        A bridge produced by JavaSoft that allows COM enabled client software to access Java objects as COM objects through an IDispatch interface. You can download an early access version of the software here: <a href="http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/j2eecas/">http://developer.java.sun.com/developer/earlyAccess/j2eecas/</a>

        The API is very simple and will become simpler. There is built-in support for accessing <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> servers and talking to <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a>. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        From a quick and informal glance over the ComToJavaBridges out there, I got the impression that Linar's J-Integra (<a href="http://www.linar.com/)">http://www.linar.com/)</a> could also access custom COM interfaces, incredible as it may sound. I might be mistaken, however.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I used J-Integra to access the MSFT media encoder from a java application. Basically, if you have a typelib or some way to get the interfaces for a COM object then J-Integra can generate the bridge classes. Note that by default it uses DCOM, meaning you could have your Java app running on any platform with a supported JVM and access COM services on a windows machine. The most recent version includes a Java-to-Native DLL which allows direct COM access. It works pretty well. -- </em><a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a><em></em>

           Will there be any plans for J2EE CAS to support custom interfaces? Is this even possible, or should we just give up hoping?

        Is there a more light-weight <em>just</em> COM/RMI bridge?

        Are there any SunJava compatible packages for reading/writing to the Window's Registry?

      <p>
        The above question could be rephrased as 'Are there any COM objects for reading/writing to the Window's Registry?'?

        (Hint: there are. Have a hunt around on <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com.)">http://msdn.microsoft.com.)</a>

      <p>
        Then add J-Integra or <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>'s stuff and hey presto! Instant registry access.

        This of course raises the question: If JavaSoft are now producing an easy-to-use bridge to native code, why did Sun raise such a fuss about J/Direct?

        Sun certainly raised a fuss, but I don't believe they ever complained about J/Direct. A press release describing Sun's suit against Microsoft can be found at <a href="http://www.sun.com/announcement/.">http://www.sun.com/announcement/.</a> Note that the press release makes absolutely no mention of J/Direct or Java/COM. Sun most definitely did want Microsoft to support JNI, and in fact Microsoft ultimately had to in response to a court order (see <a href="http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-337703.html).">http://news.cnet.com/news/0-1003-200-337703.html).</a> On the other hand, they did not have to remove J/Direct and Java/COM.

        Bull. I don't care what the press release says. I know people that were involved in the direct negotiations and Sun would NOT allow COM support in Java which <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> offered to Sun FOR FREE. They also were incensed about J/Direct. They made their bed. Now they live in it. If they had LET <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> participate in the Java process like every other company their WOULD NOT BE A <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>. Now we will see <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> crush them and I'll be the first one cheering.

        There's a difference between making COM a part of the Java standard and Sun allowing Microsoft to provide COM support in the MS JVM as an extension above and beyond the Java standard. The press release seems to imply that Sun would have allowed the latter even if they outright rejected adopting COM as part of the standard as Sam says. Of course, maybe Sun really was trying to force MS to remove J/Direct and Java/COM from their JVM. All I'm saying is that Sun never said that publicly. So to get back to the original point, Sun's current effort to provide COM support is not an about-face from what they've said publicly, even if it is an about-face from what Sun told Microsoft privately (as it appears to me, anyway).
