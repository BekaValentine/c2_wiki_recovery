        Is Recent Posts Broken
      </h1>
      <p>
        Moved from IsThePostsFeatureBroken:

      <p>
        It seems like the <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> feature isn't working.
        Admittedly when it was introduced three years ago
        it was said to be temporary. Maybe it really was.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, is it broken, or has it been withdrawn?
      </p>

      <code>
        Not Found<br/>
        The requested URL /cgi/posts was not found on this server.<br/>

      <p>
        Looks broken to me.
