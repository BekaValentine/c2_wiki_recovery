        This technique is used in conjunction with shared editing of a common file (usually text based). The environment is a conference call between two or more parties and some access to a shared file via a network connection.  This is a cheap imitation of an actual shared resource.

        <li>
           "Refresh" / "Reload" is used by the scribe party to inform others to reload the file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Additionally, if the parties on the call are good enough, editing responsibilities might switch from one party to another.  This really requires that the parties shifting editing (scribe) responsibilities know their tools and that the tools PlayWellTogether.

        EMACS is my tool of choice for editing and allows a "tail -f" type of functionality with auto-revert-mode.  --FrotzFaatuai
