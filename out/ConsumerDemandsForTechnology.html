        Consumer Demands For Technology
      </h1>
      <p>
        Computer games are important for the hardware industry. Consumers don't buy new, more-powerful computers for business or Internet apps - they buy them to run the newest hardware-intensive games.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, corporations used to buy new, more-powerful computers whenever the new version of Windows came out. This created a boom-bust cycle which drove the entire industry. Of course, it was extremely expensive, so many corporations have now learned to stop doing that. I think the cycle has broken.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        True for corporations, but consumers don't care much about Windows upgrades.  They care about games, e-mail, and porn.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And email is driving ever smaller networked devices. So what's porn driving?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which networked devices are you referring to?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Beepers, cell phones and the like.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Porn would be driving home-broadband, except that for most consumers, home-broadband isn't that responsive to consumer demand, being locked up in the hands of lazy State monopolies or corporate monopolies. I wonder if data storage companies have been getting into lobbying for more home-broadband: More home DSL -> More downloaded porn DivX ;) -> More people buying spare hard drives ...
