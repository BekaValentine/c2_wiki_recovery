        There hasn't been a <a href="CategoryProblem.html">CategoryProblem</a> here before.  There are some pages which can go into it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please please don't introduce categories without actually adding it to some pages. Sure there are pages but where? 
      </p>
      <p>
        [In some sense that is the <a href="CategoryProblem.html">CategoryProblem</a>, in that it takes time to do the catchup and get the pages into a category. Before that can happen someone comes along and says why hasn't it happened yet. GiveSomeoneaBreak. I think there is an <a href="ImpatienceProblem.html">ImpatienceProblem</a> on this wiki.]

        <em>At the moment, there are fifteen other pages in this category, not including </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.  Click on this page's title to see them.<em></em>

        Surely, one more category is going to break and overload the Wiki software... sheesh... <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> can handle it, and Wiki can use it.  I say go for it.
