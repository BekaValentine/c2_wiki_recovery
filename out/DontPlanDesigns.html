        Now this one is dedicated to the phasists all over.<br/>
        Remember the words of your crucial infotainer.<br/>
        When I say: I do not document I only test, code, and refactor.<br/>

        When on the town or with my team I am de newbie and de mentor.<br/>
        Me notebook overflows with all de Unitary Testors.<br/>
        If testing business was de school then I will be de principle.<br/>
        If a bike I be de rider; if a SegWay gyroscopical.<br/>
        But if testing was religion then I would be sayin' bye bye.<br/>
        So I push on de Test Button den I push all'ya say Go Try.<br/>
        But fun and joke aside I increment de serious matter,<br/>
        And dedicate this style to each and every phasist writer.<br/>

        Me offspring learned to talk and then I pair with her on homework.<br/>
        Hijita look up and she said:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        "Dad me glad that you refactor.<br/>
        For swapping code within constraints drop to de rest state proper.<br/>
        Now I can read de words you write so don't describe what's in the future."<br/>

        To languages dynamic I now turnin' my attention.<br/>
        I mock all of their layers but don't take no mock objections.<br/>
        I solve them for de simple case den solve all de projections.<br/>
        I do not guess de business space but bless dem with solutions.<br/>
        I also got a lot to read in alla my fine testing fixtures.<br/>
        Dat's why I do not document I only comment on de mixtures.<br/>

        One day I had to catch a plane from County Orange to Dallas.<br/>
        Sat down upon my seat and found me next to de White Collar.<br/>
        With perfect hair and suit he looked just like de robber baron.<br/>
        He sat down next to me in his right hand he had a Barrons.<br/>
        But I don't judge appearance I just pair and check de grammar.<br/>
        So introduced myself to him as Mr. Phlip Programmer.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <spoken><br/>
        [He say,] "Nice to meet you, I'm an architect, <br/>
        And I direct big teams of coders.<br/>
        I've heard your name online before, but I just can't remember.<br/>
        But anyway I'm very very very glad to meet ya.<br/>
        And I've got a plan it's wrote by hand<br/>
        Now can you code it for ten grand?"<br/>
        </spoken><br/>

        I looked upon the tray and saw hardcopy with de diagrams.<br/>
        Inside de diagrams I saw de boxes and de arrows.<br/>
        Me asked: What it do for you? It give you strength and power?<br/>
        Now everyone I want you to hear the way White Collar answered:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        "I give it to my teams and then they type in my designs.<br/>
        Coding night and day 'til they go out of their minds.<br/>
        Mushroom treat executives; the schedule's refined.<br/>
        No matter what they do my ass is not on the line!<br/>
        If you can read the UML I'l hire you this time.<br/>
        You'l find typing my design will not require your mind!"<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        But I took the paper threw it right inside the snack cart trash slot.<br/>
        Said tell me the requirements in de order that you got.<br/>
        Open up my notebook and I wrote de test dat passed not.<br/>
        Wrote de code dat passed and den I checked out that it smelled not.<br/>
        Present it and White Collar see how fast I done dat feature.<br/>
        "But my next feature's gonna change things then you got no architecture."<br/>
        "Change is my design," I say, "one more change is in its nature.<br/>
        Each change just makes me faster if each time I will refactor."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        [He say,] "You won't know what you will get <br/>
        until you'r done all of the effort."<br/>
        I say, "So pair and you take care with all de comments proper."<br/>
        But fun and joke aside I increment de serious matter,<br/>
        If new pairs find a better way to upgrade it they'r required.<br/>
        You document all day you'l hit de moving target never.<br/>
        After going with de flow we know you'l find no system's better,<br/>
        Why we do not document we only test code and refactor!<br/>
