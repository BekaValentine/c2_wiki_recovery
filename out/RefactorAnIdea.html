        Refactor An Idea
      </h1>

        Can you <a href="RefactorAnIdea.html">RefactorAnIdea</a>?? -- <a href="ErikMeade.html">ErikMeade</a>

        Well, refactoring technically means changing the representation of a system without changing the meaning; so, the answer is yes, as all thoughts are expressions in a language. Most languages are flexible enough that you can reform a string of symbols into a semantically equivalent but different phrasing.

        Individual ideas are like Platonic forms with finite temporal extent.

        (In fact, I personally think that OO is a lot like the Platonic ideal world; this could be related to <a href="SoftwarePlatonism.html">SoftwarePlatonism</a>?)

        They exist in a sort of different space.

        You cannot alter an idea. You can create new ideas by expressing them for the first time and you can destroy ideas by losing all representations of that idea. Altering an idea merely creates a new idea. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I think that refactoring ideas could mean taking an idea, simplify it and combine it with something else, and, voila, new idea. I guess this process happens a lot.
