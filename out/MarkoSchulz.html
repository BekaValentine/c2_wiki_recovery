        On <a href="DanBarlow.html">DanBarlow</a>'s page I found the following text, which I like to adopt:
        <em>I (often) sign my contributions. This is to declare culpability, not to claim immutability. Edit what you want to edit, remove my signature if it's no longer appropriate.</em> I guess, that makes me an <a href="OpenAuthor.html">OpenAuthor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I even would like to urge you to edit my contribution. I know that quite often I do make mistakes (especially in spelling, punctuation and grammar, since English is not my native language) and all the other people on wiki together know so much more than I do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki would be worse without all those <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s lurking in the niches.

        Sometime ago I read an article in which <a href="StevenFeuerstein.html">StevenFeuerstein</a> explains why he started to use controversial examples including political statments in his books: <a href="http://www.ora.com/news/feuerstein_1000.html.">http://www.ora.com/news/feuerstein_1000.html.</a> This was a real eye-opener to me. It is an illusion, that a discussion/wiki/article can be purely technical and absolutely apolitical. It is already hard to try to stay neutral, but it is impossible to be totally apolitical.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OTOH, would people still fawn over Feuerstein's thesis if his examples had been on the other side of the spectrum?</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thanks for sharing this article - it's great ! both Feuerstein's explanations, and the comments that followed.</em> -- <a href="LaurentSteffan.html">LaurentSteffan</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the opinion that political issues should be kept totally out of (technical) texts contains its share of responsibility for why people are so sullen on politics: They are taught to keep political thinking out of their life.
      </p>

        <em>I will eventually move this note to another page (if you want to do it for me: go ahead). It just came to my mind and I scribbled it down here, so that it won't get lost.</em>
