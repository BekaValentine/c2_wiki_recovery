        About Sister Sites
      </h1>
      <p>
        This approach to <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> linking was proposed by <a href="StevenBlack.html">StevenBlack</a>. A wiki server polls other sites for their current list of page names. It saves these results and examines them along with queries to its own database. There are two important queries ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           on page retrieval -- do the other sites offer the same page?
        </li>
        <li>
           on <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> formatting -- does any site define this link?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An expected link might not appear for several reasons ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A site might not offer all of its page names
        </li>
        <li>
           A name may be newer than the most recent poll
        </li>
        <li>
           A remote name might not meet the local name formation rules
        </li>
        <li>
           A site might be down or unreachable at the time of polling
        </li>
        <li>
           There might be bugs in the local name query mechanism (which seems to be the case at present)
        </li>
      </ul>

        See also the <a href="MetaWikiSearchEngine.html">MetaWikiSearchEngine</a>, a multiwiki title search that you can use to implement <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a> (aka <a href="TwinPages.html">TwinPages</a>) easily. The <a href="MetaWikiSearchEngine.html">MetaWikiSearchEngine</a> canonicalizes the page names so it matches pages that only slightly differ. e.g. <a href="http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl?twin=categoryhomepage.">http://sunir.org/apps/meta.pl?twin=categoryhomepage.</a>

        How about more stringent rules about what a topic is called. For instance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           separate the verb from the noun
        </li>
        <li>
           always quote the noun first
        </li>
        <li>
           match on the noun even if the verb does not exist
        </li>
        <li>
           restrict the number of verbs
        </li>
      </ul>

        It's too hard to enforce these semantic rules using the simple technology. Moreover, this doesn't solve the fundamental problem that at best 10% of pages, and in reality more like 1%, find matches across all the wikis. This is probably a good thing. It indicates a good factoring of topics across wikis. Overlap suggests overcompetition. But then again, sparsity indicates overfitting. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        <em>Is there any particular reason that Wiki is only polling six </em><a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>? Is this due to technical limitations? Or is it more of a design decision to not link to every one of the huge list under <a href="PublicWikiForums.html">PublicWikiForums</a>?<em></em>

        Currently, all our sister sites are sites that have spun out of this wiki with my cooperation. I'm open to other policies, though this one has worked well so far. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        The <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a> and <a href="TwinPage.html">TwinPage</a> - relation suggests by its underlying metaphor, it should be a symmetric one. So the author is looking forward to reciprocity, i.e. each page in forum A that has a nonempty twin in forum B should have a <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>. I'm very astonished, that e.g. on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, there are links to the Twin Pages of <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>, but not (yet) backlinks to Recent Changes here. Even "Empty Twin Coupling" could be helpful to support WikiWeaving. As an example for this take the entry WikiWeaving. When writing this, it is not yet defined in <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, i.e. it is an (nonexistent) empty page, but has an entry in the <a href="SisterSite.html">SisterSite</a> at <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a>, so it would be helpful for WikiWeaving to present in the edit form page an option list, showing all nonempty remote twin pages. As the different <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a> all have their special focus, the reader/writer could choose the adequate one (focus on community building, or programming concepts, general philosophy etc.). -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>

      <p>
        The new version of the <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> script has a link called "Search <a href="MetaWiki.html">MetaWiki</a>" that will find twin pages across all index wikis. I decided to go this route instead of listing the links directly because the output from <a href="MetaWiki.html">MetaWiki</a> is potentially complex. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        If <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is taking applications for additional <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>, may I heartily recommend <a href="BookShelved.html">BookShelved</a>?

        <em>Excerpts from a conversation regarding mapping Fitnesse into fit.c2.com wiki. ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Fitnesse is a hierarchical wiki, which means that each page can be the parent of a flat wiki. We use the hierarchy to organize different classpaths and variables for different test suites. -- <a href="BobMartin.html">BobMartin</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure the hierarchy is an asset, especially when in a classroom environment where many people are doing the same thing and need to keep their work separate. I love hierarchy and find the discovery of effective hierarchy (as in classes or directories) rewarding.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought I'd mention why I don't do hierarchy on my wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        I see wiki as a place where people work out the names of things that they will say. Since our spoken vocabulary is small, we must struggle to find words that carry value commensurate with the space they consume in our brains. Where works collide in wiki they will also collide in our thoughts. Usually that is a happy circumstance. Still, we often establish the context of a conversation so as to avoid or at least disambiguate many of these collisions. The analogy of this I've chosen for wiki is <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>. Two sites are candidates to be sisters if the collisions in their vocabulary are likely to be useful. As a sister, you should feel just the right amount of pressure to call a thing that we share by the same names. It is a subtle thing, but very powerful when scaled. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        How about adding a couple of one-way links to, say, <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> and <a href="BookShelved.html">BookShelved</a>, and calling those a HalfSisterSite or perhaps a SecondCousinTwiceRemovedSite? That way, perhaps, some of the <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> discussion can move there, instead of having a JimiHendrix page created here just because someone smashed his name together. It could be a first step in pushing some of the material there. -- <a href="AalbertTorsius.html">AalbertTorsius</a>
