        I am currently (as of 10:12 AM EST Mar 25 2000) a college student at University of Florida. I've also slowly been absorbed into being project lead on a rather large software project, so I've learned quickly the wrong way to do things. :)

        So I'm interested in the right way of doing things, which is why I'm looking at the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> archive. Seems cool so far, although presently while I understand the importance of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, I have been too lazy to write them :)
