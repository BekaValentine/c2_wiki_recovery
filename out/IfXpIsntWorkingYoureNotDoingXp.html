        Frequently, someone will volunteer his experiences with <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, and conclude that it (or some part of it) doesn't work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since many of the XP practices depend on other XP practices, it's legitimate to ask: "Were you doing all of XP when you had this experience of failure?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Some readers mistake this response for the (unfair) response: "If XP isn't working, you're not doing XP." This clearly has problems, since it excludes any possible evidence against XP (the <a href="DogmaticFallacy.html">DogmaticFallacy</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        So when you see an exchange like this, try to carefully figure out what's being said, and respond appropriately.

        It's difficult to see how the question "Were you doing all of XP when you had this experience of failure?" is a more legitimate response. It seems like <a href="WeaselWords.html">WeaselWords</a> actually, to raise the idea by implication that the failure would not have happened if the person was doing all of XP. It is also raises the presumptive association that the person was NOT doing all of XP, or the question would not need to be asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact I was just reading something in <a href="ProgrammersStone.html">ProgrammersStone</a> apropos this, in the example of auditors (in an ISO9001 environment) going around looking for problems, and assuming when problems are found it is the individual's error in following the process that caused the failure, but the presumptive condition is that the process itself is flawless.
      </p>
      <p>
        In reversing the assumptions one comes up with a curiously dismissive result: The person experienced failure. The person was doing all of XP. Many XP practices depend on other XP practices. The failure in one area, <em>by virtue of those very dependencies</em>, is a failure of all of XP. Ergo, to save XP, it must be asserted that if XP isn't working, you're not doing XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note - <em>either</em> extreme is flawed to the point of being downright silly. I would like very much to discuss XP without the requirement that there is either "only doing all of XP succeeds" or "XP fails as a whole"

        I'm one of the people who asks "were you doing x" when you thought you were doing XP and had trouble. Here's a real example.
      </p>
      <p>
        I visited an XP team who were writing lots of tests, and doing refactoring, trying to keep their design simple. There was just one little problem area: they weren't getting stories from their customer (though they were getting requests), they didn't have a release plan, and they didn't know their velocity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I think there is big potential trouble here. The reason is what I call the Circle of Life (see my chapter of the same name), where the customer defines what has value, the team estimates the cost, the customer chooses value based on cost, and the team does it. In shorter terms: these guys aren't focused as much as I'd like on keeping the customer satisfied.
      </p>
      <p>
        If they were to get in trouble, would it be a problem with XP, or with the execution, or something altogether? I think it would be unfair to blame XP, and at least a possibility that the execution was the problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        When any project goes off the rails, the best way to learn is to do a retrospective inquiry into what happened. If the team was following a defined process, part of that inquiry should - I think - find out how well they followed it. Whether they followed the process perfectly or not, there's information to be had there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every process can be improved, and every team's execution of their process can be improved. When things go wrong, I'd like to know why. And I'd like for the process to take the heat for its flaws, and the execution to take the heat where that's appropriate. 
      </p>

      <p>
        No seems spot on to me, but problems arise. To fair and balanced we must then also ask every person every time they claim, 'Xp worked for me', did you do All of Xp all of the time for all of the project. If this is not true then it is not fair to complement Xp for all of the result. Perhaps this project was saved from failure by the deviations. 
        See paper tiger alert below for an example of how absurd this seems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not only that but to be impartial we must also ask what else did you do that is neither required nor prohibited by Xp. For example on another page Kent has said anecdotally that when 'he' did refactoring the result was code that was 'radically decoupled'. Is this an attribute of Kent or the process. I know where I would place my bet if I was asked to decided is it easier to 'use the process and get coupled code', or to 'use any process at all and get Kent to write coupled code'. (I dare him to deny it :) If it an attribute of the Xp process that I have read about that code winds up radically decoupled then I am not sure how it happens. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It has always concerned me that a combination (perhaps an over-zealous one) of YAGNI and the simplest thing that could possibly work would wind up in code that was hopelessly coupled, because after all you are not going to need the flexibility provided by decoupled code (literally YAGNI). The <a href="SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> and satisfy the current set of user stories is always coupled code. If however the primary user story, which most users don't even know they have (so we have to write it) is, "We (the users) are going to radically change our minds, add new features, redefine old ones and then delete them." Then suddenly radically decoupled code is an 'you are going to need it' (YAGNI!). When I build I project I measure my safety (lack of design smell) by the number of decisions I have not made yet, and the number of very YAGNI what ifs that still have obvious easy answers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Code for me smells for pretty much exactly one reason. I try to change it and find it difficult. It is usually hard because of decoupled effects in the code and thus there are mysterious and non-local effects. Change here break there. Arrg. To produce decoupled code, my story (not the users), I need to make encapsulated objects that each fulfil all of a responsibility. The 'all' is important, When its easy I sometimes add stuff I don't need yet because clearly it belongs there. (Eg an unused accessor, All of the C++ abstraction to make this smart pointer behave like a real pointer, All of the std stl accessors to this hash table, just like other standard containers) Why? <a href="PrincipleOfLeastSurprise.html">PrincipleOfLeastSurprise</a> and it's easy. I now can write in 25 words or less. 'hashTable works a lot like std::Map but accesses data in constant instead of log time. Beware the iterators are a bit different.'
      </p>
      <p>
        If it is harder, I may add a commented out function prototype. If its non obvious and harder I will also write a comment saying how to do it. Do these violate YAGNI or not? so far I can't tell, do I do Xp will I ever do Xp, am I good husband? I suppose the answers depend on whether the project succeeds and whether or not my wife leaves me!
      </p>
      <p>
        To wait for this however is too late as the inability to change code indicates that it smelt last time you wrote it. To tell if the code I have just written smells I apply the same test but as a thought experiment. What if those YAGNI features become critical must haves? Can I still do them easily and with contained changes. If not the code probably smells enough to fix it now. Have I violated YAGNI or fixed smelly (not radically decoupled) code?
        Are the undoubtedly clever and talented proponents of Xp who describe it successes actually describing the properties of Xp or the properties of Xp plus their own expertise, or perhaps even the properties of their own expertise despite Xp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open Question: Are there ANY <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s that do not break tests and do not make code hard to change, that are worth fixing. If so where is the payoff to the customer?
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem also is that if we only evaluate the cases where all of Xp has been done and compare it with the cases where none or not all of Xp has been done then the quality of the staff involved is likely to differ markedly (IMO).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is however also true that detractors (Anti Zealots) will turn up from time to time with paper tigers and say 'We tried pair programming and it failed miserably'. A suitable response that avoids the classic 'but did you do all of Xp' is the more open question that simply asks them 'to describe all of the process they used, and in what way it failed'. If the answer is that 'I and George wrote this really nifty task scheduler and a couple of newbies on the team changed it and broke it irreversibly.' Then several obvious questions about unit tests and source code control exist. The best way in my experience to deal with most zealots of all flavours is to let out enough of the right kind of rope and have them shoot themselves foot.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get real and really evaluate Xp is not going to happen. To do that we would need real experimental settings, real projects, real users, real development teams all times N so that we would get statistically significant results that control for the effects of 1 really good coach. 1 Type of real world problem, especially suited(or not) to XP, and so on ad infinitum. Experimental psychology and in this case Sociology is really really hard to get right, It is harder than writing bug free code!
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand IMHO:
      </p>
      <p>
        It is inconceivable, to me, that adding some more <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to most projects would not make things (much) better. No other Xp changes required. Turning just that knob up from 1 to 2 should make things better. If it does not it would take serious explaining why it only works when you get to Xp's 11 and then it only works if you also do everything else.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other rules such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           do not expect to turn up <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> and get anything other than chaos unless the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> knob is already fairly high.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           do not expect to radically refactor a dinosaur without the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to catch you when you fall. (You will fall; I have the bruises.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other than some reasonably self evident rules (eg above), that proponents and experienced practitioners of Xp, must know; As knobs are continuously turned from 1 to 11 things should get better.
        I expect there to actually be a law of diminishing returns. I believe Kent has even suggested to one group they had too many tests! So in fact to find where 11 is we need to keep turning up the knobs until it stops getting better.

        "Not working" seems rather vague. Anyone critiquing a software process (but to be fair, its outcomes really) ought to be able to say something more specific than "it's not working". Is the functionality poor? Is the code hard to maintain? Are schedules being missed? Is management unhappy? What?

        Asking 'were you doing x?' is subtly but importantly different from 'were you doing all of XP?', in that it doesn't insinuate that the failure is tied to XP being all-or-nothing.

        Throw in a Klieg light, a riding crop, and a cheesy German accent, and I'd agree with you. You can ask just about any question rhetorically, to score debating points.
      </p>
      <p>
        But on Wiki, it's not asked rhetorically, and the questioners listen to the answers. They're interested in finding any problems with XP and fixing them.
        It's not a debate; it's a tech-support call.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for implications and presumptions: well, the person asked gets to respond, which then trumps any implications or presumptions with their actual experience.
        For example, "Yes, I was doing all of XP." So now the XP proponents have a useful case where XP didn't work, and can bang on XP until either it will work in that case, or it's flagged as not working in that area.

        Has anyone who has stated "XP didn't work for us" actually been able to claim they've been following the principles and practices?
      </p>
      <p>
        For my reading of the XP mailing list and newsgroup, the most vehement claims of "XP didn't work" described situations where XP was clearly not being used. In particular, it appears that testing, iterative development, refactoring, on-site customer, and the Planning Game were all neglected.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question "Did you follow all of the XP practices?" is quite a natural one to ask when the vast majority of claims that XP didn't work seem to have come from environments where the XP practices were _not_ followed. -- <a href="RobertWatkins.html">RobertWatkins</a>

      <p>
        A related question is whether or not XP is falsifiable (in the sense that one can construct an experiment which, upon giving a certain result, would show that XP-as-stated is false). In general, people seem to want to justify or refute methodologies by anecdote, which leads to semi-absurd debates like those discussed above. However, before you can really get into the issue you need a formal statement of XP's claims which is falsifiable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples of non-falsifiable doctrines include most if not all religions, Marxism (Leninism, Stalinism...), and psychotherapy as outlined by Freud. They have the peculiar characteristic that their adherents can never be proven wrong; I have met Leninists who insist that "true" Leninism has never really been tried, and that the failure of Leninism in any given country is proof that they were not practicing true Leninism. ;)

        Here's a hypothetical experiment to test XP versus some other methodology. (It would cost a tonne of money to do, but it is theoretically possible to verify the validity of any methodology this way.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Prerequisites: Clearly define the two methodologies in terms of practices and measure the degree to which those practices are followed. Clearly define the meaning of 'project success'. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Start N projects with XP and another N projects with some other baseline methodology. The greater the N, the greater the accuracy of the experiment. The more closely related the projects are, the greater the confidence in the results. Ideally, each of the N projects done by XP would be the same as one of the N projects of the other methodology (i.e. the same project would be cloned and tried with each methodology). Complete all of the projects and compare the results. Measure such things as cost, number of features, customer satisfaction, developer satisfaction, the project's success in the market, amount of reuse, etc. I'm not actually an expert in this field, so I'm just making up measurements as I think of them. If XP succeeds more than the other methodology, based on the prerequisite definitions, then XP has been validated. If it succeeds less often, then it has been 'falsified'. -- <a href="RobHarwood.html">RobHarwood</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        As seen in some forums, and most recently on Slash, the XP version goes, we tried XP and it failed; if you ask <em>whether</em> what we tried was indeed XP and not a different set of practices arbitrarily termed "XP" by whoever was responsible for imposing them, then you must be guilty of unfalsifiability.
      </p>
      <p>
        To counter the argument, it should be sufficient to point out that there is a difference between saying <em>"we tried XP and it failed"</em> and saying <em>"our coding pairs tried having complete UT and AT coverage of a collectively maintained system described by a simple metaphor and constantly refactored to its simplest expression, frequently integrated and released to a maximally available customer, all the while having fun and not doing much overtime, and it failed"</em>. -- <a href="LaurentBossavit.html">LaurentBossavit</a>

        First off, I'm not a member of the anti-XP brigade - I am actually using XP (or so I think!) in my current project and am happy so far. But no, it's not sufficient to restate things like that, because the more specific criteria are all still open to subjective judgement and are not precisely enough stated to make XP falsifiable (one could plausibly doubt whether or not a team's metaphor was simple enough, its refactoring constant enough, etc., since these aren't really precisely quantified).
      </p>
      <p>
        Large-scale studies as suggested above would have the same problem of imprecise definitions. For what it's worth, I suspect that most if not all methodologies are not falsifiable either and so should be considered on par with religions. ;)

        Great James you are just what I need. Are 'you' doing all of Xp? To speed the conversation up, I will ask a directed question to which I can guess the answer, do you have a full time on site customer and did they write (not agree to) the <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        If not then I have an explanation of why your positive experience with Xp is a mere artefact of you not doing all of Xp. If you had insisted on doing 'All of Xp' then your project like many others would almost certainly fail!!!
      </p>
      <p>
        Why? Because with the current level of knowledge about Xp in the user community most attempts to use all of Xp will either fail to use all of Xp or fail to get off the starting blocks when the programming team insists the customer play all of their role.

        I believe the comment about imprecise definitions is an extremely valid one and should not be so lightly dismissed. On one hand we are told it is required to do all practices, but when someone asks how to do the practices, the answer is go figure it out yourself. Most of the practices of XP are described in a highly subjective manner hiding the intentions. This level of imprecision leads many to conclude that XP is just glorified hacking, and frustrates those of us who are trying to gain an understanding. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

If someone disagrees with the definition, they can always do their own study and define XP the way they want. It's not perfect, but that's how it works.

        Ever since the conception of XP, I've disagreed with the fact that you need to do all 12 for it to be XP. And I disagree that attempting to apply all 12 practices and failing (whether your project succeeds or not) means it isn't XP. I respect that you guys have such strong conviction about this, but I think it will hinder XP's ability to be successfully adopted, especially by your standards.
      </p>
      <p>
        If XP was positioned more as a reference model for an adaptable pool of interacting practices, then I think it would become more ubiquitous in the software development community. By your standards, I've never done XP in the twelve years I've been in the business. By my standards, I've done it in many of my engagements. (By <em>done</em>, I mean that I've used a subset of XP's practices.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In closing, what do you think I should do now? Should I stop telling people I do XP, since I'll never be legit in your book? If I succeed by using a subset of the practices, what value is there in disqualifying me from the official XP seal of approval? Gee, I feel like the duck in those AFLAC commercials ;-)

        XP is being born into a rough neighborhood, so it needs its hard shell for the moment. Adults who know that rules can be broken may, of course, break them.

        Clearly, everyone merely can <em>attempt</em> to do XP.

        <em>In the "don't grok XP" and "partially XP" failure cases, there are responses from people who do grok XP which, if you interpret them </em>'as if they were<strong> responses to "did all of XP" failures, will give the illusion that what is said is "</strong><a href="IfXpIsntWorkingYoureNotDoingXp.html">IfXpIsntWorkingYoureNotDoingXp</a>".<em></em>

        I think the response, "<a href="IfXpIsntWorkingYoureNotDoingXp.html">IfXpIsntWorkingYoureNotDoingXp</a>," is mostly to people setting up their failed projects as XP strawmen.

So, they naturally cut the person down as a failure himself.

        However, I don't think it's the best approach. Since it's essentially cultlike to rally around a methodology - on par with Linux advocacy ;) - the failed individual will look even more unkindly towards XP after such a beating.
      </p>
      <p>
        I submit, in order to gain more positive mindshare, one take a more socialist tact (based on the NonMethodology). Instead, constructively engage the individual. Identify the real problems he experienced and work to prepare responses for future projects. Then, instead of spouting the normal XP mantras - which don't work unless a project is already on the road - you can engage troubled projects at the level of helping them out of the ditch.

        Now perhaps this is troubling to some. But so far I've not seen a case where a team said "We're smart people, we followed all the rules for six months, we paid attention and made these modifications based on what happened, and we produced crap software on a completely random schedule".

XPers won't admit there's any particular context where XP won't work. Let's consider external politics and "sufficiently violent outside forces" out of scope for this discussion. But there's nothing in XP that says is good for a particular class of problems, or it's not a good for another class.</em>

      <p>
        <em>It can be one of these cases:</em>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          <a href="MichaelJackson.html">MichaelJackson</a> was wrong, and XP transcends common sense. Maybe XP is a silver bullet. It is not at all impossible that XP might have hit a sweet spot and set up the perfect machinery with which a team can tackle any imaginable software development problem. And its generality is not making it less useful, because it might have unravelled some miraculous universal principles that makes it effective everywhere. 
        </li>
        <li>
          XP is an all purpose method, but its usefulness is inverse to its generality. In particular XP rules are enounced with such a generality and lack of precision that XP can really take no counter examples. It might even be the case that XP can accommodate <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> (in cases where there's obviously no other way), formal proofs instead of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and everything else ever invented. After all things like "listen to what the code says" (design) and "listen to what the customer says" (analysis) can mean anything at all and consequently are as useful as "breathing is good for you". See <a href="ReplaceDocumentation.html">ReplaceDocumentation</a> for a particularly funny illustration of the "only if it works for you" approach.
        </li>
        <li>
          XP is an effective method for a limited set of problem domains. However Xpers don't have neither the time nor the inclination to try to come up themselves with a list of specific contexts where XP applies effectively and where it doesn't. Their general attitude is that XP should work everywhere, until proven contrary if ever possible, and of course they won't live up to the responsibility and the critical thinking it takes to explore and define the limitations of their own creation. They wait for others to do it, and would rather sit back and see what happens. After all, doesn't everybody else do the same? In the meantime they make sure to create more hype than arguments and lure more and more people to their religion. But isn't again what everybody else is doing?

        So which one do you think it is? Or maybe I missed other possibilities. In particular approaches like <em>I think that to really assess it, you really have to do it, not some other thing.</em> are non-starters. I do expect to see an objective and critical assessment from the people who did it. That's why I started this page. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        Firstly Ron you say we, as if you speak for group. I thus feel less bad about referring to that group elsewhere on this page as 'they'. I was concerned that I had been inventing faction out of thin air when it was in reality a group of people who only shared opinions and I was categorizing them for the purpose of tarring them with one brush. I don't quite know who your 'we' or my 'they' are, but to everyone else feel free to include or exclude yourself from my 'they' remarks as you see fit.

        You Said
        'but the definition of doing Level 0 XP is quite unambiguous and clear: the 12 practices, all the time'
        So it seems it is unambiguous. You also said we should change the name of the practice 40HourWeek. So it is unambiguous that we must do all 12 all of the time but it is less clear what the 12 are. I would like to try it and assess Xp. This offer of yours however seems a little unfair and high priced(I do not have the change dollars). You have stated if I try Xp but do 'No <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s' you will disown it as Xp even if I succeed. (But presumably When I say "I did Xp and It worked" someone would have to ask but did you do all of Xp and then if and only if some asks that question then you will disown it as Xp. Also it is unclear that if I succeed but do some unit tests will I be disowned. I thought some of the practices were pretty crunchy in that it was easy to definitively decide yes or no. Eg 40 Hour week. We could thus do experiments at say 40 and 60 hour weeks and compare results. You comments higher up this page however no longer rule out 100 hour weeks. I really am beginning to suspect that one size fits all that we Xpers want it to.

        <em>Elsewhere on the page you suggest you are an advocate of Xp.</em>

      <p>
        Perhaps you are, I however am an advocate of Xp practices. I claim that Fred, a prospective Xp user, should try adding some <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. I suggest Fred try picking some good, important targets and add some unit tests. I claim that this alone will make Fred's project better and Fred will notice. Being in front already, there is no more risk just reinvestment of previous gains in more. I then further suggest that Fred not be stupid and that if some tests made it good more might make it better. I further suggest, that it is possible to write too many and that Fred should keep adding more until the cost/benefit fades out to near 1. I then suggest that with Freds tests in place, Fred might find that some of Freds tested code is cumbersome hard to use and change. Try fixing it, really fixing it. Being a hard task try using two heads and brainstorming some ideas. See if the tests Fred put in earlier save Fred from danger and produce success. I then suggest Fred think about changing but do not attempt, changing some untested code. Is Fred scared? In that case I think I found a reason for Fred to go back and write more tests. Whats more I don't think Fred has to try it, just think about what is said above a decide if that is a low risk plan with potentially significant benefits. Should Fred try the plan? Does Fred
        think the plan will work even before he tries it. I think the answers to these questions are clear.

        Above someone writes "XPers won't admit there's any particular context where XP won't work." Is that really true? It seems to me that many of XP practices contain pretty clear limits. For example, an on-site customer is a requirement. So is the ability to do automated testing. And having all your developers in one place is a third. These rule out a lot of contexts for by-the-book XP. Many people are trying to push these limits in various ways, but the XP heavyweights I've talked to have been very frank about how much water is uncharted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or is that poster looking for something different, a more firm statement that XP is guaranteed not to work under conditions X, Y, and Z? It seems like XP is too young for such firm statements; right now the best one could say is that "I tried XP under condition X experienced problem A." In a decade we'll hopefully have enough data to make firm statements about where XP works and doesn't; until then I'd be disinclined to trust any black-and-white generalizations about its appropriate use. -- <a href="WilliamPietri.html">WilliamPietri</a>

        I think the question "Are you doing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>? Are you not doing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>?" is fairly irrelevant, and moves the discussion into semantics and methodology religion fairly quickly. I prefer a pragmatic approach: "What are you doing? Is it working or not? Why?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is useful as a conceptual grouping - a set of practices and values that exemplify a specific approach to software development - but less useful as a litmus test. In fact, most good ideas are fairly worthless as a litmus test. The quickest way to get me to leave the room is to start quibbling about the definition of "sex", "art", or "God", though I think sex, art, and God are fairly important anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I find most compelling about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is not its practices, but its values. The practices are just manifestations or iterations of the values, and they may be adapted or discarded as people fine-tune them. If you're looking for <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> because you want to follow a recipe book to <a href="SoftwareSuccess.html">SoftwareSuccess</a>, you run a high risk of failing no matter what you do. IfYouMeetTheBuddhaOnTheRoadKillHim. The values are vaguer, harder to define, fairly impossible to quantify. But these amorphous things are always the things that stand the test of time.

        One of the problems I suspect with C3's aftermath (at least as told here) is the marketing of XP, OO, etc. as the <em>One True Solution.</em> This is fundamentally why "all methodology is crap," I think. When you push a particular package as The Way, you are going to fall on your face because it just <em>isn't</em> The Way. (This is sometimes just deserts to those who make money from methodology as fear-mongering.) So then people are just going to brush aside the whole package instead of taking what's useful. For instance, I liked the discussion of XP on Wiki because it taught me how solve problems in new ways and why those heuristics worked. I don't write <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, but I do refactor even more mercilessly than before. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
