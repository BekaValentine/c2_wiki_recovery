        This memo describes an adaptive architecture for federating peer object servers. Both the architecture and its implementations are called Folk Memory. This term alludes to the social process by which folk tales or folk songs are remembered and propagated within a culture. The folk servers, like people within a culture, share their interests with their associates and associate with those who share their interests. Folk servers stream domain objects over simultaneous connections to peers dynamically chosen to shorten access to the authoritative sources for objects deemed interesting. Conflicts are resolved by a collective process that may not settle to identical state in all parts of a network. Folk memory favors scalability and robustness over accuracy and determinism.
