        Coalescent Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        A CoalescentPattern is a Pattern which is explicitly merged with other smaller Patterns to create a larger Pattern.
        This larger Pattern may alter the original small patterns to align themselves with each other, in order to make a new Pattern. For example a <a href="FactoryMethod.html">FactoryMethod</a> Pattern which has been merged with a <a href="CommandPattern.html">CommandPattern</a>, could have Command.Execute which calls Command.Create or it could coalesce and become Command.Create. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, patterns like the MVC pattern can be thought of as a CoalescentPattern, as it merges ideas from Observer, Composite and other smaller patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe also to avoid ambiguity the term CoalescentPattern would be better than small 'c'omposite and large 'C'omposite.

      <p>
        <a href="CoalescentPatterns.html">CoalescentPatterns</a> are not AggregatePatterns. AggregatePatterns would describe patterns that communicate with patterns, but remain complete and distinctly visible as themselves.
