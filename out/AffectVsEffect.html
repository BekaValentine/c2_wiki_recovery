        To affect something is to cause it to change in some way. To effect something it to cause it to come into being. Effecting a change affects the changed thing with an effect. What could be more clear?

        From Strunk, William, Jr. and White, <em>The Elements of Style</em>, V. WORDS AND EXPRESSIONS COMMONLY MISUSED:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Effect.</strong> As noun, means <em>result;</em> as verb, means <em>to bring about, accomplish</em> (not to be confused with <em>affect</em>, which means "to influence"). 
      </p>
      <p>
        As noun, often loosely used in perfunctory writing about fashions, music, painting, and other arts: "an Oriental effect;" "effects in pale green;" "very delicate effects;" "broad effects;" "subtle effects;" "a charming effect was produced by." The writer who has a definite meaning to express will not take refuge in such vagueness.

        <strong>Affect</strong> is also used as a noun in psychology, meaning, roughly, "reaction". "The patient received the bad news without affect."
        "Flat affect" and "neutral affect" are fancy ways of saying "emotionless."
