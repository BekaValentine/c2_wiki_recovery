        Every Thing Is Predictable
      </h1>
      <p>
        If <a href="EveryThingIsMath.html">EveryThingIsMath</a> then every thing is predictable. 
        A system has an input and an output. If we can predict all the inputs to a system, we can predict the output. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However the precision of the output is dependant on the precision of the input. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also for most non-trivial systems, the resources (in time and hardware) needed to model the system completely may be greater than the resources that would be used in observing the original system.
      </p>
      <p>
        To completely model the universe, we would need at least one universe.

        Not so. There's this thing called <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a> that says otherwise. You may have heard of it?
      </p>
      <p>
        The mathematics behind quantum mechanics is entirely deterministic, right up until the point of observation.  Then you get non-determinism under the Copenhagen interpretation, but determinism survives intact under the multi-universe interpretation.  See <a href="QuantumPhysics.html">QuantumPhysics</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>in any one universe, though, the result is that the experiment or whatever is not predictable. Which was my point. Or perhaps you'd like to predict when this radioactive atom I have here will decay?</em>.

        Assumes that the mind (emotions, thought, plans) is predictable?  Or possibly irrelevant?  Gosh, I may have to dig up my <a href="CelestialBilliards.html">CelestialBilliards</a> example (which assumes a source entity with effectively unlimited extrapolative powers).

        Is this the ultimate conclusion of <a href="ChaosTheory.html">ChaosTheory</a>, or does it imply that <a href="ChaosTheory.html">ChaosTheory</a> is incomplete?  -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

        Doesn't <a href="GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem.html">GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem</a> come in here somewhere?

        <a href="GregoryChaitin.html">GregoryChaitin</a> would be more relevant.
