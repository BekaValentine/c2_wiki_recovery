        More About Backup Copies
      </h1>
      <p>
        A page often has several authors. We expect each author's edits to be an improvement.  
      </p>
      <p>
        But, just to be safe, we save a copy of the previous author's text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> page knows when a backup copy is available and
        will offer the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> hyperlink to access it.
        From this page you can...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Save the copy as the desired version
        </li>
        <li>
           Edit the copy and save that
        </li>
        <li>
           Cut text from the copy to use elsewhere
        </li>
        <li>
           See a <em>diff</em> of the two versions
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A new backup copy is made whenever a page is saved by other than the most recent author.
      </p>
      <p>
        The current implementation uses the host machine name to detect change of authorship.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two authors on the same machine (or behind a firewall) appear as one; one author using different hosts or dynamic IP addresses appears as two.

        Older versions are kept for a while in <a href="http:/wiki/history.">http:/wiki/history.</a> See <a href="HistoryPages.html">HistoryPages</a> for an explanation, and links to deeper archives.
