        <a href="OsWiki.html">OsWiki</a> is the idea of writing and using an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> at the same time by several people over the web. While the idea is not entirely original, for example see the <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> and the entire unix family, <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is the perfect metaphor for this idea.

           You probably would want to see some kind of <a href="VersionManagement.html">VersionManagement</a> for the code source, which is something some <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>s offer too. Because the code is supposed to provide some service, it would be good to have <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s.

           Similar goals have been stated a long time before in the <a href="GnuHurd.html">GnuHurd</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-paper.html.">http://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd-paper.html.</a> So, maybe an <a href="OsWiki.html">OsWiki</a> is a way to not only have an OS that can be modified, but to provide an easy to use interface to actually modify it. Naturally it would use a NonHierarchicalFileSystem the <a href="WikiOs.html">WikiOs</a> filesystem.

           <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> can definitely be like this, especially if you realize it isn't a language per se, but an environment. Take some existing Smalltalk Wiki and allow embedded Smalltalk commands in the pages. You're pretty much done. That kind of WikiOS would look somewhat like a distributed component network.

           The <a href="NomicGame.html">NomicGame</a> often ends up with lots of work for the one in charge of executing the rules. If rules proposals where given in the form of a function in some programming language, everything would work completely automatically.
