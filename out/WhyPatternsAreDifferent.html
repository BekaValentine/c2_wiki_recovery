        <strong>Patterns solve problems:</strong>
        Many design methods strive to uncover the structure
        of a system;  most focus on the structure of the solution.
        Those that focus on the structure of the "problem" use
        the word "problem" only in the loosest sense.  
        Patterns are explicit about the problems they solve,
        and about the solutions they provide.  A pattern is not
        a strategy, but a problem/solution pair.  A pattern
        may attack a problem that is abstractly stated, but
        "abstract" never means "vague."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Patterns are generative</strong>:
        Most problem-solving techniques pair problems with
        solutions.
        In complex systems like software programs, the problem
        and solution are often not close in time and space.
        That makes it difficult to methodically hunt down
        solutions on demand.
        But insight, cleverness, or luck uncovers such
        solutions over time.  Patterns chronicle
        such solutions.  Alexander said, "This quality in
        buildings and in towns cannot be made, but
        only generated, indirectly, by the ordinary actions
        of the people, just as a flower cannot be made, but only
        generated from the seed." (<a href="TheTimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TheTimelessWayOfBuilding</a>, p. xi)
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we should leave non-generative solutions in the
        able hands of FormalMethodsPeople.
        People talk of <a href="FormalMethodsAndPatterns.html">FormalMethodsAndPatterns</a>;  by the
        time technology or understanding matures to the
        point where we can formally capture an idea, it
        ceases to have the generative, literary quality
        that sets patterns apart from other methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="HandsInView.html">HandsInView</a> is a great generative pattern.  See <a href="GenerativePattern.html">GenerativePattern</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Patterns build on experience</strong>:
        Most design methods create new structures from first
        principles;  while the principles are well-known, their
        application to a given context isn't proven, and the
        resulting structure may be entirely novel, and perhaps
        unsuitable to the problem at hand.  It takes insight
        to apply a method to a problem;  in fact, it takes insight
        to choose the right method.  Patterns encode experience
        by documenting proven structures, and how they relate both
        to the underlying principles, and to the problem at hand.
        They convey not only the solution,
        but the insight behind it.
        Patterns both build on the experience of those
        who refined the idea over time, and on the experience of
        those who insightfully apply the pattern to a given
        situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Patterns focus on aesthetics and human comfort</strong>:
        Most design methods focus on the needs of the computer,
        or on principles like <a href="CouplingAndCohesion.html">CouplingAndCohesion</a>.
        However, the computer doesn't "care" about its
        coupling and cohesion, and most design methods don't
        make it clear how their mandates improve the quality
        of life.  Good patterns tell how humans benefit from
        their application.  <a href="RichardGabriel.html">RichardGabriel</a> says: "We are trying
        to bring people and humanity into the software design and
        development process.  I think this is the goal because
        it's the key Alexandrian idea.  If you look at his
        patterns, each or nearly all talk about the context and
        forces in terms of what people need to do to live
        fully and to be fully alive..." (Personal communication
        with <a href="RichardGabriel.html">RichardGabriel</a>, April, 1995)
      </p>
      <p>
        Dick wrote a simple example of a software pattern with
        strong human overtones, called <a href="SimplyUnderstoodCode.html">SimplyUnderstoodCode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Patterns address the "orthogonal" dimensions of design</strong>:
        Object-oriented design produces objects.
        The object paradigm is a good decomposition and abstraction
        technique, but it is weak for integration.  The same is true
        for top-down procedural design (which was why reuse was
        so hard with procedures).  Good patterns cut across the
        modular parts of design and address the important constructs
        of system structure.  Alexander says:
        "<em>Design is often thought of as a process of synthesis,</em>
        <em>a process of putting together things, a process of</em>
        <em>combination.</em>
        According to this view, a whole is created by putting
        together parts.  The parts come first;  the form of the
        whole comes second.
        <em>But it is impossible to form anything which has</em>
        <em>the character of nature by adding preformed parts.</em>
        When parts are modular and made before the whole, by
        definition then, they are identical, and it is impossible
        for every part to be unique, according to its position
        in the whole." (<a href="TheTimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TheTimelessWayOfBuilding</a>, p. 368)

        Jim - You compare patterns to other "design methods" and "problem-solving techniques" in this discussion.  That got me thinking.  Up to now, I have used patterns to record problem solutions (and to read about other people's solutions).  In other words, for education purposes.  I like patterns a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have never really thought about the <em>best</em> way to use these patterns in a new project - I guess I have just assumed they would be talked about during the <a href="DesignPhase.html">DesignPhase</a> and somehow make the process go smoother.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you have any advice about explicitly using patterns in a software project? Or any project involving design?  Are there any "patterns" about the best way to use patterns in a project?  Do they work best in design reviews?  Code reviews? Should which patterns to use be decided on by the whole team up front?  Or are they just used for education, with the assumption better educated designers and coders will produce better projects?

        Just wondering...

        Hi, Stan,
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think there is a "best" way to fit patterns
        into a development process or method.
        Patterns cover development problems
        that range from what we call
        <em>architecture</em> to what we call
        <em>implementation</em>.
        We also have patterns of testing;  I can conceive
        of patterns for maintenance;  there are those who
        have published <a href="AnalysisPatterns.html">AnalysisPatterns</a>.
        Patterns are just a problem-solving tool,
        and software developers face problems at all levels.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wonder what you mean about "design phase."
        As I've done empirical studies of software organizations
        worldwide, I quickly discovered that
        <a href="DesignIsNotaDevelopmentPhase.html">DesignIsNotaDevelopmentPhase</a>.
        Design is the whole job;  patterns are relevant to design.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, I think there are
        many effective <a href="WaysToUsePatterns.html">WaysToUsePatterns</a>.

        Hello,
      </p>
      <p>
        One, perhaps the principle, way I use patterns during
        design (and BTW: Yes, design occurs throughout development. But it is also true that it is more intensely involved in the beginning of a project than the end) goes like this: I get a whole bunch of potential objects. I think about them, make a few preliminary stabs at "clustering" them (sort of like modules) and see if I can get a decomposition into a whole bunch of modules (each of which will have a Facade) and some very tightly defined lines of communication (this is a goal). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, within each module, there's a whole mess of related objects, which seem pretty related. I look at the interactions and then go skim <a href="DesignPatternsBook.html">DesignPatternsBook</a>, <a href="PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign.html">PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign</a>, <a href="AdvancedCeePlusPlusProgrammingStylesAndIdioms.html">AdvancedCeePlusPlusProgrammingStylesAndIdioms</a> (not as often, as I don't do C++) etcetera. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of times, things just click. I look at my objects and I think <em>ooops. That's the wrong model because of</em> x <em>and I think GOF got it wrong too (for this circumstance). But, there's something</em> close <em>which feels right.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I make it a point, whenever I'm sketching out a set of objects that are closely related, to go and read a few patterns, to see if anything clicks.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that someday I will make up a formal checklist of questions ("if you answer yes to this question, think about using the following patterns....") arranged about <em>core</em> objects. But, I think patterns will have to have settled down a bit more before that's really possible.
