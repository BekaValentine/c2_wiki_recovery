        Identity Subversion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Let's take the case on <a href="MeaningOfIdentity.html">MeaningOfIdentity</a> for a moment. Since the network is inheritantly unsecure, any errant machine may masquerade as another.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a few cases to consider.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Aliasing</strong></dt>
        <dd>Instead of identifying itself explicitly, a machine <em>consistently</em> uses an alias. For instance, a machine that outputs statistics on human rights violations in its country wishes to build a reputation for itself without identifying its location or who owns it.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Theft of identity</strong></dt>
        <dd>Using another computer's identity on the network and masquerading as it.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Resurrection of dead identity</strong></dt>
        <dd>Using an identity that was used years ago by another computer that had been taken offline. This happens a lot on the internet as practical jokes, actually.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Anonymous corrections</strong></dt>
        <dd>If one machines correct some other machine's posting, that first machine adds content to the other's IdentityContext.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Denial of identity</strong></dt>
        <dd>One machine denies ownership of data that it created.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        What are the effects of subverting an identity to both the subverter and subvertee?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do it?
      </p>
      <p>
        What can you do to get around the ethically wrong subversions without discouraging the ethically right subversions?
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a hard computer security problem.
