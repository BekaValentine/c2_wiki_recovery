        Bliss The Movie
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are in fact six different movies named "Bliss". Here are favorable reviews of two.

        Bliss [ <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Bliss%20%281997%29">http://us.imdb.com/Title?Bliss%20%281997%29</a> ] shows how barriers to intimacy created in childhood can persist well into adulthood and what it takes to bring these down. Very rare as it deals with sexuality in a mature and tender way that is unfortunately almost never seen in popular American culture, or popular culture anywhere. This "Bliss" was made in 1997 and directed by Lance Young.

        Another "Bliss" [ <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?Bliss%20%281985%29">http://us.imdb.com/Title?Bliss%20%281985%29</a> ] is a seminal Australian film from 1985 following PeterCarey's novel of the same name. This one shows how barriers to intimacy created in adulthood transcend civil society, and questions the fantastic isolation of modern man from natural reality. Wonderful photography of Sydney and Tuntable commune, and a deeply optimistic message not treated with too heavy a hand.
