        Theme Based Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>: Developers in a team are in different 'modes'. Some are in the 'mode' of performance tuning, some are in the mode of GUI usability improvment etc. So, its very difficult to get a 'performance tuner' to get into a GUI usability mode. So getting him to agree that a GUI feature, although a performance hog, will greatly improve usability gets difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>: The project manager decides what the 'theme' for current release would be. Theme could be performance, reusability, and GUI improvments. This makes the whole team to come under one common goal. This way, co-operation, and adaptability to changes increase a lot. Also, when all team members are in the same 'mode', very good ideas gets generated. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a typical theme sequence could be: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           2 weeks of feature implementation (meaning as many user-requested features as possible).
        </li>
        <li>
           2 weeks of GUI usability enhancement.
        </li>
        <li>
           2 weeks of performance tuning.
        </li>
        <li>
           etc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Also called: Goal orientation.
