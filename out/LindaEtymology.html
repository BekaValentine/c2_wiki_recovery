        Yes, there really is a language named after ex-porn actress Linda Lovelace.

      <code>
        When it came time to name the language, Mr Gelernter said he noted<br/>
        that Ada was named after Ada Augusta Lovelace, the daughter of Lord<br/>
        Byron, the English poet.  Miss Lovelace is regarded as the first<br/>
        computer programmer because she worked for the computer pioneer<br/>
        Charles Babbage.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Another woman named Lovelace was in the news when Mr Gelernter was<br/>
        casting about for a name -- Linda Lovelace, a star of pornographic<br/>
        films.  So he named the language Linda, and it stuck.  Asked about it<br/>
        now, Mr Gelernter grins and shrugs, "I was a graduate student at the time," he said.<br/>

        A search for "linda tuple lovelace" on Google turns up some other links, which at one time included a Linda Lovelace fan page that referred to the eponymous language.

        And we would all watch the movie "Deep Thought" starring <a href="AdaLovelace.html">AdaLovelace</a>.
