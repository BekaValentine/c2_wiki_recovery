        Mac Lisp
      </h1>
      <p>
        A major pre-<a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> implementation of Lisp at MIT.  <a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a> had <a href="DynamicScoping.html">DynamicScoping</a> implemented with <a href="ShallowBinding.html">ShallowBinding</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a> was used for a great many amazing things, including the bootstrapping of the <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> (which was compiled to <a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a>.) Its name derives from the MAC Project at MIT, and <em>not</em> from the <a href="AppleMacintosh.html">AppleMacintosh</a> computer series (which it predated by almost two decades).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a> reference manual (aka Moonual, after its author, <a href="DavidMoon.html">DavidMoon</a>) can be found in the <em>lspman</em> directory from the <em>AI</em> machine's filesystem at <a href="http://www.its.os.org/.">http://www.its.os.org/.</a> There are a lot of other historically significant things on this filesystem, including the <a href="TecoEditor.html">TecoEditor</a> source to the original <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is no </em>lspman<em> directory on </em>AI<em> as of 26dec2003. Other links?</em>

           The its.os.org maintainer tells me that the missing manual was not the 1974 "Moonual", but rather a 1983 version copyright KentPitman, who requested that it not be redistributed there -- nor apparently is he making it otherwise available as of 2005-Jul-16. But he has indicated that if and when he makes it available, it will be in the same spot as the rest of his publications: <a href="http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/index.html">http://www.nhplace.com/kent/Papers/index.html</a> (lots of good reading there).

        How related is <a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a> to Emacs Lisp? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The relationship between </em><a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a> to Emacs Lisp is indirect: the author of Emacs and Emacs Lisp, Richard Stallman, developed Emacs at MIT and was associated (in some sense) with <a href="MitProjectMac.html">MitProjectMac</a>, but Emacs Lisp itself is a rewrite from scratch, as is the current Emacs (the original Emacs was written in the Teco language). Almost all Lisps have been indirectly influenced by <a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a>, which in turn was influenced by the original <a href="LispOnePointFive.html">LispOnePointFive</a>.<em></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The <a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a> compiler also has been optimized to support fast numerical processing.
