        Resource Contention

      <p>
        One problem that appears when using <a href="LockBasedSynchronization.html">LockBasedSynchronization</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most processes try to hold a single lock. The lock is held only by one process at a time, but while a process is holing the lock, there are several others waiting for the lock.
      </p>
      <p>
        What would normally execute very fast is executing very slow because the concurrent threads or processes are all serialized by the access to this shared resource.
