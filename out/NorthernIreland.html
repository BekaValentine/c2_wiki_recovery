        Northern Ireland
      </h1>
      <p>
        Northern Ireland is, depending on your viewpoint, either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Part of the <a href="UnitedKingdom.html">UnitedKingdom</a>. This is obvious because a (significant) majority of people in Northern Ireland want to be part of Britain.
        </li>
        <li>
           Part of Ireland, annexed by force by Britain <em>(or rather, the bit of Ireland that chose to remain part of Britain when the rest of it became independent again, Britain having annexed the whole of it by force previously)</em>. This is obvious, because a (significant) majority of people in Ireland as a whole (North & South) want it to be part of the RepublicOfIreland (<a href="EireEurope.html">EireEurope</a>).
        </li>
      </ul>
