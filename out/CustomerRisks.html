        <a href="AlanCooper.html">AlanCooper</a>, in <a href="TheInmatesAreRunningTheAsylum.html">TheInmatesAreRunningTheAsylum</a> (p. 220), speaks about <em>the customer-driven death spiral</em>:

      <ul>
        <li>
           There is a big difference between <em>listening to</em> and <em>following</em> your customers. Listening is good -- following is bad.

      </ul>

        <li>
           Customer-driven products lack what <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a> calls <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a>, a single-minded vision which is the key to success.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When you are customer-driven, your product mutates from one release to the next, instead of growing in an orderly  manner. The product ends up filled with mismatched parts and random features, and becomes a <em>dog's breakfast</em>. Customers may buy it, but there will be little love in the product.

        Doesn't most XP writing focus on one-off development (for a single customer) rather than product development?  Doesn't Alan Cooper's point concern product development, where you sell the same piece of software to a great many customers?
      </p>
      <p>
        In one-off development, the customer pays for the development.  It's as simple as that.  The customer asks for <em>X,</em> you develop <em>X,</em> you get paid for <em>X,</em> and you're happy.
      </p>
      <p>
        In product development, you split development costs across many customers.  You develop the product, and you aren't happy unless a whole lot of customers pay for it.  Consequently you have to market the product: you have to send a message to the marketplace that is so bold and simple that your potential customers will hear it over all the noise.  In one-off development, you don't have that problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        A big risk for a one-off customer is that the developer will try to make the user interface as high-quality and conceptually unified as Alan Cooper could make it.  For most projects, that just isn't worth it.

        There is often a substantial gap between what the customer <em>asks for</em> and what the customer actually <em>wants</em>. A primary function of the analyst/designer/whatever you want to call him or her is to intelligently bridge that gap. In that regard, being able to listen to--yet not blindly follow--the customer is an important skill. This is just as true in one-off, custom projects as it is in mass-market software.
