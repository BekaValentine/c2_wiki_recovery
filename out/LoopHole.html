        Loop Hole

      <p>
        A <a href="LoopHole.html">LoopHole</a> is a way to escape/breach intended behavior or design.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example if a programming language has a strong type system, one <a href="LoopHole.html">LoopHole</a> may be to use pointers, which can be used to trick the language into being weakly typed even though it was intended to be strongly typed.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example of a loophole is a security issue in an operating system; virus writers find loopholes to get into systems and damage them.
