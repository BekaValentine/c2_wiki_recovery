        I didn't know it before but what I'm trying to do in the project I'm currently working in, is almost <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. And I like it a lot! All I have to do now is to convince the rest of the project that XP is what we should be doing. It might be a bit tough though because I'm leaving in a week:-( But then I probably will join some other project where we can use XP from the beginning:-)
