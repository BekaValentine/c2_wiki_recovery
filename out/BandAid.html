        <strong>Type</strong>: <em>Organisational</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>: Management (or responsible co-worker) needs to solve
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>: There is a deep-rooted problem in a company/project that will cause the company/project to fail unless addressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The problem has been ignored for a period of time.
        </li>
        <li>
           The problem has risen to the surface and cannot be ignored anymore.
        </li>
        <li>
           The person(s) solving the problem wants the solution to be quick and 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Supposed Solution</strong>:  Something quick and painless for the majority. Sometimes a requirement or policy change which satisfies <a href="PointyHairedBosses.html">PointyHairedBosses</a>. More often than not, a workaround that gives the company/project a new gloss when really nothing has changed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unlike the human body, a company/project does NOT heal itself once a plastic wrapper is put over a wound.
        </li>
        <li>
           This <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> is popular because it is usually quick and painless in the short term, but many long term consequences are ignored.
        </li>
        <li>
           Despite the apparent glossy exterior, a project may now be doomed to fail, because the root problems were not addressed completely or at all!

        <li>
           Often the person(s) applying the bandaid will be celebrated by the <a href="PointyHairedBosses.html">PointyHairedBosses</a> for coming up with an original solution, when almost everyone who is inimately involved with the day to day operation will: 
          <ul>
            <li>
               have more work to do because of bandaid; 
            </li>
            <li>
               have diminished respect for "champion" who applied bandaid; or 
            </li>
            <li>
               be put out for not being asked about the proper solution.
