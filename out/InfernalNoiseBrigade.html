        Infernal Noise Brigade

        I'm not usually one for posting musician type pages, but I was wondering if anyone knew about or wanted to discuss the <a href="InfernalNoiseBrigade.html">InfernalNoiseBrigade</a>.

        Evidentally they are "a cross between a band and a protest" - Appearing in places like Seattle - and soon in New York for the Republican convention.

        I haven't seen them personally, but I've had first hand reports that it is quite a spectacle - easily attracting the attention of an entire city.
