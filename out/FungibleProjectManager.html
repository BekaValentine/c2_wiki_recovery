        Fungible Project Manager
      </h1>
      <p>
        Fungible - being of such a nature that one part or quantity may be replaced by another equal part or quantity in the satisfaction of an obligation.

        Hence, you should put in place a <a href="FungibleProjectManager.html">FungibleProjectManager</a> approach when you are working in conflict mode with a hard customer. After a big crisis and escalation, after useless task forces, you can dispose of your project manager as a sign of your will to go on with the project... and get a clone from your warehouse. Your customer will be happy and nothing will change because your project manager is a <a href="FungibleProjectManager.html">FungibleProjectManager</a>.

Seen from the job that is to be done, it is definitely a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>, so a <a href="ManagementAntiPattern.html">ManagementAntiPattern</a>, but I saw companies using it as a <a href="ManagementPattern.html">ManagementPattern</a>. -- <a href="OlivierRey.html">OlivierRey</a>

        Well, we can wander if this is really an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. Some companies are using this trick to fool customers, especially in the IT world and it seems quite successful.
