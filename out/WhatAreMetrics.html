        What Are Metrics
      </h1>
      <p>
        Metrics are defined processes for measuring things.  They are not amounts.  When creating a metric, be aware that people tend to modify their behavior so that measurements improve, even when there is no direct reward.   (See <a href="BehavioralEffectsOfMetrics.html">BehavioralEffectsOfMetrics</a>.)  This can result in counterproductive behavior.  For example, the KLOC metric (which measures lines of code produced) can result in verbose code with minimal code reuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coming up with a good metric is hard.  Here's a few things to consider when creating a metric:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           What problem am I trying to solve?  How will this metric help?
        </li>
        <li>
           What impact will this metric have on people's behavior?  How will they subvert the metric to make themselves look good?
        </li>
      </ol>
