        Top Vs Others
      </h1>
      <p>
        The majority of Top vs Others discussions here on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> appear to boil down to repeated assertion of personal preference for tools and approaches.
      </p>
      <p>
        Top argues for "classic" procedural programming, where coding is reduced to its fundamental <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> essence: expressions, variables, IF statements, loops, sticking to canonical primitive built-in types and <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>, using the occasional procedure or function as needed to remove duplication.  Where higher-order capabilities might be suggested, Top would prefer to rely on a pre-built tool (e.g., SQL DBMSs, or off-the-shelf libraries) rather than code them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Top's detractors typically argue for what (for lack of a better term) I shall call "higher-order" programming: <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>, <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a>, <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a>, <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> but avoiding <a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a>, metaprogramming, polymorphism and inheritance, <a href="TypefulProgramming.html">TypefulProgramming</a>, etc.  When low-level coding might become objectionably tedious, Top's detractors would prefer to subsume it under a(nother) level of abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both views have a sincere common goal -- making programming "better" -- but they're really just stating personal preference for a favoured programming approach.  Top believes programming is improved by using simpler elements, but that's just because he likes "classic" procedural programming.  Top's detractors believe programming is improved by using more abstract elements, but that's just because they like "higher-order" programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, neither <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> nor <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> have provided definitive evidence of which personal preference is "better" -- a good start would be to define "better", but that's an unresolvable debate right there -- and there's nothing to suggest they ever will, so debates over tools and approaches are effectively little more than two (or more) participants repeatedly shouting, "I like <x>, so you should too [because of the following beliefs that I hold to be true]!"
      </p>
      <p>
        If that's the case, debating with Top is isomorphic to arguing over which is the best flavour of ice cream.  I.e., pointless, unproductive, and best avoided.

        <em>This strongly </em>'implies<em>' that the "others'" evidence is direct solid research as a contrast, and thus is a misleading introduction in my opinion. It's a technique often used by sleazy marketers. It's a way to lie without directly lying. I don't know if this is intentional spinning or just poor writing, but either way it should be repaired. The topic title renaming is also suspicious in terms of spinning. Wiki should emphasize ideas and concepts, not voting and people. I plan to change it back. -t </em>

      <p>
        It doesn't imply any such thing, and I'm not sure how or why you inferred it.  The views of Top vs Others are presented here in an objective fashion with no intended bias.  The sentence that you quoted suggests that Top, and Others, both make "repeated assertion of personal preference for tools and approaches."

      <ul>
        <li>
           Bullshit! It's possible to be objective BUT misleading. If you have a topic "X versus Y" and start out saying, "X does A", that strongly implies that Y does NOT do A.

           [Personal preferences aren't emotions, and direct observation is not the only possible form of observation. It's perfectly reasonable to assert "X likes Y" as a result of observing that X, all else being equal, tends to choose Y rather than Z -- it's also objective, if possibly incorrect (say, if X chose Y with a deliberate intent to mislead). Indeed, the fact that "X likes Y" can be an incorrect statement is a demonstration of its objectivity, as has been discussed many times on this wiki before. -DavidMcLean]

      <ul>
        <li>
           "Assert", yes, but that's not solid proof, especially if there are a lot of variables. For example, I drive to work almost every Monday through Friday, but that frequency alone does not mean "I like to drive to work". I <em>hate</em> the commute, but it's a means to an ends. Thus, "tend to choose" is not telling the whole story. (I'm avoiding a <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> mess over "emotion".) -t

           [I said "tends to choose Y rather than Z". Are there alternatives to driving to work that, all else being equal, you would prefer? As for not being solid proof, you're right; it's just a reasonable inductive inference, not an irrefutable deductive one. Nonetheless it is reasonable. -DavidMcLean]

        <em>I disagree with this summary. I approach it from what techniques are </em>'economical in terms of staffing<strong>, not just MY preferences. As pointed out in </strong><a href="GreatLispWar.html">GreatLispWar</a>, my <em>own</em> abstractions have had complaints about "being too abstract" by organizations. If you use certain advanced techniques, there's a decent chance you'll confuse future maintenance programmers, perhaps halting the project. Slow maintenance is often better than no maintenance to an organization. Slow maintenance is annoying; halted maintenance is a problem. Often lower abstraction is simply the least of two evils. -t<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You may claim and even fervently believe it's what's "economical in terms of staffing" or that "lower abstraction is simply the least of two evils", but in the absence of any evidence to support it, I suspect it really is just your preferences.  After all, your preferences that have lead you to work in places that (I would assume) avoid higher abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's quite possible our professional surroundings are ALL shaped by our preferences, whether we know it or not. Either way, I don't insist staffing economic issues trump theoretical elegance, but am merely saying I believe it to be a more important and it should get a fair hearing in tool evaluation rather than insist theoretical elegance trumps staffing economics. As far as "evidence", </em>'neither side has any solid research<strong> in terms of practical net effectiveness; it's an </strong><a href="AnecdoteImpasse.html">AnecdoteImpasse</a>. Thus, <strong>complaining about lack of evidence is hypocritical</strong>. The true default is NOT that theoretical evidence trumps economic evidence, but rather "unknown". -t<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have <strong>not</strong> made any claims about the value of theoretical elegance.  I have claimed that theoretical <strong>evidence</strong> is valuable, but we need to include more than just theoretical elegance.  It also includes simplicity, parsimony, flexibility, composability, extensibility, safety, and so on.  Until you cite outcomes of research into staffing economic issues and demonstrate their relevance, theoretical evidence <strong>does</strong> trump staffing economics, because you've presented no evidence to suggest "staffing economics" matters, let alone how much.

        It's also very unclear whether the key point is versus-ness or personal preference. If the second, then rework it to make versus-ness a mere example, including the title.

        How is the issue of a lack of rigorous studies different for top-vs-others versus ANY debate over software tools?

        <em>It isn't.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Then why focus the title on Mr. Top? You seem to be admitting it's more general and/or wider than one individual.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Because it's an explanation for debates where you (i.e., "Mr. Top") are always a participant.  Debates characterisable as "Mr. Top vs Others" have been a defining feature of </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> since you arrived.<em></em>

           I believe it would be better to focus on concepts and patterns (of both tools and IT staff) rather than individuals. I believe most <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> would agree this wiki should not unnecessarily focus on individuals. Doing so is confusing to new readers and can generate a lot of personal animosity.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, it would be better to focus on concepts and patterns rather than individuals, but when a particular individual is uniquely prominent in a particular role, it may be helpful to understand -- if nothing else -- why it is fruitless to engage in debates with that individual.</em>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Would the alleged outcome be different if it were <em>not</em> about "personal preference"?

      <p>
        <em>Probably not.  I don't know.  Does it matter?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If it doesn't matter, why mention it? That intro is already a confused soup of 3 sub-topics (below), so if it doesn't matter, slice it out. Plus, it's accusative.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I mention it because it appears to be a fundamental motivation.  It's certainly not accusative, because the "accusative" (usually short for "accusative case") is the grammatical case of a noun used to indicate the direct object of a transitive verb.  I assume that's not what you meant, because it doesn't exist in English.  If you meant "accusatory", it isn't.  You seem to think I'm accusing you of something bad.  I'm not.</em>
        </li>

        The intersection (or lack of) between Mr. Top, lack of studies, and personal preference is too confusing. The relationships need clarification.

        <em>All that was intended was to provide a possible explanation for the debates between you and Others, and point out that because they appear to be rooted in personal preference there's no point in debating them.

      </p>
      <p>
        Whats the alternative? If that is the general and unavoidable state of IT tool comparisons, then the title and intro focus should be on that, not individuals.

      <p>
        <em>It isn't a "general and unavoidable state of IT tool comparisons".  Indeed, many of us discuss tools without basis in personal preference.  We may discuss performance, expressiveness, flexibility, re-use, homoiconicity, and many other attributes that are not motivated by personal preference.  The arguments involving you and Others, however, seem to be rooted in personal preference because they're not about (say) how to make a given feature run faster or be more flexible, but about categorical elimination of an entire category of programming.  It's baby with bathwater, out -- and on fairly flimsy evidence.  It's not like you've researched some fundamental programming problem -- or even a fundamental </em><a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> problem like reliability or time-to-market -- and are suggesting that eliminating <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> will fix it.  With evidence, that would, perhaps, be reasonable.

           I honestly believe that typical shops, as I have encountered, are not ready to absorb them in a way that produces net benefits. If you think I am lying or being self-deceiving, so be it. It appears I cannot change your impressions of such and so will have to live with that impression exiting in your mind. I don't believe you guys are consciously pushing HOF's beyond what the market is ready for, rather you focus on the code itself first in terms of parsimony and <em>potential</em> "purity" etc., but staffing and economic issues are second because you are not used to thinking that way. Your mind is "equation geared" out of habit and perhaps preference and personality. You process symbols first in your mind; and economic, business, and staffing get the attention of far fewer cycles or neurons in your mind. Thus, your priorities are not in sync with owner/manager priorities.

        As far as hype-detection, it's still more art than science, for sometimes hype does actually bear fruit, although it may be largely accidental. For example, the dot-com bubble was indeed largely hype, but in general the Internet is taking over everything, just not the way early investors imagined. Christopher Columbus hyped his "India shortcut", but we mostly remember his grand discovery.

        I answered the "media attention" question as I understood it. If I misinterpreted what you were asking, it wasn't intentional. I cannot read minds.

        Incidentally, I generally deny that I am simply pushing my preferences, although my preferences may mirror what I feel the market demands or expects because I intentionally try to keep in sync. Without market influence, I'd heavily lean toward more TOP and something akin to <a href="MaspBrainstorming.html">MaspBrainstorming</a> in production. Thus, the assertion that it's all about pushing personal preferences alone is <strong>wrong</strong>. See footnote 2 under <a href="PatternsOfClaimsAgainstTop.html">PatternsOfClaimsAgainstTop</a> for more.

        <em>If your preferences "may mirror what [you] feel the market demands or expects" and you feel the market demands or expects avoidance of "higher-order" programming, then your personal preferences are what I described.

        But then the root shaper is industry patterns, not so much preferences. My preferences would then merely be a middle-man side-effect. Your intro is "issue soup" without a clear relationship still.

      <p>
        <em>No, in this case the root shaper is your preferences.  I'm not assuming the market demands or expects avoidance of "higher-order" programming -- indeed, I see no evidence of that.  I'm arguing that your preferences lead you to work for organisations that demand or expect avoidance of "higher-order" programming, and as a result you think that's the majority of the industry.</em>

        That's a pretty big assumption. I know you personally see no evidence of that, but to word everything like that's the default is quite presumptuous. And that's largely why the topic intro is stupid. --top

        <em>I find the same of my most common opponents. And it's not true. For example, I agreed that HOF's may be better for patching bad OOP API's and/or languages than living with bad OOP. But opponents are not satisfied winning battles, they want the whole fricken planet. -t</em>

      <p>
        {It's a strange point to claim you "agree" with, given that the claim that HOFs "may be better for patching bad OOP API's and/or languages than living with bad OOP" is yours alone.  HOFs are functions that accept functions as parameters or return a function, typically used for generating or executing <a href="TypeSafe.html">TypeSafe</a>, pre-compiled customised function definitions that support implicit closure over their defining environment.  They are simpler than <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s because they implicitly close over their defining environment; the environment does not need to be explicitly passed as it does with a <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>, typically via its constructor.  <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> can indeed be used to "patch bad OOP APIs", but only to the same degree that any other programmatic construct can be used to "patch bad OOP APIs".  You can use loops to "patch bad OOP APIs" when loops are needed, too.  Therefore, that HOFs can "patch bad OOP APIs" is not a defining or even a distinguishing characteristic of HOFs.}
      </p>
      <p>
        As I mentioned somewhere else, your HOF-versus-FO may be a strawman or over-simplistic because the competitors to HOFs may depend on the situation. It's why I'd prefer to focus on scenarios rather than general claims.
      </p>

        {I've never seen an event handler, callback, or internal iterator that varied by application domain.  An event handler for an accounting application looks exactly the same as an event handler for a videogame.  We're talking about code requirements, not business requirements.}
      </p>
      <p>
        And at this point I am partially impressed by HOF's ability to assist with or work around the faults of certain problem/fault-having languages and/or API's. I am listing it as a benefit of HOFs in my mind for now. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's only a short step from that to recognising that HOFs are nothing more than a programming construct that some languages have.  Just like FOR loops are good for implementing certain things, HOFs are good for implementing certain things.  I'm not clear what that has to do with "certain problem/fault-having languages and/or API's", but I'm not sure it matters, either.}
