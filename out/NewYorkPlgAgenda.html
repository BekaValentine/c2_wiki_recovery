        New York Plg Agenda
      </h1>
      <p>
        When a study group starts reading <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> it automatically gets an agenda and a schedule that lasts six months. That's one pattern a week for about twenty-three weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pattern Languages Group in New York finished <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> around May of 1996. We continued in much the same way reading papers from the PLoP Conferences, other patterns books, individual papers from several authors and rereading sections of <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now we're wondering how to proceed.  We've come up with a few ideas:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Implement Checks
        </li>
        <li>
          Have members review papers before the group reads them
        </li>
        <li>
          Spend more than one week on a topic or paper
        </li>
        <li>
          Revisit complicated topics
        </li>
        <li>
          Produce something:
          <ul>
            <li>
              GUI Designers Guide to Patterns
            </li>
            <li>
              Database Application writer's guide to patterns 
            </li>
            <li>
              Guide to Patterns after reading <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Spend more time on architecture patterns
          <ul>
            <li>
              As a category these are useful patterns.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Last update to this page (before this one) was August, 1997. It is probable that this agenda is no longer applicable? What is the current agenda?
