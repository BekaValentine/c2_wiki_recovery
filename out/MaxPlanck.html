        Max Planck (1858-1947)
      </p>
      <p>
        Max Planck made history in 1901. At the dawn of the 20th century he published a paper on the Theory of Heat Radiation. This paper recognized the quantization (dividing into parts) of heat energy. Many fundamental physical constants bear his name in recognition of his intuitive leap that truly make Max Planck a world genius.

        "It is impossible to make a clear cut between science, religion, and art. The whole is never equal simply to the sum of its various parts."
        --Max Planck

      <p>
        In his Scientific Autobiography, Max Planck penned a now familiar adage known as Planck's Principle: "A new scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light, but rather because its opponents eventually die, and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it."
