        No Compilation

      <p>
        <a href="NoCompilation.html">NoCompilation</a> refers to the ability of a programmer using an interpreted language to edit and instantly continue testing or debugging or using the application, since there is no build script, no Makefiles, no time to GoGetCoffee, you can just keep working, without brain-draining delays.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some compiled languages can get very close to this this ability because they feature <a href="FastCompilation.html">FastCompilation</a>, which is not quite the same thing, but practically gives the same benefits.

        See <a href="RapidApplicationDevelopment.html">RapidApplicationDevelopment</a> for the context that this remark refers to.
