      <p>
        Dave Babbitt thinks very little about programming, because he primarily works in Cold Fusion 5, and all the hard work has already been done for him. He has no spare time due to being forced to take low paying, time wasting jobs because nobody wants to hire a Cold Fusion programmer these days.
