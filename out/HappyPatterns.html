        Happy Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        A phrase I've started using... these are patterns that allow the group to sleep at night, go home and not worry, that keep the people happy.  <a href="EarlyAndRegularDelivery.html">EarlyAndRegularDelivery</a>, AutomatedRegressionTest, and <a href="ContinuousRoundTrip.html">ContinuousRoundTrip</a> are three that come to mind immediately. --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase reminds me of BobRoss' "Happy little trees". <em>- so see also </em>HappyLittlePatterns?<em> </em>':)<strong></strong>
