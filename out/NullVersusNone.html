        Any sufficiently complicated SQL database query contains an ad-hoc, informally-specified, bug-ridden, slow implementation of half of a Domain None on top of <a href="SqlNull.html">SqlNull</a>. -- GreenLuxSpesTop Tenth Rule Of Database Queries

      <p>
        None means Nothing, Nothing is a concept that describes the absence of anything at all. Nothing is sometimes confused with Null, but they are very different concepts because Nothing means absence of anything, while Null means unknown (you do not know if there is a thing or not).
      </p>
      <p>
        For Nothing, the normal <a href="TwoValuedLogic.html">TwoValuedLogic</a> applies (Nothing=Nothing : true, Nothing = Something : false), for Null, <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a> is necessary. Unfortunately, these 2 concepts have been used interchangeably without much thought, to point where the most common use for Null in relational databases is to mean Nothing (even when Null was designed to represent unknown by Codd). This confusion is aggravated by the fact that many mainstream application languages (Java, CSharp, Cee, etc) use the null keyword to mean uninitialized variable which easily maps to the interpretation that null means the variable is pointing to "nothing" (no object).
      </p>
      <p>
        But for databases, Null was not invented to represent nothingness, was invented to represent that the value of something was not known (maybe be something, maybe nothing, we just do not know). See <a href="SqlNull.html">SqlNull</a> for more on the origin of Null for databases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> wants Null to be removed from <a href="RelationalDatabases.html">RelationalDatabases</a>, so that the incongruence and confusion brought in by <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a> is eliminated, the developers, accustomed to use Null to represent Nothing, resist to the idea asking: How am I going to represent the fact that a Person is not married? I use to do that by marking the MarriageDate as a <strong>nullable</strong> Date. Now what? I need to split the table into 2 tables just to represent the fact that the MarriageDate is not mandatory? That of course seems like the obvious, elegant (if extremely cumbersome answer). But the practical developer refuses to get into that trouble, it is just too much effort, it is simple easier to continue using Null. But... what about Nothing? why not just simply add "Nothing" as a possible value for to the Date domain? That way it is possible to say that the Person has no MarriageDate, and still stay inside the realm of <a href="TwoValuedLogic.html">TwoValuedLogic</a>.

        Real-world reports have Nulls, or at least "empty cells" and that's the way the customer wants them and will fire you if you don't deliver or spend too much time working around that gap.

(Also, most users I have met do not like empty cells in reports, because it is hard to tell if the value in there is unknown to the system, known but empty, or just a report error, they prefer some standard way of saying "I don't know what goes in here" or "there is no value for this" like the String "N/A")<em>. -- </em><a href="LuxSpes.html">LuxSpes</a>

           "N/A" is often a kind of Null in itself. It's hard to mark/track them without something similar to a Null. For example, consider a cross-tab query/report in which there are not instances for every cell. Regardless of whether you put "N/A" or blanks in those cells, some kind of value or marker has to indicate them.

I've used type-lite languages that lacked a true Null, and working with strings as replacements for Null pretty much leads to most of the same kind of issues. (Although, I do wish SQL had better Null-handling conventions and operations. For example, there should be no such thing as a null string. Numbers and dates, okay, but not strings.)

           That's merely an indirect Null in which one can control the value or replacement for Null. And I'm not sure it's better than Nulls. Again, you are not really escaping Nulls, but dancing around them via something potentially uglier than Nulls themselves. I agree that specifying a value default when none is available is indeed a nice feature. But whether it can replace Null is yet to be seen. If the result is a numerical type, what does the app software receive as a substitution, for example? A string? That may not work well in the app, especially a non-scriptish language. At least Null is something recognized by many app languages; a convention that is shared and understood. - t

           That's mostly a syntactical issue, since one uses "is null" in most RDBMS as the equivalent. And even if I agreed with you, an imperfect translation is better than none, or a Rube Goldberg-like work-around. You seem to be arguing that "since X is imperfect, X is useless". First let's see the <strong>alternative</strong>.

In this case, with <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> domains, the "Date" type could include a value to represent "No Date", which would keep us from falling in the trap of <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>. This "No Date" would map to the null of app languages in a more accurate way: No Date = No Date (as null = null in Java, CSharp, C++, etc, etc). See?

           I see where this is leading to: <strong>complex custom types</strong> (DomainValues?) that are somehow shared between tool/languages. Sure, if you want to invent a sharable inter-tool type system, then such problems "magically go away". I don't think it's worth the complexity.

        <li>
           I didn't fall in any trap; I just didn't finishing defining what they meant. If you want something concrete, then lack of a cancel date means that the product has not been cancelled yet. I'll rework the example to make that clear.

Null was designed to represent unknown, not "no value"... how do I know that? because if null meant "no value" then in SQL null == null would return true, because the value for the cancellation is known: "none". But no, SQL added null to deal with the case when information was missing that is why null = null is </strong>unknown<em>', not true, not false: There might be a cancellation date, but since it is unknown, I can not compare it (I am thinking 2 dates in my head, tell me if one is greater than the other... you can't!)</em>

        <li>
           I rarely see that as a problem in practice. If the domain or task grows that complex, then usually there are other column(s) introduced, such as a "<strong>product status</strong>" column to clarify the situation. We don't need to sub-divide null and invent new types. And the distinction between "no value" and "value unknown" is mostly a pointless issue.

NULL is semantically void; by definition it carries no meaning. Missing values are <em>not</em> universal. Their <strong>representation</strong> may be universal, but their semantics are not. <strong>Why</strong> a value is missing may vary dramatically, but NULL tells us nothing about why the value is missing when databases are all about capturing meaning. Therefore, NULL fails to capture meaning. As such, the above Date type is merely an attempt to adapt to a SQL NULL in the most meaningful way possible. In pure <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, depending on the requirements, I might create a Date type like this:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        TYPE Date UNION;<br/>
        TYPE ValidDate IS {Date POSSREP {Year INTEGER, Month INTEGER, Day INTEGER}};<br/>
        TYPE NotExpiredYetDate IS {Date POSSREP {}};<br/>
        TYPE MissingDate IS {Date POSSREP {Reason CHARACTER}};<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        .
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Usually a "status" column or something similar is used when such info is needed. It usually works well and doesn't need the invention of new types. (It can be linked to a </em><a href="ConstantTable.html">ConstantTable</a> to ensure validity.) - t<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Your "status" column forces the developer to re-implement the combined "status" & Date semantics every time a Date is used in a table (or elsewhere too, presumably), instead of describing it once in a type definition.  Your approach is a violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>The status values are rarely the same from app to app. "Jockey didn't show up" is fine for horse-racing, but not dress catalog sales. Status can get rather complex in some apps. Stuffing all that into a date column or finish time column the like is trying to pass a camel through the eye of a needle. It's force-fitting two concepts into one.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Note that there's nothing in the type definition which pre-defines the contents of 'Reason' in the MissingDate subtype, so your argument is moot.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>If it's open-ended text, then it's generally equivalent to an open-ended Status column. I don't see how your fact changes the argument much. And, most companies don't like those because managers like status reports on the different statuses over time. If they are free-hand, then consistent measuring is difficult. A free-hand option may be available, but usually discouraged. For example, one of the status codes may be "Other - see note", in which case the "comments" section is expected to describe the situation, and may be required if "Other" is chosen.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               The type definition can be trivially configured to constrain the Reason values to those checked by a function or obtained from a <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>.  The value of building this into a type definition is that it need only be specified once, rather than everywhere your status_column+date_column "type" is used.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

           [Again, <a href="SqlNull.html">SqlNull</a> was invented to provide <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>, and again you (like many others) are perverting it in to a ad-hoc, informally-specified, implementation of None. In this case, you want to use a "status" column as a crutch to make Null limp as if it were None. And it is not a bad idea for a language like SQL that needs such a crutch, but: what is the point of keeping the need for such a crutch when designing a new language?]
