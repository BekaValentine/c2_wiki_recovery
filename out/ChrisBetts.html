        A recent visitor to wiki - aside from being unable to resist joining in a debate on compulsory voting and Australia (in <a href="YouCantForceVoting.html">YouCantForceVoting</a>) I haven't had much to say, except that wiki seems like an excellent pasture to browse in.

        When not being sidetracked by things wiki, I run a small open source project (a java ldap browser at <a href="http://jxplorer.org">http://jxplorer.org</a> ), work in web services security/UDDI and stuff with Computer Associates in Melbourne, Australia, maintain a personal web site at <a href="http://pegacat.com">http://pegacat.com</a> describing my PhD work in nanotechnology, and live in a forest on the top of mount Dandenong overlooking Melbourne and the bay.
