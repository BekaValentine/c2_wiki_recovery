        Workspaces of the future may become Integrated, Geographically Separated by roughly 6 hour separation in time zones.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the future, Working Spaces will be highly and rapidly portable. It is possible that a product might be worked on for 6 hours in Atlanta, 6 more in Hawaii, 6 more in Hong Kong, and the final 6 of the day in Athens.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or breaking it into 1 + 6 + 1 hour day with time off for lunch during the 6 hour period, at 4 locations about 6 hours separated in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or an overlapping arrangement based on 6 hour working, overlapped with a one hour period at the beginning and again at the end with the next zone.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           one hour period would be used by the sites for DualSiteProgramming.
        </li>
        <li>
           The remaining 6 hours could be pair-programmed with a locally based leading and trailing programmer working together.
        </li>
        <li>
           The total for a WorkingSession would be 8 hours.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The TrailingProgrammer at the HandoffSite would pair coordinate with the LeadingProgrammer at the ReceivingSite:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Leading
          <ul>
            <li>
               1 hour intersite 6 hours with TrailingProgrammer locally, 1 hour freewheel
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Trailing
          <ul>
            <li>
               1 hour freewheel 6 hours with LeadingProgrammer locally, 1 hour intersite
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The FreewheelPeriod would be the time for for intersite coordination, planning, summaries, documentation and reports.

        In a recent conversation with a friend of mine, I was surprised to learn that such workspaces are already routinely employed. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20080720.2226.m06

        <em>I'd like to know for what kind of projects this is used. Size, difficulty (newness), timeline, ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is one which could do this if not already engaged: (I have no way of knowing this, not being associated in any way with them, or knowing anyone in their employ)
      </p>
      <p>
        A firm, whose world headquarters is located in Olathe, KS, is philosophically and geographically set up to do this. I would be surprised if they were not doing some of, if not all of the things mentioned on this page. They have offices in time-zone differences which would allow this.
      </p>
      <p>
        A clue from their website: "What began as a brainstorming session of a handful of engineers around a card table in 1989 has evolved into a worldwide <strong>collaborative effort</strong> of thousands of colleagues."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is a global company with several offices in the United States (Kansas, Arizona and Oregon), one in Europe (UK) and and also another in Asia (Tawain).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        At these facilities: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           they carry out various stages of product development, from initial concept to shelf-ready unit. Their business structure is based on performing all design, manufacturing, warehouse and marketing processes in-house.

        I think I am doing some of this now. I am sitting in a hotel room in Chennai (Madras), India. I flew in today from Delhi. I am logged into C2, and also to a workspace at my home university which I have been using to write up my visit. I have also used email to request information from home, arrange to go to a conference when I get back, send electronic postcards to my family. I also use my mobile phone to take photographs and upload them to the computer to add to my report. I could have got set up to log into computers back home and do program development, but did not get that done. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        I think this will become a PatternForTheFuture. Where one will use mobile devices to replace the brick and mortar office cubicle and wired connectivity devices usually associated with the TraditionalOffice. The device(s) may include a Laptop with wireless internet connectivity, a TelephonicComputingDevice with a form factor similar to the cell phone of 2010, or other device, only now being invented and considered for manufacture for the consumer market. ComputerData, WayPoints, PhotoGraphs, <a href="ElectronicMail.html">ElectronicMail</a>, VirtualTransactions and VirtualOfficePrcedures communicated and processed by the handheld, ShirtPocketElectronicDevice from nearly anywhere on or above the planet. Perhaps some day from the moon or planets in the solar system. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
