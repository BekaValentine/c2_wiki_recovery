        <strong>Archiving </strong><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Current practice:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           From time to time, move the oldest day(s) to the end of the appropriate "ChangesIn<monthName><lastTwoDigitsOfYearAsWords>" page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Save the "ChangesIn<Month>" page before saving <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> - just in case the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> save should fail.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please keep at least <strong>three</strong> full days (in addition to the current day) in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> need to be archived because not everyone checks Wiki every day: Some may drop in every week or two - say, on weekends, when they browse from home.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Why keep at least three full days on </strong><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For all of Monday, people can see all the changes of Friday, Saturday and Sunday on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>When that's not enough...</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        People who drop in less frequently can start with <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, and switch to the "<a href="ChangesInMonth.html">ChangesInMonth</a>" pages, for older content.
        <em>(The original objective was to preserve only three months of history.)</em>

      <p>
        <strong>"Where's the rest of the history?"</strong>

      <p>
        <a href="ChangesInMonth.html">ChangesInMonth</a> is a new (and maybe temporary) idea to keep <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> a reasonable size now that ChangesInWeek is no longer maintained (since October 2008). The idea is that a new page can be created once a month and does not have to be redone the following year. After <em>inventing</em> this I find I have done no such thing, merely reinvented the past - see ChangesInWeekDiscussion where the ChangesInWeek replaced <a href="ChangesInMonth.html">ChangesInMonth</a> which then (2005) had become too large to be edited. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Quite true. And I support your efforts. The history was pretty much...
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           People randomly deleted old stuff from <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>; sometimes from in the middle.
        </li>
        <li>
           I moved old content to "<a href="ChangesInMonth.html">ChangesInMonth</a><monthName>" pages, keeping an 11 month history, leaving only 3-5 days on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. (I moved old content to history every day.)
        </li>
        <li>
           When this failed, due to a large monthly change history, I changed to "ChangesInWeek<name>", still keeping about a year's history, with nightly moves of single days to history, by hand.
        </li>
        <li>
           Eventually I tired of this. (But I'm keeping the BarnStar!!! ;-) Fortunately, while I was offline on vacation for a few weeks, others took up the slack, so I let them keep doing it.
        </li>
        <li>
           ...until they stopped, as you describe above. I've been wondering if someone would do something about it. Thanks John!!!

        <strong>4th August 2009</strong> I have been following the practice of <a href="ChangesInMonth.html">ChangesInMonth</a> for most of a year now.

        <em></em>'Historic information on "ChangesInWeek*" pages:<em></em>'
      </p>
      <p>
        The "ChangesInWeek*" pages were created as a replacement for the "ChangesIn<Month>" pages when monthly pages grew excessively large and unwieldy.
        With the volume of changes in late 2004, each of the month's changes in November and December of 2004 could <strong>not</strong> be held in a single page, regardless of browser used.
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> limits page sizes as a defense against spam prevent the posting of excessively large pages -- something over 256K of text each.
        Also "<a href="ChangesInMonth.html">ChangesInMonth</a>" pages were taking a long time to render because the Wiki server has to look up all the referenced pages.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Rather than clear everything at the end of a year, would it be possible to somehow compact into changes into ChangesInTwoThousandAndFive, say? I ask because I'd like an easy way to know approximately when certain threads started. Just a thought. -- BenA.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That would be problematic. Thread and page are not the same. Also, there is a maximum page size.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes; one of the reasons for going from C<strong>'hangesInMonth* to</strong>
        C<strong>'hangesInWeek* pages was that</strong>
        the C<strong>'hangesInMonth* pages were exceeding Wiki's maximum page size</strong>
        -- which is much larger than the 32K limit that some browsers impose.
        So a C<strong>'hangesInYear page would be infeasible.</strong>
        Plus, it would take an excessively long time to load -- as it would have to check the existence of all pages referenced in that year.

      <p>
