        Would you like to spend a long weekend in a Victorian castle
        broadening your understanding of software patterns, learning how to
        use them better, meeting the experts and having some  fun?  If so,
        then UP '97, the first workshop on Using Patterns, is for you.  Come
        join us!
      </p>
      <p>
        UP is a gathering of pattern enthusiasts.  UP will focus on using
        patterns to make software development productive and fulfilling.  It
        will be highly participatory.  It will be a place for us  to share
        experience and increase our understanding of patterns.  There will
        be sessions for all of us, no matter whether we are newcomers or
        pattern experts.  We will look at the effective use of all kinds of
        patterns, from design patterns to analysis patterns to management
        patterns, from old patterns to newly described patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        All sessions will be small and focused on results, allowing us to
        discuss, debate and learn from each other.
