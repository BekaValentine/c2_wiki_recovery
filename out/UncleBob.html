        When I saw this page, I thought aha! Finally someone is going to explain the origin for that British saying "... and _blank_ is your Uncle Bob"
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>"Bob's your uncle!"</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It was both British and Strine for "you have an inside track" or "you have a lock on it". It derives from an incident in the 19th century when a British prime minister named Lord Robert Stanley  appointed his own nephew to be chancellor of the exchequer.

      <p>
        The phrase is used today to mean "and your problem is solved".

        Yes, that's it. Strine has many phrases somewhat overlapping in meaning: "No worries", "She's apples", "She's jake", "Wacko the chook", and so on. Until I received a resounding stunned silence using "Bob's your uncle" at the end of a high level design review at HP <a href="SanDiego.html">SanDiego</a> 3 years ago, I had actually thought the phrase American. Growing up in oz tends to provide one a somewhat ... eccentric view of etymology. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        <em>Anyone who watched Bob & Doug </em>MacKenzie (<a href="GreatWhiteNorth.html">GreatWhiteNorth</a>) knows "Bob's your uncle", eh?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And I thought "It's jake" was </em>AmericanSlang from the gangland years.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Might be. I was very surprised to find that the Australian "bloke" is used liberally in the <a href="DamonRunyon.html">DamonRunyon</a> gangster stories. I guess you toss a whole bunch of slang into books and movies, and different cultures keep different parts of it. -- PM

        <em>...then there are the comedy variations, such as "Bob's your auntie's live-in lover"...</em>

      <p>
        Sex-change operations are simple these days. One quick snip and tuck, and Bob's your auntie. -- HaleAndPace
