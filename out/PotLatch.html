        <a href="WikiIsNotaDictionary.html">WikiIsNotaDictionary</a>, agreed, but "Potlatch" is an interesting term that not many people seem to know unless they've read TheMoatAroundMurchesonsEye, sequel to TheMoteInGodsEye by <a href="LarryNiven.html">LarryNiven</a> and <a href="JerryPournelle.html">JerryPournelle</a>.

        "Potlatch" is a ceremonial feast among certain Native American peoples of the northwest Pacific coast, as in celebration of a marriage or accession, at which the host distributes gifts according to each guest's rank or status. Between rival groups the potlatch could involve extravagant or competitive giving and destruction by the host of valued items as a display of superior wealth.

        <strong>Potlatch</strong> is a word from the language of the Kwakiutl of British Columbia. The ritual was described by Franz Boas (<a href="http://emuseum.mnsu.edu/information/biography/abcde/boas_franz.html).">http://emuseum.mnsu.edu/information/biography/abcde/boas_franz.html).</a> -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a>
