        Open Wizard Assistants
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="OpenWizardAssistants.html">OpenWizardAssistants</a> is a new Open Source project intended to stand the traditional software wizard concept on its pointy little head.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic idea is to create open source software assistants for the real wizards: programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        The assistants make use of but do not replace a combination of several common software application models:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hyperlinked Text, including but not necessarily limited to wikis
        </li>
        <li>
           Source Code (both compiled and  interpreted)
        </li>
        <li>
           Shells and Shell Scripts
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They have several purposes:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Getting the job done
        </li>
        <li>
           Helping the user understand why the job is important
        </li>
        <li>
           Helping the user discover and explore alternative methods
        </li>
        <li>
           Helping the user understand exactly how the job is done
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
