        Pairing Surplus
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you and your pair partner work on your partner's task (<a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, of course), you are accumulating a <a href="PairingSurplus.html">PairingSurplus</a>. If you accumulate too high a <a href="PairingSurplus.html">PairingSurplus</a>, you're artificially lowering your velocity (because you are spending more time helping others than doing your own work). You reduce <a href="PairingSurplus.html">PairingSurplus</a> by pairing on your task. Spending too much time on your task leads to a <a href="PairingDebt.html">PairingDebt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A high <a href="PairingSurplus.html">PairingSurplus</a> may or may not be a bad thing, especially if the resulting <a href="PairingDebt.html">PairingDebt</a> is spread around the team (as opposed to being all with one person). Certain <a href="ExtremeRoles.html">ExtremeRoles</a>, such as the Coach, will naturally have a high <a href="PairingSurplus.html">PairingSurplus</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The downside to a high <a href="PairingSurplus.html">PairingSurplus</a> is that you won't be able to sign up for as many tasks as you could do in an iteration, due to <a href="YesterdaysWeather.html">YesterdaysWeather</a> and your artificially low velocity. This assumes that you use individual velocities during <a href="IterationPlanning.html">IterationPlanning</a>, of course.
