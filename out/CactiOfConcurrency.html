        Cacti Of Concurrency
      </h1>
      <p>
        <img src="http://www.hr.state.az.us/images/cactus.jpg" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Concurrency primitives are built on other, lower-level, primitives supplied
        by underlying software or hardware.  Higher levels of a given cactus (usually)
        contain primitives that operate at higher levels of abstraction.  Different
        hardware and software platforms and applications may have slightly differing
        cacti.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this sense, the properties of the cactus are determined more by the
        properties of the human brain and of the current state of the concurrent
        computing art than by any underlying theoretical properties.  This is
        in contrast to the complexity hierarchies found in theory of computing
        or Herlihy's hierarchies of atomic primitives (<a href="GlobalConsensus.html">GlobalConsensus</a>).  These hierarchies are
        used to explore properties of abstract machines, while the cactuses
        will be used to classify patterns that occur in parallel software.
      </p>
      <p>
        These cacti thus form one possible index into these patterns -- an index
        that is useful for someone trying to understand the architecture, design
        and implementation of synchronization primitives and mechanisms.  Other
        indices would be more helpful to someone trying to construct an application,
        still others for people reverse-engineering an applications, and yet more
        for people debugging an applications (fault tree!).
      </p>
      <p>
        In keeping with a fine old computer-science tradition, these cacti will
        be drawn upside down.

        ElectricalSignal: a set of electrical/optical signals
        sent from one IC to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        FlipFlop: a circuit used to (among other things) synchronize signals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        DeviceInterrupt:  interrupt sent from I/O devices to CPUs or between CPUs.
      </p>
      <p>
        InterruptMask: mechanism for suppressing or deferring interrupts across
        critical sections of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        MemoryTransfer: hardware message that transfers values between CPUs, caches,
        and memory modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        CacheProtocol: cache-coherency protocol that ensures that all components of
        a shared-memory computer system will agree on the current value
        contained in any given memory location.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SharedMemory.html">SharedMemory</a>: an illusion that a set of caches and memory modules provide a
        global memory shared among a set of CPUs.
      </p>
      <p>
        LoadStore: a family of mutual-exclusion algorithms based on coordinated
        sequences of simple loads and stores.  Dekker's algorithm
        and Lamport's algorithms are well-known examples of this
        group.  Most current software relies on explicit hardware
        support for mutual exclusion, see below.ATOMIC: a genus of computer instructions that provide support for
        mutual exclusion and parallel computation.  Examples include the
        FetchAndPhi class of instructions (which in turn includes FetchAndAdd
        and TestAndSet), AtomicExchange, CompareAndExchange,
        LoadLinkedAndStoreConditional, and OklahomaUpdate.
      </p>
      <p>
        WaitFree (<a href="WaitFreeSynchronization.html">WaitFreeSynchronization</a>): a genus of mutual-exclusion algorithms based on
        CompareAndExchange or LoadLinkedAndStoreConditional that guarantee
        that each process will complete any given operation in a finite
        number of steps.  Some members of this genus can withstand termination
        of member processes at any time.  This attractive property is
        counterbalanced by high <a href="ConTention.html">ConTention</a> at high loads.
      </p>
      <p>
        BusyWait (<a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>):  the more traditional genus of spinlock-based algorithms.
        In contrast to WAITFREE, terminating a process that holds a lock
        can hang the parallel application.  However, processes waiting for
        the lock can avoid contending with the current holder of the lock
        for the data.
      </p>
      <p>
        PreemptiveBlock: applications with critical sections that may be held for
        long periods (e.g., a lock might be held while doing I/O) may not
        wish to spin while waiting for locks.  A blocking mutual-exclusion
        primitive allows the application to give up the CPU while waiting
        for the lock.
      </p>
      <p>
        SoftwareMessage: a software message.  These normally require some form of mutual
        exclusion in shared-memory environments (although in some cases
        only BUSYWAIT is needed).
      </p>
      <p>
        RemoteProcedure: generalized notion including asynchronous messages (AKA C/S)
      </p>
      <p>
        DistributedLock: distributed lock manager:  BLOCK w/out shared memory, or a
        particular form of ELECT.
      </p>
      <p>
        DistributedMemory: distributed shared memory:  recurses on SHDMEM to create
        an ingrown cactus.
      </p>
      <p>
        ElectionAlgorithm:  Note that all mutual-exclusion primitives
        are by definition election algorithms.  The term ``election
        algorithm<em> is normally reserved for the more complex elections</em>
        among entities that do not share memory.  Even more complex election
        algorithms allow entities and/or the communictions networks connecting
        them to fail.

        Nice page. Is missing Timers for simplest form of lock retry, as used in Ethernet, and sleep(). No manager required, though still need shared collision detection.
