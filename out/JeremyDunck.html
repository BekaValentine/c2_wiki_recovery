      <p>
        I've viewed Wiki a number of times, but have never posted until just today.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is quite an interesting tool.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a Windows and web developer, looking to make the leap to non-MS programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've got a bit of experience in C/C++, Java, VB, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, HTML, CSS, DOM, and the usual accompanying suspects.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've got a web site (<a href="http://dunck.us/)">http://dunck.us/)</a> which isn't much yet, but I hope to do more with it.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There are never enough hours in the day, and that particular ambition falls toward the bottom of my list.
