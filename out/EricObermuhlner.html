        I'm a software engineer in a Swiss software company called TakeFiveSoftware which writes a OO development tool (mainly for C++ and Java) called SNiFF+.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be interesting in this context that SNiFF+ uses ET++ which is mentioned many times by the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a>.

        Since I first stumbled over Java in 199? I've been fascinated by it and almost every free minute (which are unfortunately very few; 100% daytime job + married + 1 kid doesn't leave much time) I spend hacking away in Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was born 1997/02/24 in Munich, Germany and lived mostly in Switzerland, Brazil, the USA and a few other places.
        I currently live in Greifensee, a small town near Zurich in Switzerland.
