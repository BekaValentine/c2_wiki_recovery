        (04 Nov. 1998)
        I've just seen a story on the BBC's Newsnight 
        about a leak from the Scottish Office.
        Apparently, the letter was protesting against reductions in troop numbers
        in the Territorial Army. It cited Y2K as a major reason why we should maintain
        troop numbers.
      </p>

        Here's the story on the web:

Btw,, where do you fall on the <a href="YtwokUpdate.html">YtwokUpdate</a> scale?<em> --</em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        Err, I feel that the BBC story has more to do with Scottish nationalism than any serious thoughts about martial law, or Y2K for that matter. Can't get to the G+M story, so can't comment.

        But then, I remember when I was young the Army bringing food to us people in the high Pennines cut off by heavy snow; the Army turning out to douse fires while the Fire Brigade were on strike (this used to happen quite a lot in the UK); the Army searching for lost children, and so on.

        I don't know but that I'm quite happy that a bunch of well-organised, very fit, highly trained men and women with vast resources and indestructible equipment are standing by to <em>help me out</em> if it all goes pear-shaped. --<a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

        I've had this recurring nightmare (maybe it'll become a Science Fiction short story :) about Y2K coming close to "The end of the world as we know it" and Martial law being declared with all programmers being drafted into the Army in a special "programmers" brigade who are made to work long hours fixing broken COBOL and 370 ASM programs for the government.  The justification would be that programmers are in "protective custody" to keep them from being massacred by howling mobs who can't use their cell phones :)

        Hmmm, can't go to Canada to avoid <em>that</em> draft. And if it comes to be, probably
        can't go <em>anywhere</em>. --<a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        Yeah, after thinking about it more I realize it's just scary enough to actually happen.  Definitely shades of Joe Haldeman's TheForeverWar here... -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

        For comprehensive, frequently-updated, and largely rational Y2k info, one might want to consider Peter de Jager's excellent site at <a href="http://www.year2000.com.">http://www.year2000.com.</a>  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        I'm trying not to think where that may fit in on the <a href="YtwokUpdate.html">YtwokUpdate</a> scale.

        OK, so there's this launch computer. It hangs in a loop looking for two keys to be turned or for time to run backwards. Suddenly it goes from Dec 31 1999 to Jan 1 1900.  Time has run backward! Time to launch missiles! I don't think so.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        There is only one time in my life that I can look back upon and be very glad I procrastinated.  For a CS degree the university required a section of COBOL.  I put it off until the last term and viola!  They dropped the requirement before I had to take it.

        Have fun in the brigade.  I'll keep the C++ running outside.

        If we get to the heavy end of the <a href="YtwokUpdate.html">YtwokUpdate</a> scale there might be considerable competition to get into the Cobol Brigade.
