        Nerd Pack
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have this really cool belt pack that I keep my expensive Rotring pens and pencil in: Black fountain, Red fountain, 0.7mm pencil.

        At a workshop at OOPSLA, <a href="BruceAnderson.html">BruceAnderson</a> was standing behind me, staring at my hip. At first I ignored him, hoping he would lose interest and go away. Finally I looked at him quizzically. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is that a <a href="NerdPack.html">NerdPack</a>," asked Bruce.  "I don't know," I replied. "It's expensive, it's leather, it's not in my shirt pocket."
      </p>
      <p>
        David Arnone was listening in. He asked, "Are the pens in any particular order?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I answered, "yes".
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's a <a href="NerdPack.html">NerdPack</a>," he pronounced.

        I don't suppose there's a link available to this particular item, is there?

        I suffer from a disease that compels me to have things on my belt.
