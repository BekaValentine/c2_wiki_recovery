        You just dug deeply into your bag of tricks and made something work that no mortal could ever match.

        Stand up.

        Reach your arms above your head.

        (This is best done on a mountaintop bare-ass-nekkid, but in the absence of a mountaintop, at least step outside your cube; all the static electricity is hell on your computers, to say nothing of your ATM card.)

      <p>
        In the absence of a mountaintop, is bare-ass-nekkid still appropriate?

        I've had this feeling a few times. It's an extraordinary feeling. But, afterwards, I always feel a little bit guilty. To me, it's sorta like playing nine ball. When I call and make that double-bank-into-a-combo shot, I feel like <strong>strutting</strong>. But there's always this little voice saying "Who's the ******* who got into a situation where he needed to make that shot?"

        For people who like the pool metaphor, I highly recommend <em>Playing off the Rail</em> [ISBN 0679423745]. A fun look at a year in the life of a professional pool hustler (which is, thank you, <em>nothing</em> like the life of a professional software developer).
