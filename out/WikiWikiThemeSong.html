        Wiki Wiki Theme Song
      </h1>
      <p>
        Apparently there is (or used to be) an exhibit at Disneyland
        called "The Tiki Room".  (Disclaimer: I've never been to Disneyland;
        I found out about this from the music CD <em>Classic Disney: Volume II</em> --
        the blue one.)
        "The Tiki Room" featured animatronic birds and flowers performing
        a musical show.  The Tiki Room had a theme song titled
        <em>The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room</em>.  The refrain will give you an idea
        of the song and the show:
      </p>
      <code>
        In the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room,<br/>
        in the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room,<br/>
        all the birds speak words<br/>
        and the flowers croon<br/>
        in the Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room!<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        These words are set to a deplorably catchy tune, by the Sherman
        brothers (Richard and Robert, who were also responsible for the music
        in <em>Mary Poppins</em> and most of the other great Disney works of the 1960's).
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, whenever I visit the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, I can't help hearing
        <em>The Tiki, Tiki, Tiki Room</em> playing in the back of my head.
        And naturally, it's starting to evolve into a <a href="WikiWikiThemeSong.html">WikiWikiThemeSong</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Come on, join in and let's compose the definitive <a href="WikiWikiThemeSong.html">WikiWikiThemeSong</a>!
        The refrain of course begins thus:
      </p>
      <code>
        In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,<br/>
        in the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Web,<br/>
        all the ... <em>hmmmm... you know what? there aren't a lot of good English rhymes for "web"!</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If you've never heard the song, this will probably make very little sense
        to you.  Go find a copy of the Classic Disney Blue CD and listen -- if you
        dare.  (I'm serious, the song is catchy; it may warp your view of the
        <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> forever.)
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>It's a Wiki World after all,</em><br/>
        <em>It's a Wiki World after all,</em><br/>
        <em>It's a Wiki World after all,</em><br/>
        <em>It's a Wiki Wiki World.</em><br/>

        Somebody shoot me.

        <em>The scary thing is, I clicked on </em><a href="WikiWikiThemeSong.html">WikiWikiThemeSong</a> to write, "Nah, it's 'In the Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki, Wiki Room,'" after whater was there. The Tiki Room was the first attraction on the left as you entered the park.<em></em>

        Well, I don't have any Disney records, but these verses are to the tune of "She'll be coming round the mountain when she comes" which is probably more widely known.

        It feels like a song that should be sung as a group, in a Bavarian bierkelle, while swinging (and swigging) large tankards of beer.  Perhaps at the next EuroPLoP...

        The <a href="TheyMightBeGiants.html">TheyMightBeGiants</a> wiki has a tagline randomly chosen from user submissions (like unix 'fortune'), where "wiki" is cleverly substituted into various of their lyrics.  They must be up to several hundred of them now.

        There's an audio clip at the bottom of the page, so you can hear the 1963 original.
