        <a href="GotoStillConsideredHarmful.html">GotoStillConsideredHarmful</a> is a FishBowlSession I organize at <a href="ObjectTechnologyTwoThousand.html">ObjectTechnologyTwoThousand</a>.  One of my reasons to organize this is the recent decision to rename the conference OT (no more objects in the title).

        Ralph and I are working on the 4th edition of the System Envisioning workshop -- special theme Schemata and cognitive systems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am co-organizing a workshop on <a href="SystemEnvisioning.html">SystemEnvisioning</a> with <a href="RalphHodgson.html">RalphHodgson</a> at Oopsla this year. <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> helped us to set up <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>s for it. 
        Visit the <a href="SystemEnvisioningWiki.html">SystemEnvisioningWiki</a> at <a href="http://c2.com:8040/WelcomeVisitors.">http://c2.com:8040/WelcomeVisitors.</a>
        In the afternoon -- at this workshop -- we invite people interested in patterns and wiki-visitors to participate in an experimental <a href="ConceptCafe.html">ConceptCafe</a> where we use lateral thinking and metaphors to <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a> and surface assumptions on patterns, reflect on patterns in different paradigms... Please contact me if you want to participate in either the full workshop or the <a href="ConceptCafe.html">ConceptCafe</a>.

        Proud to announce the start of a <a href="BelgianPatternsGroup.html">BelgianPatternsGroup</a> in Brussels.
        <a href="EuroPlopInfo.html">EuroPlopInfo</a> and ImpressionsOfEuroPlop are hosted at the argo-website.

        I am working as Director of the IS-departement of Argo, Network of 721 schools of the Flemish Government.
      </p>
      <p>
        We developed a framework for modelling the business logic for a wide variety of organizations and application domains (demo presented ECOOP 97, Oopsla96 and 97).
        Documentation is available at <a href="http://www.argo.be/OoFrame">http://www.argo.be/OoFrame</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested in design patterns, but my special interest goes to <a href="OrgPatterns.html">OrgPatterns</a> - in a wider context than IS-departments. I am working and experimenting with creativity techniques, workshops and games in combination with a house-built flexible software-system, our Framework for Adaptive Design. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider it my primary task to help users at Argo imagine a future organization (and IT-system) supporting them in their task 'to make a difference' for their customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have always worked in FaceToFaceProjects, where the user has a face and personal preferences, hopes and fears. I consider the human aspects in this kind of projects more difficult than technological problems.  Misunderstanding and fear of change and the unknown can make or break a project. 
        Many of the problems to be solved are <a href="WickedProblem.html">WickedProblem</a>s and many of our projects are <a href="SensitiveProjects.html">SensitiveProjects</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of these <a href="SensitiveProjects.html">SensitiveProjects</a> are similar to projects in other disciplines. 
        Often core of the problem may be a limited perspective, misunderstanding, emotions, micromanagement, lack of delegation and trust. I am writing patterns ManagingWickedProjects, and I can use help in collecting examples of wicked problems, post mortems, ...  
      </p>
      <p>
        I chaired a panel on the more human aspects of our profession -- both among teams and in interaction with users -- at Ecoop98 this year. 
      </p>

        Shortly we'll use a <a href="ArgoWikiWiki.html">ArgoWikiWiki</a> as a discussion-forum. It written using <a href="VisualWave.html">VisualWave</a>.

        <em>Moved from EuroPlop</em>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          : It was my first Plop, but it will not be the last. I was "briefed" that I would not enjoy since I had not written patterns. Well I did enjoy and I learned a lot, and not only about  patterns. It's a way of working together, of sharing. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I attended the MoreInterestingPatternsGroup but was told that the other groups were at least as interesting. 
        I enjoyed the way of interacting, the company, the open discussion and last but not least the games (see <a href="NewGamesFoundationBooks.html">NewGamesFoundationBooks</a>) lead by Master <a href="GeorgePlatts.html">GeorgePlatts</a>. 
        Enjoyed the update by <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> on the <a href="NatureOfOrder.html">NatureOfOrder</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was fun to learn, at the start of EuroPlop, how a workshop is run by reading <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>'s A Pattern Language for Writers Workshops (see <a href="WritersWorkshopPatternLanguageOverview.html">WritersWorkshopPatternLanguageOverview</a>)
        Back home I found a lot of help practicing project risk reduction patterns from the <a href="RiskManagementCatalog.html">RiskManagementCatalog</a> by <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I studied APatternLanguageForPatternWriting by GerardMezaros. Matter of being prepared in time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The setting is great, so was the organization (by <a href="FrankBuschmann.html">FrankBuschmann</a> and <a href="DirkRiehle.html">DirkRiehle</a>), the food, the beer and the company. 
        And I know some enjoyed Gang of Four TrivialPursuit and are training for next year (or Plop).
