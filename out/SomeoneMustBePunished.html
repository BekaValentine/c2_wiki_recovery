        Someone Must Be Punished
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> A project has failed by some metric--been cancelled, is late or over budget, or fails to meet customer expectations or revenue targets.  The culture is such that <a href="FailureIsUnacceptable.html">FailureIsUnacceptable</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Senior management has noted the failure; and is demanding something be done about it.  Even if there is no clear-cut person responsible for the failure; a <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a> <em>must</em> be selected for punishment--if for no other reason than to be an example for the rest of the team--to make it clear that <a href="FailureIsUnacceptable.html">FailureIsUnacceptable</a>.  For a large team, multiple <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a>s may be required--in some cases, entire project teams are selected.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="FearCulture.html">FearCulture</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Choose a <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a>(s) and punish him/her/them in a visible way--often including termination.  (Think Robert De Niro playing Al Capone in <em>The Untouchables</em>, wielding that baseball bat.  Think Darth Vader killing the Imperial officers' corps, one at a time, in <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>.  You'll get the idea).  Make it clear throughout the organization that their punishment was due to the project failing; and that the next project team that fails will receive similar consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong> The <a href="FearCulture.html">FearCulture</a> is preserved/enhanced.  Employees will take great pains to make sure they don't fail again.  Senior management is mollified (though if too many failures occur in a department, then middle management of that department may find it's <em>their</em> turn).   Morale goes into the toilet; those developers who have a choice frequently leave.  (The ones who are left are the ones who have trouble finding jobs elsewhere).  Massive <a href="SandBagging.html">SandBagging</a> occurs in schedule and budget estimates, as nobody is willing to risk failing to meet these targets.  Management congratulates themselves on their "old-school" approach, thinking that the best way to run an organization is to use the stick (and not the carrot) frequently and visibly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rationale:</strong> It is frequently believed by some managers that whenever a failure occurs, <a href="ThePeopleIsTheProblem.html">ThePeopleIsTheProblem</a>.  Failure is never due to problems with processes, bad luck, or other unforeseen circumstances, but because <em>people are not doing their job</em>.  If there's too much work--they aren't working hard enough.  If there's bugs in the code--the programmers are sloppy.  If a key developer gets hit by a truck (<a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a>) causing a schedule slip--the <a href="ProjectManager.html">ProjectManager</a> should have planned for that contingency.  If the product didn't sell well--it obviously wasn't well-designed.  Etc.  As the <a href="PeopleAreTheProblem.html">PeopleAreTheProblem</a>, the way to correct things is to punish the people and make it clear that failure is not allowed.

        <strong>Related Anti-Patterns:</strong>  This has a lot in common with <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a> in that someone is punished for a project failure (regardless of whether or not they are responsible for that failure).  Key differences though:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a>, punishment is generally less severe; the purpose is to mollify senior managers who know the project is in trouble, and want to see <em>something</em> done about it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In <a href="SomeoneMustBePunished.html">SomeoneMustBePunished</a>; punishment is severe--the purpose is to threaten and intimidate the workforce.
        </li>
      </ul>
