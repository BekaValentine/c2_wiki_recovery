        Open Data Base Connectivity
      </h1>
      <p>
        ODBC (<a href="OpenDataBaseConnectivity.html">OpenDataBaseConnectivity</a>) is an industry standard created about 2 decades ago to standardized the way different tools and languages access and query data from multiple RDBMS vendors. ODBC can be roughly thought of as "FTP for RDBMS".
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a typical flow of an ODBC driver for reference. There are other possible features, but this example focuses on the common basics.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1. Driver receives SQL text from application or tool.
        </li>
        <li>
           2. Driver opens connection to DB server via login etc. (Or fails with an error. It's also possible to keep a a longer-lasting connection open for multiple queries.)
        </li>
        <li>
           3. Driver sends SQL query text to server as-is.
        </li>
        <li>
           4. Driver waits for response from server (or times-out with an error.)
        </li>
        <li>
           5. Driver receives a single <a href="RecordSet.html">RecordSet</a> (virtual table) from the server. The record-set could be a 2D array or list of 1D arrays or maps, but this depends on the driver and/or language. (Record-set is ignored if the SQL is merely a command, such as UPDATE.)
        </li>
        <li>
           6. The application uses the resulting record-set for its needs, often by iterating over the rows of the record-set.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It appears in practice one has to have the database vendor's drivers on both ends of the communication loop. There is no "generic" ODBC driver that can tap into any ODBC-supporting vendor (without programming in vendor-specific protocols). Bummer. Time for a new standard, maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>ODBC </em>'is<em>' the mechanism by which vendor-specific protocols and DBMSes are made (relatively) generic.</em>
