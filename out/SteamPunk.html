        Steam Punk
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SteamPunk.html">SteamPunk</a> is a <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> sub-genre that takes as its jumping off-point the idea that 20th or 21st century technologies can be transliterated into the Victorian era. As such, it is a sub-genre of <a href="AlternateHistory.html">AlternateHistory</a>, although the name is a take-off on <a href="CyberPunk.html">CyberPunk</a>. The novels are usually set sometime between 1820 and 1890.  Some representative novels are:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TheDifferenceEngine.html">TheDifferenceEngine</a>, by William Gibson and Bruce Sterling
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AntiIce.html">AntiIce</a>, by Stephen Baxter
      </p>
      <p>
        The new TV show on SCIFI, The Adventures of Jules Verne, which is quite good.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I might even add to this list the original TV show from the '60's "The Wild, WIld West" and the 1999 movie of the same name.  However, unlike Sam, I wouldn't classify either of these as "quite good".

        Another angle is that <a href="SteamPunk.html">SteamPunk</a> takes a possible turn of history, approximately from the Age of Steam, and translates the <a href="CyberPunk.html">CyberPunk</a> dystopian viewpoint to the resulting alternate history.

        <a href="TheDiamondAge.html">TheDiamondAge</a> by <a href="NealStephenson.html">NealStephenson</a> is a weird twist on <a href="SteamPunk.html">SteamPunk</a>.  In it, a very advanced society (they've mastered <a href="NanoTechnology.html">NanoTechnology</a>, for instance) chooses to live and behave in accordance with Victorian social norms.
