        Argentinian writer, born in Buenos Aires in 1899, died in Geneva June 1986. Wrote esoteric and fantastical stories about infinite involutions and infinities.  All quite short stories, which got shorter as he stripped out the plot for the parable.
        Made his living as Librarian of the National Library of Argentina.

        Borges was obsessed by representation of real things in words. In a sense, this is normal that author pleases the IT people's mind because programming and writing can generate similar ThinkingPatterns. All that is about representing things or in words or in code. The only thing is that when you represent things in words, it is so close to the ways the mind thinks that it can become easily esoteric! -- <a href="OlivierRey.html">OlivierRey</a>
