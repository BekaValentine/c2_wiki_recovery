        Richard Kulisz Baiters Anonymous
      </h1>
      <p>
        My name is <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>...
      </p>
      <p>
        [<em>all: "Hi, Phlip!"</em>]
      </p>
      <p>
        ...and I'm a <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a> baiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been 30 seconds since I last baited <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most people who bait <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>, it was easy to start. I would just edit a page to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           write the least text possible
        </li>
        <li>
           make some implicit or explicit assumption about humanity's innate goodness 
        </li>
        <li>
           see if I could get <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a> to write the maximum number of pages possible in reply.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I understand now the deleterious effect my addiction has caused for myself, my family, and <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'l try to stop.

        Forgive me, <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>, for I have sinned. It's been four weeks since my last confession...

        I think I might be a <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a> baiter.  I'm not sure.  I've posted comments that seem to have enraged him, but he hasn't been signing his responses.  Is he the same guy that argues psychology competes with memetics (<a href="MemesAreNotScience.html">MemesAreNotScience</a>)? -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        It's good to go through at least one RK rant directed towards oneself, if for no better reason than to learn how nasty anonymous online communication can get, and how to immunize yourself against it. See <a href="BozoBit.html">BozoBit</a>.

        Hey, I got flamed by <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a> today!  (And I wasn't even trying!).  What do I win?

        Oh, if only someone had warned me about the dangers of <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a> abuse, I would never have posted a set of links about - horror of horrors - practical implementation issues in a part of his private domain (<a href="OperatingSystemDesigners.html">OperatingSystemDesigners</a>, to be specific). - <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>

        Tell me, is it just me, or is <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a> more like Ignatius Reilly from "ConfederacyOfDunces" than anything human? I bet he still lives with his mother. <grin>

        <em>Great book, but...Not as humorous as it used to be; if you look at studies, people these days live with their parents, out of economic necessity, far more frequently, and to a much later age, than was common just one generation ago. By using old standards for humor, you may unintentionally insult without good cause a large percentage of younger (Gen-X or whatever) lurkers.</em>

        <em>And of course, we know that that book would not even exist (for us readers) were it not for the author's mother's dedicated efforts to have it published posthumously, which perhaps makes that book even less appropriate for sourcing that kind of humor even aside from the first point.</em>
