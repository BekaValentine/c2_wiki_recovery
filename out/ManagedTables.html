        Managed Tables
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ManagedTables.html">ManagedTables</a> was a storage management technique used in
        <a href="GordonLetwin.html">GordonLetwin</a>'s 8080 Basic interpreter.  
        It also was a standard library component
        in the Purdue Mace OS and used in many utilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        These days software generally relies on large amounts of real or
        virtual memory and usually manages all dynamic storage
        out of a single heap.  Managed tables may still be suitable
        where
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Memory is fixed and limited
        </li>
        <li>
           It is impossible or impractical to stage data to disk
        </li>
        <li>
           Dynamic data can be classified into a small number of homogeneous items
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where it makes sense, managed tables have a lot less storage
        overhead, as the overhead is constant per table rather than per item.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managed Tables are implemented in a contiguous section of
        RAM.  Typically all the spare RAM after loading your program
        is allocated to managed tables.  
        Within that, 
        each of the tables (data types) to be managed are
        assigned a fixed relative order.
        The table manager maintains a pointer or index to 
        the start of each individual table.
        When a table grows in size, all the following tables
        are block-moved down to make room.
        Usually, the moved tables move down so that all the 
        available free space is now part of the table which
        most recently grew.
      </p>
      <p>
        The table manager provides functions for
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           adding a new item to a table
        </li>
        <li>
           deleting an item to a table
        </li>
        <li>
           accessing the ith item in a table
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fancy implementations additionally provide
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           creating and removing a table
        </li>
        <li>
           maintaining sort order of elements in  a table
        </li>
        <li>
           managing tables consisting of variable length items (of a known format)
        </li>
      </ul>

        <a href="GregMansfield.html">GregMansfield</a> wrote a managed table package for the
        CDC6000 series.  It's hard these days to think of 
        managed tables as an achievement.  You have to remember
        that back then machine words were long and scarce.  
        A UniversalDataStructure
        had to deal with BitPacking and do so quickly with 
        word addressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect Gordon picked up the ideas
        from Greg's package, possibly through RossGarmoe who was
        a <a href="DualMace.html">DualMace</a> heavy.  Gordon later brought Ross into the
        os group at Microsoft.

        The SinclairZX81 and <a href="SinclairSpectrum.html">SinclairSpectrum</a> Basic's also managed memory in this
        way.  The SinclairZX81 even used <a href="ManagedTables.html">ManagedTables</a> for its display file.
        If there was nothing on the screen, the machine would store just one
        newline for each screen line.  When text was added to the screen, it would
        expand the <a href="ManagedTables.html">ManagedTables</a> character by character.

        Venn implemented, as part of their set-theoretic database software for the PC, a library called Space Manager.  Space Manager used a couple of dedicated pages of PC memory to provide access to a very large collection of tables.  Tables could grow and shrink, and could be added and removed.  Space Manager was basically <a href="ManagedTables.html">ManagedTables</a> with disk-based virtual memory.

        The reason you never heard of this is that we only had a very small number of very happy customers.  Next time I'll partner with a sales guy, not another techie.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
