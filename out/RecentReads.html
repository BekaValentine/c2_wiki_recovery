        Recent Reads

      <p>
        I happened to be rereading some of the old traffic about the <a href="BackStack.html">BackStack</a> approach to managing wiki content, and the idea of creating a <a href="RecentReads.html">RecentReads</a> page occurred to me. It seems blindingly obvious, is there some reason it won't work?
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is to maintain <a href="RecentReads.html">RecentReads</a> precisely like <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, but using the load, rather than store, operation to trigger each entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I'll try it on my own Wiki's and see how it feels.
