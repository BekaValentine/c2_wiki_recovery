      <p>
        <a href="WindowDressing.html">WindowDressing</a> (a cousin of <a href="YouDontNeedItAnymore.html">YouDontNeedItAnymore</a>) is frilly, extraneous code that dresses up existing code, without adding any value.  <a href="WindowDressing.html">WindowDressing</a> code should be refactored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example (pardon the VB syntax but I took this stinker from real code submitted for <a href="CodeReview.html">CodeReview</a>):
      </p>
      <code>
        Dim i As Integer<br/>
        For i = 1 To 3<br/>
        Select Case i<br/>
        Case 1<br/>
        ' first block of code<br/>
        Case 2<br/>
        ' second block of code<br/>
        Case 3<br/>
        ' third block of code<br/>
        End Select<br/>
        Next i<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Refactored solution:
      </p>
      <code>
        ' first block of code<br/>
        ' second block of code<br/>
        ' third block of code<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note: the variable i was never used in the code blocks within the Select statement, so other than reformatting and removing the <a href="WindowDressing.html">WindowDressing</a> code, the underlying code -- which provided all the functionality -- is unblemished.  
      </p>

        <em>I've seen something similar in C, except that the loop had an extra termination condition, allowing you to bail out of a multi-step process.  It's apparently called a "stepper loop".  I think that it's still a smell, though.</em>
