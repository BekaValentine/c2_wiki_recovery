        Whether or not there is a spoon is irrelevant. What matters is the belief.

           Descartes (There isn't anything else, either. Except him) <em>Minor nit - Descartes started from cogito ergo sum ("I think, therefore I am"), but later expanded it to encompass an external world</em> That's actually quite the opposite... after discarding the rest of the world and getting that nothing else existed appart from him, and knowing that if he was the only thing that existed and that he was aware of himself, he came to the conclusion in his 3rd meditation to the conclusion "I think, therefore I am".

        Granted this spoon even existed in any world, the spork is a much more efficient tool.

        Boy: Do not try to think outside of the box. That's impossible. Instead only try to realize the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neo: What truth?
      </p>
      <p>
        Boy: There is no box.
      </p>
      <p>
        Neo: No box? Then what am I sitting on?
      </p>
      <p>
        Boy: You are missing the point of the lesson.

      <p>
        Neo: There's a lesson in all this gibberish?
      </p>
      <p>
        Boy: Just shut up and focus on the truth, willya?!? <em><aside, to self></em> Sheesh! Some people's kids.

        If, in truth there is no spoon, then any attempt to bend the spoon validates the truth of the spoon.  <em>That is why you bend yourself instead of the spoon.</em>

        Spoons make excellent murder weapons because the victim looks like they died of smileys.
