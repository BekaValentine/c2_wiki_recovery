        How can one begin to describe <a href="PrologProgrammers.html">PrologProgrammers</a> here, there or anywhere?
      </p>
      <code>
        ? describe(prologProgrammers).<br/>
        no.<br/>
      </code>

        Perhaps we can simply list ourselves in a fashion that is self documenting.

        How about, "They are too lazy to implement the solution themselves, so only want to supply the criteria to the machine and have the machine figure out how to actually carry it out." :-)

        Well, I for one have been guilty at times of spending more effort trying to automate something rather than just buck up and do it by hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Quite. But if someone else had spent the effort to automate it before, you might not have to do it by hand.</em>
