      <p>
        <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> Classes don't support static methods, or a mechanism equivalent to overriding new(), so singletons can't be implemented in the way you would in C++.

        <strong>Context:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You are in a context where you would normally use a singleton but the implementation is in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Resorting to global variables has all the problems of correctness and maintainability that singletons were designed to prevent
        </li>
        <li>
          Rewriting the code in something other than <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> is elegant and conducive to sanity yet all too often infeasible due to outside constraints
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementation details that depend on the programmer rather than language features need to be made transparent yet avoid overload.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solutions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Make a "private" implementation class, and use a <a href="FactoryMethod.html">FactoryMethod</a> on a general "singleton factory" class to create it.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> class controls creation of implementation class, in ActiveX DLL for enforcement.  <em>(from the </em><a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> VisualBasicDesignPatterns book)<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           HandleBody -- multiple "handle" instances all point to a single "body" instance; the singleton.
        </li>

        <em>But singletons </em>'can<strong> be implemented in </strong><a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>. It's just a different technique but the principle it's the same. All it really takes is a GlobalMultiuse class in the same ActiveX DLL as your Singleton class and a static module. I've described it below.<em> :)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have found that you can fake a lot of things using the different instancing properties of classes and standard modules in in </em><a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a><em></em>

        <strong>Problem:</strong>
        Ensure a class only has one instance, and provide a global point of access to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong>
        You are in a context where you would normally use a singleton but the implementation is in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Implementation:</strong>
        I don't know if someone came up with this one before me, but I recently had a programming problem in a project that quite fits the context and forces described for the singleton pattern in many online catalogs. So here's my take on it:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If your target class isn't already in an ActiveX DLL project, create one and move your class into it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make your singleton-to-be class <em></em><a href="PublicNotCreatable.html">PublicNotCreatable</a><em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Add a new standard module to your ActiveX DLL and declare a new variable. i.e. if I'm dealing with a <em>CSesion</em> class, then I'd use:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        Public g_oSesion As CSesion<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Create a new class (which I personally call "CAccesor", unless I have previously created a "CCreator" one, in which case I'll "recycle" the previous one) and make it <em></em>GlobalMultiuse<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Add a new public <strong>Property Get</strong> procedure, which will grant public access to your singleton class. Using the example above, I'd use something like:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        Public Property Get Sesion() As CSesion<br/>
        If g_oSesion is Nothing Then<br/>
        Set g_oSesion = New CSesion<br/>
        ' add any initialization code here,<br/>
        ' or better yet, <a href="IntroduceCreationObject.html">IntroduceCreationObject</a> here<br/>
        End If<br/>
        Set Sesion = g_oSesion<br/>
        End Property<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Finally, make sure you destroy your Singleton properly. A new <strong>Class_Terminate</strong> event handler will do nicely here:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        Private Sub Class_Terminate()<br/>
        Set g_oSesion = Nothing<br/>
        End Sub<br/>
      </code>

        <strong>Private implementation class, with a </strong><a href="FactoryMethod.html">FactoryMethod</a>:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create the classes which should be singletons as standard classes named in the form <strong>privateSomeClass</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Create a module called <strong>Singletons</strong> and create a GlobalAccessor for each singleton thusly:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        public property get <strong>publicSomeClass</strong>() as privateSomeClass<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        static oInstance as privateSomeClass<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        if oInstance is nothing then<br/>
        set oInstance = new privateSomeClass<br/>
        end if<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        set publicClassName = oInstance<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        end property<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Heavily document that classes named in the form privateSomeClass, should only be accessed through their corresponding publicSomeClass interface.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Call methods and set properties of <strong>publicSomeClass</strong> in your code in the usual way:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        <strong>publicSomeClass</strong>.someMethod<br/>
        <strong>publicSomeClass</strong>.someProperty = "someString"<br/>
        Set someReference = <strong>publicSomeClass</strong>.someObjectProperty<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Additional thought:  Make this an </em>ActiveX DLL, and you can set the Instancing property to <a href="PublicNotCreatable.html">PublicNotCreatable</a>, preventing DLL users from violating your creation rules.  Consider setting the <a href="ThreadingModel.html">ThreadingModel</a> to SingleThread too.<em></em>

        <strong></strong>HandleBody approach:<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with this approach is it still relies on programmer's discipline not to instantiate the actual "private" class. I turn it around, and basically use the handle/body approach.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Implement the actual class as module (MySingletonBody), with all data members private to the module. Provide access functions for all "public" properties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Create a class MySingleton, and delegate all methods and properties to those in the body module.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If garbage collection is required, perform reference counting in the Initialize and terminate events of the class. The body can release its resources on the count going to zero, and re-acquire them when the count becomes non-zero.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result has many advantages
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Programmers can <em>not</em> create more than one instance as all the data is effectively static to the body module.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Garbage collection is still possible
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You can get the "instance" reference by simply creating a instance of the handle class.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is relatively simple to move from a singleton to an ordinary class at a later date.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Implements feature is now available to allow you to  have polymorphic singletons.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you define this in an OLE server, you can export the handle class and get a PC-wide singleton (useful for sharing COM ports between apps).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The only thing I can not find an easy way to do is to allow the classes to raise events. The only solution I have is for the body to maintain a collection of all created handles and call a"private" function in each instance telling them to raise their event.

        Here's how you do it. Slightly long winded, perhaps, but it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a new ActiveX DLL. Create in this your Singleton class with all its methods etc. Make sure you mark it 'Public not creatable'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a .BAS module with one function:
      </p>
      <p>
        Public Function getSingleton() as NameOfSingletonClass
      </p>
      <code>
        Static Singleton as NameOfSingletonClass<br/>
        If Singleton is Nothing then<br/>
        set Singleton= New NameOfSingletonClass<br/>
        ' add any initialisation calls you want<br/>
        endif<br/>
        Set getSingleton = Singleton<br/>
        Exit Function<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        End Function
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a new class; ensure it is marked MultiUse. Give it one method:
      </p>
      <p>
        public property Get SingletonInstance() as NameOfSingletonClass
      </p>
      <code>
        Set SingletonInstance = getSingleton<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        end property
      </p>
      <p>
        Add a reference to this AxDLL in your VB project and there's your singleton. What's so hard about that?
      </p>
      <p>
        Took me < 5 mins to type into Wiki; add in compiles etc and there is about 10 mins overhead.
