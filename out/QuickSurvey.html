        This tag would not be needed if there are frequent participation in a survey. However given peoples reluctance in using <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a> in posts, and that C2 is currently still in "restricted mode", there can be days/weeks in between entries made to a survey. So the original author may wish to increase awareness of such "open surveys" by adding this tag. -- dl
