        Oh dear. We don't learn from past mistakes, we don't even learn from past sucesses.

        Databases are on my mind at the moment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> is on the warpath, trying to get the RDBMS community to wake up to what the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> can do for you, if only you had any tools that implemented it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If I've understood correctly, he claims that a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> that worked the way Codd always wanted them to would be object oriented alread (and OO is orthogonal to ER). Meanwhile, as reported on <a href="LetsUseAnObjectOrientedDatabase.html">LetsUseAnObjectOrientedDatabase</a>, using an OODBMS can break your company. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there's the various ideas for a <a href="XmlDatabase.html">XmlDatabase</a>. So, hierarchical and network databases return from the dead. The relational wonks who thought OODBMS's were a dangerous step back towards CODASYL will flip when they catch wind of this. If only all those GUI toolkits had a "relation" component instead of a "tree" component...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh, I would love to hear more on that previous sentence.  Tell us more about "relation" vs. "tree"!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, I've worked on a project that started with a system that hideously abused Netscape's LDAP server because it was the only hierarchical DB they had around (and they had to lie about what it was, since that firm had a one product  policy and their "database" was Oracle). An here we go round again. What is it with us?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>"What is it with us?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OneSizeFitsAll.html">OneSizeFitsAll</a>, that's what.  Each of these database models have their place as solutions to particular classes of problems.  For some applications, it is appropriate to use more than one model.  Advocating a single model as the <a href="OneTrueWay.html">OneTrueWay</a> is what keeps up on this hamster wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        I so agree with that.  Unfortunately, some people seem to think that all data must be relationally queryable, so they pan all other solutions as inferior.  Sometimes, a network database is better you know.  Relational isn't the answer the everything you know.
