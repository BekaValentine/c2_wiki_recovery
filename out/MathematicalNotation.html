        Our <a href="MathematicalNotation.html">MathematicalNotation</a> has come a long way in only a few centuries. This footnote from a history of probability is instructive:

        "To illustrate the difficulties... [A] multplication sum is written as follows:-
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          p.R6 4.m.R6 Productum 16.m.6 10.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        or, as might now be written, :-
      </p>
      <code>
        (4 + sqrt(6)) (4 - sqrt(6)) = 16 - 6 = 10.<br/>
      </code>

        There are still many missing and cumbersome constructs in modern math notation. See <a href="http://www.jsoftware.com/books/help/camn/camn.htm">http://www.jsoftware.com/books/help/camn/camn.htm</a> for an excellent paper on the subject. -- <a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>

        <em>Iverson has proposed quite a few new notations beyond those mentioned in that paper, and Knuth has exploited the flexibility he has with </em>TeX to begin using some of those notations in his books and papers (beginning, I think, with Concrete Mathematics) in an attempt to popularize them. -- <a href="GlennVanderburg.html">GlennVanderburg</a><em></em>
