        Dilberts Salary Theorem
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Dilbert's Salary Theorem</em> states that <strong>Engineers and scientists can never earn as much as business executives and sales people.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This theorem can now be supported by proof based on the following two postulates:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Postulate 1: <strong>Knowledge is Power.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Postulate 2: <strong>Time is Money.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As every engineer knows: Power = Work / Time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Knowledge = Power, then Knowledge = Work/Time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since Time = Money, then Knowledge = Work/Money.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solving for Money, we get Money = Work / Knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, as Knowledge approaches zero, Money approaches infinity,
        regardless of the amount of work done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusion: ... left to the reader.
