        Investigating Vandals
      </h1>
      <p>
        If <a href="WikiVandals.html">WikiVandals</a> are <strong>persistent</strong>, it may be necessary to complain to their ISP, but this is rarely the case.

      <p>
        If it seems to be needed, use the <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> feature to find the IP address of someone who changed a page.  You can then find out what domain name that is and other information using <a href="WhoIs.html">WhoIs</a> (which can be optionally added to reports on <a href="WikiVandals.html">WikiVandals</a>). Complaints can usually be sent to "abuse@<domain>". Some ISPs even have toll-free numbers where we can phone to report abuse; some of us might be interested in phoning if it seems the vandal is particularly offensive.

        An alternative to this approach has been suggested: <a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a>, take a deep breath, and let it go.
