      <p>
        Abbreviated NaN, Not-a-Number is used to signal a mathematical error where other error reporting mechanisms are not available. Any mathematical operation performed on NaN generally results in NaN. This propagates the error.

        Another version, defined by the <a href="IeeeSevenFiftyFour.html">IeeeSevenFiftyFour</a> standard, is known as the <a href="SignallingNan.html">SignallingNan</a>; mathematical operations performed on <a href="SignallingNan.html">SignallingNan</a> result in a processor exception being raised; rather than NaN being returned on a result (testing for NaN being an exception).
      </p>
      <p>
        The comparison of two NaN values always returns false. The test for NaN-ness must be implemented as a library function.
      </p>
      <p>
        The IEEE floating-point representation of NaN is an exponent of all 1s and a non-zero mantissa. Zero mantissa with all 1s in the exponent represents Infinity. Some language runtimes and/or <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>s have been known to overload the numerous possible representations of NaN to stash away <a href="TagBit.html">TagBit</a>s and other stuff - you could encode an entire 32-bit pointer plus change within a double-precision NaN.
