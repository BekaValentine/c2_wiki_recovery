        Pay No Attention To The Man Behind The Curtain
      </h1>
      <p>
        A line from <em></em><a href="TheWizardOfOz.html">TheWizardOfOz</a>.<em> But also it started me thinking...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some ideas that can be categorized as <a href="WrongButIrrefutable.html">WrongButIrrefutable</a>. I don't mean that they're <em>actually</em> irrefutable, because then how would one claim that they were wrong? I mean that whoever holds these ideas loses the ability to refute them even though they're wrong - precisely <em>because</em> he holds them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of these are the kinds of ideas that tell one how to direct one's attention - <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a>s. We all know that optimists and pessimists tend to find the information that supports their optimistic or pessimistic views, while overlooking or trivializing the information that would support the opposite view - and yet optimism and pessimism are only two examples of <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every religion or philosophy that has ever been proposed has an <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a> somewhere within.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a> has a rationale. And yet the danger exists that any <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a> has the <em>potential</em> to direct one's attention <em>away</em> from whatever information would show that the rationale is flawed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not possible to avoid having any <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a>, because, just as the human eye has a fovea that has to be directed toward whatever the human wants to look at, the human mind also has to focus its attention on whatever the human wants to think about, in order to be of any use to that human. Nor is it possible to have an <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a> that doesn't ignore <em>anything.</em> One cannot pay attention to <em>everything.</em> One can only spread oneself so thin.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> is a kind of <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a>. It has the virtue of deliberately doing the opposite of the aforementioned dangerous thing -- it actually encourages one to pay attention to information which might refute the ideas it produces, as well as that which might support them. That's why the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> produces results that work in the real world. But even the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> cannot admit the possibility of any information that would bring the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> <em>itself</em> into doubt. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this lead to PhilosophicalSkepticism? I think not - even PhilosophicalSkepticism cannot admit the possibility of any information that would bring the skepticism into doubt and perhaps allow certainty somewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusions from all this?

           Conception shapes perception, and vice versa.

           An "honest" <a href="AttentionDirector.html">AttentionDirector</a> will tell you exactly what it is asking you to <em>ignore</em> and upon what grounds it can maintain that it is safe for you to ignore that information.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           In the absence of such an explanation, you should try to create one - you should always consider whatever information you have been ignoring, and ask yourself whether it is a good idea to ignore it and why. If you can't come up with one then you should consider directing your attention in some other way.

        But it doesn't matter if they actually exist. Even if they don't, but the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> works for us, it works as well. -- <a href="NikitaBelenki.html">NikitaBelenki</a>

        This page seems <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, but might be salvageable when presented with regard to invisibilty or transparency. In software development, it is not always necessary to know of the internal operational details of systems and interfaces in order to utilize them.
