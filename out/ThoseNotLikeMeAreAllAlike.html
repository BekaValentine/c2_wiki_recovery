        The fallacy that A!=B and A!=C, therefore B=C.

        Often used in political debates. Speaker asserts that two political parties/persons/factions are a) different from him (or his party); and b) alike in some way (e.g., "leftist" or "right-wing"), so they are the same or equivalent. Frequently, B is the speaker's opponent (or the opponent's political affiliation), or something else that the speaker wishes to discredit, and C is a widely-repudiated group or individual that represents an extreme viewpoint (Nazis/Hitler, Communists/Stalin, the Klan, bin Laden, etc.). Purpose is to associate B's views (which may be regarded as "reasonable") with those of C.

        <em>The enemy of my enemy is my friend. Sounds like a plan for foreign policy to me.</em> Sounds like polarization to me.  <em>My favourite term for it is "triangulation".</em>

        History is full of examples where a nation had two sets of opponents which were themselves at war with each other. Alliances and coalitions are the exception, not the rule. -- <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>

        Example: Minivans are vehicles, but different from Cars.  Trucks are vehicles, but different Cars.  Minivans and Trucks are both not Cars.  Therefore, Minivans are a lot like Trucks.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see that this reasoning is flawed, substitute Bicycle for Truck.

        This has a corollary.  I disagree with both B and C.  However, the opinions of B and C contradict each other.  Therefore they are both wrong and I'm right.

        See in the wild with: Republicans are not liberals. Republicans are not Democrats. Therefore liberals are Democrats. <em>(I'm not sure if Democrat or liberal is the more "derogatory" term)</em>
