        They were pragmatists who converted vision to reality. While others thought about it, proposed its possibility, made sketches and even some tried in converting their dreams, the Wrights succeeded and were recognized for their success and are popularly credited with the first american flight. Every age needs those who not only think it can be, but also move on to make it real. Who as Picard says in nearly every episode "Engage" - who move beyond experimentation into engagement, innovation, and implementation.

While rivals were barely getting off the ground, the Wrights were exhibiting their ability to bank, turn, do figure-eights, and for increasing longer periods of time.
