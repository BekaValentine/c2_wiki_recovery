        Void Func Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        A minimalist test framework.
        Each test case is essentially a free void (void),
        i.e. a free function with nor arguments returning nothing.
      </p>
      <code>
        void<br/>
        test_foo()<br/>
        {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        TEST_ASSERT("TEST PASSED");<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Test pass/fail is indicated by 
        printing,
        to stdout/stderr/cout/cerr,
        and/or by throwing an exception or exiting
        (with a nonzero exit code).
      </p>
      <p>
        PRO: minimalist. Few assumptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        CON: perhaps too minimalist.
      </p>

        It is very minimalist, but you might be afraid of painting yourself
        into a corner. Consider: how easy or difficult would it be to 
        convert these testing functions to classes? You probably already
        have a script that pulls out all the function names, so it is
        trivial to create the boilerplate class declarations.
        The function definition then has to be changes to seomthing like
      </p>
      <code>
        void test_foo::run() { ... }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Seems also within the realm of textual substitution. So perhaps 
        changing this later on is not too expensive.
