        Work In Progress
      </h1>
      <p>
        Since Wiki provides the ability to edit any <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>, and is therefore constantly evolving, some consider every <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> to be a <a href="WorkInProgress.html">WorkInProgress</a>. <a href="WorkInProgress.html">WorkInProgress</a> is often used more specifically as a <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a> on a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> that is currently under development.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most obvious sign of a <a href="WorkInProgress.html">WorkInProgress</a> wiki page is that much of the content is in <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> conversation. As development nears "completion", <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> comments are sometimes moved into a new <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> of the same title with the suffix <em>Discussion</em>. The valuable content from the discussion is then refactored back into the original page. In many cases, this refactoring is comprehensive enough that the discussion page becomes unnecessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, a product or project past the inception stage but prior to the completion stage is also considered to be a <a href="WorkInProgress.html">WorkInProgress</a>.

           Be wary of <a href="DeathMarch.html">DeathMarch</a> projects.  They kill your creative side.

        My Convention - some guidelines
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use this as a TransientTag:
          <ul>
            <li>
                to indicate a page which is constructed and is in the process of editing.
            </li>
            <li>
                applied to the top of such a page, is followed by Name and date of <a href="WorkInProgress.html">WorkInProgress</a>, and is separated from the work by a horizonal rule. It will be removed when current work is complete. Sometimes within an hour, never less than a few hours. 
            </li>
            <li>
               with the hope that when wikizens see this as the first thing on a page, that they will refrain from commenting for at least an <strong>hour or two</strong>. Its use should not be abused and should only be used by an individual on <strong>one page at a time</strong>. 
            </li>
          </ul>
