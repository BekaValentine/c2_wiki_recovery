        Data Type
      </h1>
      <p>
        '<a href="DataType.html">DataType</a>' is a type that abstracts a measurement, description, or property of something (a world, an object, a relationship, a region, a period - 'something' is left intentionally vague). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Common examples include dates, times, counts, distances, volumes, current, resistance, temperature, colors. More exotic forms include voices (for sound), wave-forms, images, graphs, names and addresses, etc. In all cases, they are used in modeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        One often simplifies these by representing them into more generic 'integers', 'numbers', 'strings', and structures consisting of more than one such element. Such simplifications allow for more general-purpose modeling, but have some costs in terms of safety (might add a distance to a volume), convenience (a model that only understands 'realnum' cannot add '2 inches + 3 meters', for example, or readily switch from feet to miles in a display), and specialized operations (adding two 'volumes in decibels' to get a new volume with the correct log_10(10^(dB1/10)+10^(dB2/10)), multiplying two distances to get an area, adding a number of days to a date).
      </p>
      <p>
        One might refer to 'data type' as opposed to 'type' to help distinguish them from 'interfaces' (which are more behavior oriented - contravariance, covariance, invariants, preconditions, postconditions), 'linear typing' (which has to do with number of references to a structure), 'effect typing' which analyzes what sort of side-effects an operation might have (arbitrary delay, non-termination, exceptions or checked-exceptions, side-effects), phantom types (used for zero-knowledge proofs protocol security), and so on. <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> has a much broader application than data-level safety.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the fact that <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> has a broader application, in practice most <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a>s focus very heavily on <a href="DataType.html">DataType</a>.
