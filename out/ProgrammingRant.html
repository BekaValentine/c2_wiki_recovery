           Programming is about creating emergent structure with an evolving goal in mind.
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming is both about breaking existing symmetries and spontaneously creating new symmetries.
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming is about the creation, evolution and annihilation of patterns that serve as generators of software forms.
        </li>
        <li>
           Pattern languages are autocatalytic chains of generative rules that iteratively, through the application of one pattern at a time, create new forms.
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming is about genetic-like trials and errors that maximize a "fitness landscape" through better and better prototypes that grow through a process similar to morphogenesis.  Testing simply sets the expectation of what prototypes have minimally fulfilled a utility function.
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming is self-organization that produces self-consistent knowledge structures.
        </li>
        <li>
           Programming is better served by multi-paradigmic programming-genetic pool that includes constructs from all programming paradigms: logical, functional and prescriptive (OO, structured, etc.).

        <strong>Another Rant by a Different Individual</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming is not an end in itself.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is to the programmer.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No one wants a software program.  Programming is about developing a tool that makes some job easier to accomplish.  It is a support task subservient to the needs of the end user.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wrong, while the result may be useful, many programmers themselves enjoy the creative process as a craft.  To that end, we often write things that have already been written both for fun and for learning.  Programming is its own reward!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Programming is its own reward <em>to you,</em> but certainly <em>not</em> to anybody who is paying for the results. Most of us on this Wiki do this stuff for a living, and so need to meet the needs and expectations of those who are paying for our time and productivity.
