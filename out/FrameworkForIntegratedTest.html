        Framework For Integrated Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        At the agile testing workshop I described a style of automated
        acceptance testing that I've done repeatedly over the years. Each
        implementation has been identical in spirit but as unique in detail as
        the programs they test. I've captured these differences in a family of
        "fixtures" that interpret tabulated facts extracted from documents.

        I've put together a beta distribution which I've licensed under gpl and
        distribute from a wiki.

        <li>
            <a href="http://fit.c2.com">http://fit.c2.com</a> -- the <a href="FitWiki.html">FitWiki</a>

        I call it the Framework for Integrated Test. It supports integration at
        two levels: test development and test execution. Test development is
        integrated with specification (SpecificationByExample, Martin called
        it.) Test execution is integrated in that test data flows through
        fixtures to the same interfaces developers use while programming.
      </p>

        I am eager to work with large projects that are willing to give such a
        framework a try and are willing to talk about their experience.

        I may be stating the obvious, but this is awfully similar to <a href="DavidParnas.html">DavidParnas</a>' ProgramFunctionTables which he proposes for specifying requirements.  --<a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a>

        It seems that FIT development is frozen since 22 Dec 2002. What's wrong?

        If you are interested, I wrote an Eclipse plug-in for FIT.

        I'm proud to mention that there's also C++ port of Fit in case you have some agile C++ to do.
