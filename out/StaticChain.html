      <p>
        An implementation technique for <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extracted from <a href="GlobalVariablesConsideredHarmful.html">GlobalVariablesConsideredHarmful</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an example, in a hypothetical language very similar to <em>(but not the same as)</em> <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, but extended to have complete lexical scoping:
      </p>
      <code>
        typedef (*Func<strong>'Ptr)();</strong><br/>
        Func<strong>'Ptr   /* f returns pointer to function */</strong><br/>
        f() {<br/>
        Func<strong>'Ptr ret;</strong><br/>
        int i = 0;<br/>
        /* here is a lexically scoped func that accesses i */<br/>
        void g() { printf("%d\n", i); }<br/>
        g();         /* ==> 0 */<br/>
        ++i;<br/>
        g();         /* ==> 1 */<br/>
        return g;    /* return ptr to nested function g from f */<br/>
        }<br/>
        main() {<br/>
        Func<strong>'Ptr h;</strong><br/>
        h = f();     /* prints 0, then 1 */<br/>
        (*h)();      /* indirect call to g(), prints 1 */<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When f() is called via the Func<strong>'Ptr h in main(), g() still has valid access to the stack variable i in f(), which means that the C compiler is not allowed to throw away the stack frame(s) created by f() when f() returns. Also, if f() is recursive, the i that g() references must be the one in the most recent stack frame created by f().</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In an implementation using <a href="StaticChain.html">StaticChain</a><strong>'s, both calls to g() from within f(), in addition to whatever else, would get an implicit pointer to f()'s </strong><a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a> passed in; the reference to i within g() goes through this pointer - this is what a <a href="StaticChain.html">StaticChain</a> is. (A "display" uses an external array to contain the stack of back pointers up the lexical structure).
      </p>
      <p>
        Additional nastiness - a <a href="CactusStack.html">CactusStack</a>, heap-allocated <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a><strong>'s, or other hacks, are needed to handle h() - which is a </strong><a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="StaticChain.html">StaticChain</a>/display is required for any sort of lexical scoping, even in the absence of <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a><strong>'s.</strong>

      <p>
        After changed the printf, I cannot get the result: "indirect call to g(), prints 1", is this a suitable example?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is my test:
      </p>
      <code>
        [root@test tmp]# ./f<br/>
        0<br/>
        1<br/>
        1<br/>
        [root@test tmp]# ./g<br/>
      </code>

        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        -1073749304 0xbfffe2c8<br/>
        [root@test tmp]# diff f.c g.c<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          c7
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        <      void g() { printf("%d\n", i); }<br/>
        ---<br/>
        >      void g() { printf("%d %p\n", i, &i); }<br/>
        [root@test tmp]# <br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, you need to use a language other than C.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        No C compilers support this; the C standard does not include nested procedures.
      </p>
      <p>
        gcc provides nested procedures anyway but even there the above fails
        for the value of i is in the stack frame that disappeared as f returned.
        The languages Scheme and <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> makes programs like this work.
        I know no high performance language where this works.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> is fairly high-performance nowadays - benchmarks show speeds within 40% of optimized C and well ahead of Java and <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a>.  <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> also provides <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s, and it can often beat C in speed.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(I was going to add Algol and Pascal too, but the original comment is referring to 'h = f()', which is a downward lexical closure.  Algol, AFAIK, does not support those.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Can <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> still beat C when using downward lexical closures? (Assuming they are explicitly created in C, which means they arn't real, of course. (Can one do it without malloc?)) I would think that <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> gets a lot of it's speed from recognizing when it can generate code in a C style (whatever that means)
