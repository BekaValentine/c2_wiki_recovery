        P.S. Amazing community here. I got three emails from old friends today based solely on the edits to this page.

        And just wait 'til you hear from the friends you didn't know you had! I picked up my first edition copy of <a href="ObjectOrientedProgrammingAnEvolutionaryApproach.html">ObjectOrientedProgrammingAnEvolutionaryApproach</a> just after it was published. My first reading of it (in one sitting) still rests among my top ten programming <a href="AhHa.html">AhHa</a> experiences. -- <a href="StephenHumphrey.html">StephenHumphrey</a>

        Brad, LTNS. I took your Objective-C course at the same time as Gerry Weinberg and - oh, what's his name - the former NSA guy. It'll come to me. Anyway, welcome. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Indeed! Drop me a line and bring me up to date. Great to hear from you again! I think you mean Kurt Schmucker, now at Apple last I heard. <em>(From an eavesdropper via recent changes - Kurt Schmucker! I've been trying to remember that name for years, so I could reference the first time I was introduced to OOP - his writings from early Apple Mac publications - and a later book, I think.)</em>

        <a href="ObjectOrientedProgrammingAnEvolutionaryApproach.html">ObjectOrientedProgrammingAnEvolutionaryApproach</a>: the most fun I ever had from such a thin book! I had a Tektronix smalltalk machine (4317), (68020 based). I wrote an obj-c preprocessor and implemented much of the Smalltalk class hierarchy in obj-c. I also added a non-stop garbage collector. I still think it was the most efficient development environment I ever used.  <a href="mailto:eparker@zyvex.com.">mailto:eparker@zyvex.com.</a>

        Planning the Software Industrial Revolution,

        "The possibility of a software industrial revolution, in which programmers stop coding everything from scratch and begin assembling applications from well-stocked catalogs of reusable software components, is an enduring dream that continues to elude our grasp..."

        Hi, Brad, LTNS.. What happened to the <a href="SoftwareIndustrialRevolution.html">SoftwareIndustrialRevolution</a>? I share your belief that it is definitely on its way, but, ten years later, it still hasn't put in an appearance!  --<a href="PaulMorrison.html">PaulMorrison</a>

        My second book, "Superdistribution; Objects as Property on the Electronic Frontier" addresses this. In short, there is no scalable way to get paid for small-granuarity objects 
        made of bits. Without that, no markets, no components, no change.

        Hey Brad ... I was just doing some stuff with Lakoff and "framing"; coincidentally here, rereading pages related to threading and such, found your link to "Social Construction of Reality". Coincidental for another reason: I just recovered working notes for a paper on "Postmodernist Challenges to Historiography" (the title was supposed to be satirical); I just uploaded them to use as an experiment in use of WikiThink, see <a href="http://bentrem.sycks.net/wiki/index.php?title=History:PoMoHistoriography">http://bentrem.sycks.net/wiki/index.php?title=History:PoMoHistoriography</a> --<a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a>
