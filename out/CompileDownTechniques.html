        Compile Down Techniques
      </h1>
      <p>
        I thought I'd start here asking about this topic...  What I am looking for is a way to describe a high-level design idea, particularly a communication protocol between objects, and have it compiled down into the classes of the objects referenced.  I have finally reached the point where I am no longer willing to recode the same communication pattern over and over is ever-so-slightly different contexts and classes.  In Smalltalk, etc., you edit the class's behavior directly.  What <a href="CompileDownTechniques.html">CompileDownTechniques</a> implies is an intermediate level of compilation or code generation.  Of course, I'd like the compile-down to retain the link to the brief, high-level definition.  Any leads on this topic?

        Sounds like what you're advocating is a <a href="PatternsTool.html">PatternsTool</a> that would do part of the coding of a design for you.  I know that there are several people working on tools for forward and reverse engineering of patterns.  <a href="AamodSane.html">AamodSane</a> at UIUC has written a few papers on it, and I just recently did my master's thesis on a reverse-engineering tool.  I don't think the state of the art for forward-engineering is up to where you want it, though.  Sounds like you should start on your own tool, eh Alistair?
