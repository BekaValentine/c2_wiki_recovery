        Oop And Variation Management

        (Based on material from <a href="ProblemsWithExistingOopEvidence.html">ProblemsWithExistingOopEvidence</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Evidence in OOP literature often fails to address realistic "granularity of variation". In practice when new features appear, the difference between things is usually smaller than the method's granularity. Thus, one needs to override 1/3 of a method, for example. The XP crowd simply shouts "just refactor the granularity to be smaller". But this is not change-friendly code. Thus, either withdraw the "easier to change" claim, or justify having ever smaller and smaller methods, plus the effort to shrink them. An IF statement around the area of difference appears far simpler than re-shuffling all the related methods. Something smells here. -top
      </p>
      <p>
        I have rarely seen a feature that can be added by overriding 1/3 of one method, excepting if that method is <a href="GodCode.html">GodCode</a> (like the evaluation function for a language). Are your pet variation-patterns somehow more realistic? What sort of features are you imagining? -<a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of 1/3 overrides can be found in <a href="DeltaIsolation.html">DeltaIsolation</a>. -top

      <p>
        What feature is being added in the <a href="DeltaIsolation.html">DeltaIsolation</a> example? -<a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect also that you assume some sort of context (for definition see <a href="ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext.html">ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext</a>) to support something like a <a href="FeatureBuffetModel.html">FeatureBuffetModel</a> in procedural. That same pattern can be used easily enough in OOP (e.g. via <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a>). Language support for the class of <a href="CrossCuttingConcern.html">CrossCuttingConcern</a>s addressed by context is pretty much orthogonal to both OOP and Procedural. -<a href="BlueHat.html">BlueHat</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        But <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> becomes a <strong>big wad of pointers</strong> for non-trivial apps. I'd rather manage all that as table-based sets instead of pointers. I'd rather use a database to manage them so that I can search, sort, group, report on, etc. in different ways. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        Eh? <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> does not imply <a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a>, nor does it need to introduce coupling in the language interface. A traditional use of <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> will have it carry only encapsulated interfaces... e.g. 'console' will access an object with the console interface, and so on. This is far more similar to a flat table of pointers. In any case, you aren't being rid of the need for context by use of table for context. -<a href="BlueHat.html">BlueHat</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have a photographic memory and want machines to help me track the relationship between stuff because my brain has weak areas. Is OOP only for those who have photographic memories? -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> will allow your machine to help your poor, weak brain track the relationships between stuff. ;) -<a href="YellowHat.html">YellowHat</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-trivial OOP tends to degenerate into a hand-rolled <a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a>. Pointery techniques are one reason why the <a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a> fell out of favor. Why is it trying to come back as object pointers? With enough indirection (usually "pointers") OOP is indeed very flexible. However, I find it difficult to surf, sift, and manage all that indirection/references compared to the same or similar info in a RDBMS-like tool. Please describe how you manage it as OOP code. -top

        <em>OO databases need to be </em>'strongly<strong> distinguished from OO programming.  OOP != OODB.  They may have the same conceptual basis, but are otherwise as different as chalk and cheese.  OO as a means for representing a data model may well turn into an ad-hoc </strong><a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a>, but the voices who advocate this approach (i.e., creating a <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>) are growing steadily weaker in favour of those using OOP to represent invariant computational abstractions.<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Think of OOP like this:  Note that a single procedural program can be defined in terms of inputs, outputs, and internal state.  Now imagine that you create a bunch of little procedural programs to serve various purposes.  Each one will have its own inputs, outputs, and internal state.  To create a bigger program, you simply (!) hook the little programs together.  Each little program stands "on its own", so to speak, but all participate in a greater whole.  That greater whole, of course, is itself a program that can be defined in terms of inputs, outputs, and internal state.  It too can be connected to other "programs" to form an even bigger program.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That, in a nutshell, is object oriented programming.  Each instance is a little procedural program that serves a well-defined purpose.  To create a bigger program, we hook them together.  Having to surf, sift, and manage the connections or relationships between them </em>'is<strong> an issue -- I won't deprecate that -- however, it's nowhere near the issue that it appears, because a good OO programmer endeavours to connect the little programs (i.e., instances) to each other in a logical, intuitive, and manageable fashion.  And, as noted above, </strong><a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> certainly helps identify and control what can be connected to what.  There is never a need to worry about "navigating" the object graph, because (a) each instance communicates only with its neighbours; and (b) we are effectively creating a data-processing machine, <strong>not</strong> a network of data that needs to be queried.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As an aside, note that </em><a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> is exactly the same idea.  We merely eliminate "internal state" from the above, and concern ourselves purely with little programs (i.e., functions) that have inputs and output.<em></em>

        Almost all paradigms/techniques fit that description such that it's hard to compare based on that alone. Even the human body is like that. The devil's in the specifics of how similar things (variations) are related and how they are monitored and managed. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm now wondering how it is you believe you can compose two human bodies into a larger one... but I'm not sure I wish to know.</em>

        Notably, pure procedural programming, by in large, does not fit that description.

        <em>If you mean </em><a href="TopDownDesign.html">TopDownDesign</a> (<a href="StepwiseRefinement.html">StepwiseRefinement</a>), then I'd somewhat agree (but with caveats that I won't bother with right now).

      </p>
      <p>
        No, I don't mean <a href="TopDownDesign.html">TopDownDesign</a>.  I mean pure procedural programming, especially that without user-defined type systems of reasonable capability, is barely scalable.  It tends to form a foaming sea of procedures, all accepting and returning arbitrary primitive types and differentiated only by name.  This is alleviated somewhat by <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> and proper use of user-defined types, but then it tends to border on OOP sans inheritance and polymorphism, both of which tend to get implemented (out of necessity) using a variety of brittle ad-hoc mechanisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Uuug. This is turning into yet another static/strong-typing lecture it seems. I almost decided to dissect your original description above to see how you found a way to turn it into a typefest. But then realized it would just be deja vu.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's because your understanding of <a href="TypefulProgramming.html">TypefulProgramming</a> is weak, saggy, and slightly damp in one corner.

        <em>No, it's because you mistake personal preferences for universal truths.

      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>computational</strong> world can certainly be "properly" classified up-front so that it can (optionally) be compiled, and pre- and post-checked so that everything runs all nice and smooth.  It is the "real" world where this is a problem, hence the appropriate deprecation of OO for <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s.  Don't try to use OO to represent data; use OOP to create programs to process data.

        [Anyhow, it might help to make a cleaner distinction between two different <a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>s: <strong>structural aggregates</strong> and <strong>typing</strong>. These features often get confused. Even without user-defined types and typing, support for structural aggregates (like tables or dynamic tree-structured values as <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> has advocated in the past) is sufficient to avoid the "foaming sea of procedures". <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> does well enough even without <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a>, and it implicitly passes a whole stack from procedure to procedure (or word to word) plus allows references to external blocks (effectively a heap) which may contain arbitrarily structured aggregates.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [For reasons unrelated to typing, "pure procedural programming" is incapable of efficient scaling to multiple processors and long-lived programs, at least without support for "process objects" with both waits and signals/events from an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>'s kernel at which point it is difficult to argue one has "pure" procedural programming. Thus, it is correct to say that pure procedural programming scales very poorly, albeit from a metric different than the implied "scaling in terms of adding more and more procedures".]

           <em>Of course it does. Look at a typical web app in say PHP: thousands of potential processes talking to the same DB (data-set). It came to fame with client/server designs.

(2) A typical Web Application involves multiple process-objects to manage the inputs and connections, and so is not 'pure' procedural. The 'programs' are serving as message-handlers in what is overall an OO system. If you were even moderately competent, you'd have realized that <strong>"at least without support for 'process objects' with both waits and signals/events from an </strong><a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>'s kernel"<strong> would, in fact include the web-server and multiple process-objects running different programs.

           [I've been wondering that as well. <a href="MercuryLanguage.html">MercuryLanguage</a> makes a good combination of functional+relational.

Err... well, I'll get off that analogy before I take it too far. But, for language designs, I believe that layered solutions with pure ingredients is where it's at. OOP, at least in my favorite design thus far, gets layered <strong>beneath</strong> object configurations and <strong>above</strong> procedures (which are themselves above data-types, pure functions, and <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s).

           [Based on everything I've ever read on UML, OOA+D, etc. the education is generally to model "software systems" - the sources+sinks (the actors), model the inputs+outputs, and model the process or 'flow' within the program and between program-objects. <a href="DomainModelling.html">DomainModelling</a> as part of <a href="RequirementsAnalysis.html">RequirementsAnalysis</a> is performed, but can (and many people recommend should) be done independently of the software design so as to avoid premature commitment to any particular design. While I recognize you have observed people vocal in their support of OOP for domain modeling (as I have observed the same) I believe this to be more the result of confusion in the educational process, especially the use of analogies to 'real world' objects to teach what proper classes are, as opposed to starting by teaching software patterns (<a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s, Factories, <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>, and the like).]
