        How To Keep Your Job

        An excellent talk by the <a href="PragmaticProgrammer.html">PragmaticProgrammer</a>s explaining <a href="HowToSurviveInaJobMarketThatSucks.html">HowToSurviveInaJobMarketThatSucks</a>.

        A <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a> presentation translated into HTML: <a href="http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/talks/HowToKeepYourJob/HTKYJ.html">http://www.pragmaticprogrammer.com/talks/HowToKeepYourJob/HTKYJ.html</a>

        <em>I don't know. I would summarize that as, "learn more management and business process skills instead of tech skills, and bust your butt to stay afloat in the new age of cheap, offshore outsourcing. That is almost akin to "eat your vegetables and exercise more."</em>

        Learning management skills is just one strategy they cite, and only as an example. I found the content of the slides deeper than that, and well worth a read. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

        Besides, even if that summary is accurate, what's wrong with the article?  Are there no techies that need to be reminded of this? -- <a href="BrentNewhall.html">BrentNewhall</a>

        I thought the article did a fine job of reminding us to invest in ourselves.  I firmly believe that you and only you are ultimately responsible for your ProfessionalDevelopment.  The employer has business goals of their own, which may or may not coincide with your personal goals.  The article also suggested not to get too firmly entrenched in any one language or technology, since they change.  It's common sense, but it needs to be restated periodically, especially when you're neck-deep in code. -- <a href="MartinChernenkoff.html">MartinChernenkoff</a>
