        Risk Assessment
      </h1>
      <p>
        Risk only exists if there is a possibility of loss.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RiskAssessment.html">RiskAssessment</a> is another name for RiskEvaluation. The value of a risk is the probability of its loss to happen and then the evaluation of the cost of that loss, also known as the impact. See <a href="RiskIsProbabilityTimesImpact.html">RiskIsProbabilityTimesImpact</a>.

        <a href="RiskAssessment.html">RiskAssessment</a> is usually related to the availability of resources: specifically time, knowledge, people and money.  Every project should be studied to estimate if all these factors are present in the needed degree.  If they are not, then the plan is not feasible if it remains unaltered. --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>
