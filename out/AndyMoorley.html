        I have been an irregular and silent reader here for over a year now [now = August 1998].  I was introduce to it by <a href="PaulDyson.html">PaulDyson</a> who I worked with at that time.

        I work for JPMorgan at the moment where I am the architect (whatever that migh mean in this circumstance) for their Smalltalk based derivatives system called Kapital.

        I am especially interested in Architectural Patterns (see <a href="PatternsGenerateArchitectures.html">PatternsGenerateArchitectures</a> for a clue as to what these might be) and how they help in defining the high level architecture of either an individual system or a network of communicating system.

        I am currently wondering how <a href="QualityAttributes.html">QualityAttributes</a> and <a href="ArchitecturalStyle.html">ArchitecturalStyle</a> are related.  I am thinking about proposing a OT99 workshop on this.
