        Handspring Visor
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Visor is a <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a>-based PDA, compatible with Palm's various devices.  Its unique feature is an expansion slot called Springboard.

        I love my green-and-ice deluxe, which I got for a birthday present this year after begging.  I'm holding out for the Innogear <<a href="http://www.innogear.com/">http://www.innogear.com/</a>> SixPax for my first Springboard module, though.  Of course, it wouldn't be anywhere near as cool if it didn't make extensive use of the <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> <a href="LessIsMore.html">LessIsMore</a> principle.

        I had the Visor Deluxe, and then upgraded to Visor Prism(color). I am very happy with my purchase. In conjunction with <a href="OmniSky.html">OmniSky</a> Internet service, I think they are the best available handhelds on the market. They use the <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> platform, with thousands of free and low-cost applications, and a relatively low price on the hardware as well. The color display on the Prism is beautiful, too. --<a href="JoshuaBaran.html">JoshuaBaran</a>

        Unfortunately, CDPD (which the Minstrel S-based services use) isn't anywhere near as widespread as voice cellular, meaning <a href="OmniSky.html">OmniSky</a> is quite useless unless you stay near large metropolitan areas.

        The Visorphone is a Springboard expansion module for the <a href="HandspringVisor.html">HandspringVisor</a> that turns it into a cellphone.

        Has anyone here gotten one? -- <a href="DavidCorbin.html">DavidCorbin</a>

        <em>If it were cheaper, I might.  Man, that thing's expensive.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And now it's cheaper.  $49, but you can only get it with VoiceStream service in my area.  Not sure what other areas have available to them.
