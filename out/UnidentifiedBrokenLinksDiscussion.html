        Unidentified Broken Links Discussion

        Discussion about unidentified <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>s
      </p>
      <p>
        I am wondering if the task to <a href="IdentifyPagesWithUnidentifiedBrokenLinks.html">IdentifyPagesWithUnidentifiedBrokenLinks</a> is either feasible or worthwhile. There are about 36000 pages on this wiki and although not all will have links a lot will. The links will be going out of date at some unknown rate and I don't think there are many <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s around these days to keep things uptodate.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: I have today edited both <a href="LowLevelVirtualMachine.html">LowLevelVirtualMachine</a> and <a href="CeeLanguageFamilyFrontEnd.html">CeeLanguageFamilyFrontEnd</a> to provide information about a new release of the Clang compiler, which has a very active developers list. No-one else has edited those pages for several years, which can be seen by inspection of my edit today. I have identified that the new release uses a different compression technique (*.xz instead of *.gz). I have not traced any documentation for this in the release notes. I have been able to find out about it by searching and found what I needed on <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>. I am now making some links here, but there is not very much on this topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusion: The number of regular participants here does not include many interested in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, although there were in the past. This is no longer a place where a lot of people are contributing and sharing ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am continuing to do what I can to keep things here up to date, but I am not sure if anyone else will follow me when I give up.

        Broken links do not add content to Wiki pages; instead, they add noise. It is best to increase the s/n ratio of the C2 by removing broken links whenever they are encountered. If the good <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> finds a newer reference or follows the original link to a place where the content has been relocated then the link can simply be updated. But plain broken links are no goodnik, comrade.

      <p>
        And let's not forget that Google knows everything. If a link stops working and the subject material is publicly visible anywhere on the web Google will find it. If the broken link points to a white paper or some other material that simply isn't available any more then there really is no point in even mentioning it, eh?
