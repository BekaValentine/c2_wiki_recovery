      </ul>
      <p>
        Clearing house for independent booksellers (often with on-line sales and world-wide distribution available) excellent for rare, obscure or out-of-print
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Alibris <a href="http://www.alibris.com/">http://www.alibris.com/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another general used book site. Alibris acts as a middle-man for their dealers, giving more of a one-stop shop than Advanced Book Exchange. I find their prices tend to be higher, however.

        Offers both new and used books at fair prices. Used books reasonably graded for wear. Has an affiliates program last time I looked. If it matters to you, they also employ union members.

        <li>

        I enjoy browsing my local bookstore, and am willing to pay "extra" now and then to see the store preserved. A world without bookstores would be a sad place. -- <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>

        Depends. If a local bookshop happens to have the book in stock, you save one day by buying it "physically". If they don't and some online bookshop does, you probably get it much faster by buying online. Of course, if you just want "a book" and don't care <em>what</em> book ... -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>

        My favorite online bookseller is <a href="http://www.booksamillion.com.">http://www.booksamillion.com.</a> They simply have a huge catalog of books and nothing else. You won't be directed to a Pokemon auction when looking for a Perl book. Their prices tend to be the best if you join the $5/year millionaire's club.

        I'll often find books on Amazon using their excellent tools (customer reviews and showing you common purchases), then I'll buy them at <a href="http://www.booksamillion.com.">http://www.booksamillion.com.</a>

        I used a bookmark on the Netscape Personal Toolbar Folder programmed so that if I select an ISBN on the page and click the bookmark, it goes to addall.com and starts the search immediately. It is modified from code found at <a href="http://www.google.com/options/buttons.html.">http://www.google.com/options/buttons.html.</a>

        I just bought a bunch of books and only one of them had an ISBN reference - even the <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> books hadn't. (Putting this comment here will get this page into the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> list, which should bring it to newcomer's attention, at least for a while.

        Readers in Canada should note that <a href="http://www.chapters.ca">http://www.chapters.ca</a> delivers books cheaper and quicker than Amazon. Amazon is amazing within the US. However their ex-USA shipping charges are excessive, and factoring in the customs expenses and delays, chapters.ca saves you about a day and C$10 a book. -- <a href="StevenBlack.html">StevenBlack</a> (whose website is, nonetheless, also an Amazon associate).

        There are quite a few places <a href="WhereToBuyBooks.html">WhereToBuyBooks</a>. Frequently the savings is so much that <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a> would do much better if you sent them the difference rather than using Amazon. This might be accomplished using Pay Pal. <a href="http://www.paypal.com">http://www.paypal.com</a>

        While the auto-link to Amazon for ISBN numbers is useful, a link to a price comparison site would be even more useful. Amazon is rarely the cheapest source for any given book, and the differences in price are some times substantial. I recently bought a Macroeconomics text book [ISBN: 013095733X] from a UK book seller for $41.91, including shipping from Europe to California. The same book would cost $69.30 (include shipping) from Amazon US. Even ordering it from Amazon UK would have been considerably cheaper than Amazon US.

        I've noticed that <a href="http://www.abookbargain.com/">http://www.abookbargain.com/</a> has been a [<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>] for some time now.  I have to assume that they went out of business quite some time ago.

        I commonly use <a href="BookFinder.html">BookFinder</a> and AddAll when shopping for books.
        ...generally with slightly better results from <a href="BookFinder.html">BookFinder</a>, and I like the clear separation of new and used books in its interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've tried <a href="AscesBookfinder.html">AscesBookfinder</a> / Deal Time, from time to time, but they don't seem to really be any good at finding books.

        I tried out <a href="BookAse.html">BookAse</a>, and found... <em>[visited site only, did not purchase]</em>

        <li>
           It has a really slick user interface.  Very pretty and slick.
        </li>
        <li>
           It doesn't have nearly the coverage of <a href="BookFinder.html">BookFinder</a>, but it does sometimes find better deals that any of the others.

      </ul>
      <p>
        ...except maybe <a href="http://isbn.nu/''">http://isbn.nu/''</a><isbn#><em></em>
        I'll have to include isbn.nu in my book searches in the future!
