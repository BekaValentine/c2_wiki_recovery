        Like a GlassCeiling that prevents certain people (ie women) from rising as far in their profession as others, a <a href="GlassWall.html">GlassWall</a> prevents people from expanding into other fields, not because they lack the ability, but because they lack the relevant experience.

        <strong>Type:</strong> Management
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Companies want to hire someone who is a good match for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Staff hiring
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           when hiring staff, the emphasis placed on experience as opposed to ability
        </li>
        <li>
           possibly because of the number of applications per job, that's as far as most candidates get
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Supposed Solution:</strong> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When hiring someone, an obvious starting point is their resume. This naturally focusses on what someone has done in the past.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What that individual wants to achieve in the future is not covered, or only touched on during the interview.
        </li>
        <li>
           Thus, candidates are filtered out and selected purely on the basis of what they have done.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Applicable Positive Patterns:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Candidates should get in the habit of listing aspirations in their resume
        </li>
        <li>
           Employers should assess how much training they would be willing to accept in a near match. This would avoid a <a href="DryWaterhole.html">DryWaterhole</a>.

        I've had a TeleportingGlassWall situation when I've been moved between managers. The original manager - a project manager who didn't have a lot of time to put toward the project - left the whole development cycle to me, except for some of the talking to the client. The next one came onto a project and elected themselves the DBA and architect, and switched platforms, presumably based on my incompetence to make those choices. (My title is just "programmer"; how would he know?) The next one sandwiched me somewhere in between. I didn't have an official list of competencies. Each manager came to me, teleported the glass wall somewhere else, and tossed me right over it... --<a href="JesseMillikan.html">JesseMillikan</a>

        An aspect of your personal CareerManagement is to get into a job based on your skills in X and while you are in there, finagle your way into a job where you can develop skill Y. This is the only way to keep your skills current. Of course, you <em>have</em> no skill in Y to start with, and you learning on the job is an expense to your employer. <a href="GlassWall.html">GlassWall</a>s are an attempt to contain these costs. It's understandable, but it means the good people will leave.
