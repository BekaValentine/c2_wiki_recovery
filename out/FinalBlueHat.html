        At the end of a <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> discussion, it is important to identify what conclusions, if any, have been reached, and to evaluate the quality of the thinking that has occurred, and such things as whether the particular sequence of hats was adequate. Because this is <a href="BlueHat.html">BlueHat</a> thinking, most <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> discussions end with a <a href="BlueHat.html">BlueHat</a> specifically for this purpose.

        (You can also stick a <a href="BlueHat.html">BlueHat</a> in the middle if you find that things are going horribly wrong...)
