        <li>
           No more classloader issues (well not the same ones) 
        </li>

        <strong>Admin Console</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        If you have used WLS 5.1 or below, you will be pleased to see that the 
        weblogic.properties files are gone! You used to configure WLS via a text 
        file, that would allow you to screw up the entire server by not putting a '\' 
        in the right place. WLS 6.0 now holds its configuration in a config.xml 
        file, that you are not supposed to directly edit. You configure the server via 
        a console web application that has an explorer look and feel (left hand tree, right 
        hand pane to edit config). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The console is a big improvement to the properties files, but it is still a little buggy, 
        and you find yourself touching that config.xml manually from time to time. In the future 
        your config could live in a database, LDAP, etc. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>weblogic.class.path no more</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Again, if you are used to WLS 5.1 and below you will have run into problems 
        when you didn't setup your weblogic.class.path, CLASSPATH, and/or 
        servlet.class.path correctly. The nasty "<a href="ClassCastException.html">ClassCastException</a>" can glare at 
        you if you are not careful. Now JDK1.3 is out, it allows WLS to disgard it's 
        hack with multiple classloaders, and we are left with one CLASSPATH. 
        WLS *forces* you to use 1.3 and above for the server, which I am fine with :) 
        It may seem like a small thing, but I have seen more problems with the classpaths 
        than I have had hot dinners. 
      </p>

        <strong>Central Admin Server -> Managed Server</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        WLS 6.0 has changed its configuration architecture to come closer to BEA Tuxedo. 
        You have an admin server that holds the configuration for all servers in a given 
        "domain". When you start up the managed servers, they point to the admin and get 
        their config, and code sent over to them. This allows you to centralize your 
        configuration, instead of having properties files all over the network. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>EJB 2.0 [almost]</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        WLS 6.0 has a 2.0 container, that has everything bar dependant objects, which 
        are going to change a lot in the final release of 2.0 anyway. You can write 
        Message Beans, enhanced CMP with relationships, etc. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Database Multipools r</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        You have always been able to setup jdbc connection pools in WLS, but in 6.0 
        they allow you to setup a meta pool. You would normally setup your architecture 
        so that you have replicated database servers, and then the pool points to both 
        servers (e.g. Oracle replication). Then if the main oracle instance dies, the 
        multipool will failover to the backup instance. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Solid transaction support (Two Phase Commit)</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        BEA got the transaction gurus from Tuxedo, and built full XA compliant 2PC 
        transactional support into WLS 6.0. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Enhanced JMS</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The JMS architecture has been solidified, and is now enterprise ready, so you 
        could use it instead of an IBM MQSeries, SonicMQ, etc. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Enhanced web server</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The web server in 5.1 and below has always been a little "bare bones", 
        and its performance has been a little weak. The updated web server 
        allows you NOT to have to sit behind apache (or netscape, iis, ...). 
        You get virtual hosting support, extended logging, and more... but it still 
        isn't as feature rich as a *real* web server. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>JMX system management</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        BEA opened up the server management to use the JMX API, so you have a standard 
        way to manage the server. The console, command line tools, all use this API. 
        You can use the MBeans in the server to tie your code into the management 
        infrastructure! Yay standards :) 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Stateful Session In-memory replication</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="WebLogic.html">WebLogic</a> clustering has been improved in 6.0. You can now cluster stateful 
        session beans using in-memory replication. The server that holds the state 
        will replicate it to a backup server. If the primary goes down you will 
        be routed across to the backup. Then the backup will become the primary 
        and choose another server as its backup. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You also have a say on choosing the backup via replication groups, and by 
        tying servers to "machines". This is needed because you do not want 
        to replicate your state to another server on the same box... as what if 
        the box goes down! 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Deployment tool? where? :)</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        So it comes to deployment time. You want to package an EJB. Surely you don't 
        have to hand edit the XML descriptors? Well, kinda! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Your options are: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use the WLSBuilder that you can download from the develop.bea.com website. This is a web based app that can package beans... but it is VERY buggy. 	In fact it has never gotten out of beta, and they have stopped developing it 
        </li>
        <li>
           Use a third party tool (e.g. in your IDE: Together, Cafe, JBuilder, etc). I think a lot of tools are catching up for WLS 6.0/EJB 2.0 
        </li>
        <li>
           Write the xml yourself, and write helper tools yourself :) 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I wish there was a really nice tool given to us! 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Conclusion</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There are a lot of good additions to WLS 6.0, however it looks like some 
        bugs need to be ironed out (Service Pack 1 seems to fix a lot). 
        I like the fact that you can shove a .jar file into a directory and have it 
        auto-deploy (JBoss has had that for a long time), and in general I have 
        been impressed with the product.
