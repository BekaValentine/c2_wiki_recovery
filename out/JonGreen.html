        <strong>Career</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These days, I'm CEO of LookBox (<a href="http://lookbox.net/),">http://lookbox.net/),</a> a set-top box manufacturer.  I'm also CEO of a software/hardware consultancy, Adeptium Consulting (<a href="http://adeptium.com/),">http://adeptium.com/),</a> that specialises in embedded and multimedia systems, although we can easily handle most fields of development in C, C++ and assemblers, on most operating systems (or none).

        I've been making my living almost exclusively from Linux for the past nine years or so, but have been using it for research and playing with it since kernel 0.12 or 0.95 (I can never remember).  I've been programming since 1975, starting (on mainframes) at the insanely early age of eleven.  Don't worry, it didn't take me long to leave big metal behind and get my own micro, and start doing obscene things with a chipset that wasn't designed for half of my projects!

        I'm an enthusiast of Agile development.  I've even put it to work, and fine it was too.

        <strong>Life and hobbies</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Somehow, these days, all my many hobbies seem to be subsumed by work or fatherhood: I've two mad kids - Meri (2002) and Alex (2005) with my lovely wife Chris.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal home page lives at <a href="http://www.green-lines.com/">http://www.green-lines.com/</a> or thereabouts.

      <p>
        I'm also a reasonably incompetent surfer, getting my feet wet in the swell of the East Coast of England (and Cornwall, too, when we get the chance) as often as possible, including the worst of Winter!  Currently driving a 7ft2 FluidJuice [1] 7'2" fat-boy hybrid thruster - yes, you can get a 7'2" thruster! - and most fine it is, too.  Which is more than I can say for my antics on top of it, but that's all part of the fun.

        I keep taking up flying again, then having to sideline it for other stuff.  I've been a glider pilot, and have done enough rotor to know it's an expensive hobby I'd like to be able to afford; at present, I'm looking to restart single-prop once more.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I write.  When I can.  Copious Free Time, and all that.
