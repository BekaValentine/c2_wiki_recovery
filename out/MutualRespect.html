           Don't delete other's content except to clean out name-calling or to move off-topic content to another spot (unless not computer-related, then deletion is okay).

           Don't accuse one of "you keep doing/saying X" without providing at least 3 specific instances.

           Not liking somebody is no reason to ignore these rules toward them. Be nice to even Hitler, at least on this Wiki.

        <li>
           Don't use Wiki as a revenge or punishment tool.

           Apologize if you slip rather than just ignore it.

           Complain about specific content, not the personality(s) behind it.
