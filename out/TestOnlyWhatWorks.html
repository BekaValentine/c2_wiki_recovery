        Test Only What Works
      </h1>
      <p>
        When working on a project that still contains several bugs, in order to test the last step, you have to bypass the bugs in the first steps ( for example by input that doesn't cause the bugs) .
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, when the project is released the first time, everyone will believe it doesn't have any bugs, because they never see any. Until the (out-of-team) customer steps in and starts using it ... .
