        Folks,
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've ever struggled with XP's units or points-system for estimating <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a> ("Huh? What does a unit mean!?!? Is it time? Complexity? Hours? I don't get it!!"), we've got a new term for you. It was invented by a fellow on a project we're coaching and was inspired by <a href="FrancescoCirillo.html">FrancescoCirillo</a>'s pomodori ("tomatoes") system. The new term: NUT: Nebulous Unit of Time
      </p>
      <p>
        We estimate in NUTs. Another player on this team suggested that if you have trouble thinking in NUTs, just remember that a NUT is somewhere between a pistacchio and a coconut.
      </p>
      <p>
        The team that invented this term, approx. 30 people, is currently so nuts that they implement 66 NUTs per one-week iteration.
      </p>
      <p>
        How NUTs is your team?
      </p>

        Hi Karl.  It's just a fun term.  <a href="GummiBearsOfComplexity.html">GummiBearsOfComplexity</a> is also nice.  --<a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>
