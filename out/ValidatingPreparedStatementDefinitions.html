        Validating Prepared Statement Definitions
      </h1>
      <p>
        On <a href="PreparedStatementsDiscussionTwo.html">PreparedStatementsDiscussionTwo</a>, it is alleged that <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions consisting solely of static string definitions -- which optionally make reference to other static strings -- are easier to validate than dynamic SQL definitions that must (in order to be dynamic) make reference to external data and optionally make reference to other dynamic definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here, we examine that claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        A typical set of <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions, in a language like PHP, will look like the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        <?php<br/>
        // Example-1A<br/>
        $prepClauseStatus = "s = 'available'";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        $prepStmtDef01 = "SELECT * FROM piddle WHERE p = ?";<br/>
        $prepStmtDef02 = "INSERT INTO fizzle(x, y, z) VALUES(?, ?, ?)";<br/>
        $prepStmtDef03 = "SELECT * FROM piddle WHERE " . $prepClauseStatus . " AND p = ?";<br/>
        $prepStmtDef04 = "SELECT * FROM furgle WHERE " . $prepClauseStatus . " AND q = ?";<br/>
        ?><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that the code is highly constrained, consisting strictly of assigning variables.  Variables are only assigned string literals, or the concatenation of string literals and variables.  We can express that as a grammar.  Assume the existence of token definitions <VARNAME> which is a variable name (e.g., $prepClauseStatus), and <STRING> which is a sequence of any characters delimited by '"'.  Other tokens are identified by their literal text.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The grammar, in modified EBNF, is:
      </p>
      <code>
        PHPProgram ::= "<?php" ( Assignment )* "?>"<br/>
        Assignment ::= <VARNAME> "=" StringDef ";"<br/>
        StringDef ::= ( <STRING> | <VARNAME> ) [ "." StringDef ]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If we wanted to, we could build a parser for that grammar to automate validation of <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions.  Additional functionality would be to verify that <STRING>s do not contain embedded variable references, and ensure that <VARNAME>s in the StringDef rule only refer to variables defined by the Assignment rule in the same PHPProgram.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can take the same approach with dynamic SQL definitions.  Typical dynamic SQL string definitions might look like the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        <?php<br/>
        // Example-1B<br/>
        $sqlClauseStatus = "s = 'available'";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        function sqlDef01($parm1) {<br/>
        return "SELECT * FROM piddle WHERE p = " . sqlStringFilter($parm1);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        function sqlDef02($parm1, $parm2, $parm3) {<br/>
        return "INSERT INTO fizzle(x, y, z) VALUES(" . sqlStringFilter($parm1) . "," . sqlStringFilter($parm2) . "," . sqlStringFilter($parm3) . ")";<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        function sqlDef03($parm1) {<br/>
        return "SELECT * FROM piddle WHERE " . $sqlClauseStatus . " AND p = " . sqlStringFilter($parm1);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        function sqlDef04($parm1) {<br/>
        return "SELECT * FROM furgle WHERE " . $sqlClauseStatus . " AND q = " . sqlStringFilter($parm1);<br/>
        }<br/>
        ?><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that we can't define them as static strings like we did with the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions, because we need to incorporate dynamic external data.  So, we define them as functions, in order to achieve the same flexibility to pass arbitrary parameters that we would have using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The grammar might look something like this, assuming a pre-existing token <FNNAME> to represent a function name in addition to the same <VARNAME> and <STRING> tokens used above:
      </p>
      <code>
        PHPProgram ::= "<?php" ( FnDef | Assignment )* "?>"<br/>
        Assignment ::= <VARNAME> "=" LiteralStringDef ";"<br/>
        LiteralStringDef ::= ( <STRING> | <VARNAME> ) [ "." LiteralStringDef ]<br/>
        FnDef ::= "function" <FNNAME> "(" ParmDefs ")" "{" "return" StringDef ";" "}"<br/>
        ParmDefs ::= <VARNAME> [ "," ParmDefs ]<br/>
        StringDef ::= ( <STRING> | <VARNAME> | WrappedExternal ) [ "." StringDef ]<br/>
        WrappedExternal ::= <FNNAME> "(" <VARNAME> ")"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If we automated it, additional functionality would be to verify that <STRING>s do not contain embedded variable references and ensure that <VARNAME>s in the StringDef rule only refer to variables defined by the Assignment rule in the same PHPProgram.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, the latter grammar is more complex.  The first three rules in both grammars are very similar, but the former <strong>is</strong> only three rules.  The latter requires seven rules.  This makes us ask what is being gained -- at least in this case -- by using dynamic SQL instead of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.

        First of all, I don't consider PHP's prepared statements (PS) "typical". Microsoft, for one, usually expects a type indicator be given in their PS API's. Second, you used unnecessarily large function names for the wrappers/filters, making it look more verbose than it needs to. But these are mostly separate from the grammar processor issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are using a variation of <a href="ArgumentByLabToy.html">ArgumentByLabToy</a>. The main problem is that functions and other language elements will probably need to be used anyhow for OTHER purposes (general factoring and code organization) such that a parser will have to be able to process them. If a parser can only process certain statements but not most or all, then the statements/syntax it cannot parse will often <strong>"derail" it, making it useless or unreliable</strong>. Typical programming language parsers don't have common sense and get thrown off track easily if not nearly perfect. Thus, even if we are only interested in 10% of the code for a particular usage, the parser still has to recognize 100% of the code (to be reliable) to properly recognize that 10%. A Guess-A-Tron can be built for either case if we accept "fuzzy parsing".
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, it's not likely that all SQL clauses would be defined in one place for non-trivial apps. That's anti group-domain-related-things-together. You are grouping on processing technology (database), not on domain issues. Your parser has <em>still</em> gotta process functions, modules, and variable & naming scopes, dude.

           Addendum: There is no reason to place them into functions unless they are called multiple times. Your "to make them equivalent" (paraphrased) is a fake requirement.

           <em>Assuming that's so, how would you create the appropriate dynamic SQL?  It's such a common requirement to have to invoke a given query with varying parameters that it's reasonable to define it in a parametric fashion.  This is invariably true of interactive applications; perhaps it's less so if you're creating one-off data retrieval or reporting scripts.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The "varying parameters" are the values of the variables. Perhaps I'm interpreting "dynamic SQL" different than you.

        <em>PHP's </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are typical for PHP PDO, and as I was illustrating PHP, it seemed appropriate to use what's typical for PHP.  As for the "unnecessarily large function names", the size of function names is irrelevant.  What's intended to be compared is not the size of the PHP code, but the size of the grammar definitions.  They are a better indication of code complexity (in this case) than code examples.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As for the above being "a variation of </em><a href="ArgumentByLabToy.html">ArgumentByLabToy</a>", my examples are structurally the same -- differing only in object names and query contents -- as real production code I've worked on or written.  Whilst my grammar/parser examples <strong>could</strong> easily be automated, typically the only "automation" is getting a developer to audit it who hasn't written the code.  In that case, the simpler grammar represents easier -- and therefore more reliable -- auditing.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're right -- not all SQL clauses would be defined in one place for non-trivial apps.  There may be multiple definitions like those shown above, associated with their relevant classes, modules, components, or whatever.  In PHP they can (like with most other languages) be confined to their own source files so I don't have to process functions, modules, and variable and naming scopes, "dude".</em>

      <p>
        Re: "as real production code I've worked on or written." -- Well, it does <em>not</em> fit typical structures I encounter and make. The number and complexity of mouse, keyboard, and eyeball movements would be roughly comparable between the two general techniques when in a fuller code-base environment. You seem to switch back and forth between a <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>-based argument and a machine-based argument (parsing machine) as it suits a specific narrow argument. You seem to be cherry-picking your reference specimens per sub-argument to force your argument into a certain (misleading) direction. It's a debate technique you've used before.

        That could take a while to code up in a way that makes sense to readers. I don't feel like doing such today. PS's don't interest me enough to motivate me. I'd rather spend pseudo-coding efforts on <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> or <a href="MultiParadigmDatabase.html">MultiParadigmDatabase</a>, which are far more interesting to me than PS's.

        When your parser was proven to be useless, you waffled back to <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, but didn't fill in any details on measuring <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>. That's how I interpret your round-about "presentation".
      </p>
      <p>
        And if we are talking <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, like I've said before, long <strong>positional parameter</strong> "lists" can get awkward. Positional parameters are often okay in small quantities, but a maintenance headache for larger lists.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Well, actually the wrappers <strong>could use positional parameters also</strong>. It's just an API design issue: a <strong>personal syntax preference</strong>. I personally see no code maintenance benefit in such, but if YOU like such, then fine, but don't have a <a href="PersonalChoiceElevatedToMoralImperative.html">PersonalChoiceElevatedToMoralImperative</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Sure it could, but what does it have to do with anything being discussed on this page?]
      </p>
      <p>
        You are really arguing about API design, NOT prepared statements, such that this grammar pissing contest resolves almost nothing directly related to PS's.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The so-called "grammar pissing contest" demonstrates that code defining </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is simpler than code defining dynamic SQL, and so is easier to audit for potential security issues.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax <em>could</em> be made nearly identical to the PS calls with some API rearrangement. Thus, a syntax-only analysis would produce nearly identical scores.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, an API could be designed to identically support dynamic SQL queries or </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  Then the only significant difference between the two (performance issues aside) is that dynamic SQL has to rely on filters to prevent SQL injection.  Thus, the sole risk mitigation against SQL injection is the quality of the filters.  With <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, there is no such risky dependency.  It is for that reason that OWASP recommends <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> even over its own ESAPI filters.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You are wandering off the topic of syntax, grammars, and code style. We've been over the risk issue gajillion times in other topics and I see no reason to re-re-re-re-re-debate here. YOU may like repetition, I don't.  My "same syntax" point stands. QED. Good Night.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, I am wandering off the topic of syntax, grammars and code style, because they're irrelevant if we define -- as you suggested -- a common API that can work with either dynamic SQL or </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  If we have a common API that can work with either dynamic SQL or <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, why would we ever choose to use it with dynamic SQL?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't understand the question. Please clarify or restate. <strong>Perhaps I am not clear on what you mean by "dynamic SQL"</strong>. I've talked about the need in non-trivial systems to have "libraries of SQL snippets" to mix and match SQL portions for different needs. For example, we may have snippets for product categories, and another set of snippets for locations/regions, and yet another for "report types/styles". These different factors will interweave because they are mostly orthogonal. I'm not sure I'd call that "dynamic" or not because implementation may vary per tool stack. How about "compos-able" as a working term? The granularity of a full SQL statement is often too large for typical modularization/re-use needs in medium and large organizations or complex apps. -t
      </p>

        <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> Dynamic-SQL-Def-01

      <p>
        <em>By "dynamic SQL", I mean constructing whole SQL queries by string concatenation, in which a SQL query is created as a text string composed of static text (e.g., "SELECT * FROM customers") and optional static string constants (e.g., "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE " + $southRegionWhereClause) and optional external data filtered to hopefully prevent SQL injection (e.g., "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE " + $southRegionWhereClause + " AND custID = " + sqlStringFilter($_POST['userInputID']) and the whole string is passed to the DBMS connection's "execute query" function.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, the more secure alternative is to use </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  They still allow SQL queries to be constructed by string concatenation.  A SQL query can be created as a text string composed of static text (e.g., "SELECT * FROM customers") and optional static string constants (e.g., "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE " + $southRegionWhereClause), but <strong>no</strong> external data should be included.  Where we want external data, we define a parameter -- e.g., "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE " + $southRegionWhereClause + " AND custID = ?".  We pass the string to the DBMS connection's "create prepared statement" function and get back a handle to a prepared statement.  When we want to execute the query, we invoke it by its handle, and pass an argument to the parameter specified by the '?'.  E.g., prepStmt.Execute($_POST['userInputID']).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Regardless which approach we use, we can define an API that abstracts the underlying approach.  In use, it might look something like this:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        $qry = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE " + $southRegionWhereClause + " AND custID = ?";<br/>
        $handle = $dbConnection.CreateQuery($qry);<br/>
        $handle.setParameterType(1, ParmTypes.String);<br/>
        $handle.Execute($_POST['userInputID']); <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>The above could work with either dynamic SQL or </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  If we're using dynamic SQL, setParameterType() determines what filter function gets used.  If we're using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, setParameterType() identifies the parameter type.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So, if we have the same API for either dynamic SQL or </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> -- and we can see it's reasonable that the same API be used for both -- why would we ever use it with dynamic SQL?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose you are going to argue that if the API's can be made pretty much the same, then the only decision difference maker is which one is more secure such that security becomes the pivotal factor (and SP's are the alleged security winner). That may be the case, but I not going to repeat the "security fight" here. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't tested the API swappability between the underlying techniques (PS's versus filtering) in practice and so will not comment on that further. In theory we could have:

        In theory (with what's known), it does not appear that syntax or grammar in terms of application programmer (database API programmers aside) or automated verification favor one or the other. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If a person or automated code analysis system does not detect that "outside values" are slipping in, then <strong>SQL injection can happen BOTH for PS's and filters</strong>. Thus your statement that filters are more vulnerable because one may "forget to wrap" or that it's easier for automated code analysis tools to verify is false. <strong>PS's do not prevent "slipping in" of outside values.</strong> One must inspect the app code to ensure such. Code inspectors won't necessarily face different code under each (PS's or filters) such that detection of one or the other is not easier or harder under each, as you originally claimed. <strong>You lost the "complexity/grammar" debate, bub</strong>. -t

      <p>
        <em>We've already been over this one several times, "bub".  The whole point of this page is that it's </em>'objectively<strong> simpler (based on grammatical complexity) to audit </strong><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions than dynamic SQL for inadvertent inclusion of external data.  Also, what do you think is easier to do by accident:  Include an external variable in a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition, keeping in mind that accessing external variables normally requires special syntax -- like $_POST['varname'] in PHP -- specifically to prevent accidental inclusion? Or forget to wrap an external variable with a wrapper function?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrrrrg. How the hell is it "objectively simpler based on grammatical complexity" if the code can be nearly identical? I have no idea what your $_POST['varname'] example is about. It would "leak in" or not leak in the same way if the code is the same. Arrrrg. For example, using PS's does NOT prevent the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        // Example post-01<br/>
        $foo = $_POST['varname'];<br/>
        ...<br/>
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE " . $foo . " AND USERNAME = ? AND PASSWORD = ?";<br/>
        $stmt = $dbc->prepare($sql);<br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>

        <em>I thought you were referring to the original examples.  If we're talking about the API, then the process shown at the top of the page for auditing static strings is the same for any API.  If you're following any conventional discipline for avoiding external tainting in Web apps, then it's much harder to inadvertently include an external variable where you don't want one, than to inadvertently forget to put a wrapper around an external variable were you do want one.

Aside from the poor </em><a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> that represents, it's a potential security nightmare.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why did you think I was "referring to the original examples"? I stated "Code inspectors won't necessarily face different code under each...". What did you think I meant by that? And I don't know what you mean by "conventional discipline". If you want to claim that different API design styles have different/greater risk (programmer mistyping) profiles, that's <strong>orthogonal to the PS versus filtering issue</strong> and probably should be split into a different topic and is one I may not choose to participate in.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I interpreted your "different code under each (PS's or filters)" as referring to different code.  If it was the same API for both </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and filters, why would there be "different code"?<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>An aspect of conventional discipline for developing secure Web applications is to isolate SQL definitions into their own modules, so as to reduce the likelihood of inadvertently tainting the definitions with external data.

      <p>
        But the <strong>key point</strong> still stands: the usage of PS's versus filters does NOT by itself make for easier-to-inspect code, per accidental outside data leak-ins. API style/syntax design is technically irrelevant. You lost the "inspection" debate pure and simple. -t

        The top of the page is comparing the apple API design to the orange API design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How so?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What? They are obviously two different query API's (or at least "usage styles") to me, but the style choice is mostly orthogonal to PS usage, as I thought we already agreed. (Further, per above, it's questionable to wrap every query in a function, but I'll leave personal preferences to each person.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course they're different APIs, but they accomplish the same thing: defining a query that incorporates external values for subsequent execution.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I'm not understanding your point. I didn't dispute that they produce the same results. There are multiple API designs that can accomplish the same thing. That's not news.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You said they're "comparing the apple API design to the orange API design".  What they're actually comparing is the fact that defining </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> as shown above -- vs defining dynamic SQL as shown above -- requires objectively less effort to audit.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As for wrapping every query in a function, how would you define a set of parametric queries outside of the main program logic?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure what you mean. That appears to be an artificial requirement. Typically I'll only factor them to a function if they are reused at least 3 times (the same SQL called from 3 diff spots), or 2 if it's a large volume of SQL. No use putting everything in a function for the sake of putting everything in a function.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Every query that incorporates external data is a parametric query.  If you define SQL queries in-line in your application code, you run the risk of tainting your SQL queries with external data.  If you define SQL queries in their own modules, then you run much less risk of inadvertently tainting your SQL queries with external data.  Let's assume you define SQL queries in their own modules to reduce the risk of inadvertently tainting your SQL queries with external data.  How, then, do you define them so that they incorporate external data when you need them to?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Parametric versus in-lining is a code style/design <strong>issue orthogonal to PS's</strong>. Parameterizing can be done via functions and via "insertion point markers" such as question marks. I don't want to get into a code design battle here unless it clearly relates to PS's. But I would point out that positional (parameterized) can be difficult to work with when you have lots of fields/columns in a query. There can be a maintenance/reading costs to such. Whether that overrides other issues I'll leave to a shop manager/owner decision. As a coder it's not my job to make such tradeoff decisions, only describe and recommend. If you don't like their final decision, go bicker with them, not me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every detectable "mistake path" you've identified so far is tied to the API design/usage-style and not to the usage or non-usage of PS's. <strong>Complaints that a given API design/usage-style invites more app-coding mistakes compared to another is not related to PS usage versus non-PS-usage</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, we've already discussed this both above and below.  A unifying API can be created to make definition and invocation of queries -- whether they're </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> or dynamic SQL with filters -- identical.  In that case, the only distinguishing factor is security risk.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So what's all this crap about "grammar complexity" then?
      </p>
      <p>

        "Easier to validate" was the claim that spawned this. That claim has been flattened, and the "safer" issue is covered in other topics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What do you mean by "that claim has been flattened"?  It </em>'is<strong> easier to validate </strong><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions and they <strong>are</strong> safer.  Of course you can wrap <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> and dynamic SQL definitions in an API that hides either or both, but that's always possible.  For example, if you're comparing 'for' loops to 'while' loops, you can always hide the code you're considering inside a function called 'foo', but then you're no longer comparing 'for' loops to 'while' loops.<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>However, for the reasons described above, </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions <strong>are</strong> grammatically simpler to validate -- even if the only place we need to validate them, in comparison to dynamic SQL definitions, is inside the aforementioned API.<em></em>

If we eliminate grammar complexity as a concern by defining a common API for dynamic SQL and <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, dynamic SQL is still riskier than <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> because it's forced to rely on filters.

        Bull! You did not show they "were grammatically more complex". API design is a personal preference and orthogonal to PS usage. Were are going around in circles again. I'm hopping off the Repetition Express.

      </p>
      <p>
        The opening examples could be used for either PS's, filters, both, or neither. You "grammatically measured" something orthogonal to the PS/filter decision. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How so?  The first example is of </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions, and the second is of dynamic SQL.  How could they "be used for either PS's, filters, both, or neither"?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps I measured nothing, but YOU also measured nothing (on topic/relevant). I've said this already multiple times repeatedly redundantly, but it doesn't sink in for those with stubborn dig-in-heals personalities. (And there are other issues with actually applying your grammars {cough} to real tools and <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, but those are secondary.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why do you think the examples are not "on topic/relevant"?

      </p>
      <p>
        They are NOT relevant because the top examples are a syntax/API choice that is orthogonal (independent) of the choice between using PS's or filters. You are arguing code design choice, not PS's versus filters. Either can use either style (or other styles, since your choices suck, but that's another story).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What the examples illustrate is a fundamental difference between </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions and dynamic SQL definitions:  The former should never contain references to external data.  The latter must contain reference to external data.  This is true regardless of syntax/API choice, up to the point that we define an API that unifies <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> and dynamic SQL definitions.  Of course, in that case, the definitions should never contain references to external data.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm sorry, but again again again, I don't see how they are illustrating that. You seem to be using "references to external data" in a way that means something very different to you than it does to me. The opening examples are comparing API styles, NOT PS versus filters. (Granted, the out-of-the-box API's may "encourage" a certain style.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>By "references to external data", I mean (for example, in PHP) references like $_POST['userinput'].  They must never appear in </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions.  If they appear in dynamic SQL definitions, they must always be filtered.  This isn't an issue of APIs, because it is true right down to the SQL level.  Regardless what API or process generates the SQL sent to the DBMS, we have to ensure both statements hold true -- to the best of our ability -- in order to maximise security.<em></em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm still not seeing what this has to do with opening examples. You are just restating the same things over again. I think I shall give up. If somebody else knows what you are talking about and wish to restate it a different way, please do. Otherwise, <strong>I am giving up for now</strong>. Writing a code parser to "check" either API style (which is orthogonal to PS-versus-filters) appears to be generally the same amount of effort <em>to me</em>. Signing off... -t

           But you are not showing the whole stack and one can use Example 1-A app-side style for the filter approach also. If you are also referring to deeper in the stack, then you need to count deeper PS-related code also. (I reject your use of the term <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>.)

           Note that even IF SQL and app code are kept separate, it may make sense to put the compose-able SQL snippets into functions/methods/classes for typical modularization needs rather than just be "global". Thus, a code-checker/parser will still have to recognize functions/methods.

           Take a corporate computer-supply company that sells both software and hardware. There may be organizational separation between software and hardware such that the software group writes and manages most of the software-related SQL and the hardware group writes and manages most of the hardware SQL. We wouldn't want to mix these in the same file. A typical way to separate them is to put them in an OOP class and put the classes in different files. Thus, a code parser (for reference inspection) would need to be able to at least parse classes. The same applies for other file-splitting by aspects: like report type. And if we need conditionals, it may be better to wrap some of these in methods with either IF statements or polymorphism. For example, if the target date is earlier than a certain date, then maybe an archive table is used instead of the production table (or both tables if the range overlaps).

           Okay, but I thought we clearly established that the app code being checked by such a grammar could be pretty much the same under both filtering and PS's. It's a matter of API design choice, NOT whether PS's or filters are being used and thus the "grammar issue" is orthogonal to PS usage.

           <em>We were discussing the difference between </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions vs dynamic SQL definitions, not the use of APIs that hide both under a common interface.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

           <em>Yes, my grammar example is validating application code, not the API for defining </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> or dynamic SQL.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No. Your parser could be checking the same thing under both approaches and not "know" the difference because it's at a level below what the parser is checking. Thus, the grammar thing is moot. I thought I've said this like 4 times already. The differences would or could be at the API/wrapper level, NOT the application code. Thus, if your checker is not checking the API/wrappers, then the app code could be identical and the checker wouldn't detect any difference or need different grammar rules. Separate issues. Your checker is checking level X, but the (required) differences are at level Y, thus the concern or design differences will not be visible at level X and so the checker will not see or need be concerned about (designed different for) the differences at level Y.

           Arrrg. The examples at the top are an <strong>arbitrary design choice</strong>. There are different ways to set-up/design the database access API/wrappers. I will agree that that <em>particular</em> design choice shown is easier to parse-check, but that does not mean all are. (Whether one should code around best-fit for human readers or automated code checking tools is a design trade-off that I won't go into here because it's off-topic.)

      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm not understanding the question. The query API/wrappers that an application programmer sees can be designed a myriad different ways, correct? Note that I am not talking about the implementation of PS's themselves, but of middle-ware between the PS's and app programmer, or lack of, if one want's to go direct. The automated app checker would not be checking the middle-ware nor the PS implementation, but <em>just</em> the app code, correct?

           <em>APIs/wrappers can indeed be implemented in innumerable ways, but whether it's inside an API or exposed to the application developer, the following three statements are true at the interface to the DBMS:  </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions must not contain external data.

           True, but that's orthogonal to PS-versus-filter usage, as already explained multiple times. And as a reminder, the example shown at the top of the page is one of many possible API/middle-ware designs that are also orthogonal to under-the-hood PS-versus-filter usage. It tells us nothing that's on-topic. <strong>I have not seen anything that would be checked by stated app-code-inspection tool that is clearly dependent on the choice between PS's and filters.</strong>  You appear to be conflating middle-ware interface design choices with "absolute" under-the-hood database interaction issues. -t

        <li>
           [That is the topic at hand. With the prepared statements, we can require that the statements passed to the database's API come solely from string literals or from the concatenation of string literals. This prevents user-supplied data from becoming part of the statements. Attempts to use statements that don't come from these two sources can be reliably detected by the aforementioned grammar. When using dyanmic sql, the equivalent task (in terms of security) is to come up with a set of rules that can be reliably enforced (read machine-checked) that detects the absence of the appropriate filters. Every way I can think of to accomplish that task is significantly more complex.]

           Arrrrg! No! Example-1A and Example-1B can each have either PS's or filters under the hood (behind the API's) as one chooses. Filters can be built behind "?" insert markers and vice verse, for example. Those examples are (or can be) an interface only. They are an arbitrary middle-ware interface CHOICE only. (They may reflect an out-of-the-box default, but we are not stuck with an out-of-the-box default.) See <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> same-01 for essentially the same point.

           <em>Yes, you can hide </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL behind some unifying API, but then you're no longer talking about <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL.  You're then talking -- at minimum -- about some higher-level parametric query abstraction (e.g., PHP's pg_query_params(); see <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-query-params.php),">http://www.php.net/manual/en/function.pg-query-params.php),</a> and possibly going as far entirely abstracting away all SQL.  For that reason, elsewhere on this page, we discounted talking about wrapping <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL in arbitrary APIs.  What we're talking about here -- as pointed out above -- are <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL as we usually know them, at <strong>the interface to the DBMS</strong>.

If no higher-level query API is used -- which is very common -- ensuring that <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions do not include external data and ensuring that dynamic SQL includes filtered external data becomes a concern of the application developer.  In either case, the same concerns are present and, therefore, the examples at the top of the page are applicable; the only difference lies in which developer deals with those concerns.<em></em>

           They are NOT "irrelevant" because their design affects the complexity needed by your code checking gizmos, which is the main topic here, as I understand it. Your metric will pivot on the API/middle-ware design/choice, not on PS-ness. Whether the top examples are "typical" or not is a different issue than absolute statements about the complexity of a code checker. I'm NOT here to argue typical-ness either way. <strong>If a shop wants to avoid the use of functions in order to simplify a code inspector, they can by altering/wrapping the app API to the databases, regardless of whether they are using PS's or filters under the hood.</strong> (Whether that's a good trade-off or not is another issue.

           Your words are not clear to me and the code example at the top of the page does not demonstrate what you claim to demonstrate as I interpret your claim. For one, it's not clear what you are labeling as "dynamic SQL" and where the boundary of that designation ends in your mind. I'm growing tired of trying to figure out your point. It seems pretty damned clear to me that checking whether "external" values are leaking into SQL management API's (for lack of a better term) is orthogonal to the use of PS's or filters under the hood (lower levels). The code checker won't necessarily be checking that lower level. They are clearly different concerns to me. What the code checker inspects is not dependent on the usage of PS's versus filters--it's that fucking simple! You may have a point if you go with "as <strong>typically</strong> used in practice", but I don't necessarily disagree with that, but that is not the original claim as I understood it. I'm going to abandon this debate for now and <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> on their own. I'll let my case stand as is. Here are the hard facts: -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1. What the code checker inspects is <em>not</em> dependent on the usage of PS's versus filters (assuming we are not measuring "industry habits", per #5 below.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Actually, it is.  </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions must not include external values.  Dynamic SQL -- i.e., any non- pre-prepared query dependent on external values -- must include filters on external values.  If you're not clear about the distinction between <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL, see any SQL manual, any DBMS API in any popular programming language, and/or the examples at the top of the page.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Example post-01 proves you wrong. If by "must", you mean developer/shop policy, well that's a different off-topic issue. Please clarify where this must-ness happens. I see nowhere where it is machine-enforced.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I'm not sure why you think post-01 proves I am wrong, when it does precisely the opposite.  It's an illustration of tainting a </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition with external data, which <strong>must</strong> be avoided.  You appear to interpret "must" as meaning "is always technically enforced".  That's not what is meant by "must".  What is meant by "must" is that it is necessary that <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions not include external data, and that dynamic SQL include filtered external data, and that this be enforced.  That does not necessarily mean it's <em>technically</em> enforced.  It could be enforced entirely by human effort -- through manual code audits, for example -- or by some combination of technical means and human effort, such as by using the code checkers suggested at the top of this page.  Failure to enforce this -- whether due to technical limitations or human choice (which is what I presume you mean by "developer/shop policy") -- results in serious security risk.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You appear to be rambling. If you are talking about human policy, it's off topic. To double clarify, an app code checker, whether human or machine, will have the goal of making sure that any external values are fed into field-oriented API calls not the SQL-string-construction API calls REGARDLESS of whether we are using PS's or filters under the hood. Under both PS's and filters, we don't want external values to "sneak in" via the SQL-string-construction side. This must-ness applies to both and is thus not a difference maker and is thus off-topic other than making sure the base assumptions are clear if somebody forgets.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Regarding "rambling", I mentioned "human policy" only because you mentioned "developer/shop policy".  I presume that's a "human" policy, no?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Whilst it's true that when using both </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL, we "don't want external values to 'sneak in' via the SQL-string-construction side", the point this page demonstrates is that determining whether or not unfiltered external values might "sneak in" is technically simpler with <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions than it is with dynamic SQL.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You keep claiming that, but I just don't see the evidence. The code samples are not definitively shaped by whether PS or filters are used under the hood and thus tell us nothing definitive between the two techniques. I don't understand why you think those two samples back our claim. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The code samples are shaped </em>'only<strong> by whether </strong><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> or dynamic SQL (I presume that's what you mean by "filters"?) are used.  If we're defining <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, the definitions must (for example) never contain anything like $_POST['externalData'], whereas if we're creating dynamic SQL queries, they must contain something like sqlNumber($_POST['externalData']).<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wrong. The code checker is only verifying that the app code is feeding the "right stuff" into the right API methods, <strong>it doesn't "know" whether PS's are used</strong> and that detail is hide-able below what the app coder and app checker have to be concerned with. Abstraction is kicking your examples right smack in their nuts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It's not wrong.  We're assuming -- as has been stated multiple times -- that we're explicitly using low-level DBMS APIs like JDBC, ODBC, Perl DBI, PHP PDO and so on, so there is no "detail [that] is hide-able below what the app coder and app checker have to be concerned with."  The only issue here is the complexity distinction between </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions vs dynamic SQL, i.e., that the latter is more complex because it necessarily contains filtered external data that the former must not contain.  Fundamentally, what we're talking about are differences in SQL code; particularly the impact of those differences on the client-side in terms of defining strings to specify the SQL code.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "We're assuming..." yeah, that's the problem, as has been stated multiple times. <strong>Stop assuming</strong>. It's an arbitrary assumption and is not forced on an application coder by some inherent law of the universe or logic. You randomly pulled that assumption out of your ass. (Unless you intend to measure popularity of API design or something, which appears off-topic to me.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It's a reasonable assumption, because the distinction between </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions vs dynamic SQL is present in every SQL DBMS that supports <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  Since virtually every DBMS supports <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, it is manifest in virtually <strong>every</strong> low-level DBMS interface, regardless what higher-level APIs may be used on top of it.  Since higher-level APIs are invariably based on low-level DBMS interfaces, it is an issue for every system that accesses a DBMS.  As has been pointed out multiple times, it's true that the concerns may not be "forced on an application coder", but they are certainly forced on <strong>some</strong> coder -- such as (in the case of higher-level APIs) the API author.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And please stop using "dynamic sql" unless you clearly define it. Both examples are using dynamic sql as I interpret the phrase.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"Dynamic SQL" is the standard, and conventional, term.  It refers to the fact that the query text varies depending on external data, i.e., it's dynamic and constructed using string concatenation of static snippets and dynamic (usually external) data.  </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are static; their definitions either do not vary or (at worst) are constructed dynamically from strictly static snippets.  Dynamic data should never be used to construct a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>, and is only ever passed as parameter arguments at the point where a pre-defined <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is executed.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no official canonical standard. Stop making up fake standards. And whether the PS engine under the hood uses a predefined query ("static sql"?) or creates a new one is a <strong>low-level</strong> issue that is below what the code-checker would be looking for. The <strong>code checker is only checking what's fed into the API's</strong>, not how PS's or PS-related API's process SQL under the hood.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>There is a de facto standard, which is common use: Google "dynamic SQL" and note the approximately 971,000 results that agree with my usage.  As for how "PS's or PS-related API's process SQL under the hood", it's been pointed out repeatedly that we're assuming JDBC, ODBC, native interfaces, PHP's PDO, Perl's DBI, etc.  How they "process SQL under the hood" is well understood, i.e., they send the SQL to the DBMS.</em>

           2. Function usage can be removed from what the code inspector checks under filter usage if so desired (being that functions were adding to your "grammar complexity score" for lack of a better name.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, you can conceivably remove the function definitions, presuming you can find a way to parameterise the queries (I'll leave that to you) whilst guaranteeing that parameter values are filtered.  The "grammar complexity score" will still be higher for dynamic query definitions because of the filter invocations that are not required by prepared statement definitions.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, the score won't inherently be higher. It could potentially be identical even, per #3. (And yes, it is possible to paramaterize the queries in a fashion similar to typical out-of-the-box PS-related API's: question-mark insertion diddling. Now whether that's a developer-friendly design is another issue.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, the score would inherently be higher.  Remember, we're talking about SQL as sent to the DBMS, not higher-level APIs.  In defining the SQL to be sent to the DBMS, </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> must be defined from, and only from, static strings.  Dynamic SQL queries must be defined from static strings <strong>plus</strong> filtered references to external data.  Filtered references to external data plus static strings (i.e., dynamic SQL query definitions) is inherently more complex than just static strings (i.e., <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions).<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your code checker does not appear to be checking for "SQL as sent to the DBMS". You are making no sense.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>My code checker would check SQL strings intended to be sent to the DBMS.  For example, the </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions might be sent to the DBMS for creation via PHP PDO's "prepare" method.  (See <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepare.php)">http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.prepare.php)</a>  The dynamic SQL examples might be sent to the DBMS for execution by PHP PDO's "exec" method.  (See <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.exec.php).''">http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdo.exec.php).''</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Both scenarios would be doing that. It's not a difference maker that I see.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The "difference maker" is that the </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions are checked to make sure they're constructed strictly from static strings and nothing else, but the dynamic SQL definitions will be constructed from both static strings and filtered external (and dynamic) data.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You seem to be mixing up under-the-hood issues with app-side checking issues.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Here, that appears to be a random comment unrelated to my point.  Did you intend to put it somewhere else?  If not, I don't know what you mean by "mixing up under-the-hood issues with app-side checking issues".

           3. What the code-checker inspects can be the same thing under either PS's or filter usage (via interface design choice of the DB-access middle-ware). (There may be DB-vendor-specific subtleties that vary, but I'm only looking at generalities.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, but this (again) falls into the category of hiding concerns behind APIs.  You can hide everything inside a function called </em><a href="DoIt.html">DoIt</a>() that does everything, and thereby eliminate any concerns at all.<em></em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Good good, you are <em>starting</em> to get it!!! A key gear is starting to turn in your head, creaking from disuse. In this case I am assuming a separation of app concerns from query API/wrapper design concerns. In this scenario/topic the "code checker" only checks app concerns, not API/wrapper concerns. There is no reason to have the code checker check the query API's, for they won't typically have app-specific I/O ties (such as form variable access), and should be vetted via unit tests etc. (It wouldn't hurt to check the API code for things like "$_POST" though.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Are you sure it's not </em>'you<strong> who's "<em>starting</em> to get it"?  I've already pointed out several times that higher-level APIs are moot.  From above, for example: "We were discussing the difference between </strong><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions vs dynamic SQL definitions, not the use of APIs that hide both under a common interface.  You can hide almost any coding concern behind an API, so such APIs are moot."<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, we are discussing automated app code checkers and they won't be checking app-blind API's. If the API's are/grow app-specific, THEN they are subject to checking. Thus we cannot hide everything behind them because if we hide app-specific stuff behind them, those "insides" are then subject to automated code inspection.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What are "app-blind API's"?  I've already pointed out that the code checkers don't check APIs, they check string definitions.  I'm afraid I don't understand the rest of your comment.  Could you explain, perhaps with examples?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Words are indeed failing us and it would probably require a fairly extensive coded example to explain my point. I don't wish to invest that time right now and so will bail on this topic.......for real this time. -t

           <em>So your answer is no, you won't provide an example?  Perhaps you're finding communication difficult because you're inclined to make assertions like "automated app code checkers [...] won't be checking app-blind API's" without backing them up with examples?</em>

           The filter technique (without PS's) can use the Example-1A API style if the shop so desires. Do you agree with this statement?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>No, because that would require some database abstraction layer to process the SQL string before it's sent to the DBMS, which is not the scenario illustrated by the examples at the top of the page.

           <em>No, "the middle-ware" is irrelevant.  We're examining the difference between the construction of SQL </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> vs the construction of dynamic SQL.  It's about the construction of SQL constructs, not what APIs the SQL might flow through on the way to (presumably, but not necessarily) the DBMS.  Because we've clearly indicated that Example-1A is a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>, it strongly implies typical SQL <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> behaviour, i.e., that definition and execution are separate, therefore external data must be excluded from the definition.  Because we've clearly indicated that Example-1B is dynamic SQL, it strongly implies typical dynamic SQL behaviour, i.e., that definition and execution occur in one step, therefore external data must be included and filtered.  This has nothing to do with how -- or even if -- said SQL winds up in the DBMS.<em></em>

           This paragraph is not clear to me. I still don't know what YOU mean by "dynamic SQL" and I'm going to stop trying to figure that out. And why are you saying "strongly implies"? What does human guessing have to do with machine-based code inspection? We are not building a guess-a-tron.

           6. Example-1A and Example-1B are pretty much interchangeable as far as whether PS's or filters are used "under the hood" and we cannot verify from looking at those examples alone which uses what. (Related to #3.)

           That's because the method names tends to mean a specific API call based on history/convention, but it could be some other name with the same syntax for the calls, or even redefined using the magic of polymorphism (although that's probably not a recommended practice in this case). It's just names.

           Okay, but that's one particular and arbitrary and swappable choice. With those PARTICULAR api styles you are indeed correct. But one case is not sufficient to make a generalization. The code checker engine won't know the difference, it's NOT reading your comments.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It's not an "arbitrary and swappable choice" because we're assuming low-level DBMS APIs like ODBC, JDBC, PHP PDO, etc.  These all expect SQL strings like those defined in the examples at the top of this page.</em>

           Why are we assuming that? That's an arbitrary and limiting assumption. Did somebody hold a gun to the developer's head and say "you must use the out-of-the-box query API's". Are you in Russia?

           It's not a reasonable assumption. And it's not all-or-nothing: raw out-of-box vender API's versus hide-SQL-all-together. There is plenty of middle ground and I've used that middle ground many times to better fit a shop's or app-style's needs and avoid hard-wiring them to specific vendors. And yes, we may still be creating SQL strings like Example-1A, BUT they don't necessarily have to be used for PS's. The filter approach (underneath) can also use the question-mark-insertion approach if one wants and also use a code-checker to make sure all externally-derived data/variables are only passed through as "column parameters" instead of the SQL part of the call, etc. And if we switched the mechanism underneath to use PS's instead of filters, it would STILL look like Example-1A and the code checker would still be checking the very same code (barring minor vendor-specific tweaks that may be needed).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Your "middle ground" APIs internally rely on the low-level DBMS APIs like ODBC, JDBC, PHP PDO, etc.  Thus, the same security issues that are illustrated by the examples at the top of this page hold true for the author of the "middle ground" API.  From above, "any higher-level query API will almost invariably be built on a low level interface to the DBMS, [so] ensuring that </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions do not include external data and ensuring that dynamic SQL includes filtered external data becomes a concern of the API developer.  If no higher-level query API is used -- which is very common -- ensuring that <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions do not include external data and ensuring that dynamic SQL includes filtered external data becomes a concern of the application developer.  In either case, the same concerns are present and, therefore, the examples at the top of the page are applicable; the only difference lies in which developer deals with those concerns."  Also from above, "Indeed, an API could be designed to identically support dynamic SQL queries or <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  Then the only significant difference between the two (performance issues aside) is that dynamic SQL has to rely on filters to prevent SQL injection.  Thus, the sole risk mitigation against SQL injection is the quality of the filters.  With <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, there is no such risky dependency.  It is for that reason that OWASP recommends <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> even over its own ESAPI filters."  When I last wrote that, you complained that I was "wondering [sic] off the topic of syntax, grammars, and code style", so I've stuck to focusing on the key differences between <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL.  Hence, my assumption is still reasonable.<em></em>

           I generally agree with most of that. But it doesn't contradict the fact that the metrics used at the examples at the top of the page are measuring API design and NOT difficulty of checking PS-related issues versus checking filter-related issues. <strong>Your mistake still stands.</strong> The API style is <strong>orthogonal</strong> to PS-versus-filter usage. It's true shops may typically use certain styles, but we are not measuring industry habits, like I have to keep pointing out. And this is not the topic to discuss the security merit of PS's versus filters as I keep pointing out, but I guess you have to satisfy an urge to jizz your opinions repeatedly all over this wiki. We seem to be going around in circles yet yet yet yet yet again.

      </ul>
      <ul>

           <em>How could the metrics be measuring API design?  Aside from the filter function invocations -- which are measured only by presence, not their structure or purpose or anything else -- there are no references to APIs.  The metrics are measuring exactly what they claim to measure -- the complexity of the construction of certain SQL statements as string values which are assigned to variables.  They are API-independent because they're strings containing SQL.  If you want to define and measure metrics about an API that constructs SQL statements another way, that's fine, but it is entirely orthogonal to what is presented at the top of the page.  Claiming that the metrics are measuring API design is like claiming that the CPU speed of your computer measures the number of compiler errors in Visual Studio 2013.</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Let me see if I can state this another way: all possible query API styles heavily overlap between those that use PS's under the hood versus those that use filters under the hood such that measuring the difficultly of checking the app-side query API usage for undesired "outside" value insertion will almost entire depend on the API design and NOT depend on whether those API's wrap PS's or filters (as the injection protection mechanism). Example-1A and Example-1B could be used by API's that use <strong>either</strong> PS's or filters under the hood such that the contents of Example-1A and Example-1B are not dependent on PS's versus filters. Therefore, measuring the code of Example-1A and Example-1B tells us little or nothing about PS-versus-filters. PS's versus filters is a lower-level-issue than what those examples show (or at least below what a code-checker would or could be looking at). -t

        Groundhog day on the automated tools. Such automated tools would have to recognize functions IN GENERAL because code may be in functions for multiple purposes, which may have nothing to do with databases, correct? Typical CRUD code I see has roughly a third of the code in the MAIN function or equivalent. That means a parser will have to recognize functions and parameters 2/3 of the time. Remember the "derail" argument above? Did you forget about the derail argument? Why are you ignoring it now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your "derail argument" was invalidated.  Secure applications do not pepper the application code with SQL.  Database abstraction layers isolate the application layer from the DBMS, and SQL definitions are confined to modules in the database abstraction layer in order to reduce the likelihood of tainting them with external data.  As noted above, "In PHP [SQL definitions] can (like with most other languages) be confined to their own source files so I don't have to process functions, modules, and variable and naming scopes". In other words, automated tools do not have to recognise functions "IN GENERAL".  As I wrote at the top of the page, "the code is highly constrained" -- and deliberately so.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's a code design choice orthogonal to PS's. I'm not going to argue <em>general</em> app code design here. Note that most shops I've been around use Stored Procedures if they truly want such strong separation, not Prepared Statements. If you TRULY want to force-separate the SQL from the app, Stored Procedures make it easier because the SQL then does not come from app code and is not inadvertently mixed in. <strong>One can even set database permissions to prevent the app from running non-stored-procedures, THEN you don't need to write code parsers to check for rogue SQL.</strong> Typically you'll see something like this in the "DBA panels":
      </p>
      <code>
        Allow this account to:<br/>
        [X] Run stored procedures<br/>
        [_] Run SELECT statements<br/>
        [_] Run UPDATE statements<br/>
        [_] Run DELETE statements<br/>
        [_] Etc...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In summary, if you want solid SQL-from-app separation, then using stored procedures makes it so that you don't need to write parsing-based code validators. The DBMS policy settings prevent rogue SQL alone (assuming they don't use an unknown database account). You are using the wrong tool for the job, based on the given "protection" requirements. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Stored procedures are certainly reasonable on the DBMS side, but they have no impact on what SQL appears on the client side, or where it appears on the client side.  Whether you're invoking </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, <a href="StoredProcedures.html">StoredProcedures</a>, or dynamic SQL, secure applications do not pepper the application code with SQL.<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Regardless what server-side constructs you use, separation between the DBMS interface (e.g., PDO, JDBC, ODBC, whatever) and the application code is still necessary on the client side.

        I'm still puzzled on how Php's PS's tell the type of the parameter. I suspect it either uses the SQL's syntax and schema info, or the variable's type indicator (seen through getType()). PDO does have an explicit type version that's closer to Microsoft's:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.bindvalue.php">http://www.php.net/manual/en/pdostatement.bindvalue.php</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Relying on a variable's type indicator does not seem like a very good idea to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why not?  Type mismatches in </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> parameter arguments aren't a security risk, they only -- at worst -- result in the query failing to execute or returning incorrect results.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Who said security risk is the only factor to judge them on?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If we can create an API that is equivalent for both dynamic SQL and </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> -- as discussed above -- then the <strong>only</strong> factor left to judge them on is security risk.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, but that's already covered in prior topics. Let's both resist the urge to repeat prior battles here. I guess I am complaining about your choice of API or API usage. The type tag (indicator) is a crappy way to manage types, and I'd like to see them deprecated or fall out of style. Perhaps my anti-tag rant here is partly off topic. I say "partly" because I don't want to compare bad ideas to other bad ideas if syntax/grammar/language-design issues affect our metrics.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I can appreciate that, and some </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> APIs do not require explicit type specifications.  However, if you're creating dynamic SQL, you must <strong>always</strong> specify filters for external data to (hopefully) prevent SQL injection.  What's the difference between specifying a dynamic SQL filter like sqlStringFilter() or sqlNumberFilter() or sqlDateFilter(), and specifying a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>'s parameter type?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't understand why you are asking that question. The app code can be nearly identical, per above, depending on API design. The syntax/design choice is orthogonal to PS-ness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, that's my point.  Whether you're specifying "Number" as a filter for dynamic SQL or a parameter type for a </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>, it's the same.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what your point is.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You wrote, "The type tag (indicator) is a crappy way to manage types, and I'd like to see them deprecated or fall out of style."  It suggests that one of your objections to </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is their frequent use of <a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a>, i.e., explicitly specifying parameter types like "Number", "String", "Date", etc.  However, if you're using dynamic SQL with filters, you also must explicitly specify parameter "types" in the form of filters that ensure external data is actually a Number, String, or Date and not an attempt at SQL injection.  So, with <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> you often (but not always) have to explicitly specify parameter types.  With dynamic SQL, you <strong>always</strong> have to explicitly specify parameter (i.e., external data) "types" (i.e., filters).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's perfectly possible for filter wrappers to get type info from Php's type tags also, like the PS libraries appear to do (as one possibility), but I consider it bad practice, at least if SQL is the target query language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's not really possible, because PHP's built-in types aren't fine-grained enough to reliably select appropriate filters.  You'll inevitably need a "Date" filter, but PHP doesn't have a "Date" type.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do the PDO API's do it then? There's something odd going on. There are some databases that will process numeric literals with quotes around them, so maybe that's what's happening, but it's not universal across DB vendors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Noting that a PDO prepared statement is a wrapper around a SQL </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>, PDO prepared statements work like this:  When a PDO prepared statement is defined without explicit parameter types, it defers creating the SQL <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> until the first attempt is made to execute it.  Upon execution, the PDO prepared statement's argument types are used to define the underlying SQL <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> and its parameter types, and then the SQL <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is executed.

        The vast majority of the time, form-related or typical input-related validation is required anyhow such that the filter calls are often integrated with the validation API/framework. For example, we'll know that a given variable is to be validated as a "date" and thus the filter call is factored to a date validation handler instead of repeated for each date. Validating numbers, dates, SSN's,  ID's, etc. typically will be checking for the same characters/patterns that anti-injection filters will be checking for.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That is true, but how is it relevant?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One does not need an explicit filter call for each column. It may matter depending on how "complexity" or "app code size" is measured. Thus, in practice, the filter code will usually not look like the opening examples but rather be integrated with validation. Automated code validation would then want to make sure that every "input field" goes through the standard/sanctioned validation API as apposed to "rogue" SQL creation. The same would apply even if using PS's because mere usage of PS's does not by itself stop one from directly concatenating "values" to SQL.

        Under both kinds of approaches, the code checker seems to pretty much have the <strong>same job either way</strong>: make sure the API calls that register or run SQL statements are not fed variables that get outside or suspicious values. Generally there will be one or more "statement oriented" methods and one or more "column oriented" methods (or parameters) in the query API used by the app code. The code checker has to make sure that the statement-oriented methods (or parameters) are not fed variables/values that come from outside (or from suspicious sources). It's okay if the column-oriented methods get outside info. Now, whether there are functions in the app code that the checker checks depends on the API design and app coder style, NOT on whether PS's or filters are used under the hood.

      <p>
        <em>What the grammar examples at the top of the page demonstrate is that a code checker does </em>'not<strong> "have the same job either way".

Certain API designs can reduce the complexity needed by code checkers of the kind you mentioned at the start. It's an issue of API design, NOT whether we use PS's or filters. Either can use either example's style, per API designer preference INDEPENDENT of PS-versus-filters.

        That's my very point: what your inspect-a-tron is looking at and what your complexity metrics are measuring is an <strong>arbitrary API design choice</strong>, NOT something inherently tied to PS's versus filters.

        Like I keep pointing out, your particular example is one of a gazillion ways to do it. If such issues are hidden at the low level, it's not something the code inspector would bother with and thus not affect the grammar score. And we are not measuring "commonality", as I keep pointing out on deaf ears. I'm not challenging typical usage pattern claims, only what the laws of logic force or don't force.

        <em>The point of this page has been to prove that </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> SQL definitions are inherently simpler than dynamic SQL.  That has been proven.

      </p>
      <p>
        You have yet to demonstrate a "direct impact". It's clearly orthogonal to me because those are details at an abstraction below application-level code checking and <strong>both styles can be swapped for another from the app's perspective</strong>. There's a missing link in your "logic".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The "direct impact" is what's shown at the top of this page:  It's simpler to verify that </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions don't contain external data than it is to verify that dynamic SQL contains filtered external data.  We're not talking about what some higher-level API may do; we're talking about <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions and dynamic SQL as sent to the DBMS, which is ultimately the only place where the result of client-side database security and auditing is relevant.<em></em>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        You still have failed to show that Example-1A could NOT be used with filter-based systems to produce the same DB results (data changes or output).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's like asking me to prove that Example-1A inherently CANNOT be used as a question in an on-line quiz program about SQL, or in a game to teach newbies about SQL.  Of course the strings in the examples could be used that way or in innumerable other ways.  But, the examples themselves </em>'state<strong> that they're </strong><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL, so they're not quiz questions, they're not game elements, and they're not strings that are deliberately made to look like <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> but are actually turned into filtered dynamic SQL by a hypothetical database abstraction layer.  If they were any of these things, I would have said so.  The examples explicitly state that they're <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL, which have clear and recognised definitions.  The obvious inference -- reinforced by stating it explicitly, multiple times, above -- is that they're sent to the DBMS as-is.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, it still stands that the choice between using Example-1A and using Example-1B is not dependent on PS's versus filters and thus any differences in them are not due to PS-versus-filters and thus their grammar scores are not related to PS-versus-filters. -t

        "Dynamic SQL" is not well defined. Anyhow, I'm tired of this repetitious dance and won't get pulled into your word games. <strong>I'm confident most unbiased readers will agree that how the app coder interacts with the DB is fairly arbitrary such that you are measuring a specific and arbitrary API design rather than something INHERENT to PS-versus-filters</strong>.

        And you arbitrary choose "what matters". If we "must" check all low-level API's also, then all practical low-level API's will have functions/methods, and thus jack up your grammar score: pick your poison because you lose either way, Hallucitor.

        I'm only concerned with INHERENT PS-versus-filters issues. If you invent a side topic about something you call "dynamic SQL metrics", that's fine, but it's a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> issue that only you and your weird buddy cares about and has no bearing on inherent PS-versus-filters issues. If you demonstrate that "It's harder to do Goofy-Thing-7 than to use out-of-the-box PS API's", that may indeed be true, but why anyone should care about doing Goofy-Thing-7 when it is not forced upon them, I have no clue. It's out of the blue and relates to nothing that came before that I can see other than being one possibility of API design among many others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>An inherent </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>-versus-dynamic-SQL (aka PS-versus-filters) issue is that <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions must not include external data, but dynamic SQL must include (filtered) external data.  It's imposed by security requirements and the DBMS.  This page merely discusses one of the implications of that.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I still don't know what you mean by "dynamic SQL". Both type of sub-systems are fed essentially the same thing such that it does not matter if what they are fed is "dynamic" or "static". <strong>A classification of "dynamic" versus "static" (or whatever) would NOT affect what an app code inspector would check.</strong> The code checker would not do anything different to a string designated as "dynamic" versus "static" such that such a classification is irrelevant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Dynamic SQL" means SQL query text is generated at run-time from variable data, such as user input.  Contrast that with </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, where variable data such as user input is passed as parameter arguments when a predefined <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is executed, but the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition is (or should be) static.  What an "app code inspector" -- such as that described at the top of the page -- can check is that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> (as defined at the top of this page) are defined entirely and solely from static strings.<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>However, keep in mind that such an "app code inspector" is not a requirement.  It's possible to use it if you're defining </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> like those at the top of the page, but nothing stops you from defining <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> or dynamic SQL some other way.  The whole point of this page is to show that it's easier to verify that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> haven't been tainted by external data than it is to verify that dynamic SQL has been constructed at run-time using strictly-filtered user input.  The "app code inspector" described at the top of the page is merely intended to demonstrate that difference in complexity. What's crucial is not the use (or not) of "app code inspectors", but that <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions be checked (somehow) for tainting by external data, or that dynamic SQL be checked (somehow) to make sure external data is filtered.  What this page proves is that the former will always be simpler than the latter.<em></em>

      <p>
        Example-1A could be used with either PS's or filters and the code checker would process it exactly the same and give the same score REGARDLESS if you personally call a string "dynamic" or "static" or "fliffernobb". <strong>It's just a word.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If Example-1A is used with "filters" (and it isn't, because I said so -- but let's run with your argument for a moment) then I presume you mean </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>-like syntax is converted to dynamic SQL with filtered external data, such that no actual SQL <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is involved.  If that's the case, then it's not a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>, it's dynamic SQL.  Notably, it's more complex than a real <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> -- and more complex than plain dynamic SQL -- because you have introduced the additional complexity of the mechanism that translates the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>-like syntax to dynamic SQL.<em></em>

           If you are talking about TOTAL code, that's a whole different animal than what an app-side checker has to check. I still think you are wrong because you are vendor-centric-biased, but total code is off-topic anyhow so that I won't go down that bicker road. <strong>I smell scope-slip.</strong> My original understanding was that the proposed <strong>code checker ONLY checks application code</strong>, not "generic" query API implementation. By "generic" I mean that the query API does not have app-specific stuff in it, like references to HTML "form" variables. One doesn't typically put those in query API's. I stated this before and you didn't seem to have an issue with this assumption earlier.

Whilst it <em>can</em> be used if the application developer is constructing <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> SQL and dynamic SQL, it's not necessary in general (as long as the SQL is validated somehow).  Fundamentally, it's a practical proof of the intuitive observation that of the SQL sent to the DBMS, a developer -- somewhere between the application and the DBMS -- has to make sure that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> don't include external data and that dynamic SQL includes filtered external data, and the former is technically simpler than the latter.

           But we are not measuring "dynamic SQL"; that's NOT a direct concern; the concern is PS's versus filters, and filters can use the Example-1A style also. I've said this already, but it's not sinking in. You are comparing irrelevant shit; wrapper/API styles instead of inherent technology features or limits. Do you know what "inherent" means? You are getting side-tracked easily. And if you claim all the middle-ware would be more complex, prove it. And you can't pick and choose which middle-ware to include and exclude from the count without good reasons.

        You seem to be saying if a vendor creates them, they are "low level" (and not counted in metrics) but not if a shop creates them? I consider what the vendor creates "middle-ware" also. A vendor could in theory create filter-wrapping API's that resemble typical PS API's also. That's <strong>just packaging, not an INHERENT difference in PS's versus filters</strong>. What's at the shop-side versus what's done by the vendor is not inherently dictated by PS versus filters. That technology choice does not hold a logic gun to a vendor's head to alter their behavior.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vendors probably don't make PS-like API's without PS's because positional parameters with lots of columns are awkward to use such that there is no demand: it's not a default preference, and thus the existing market pattern has little if anything to do with "complexity". Vender middle-ware versus shop middle-ware is NOT an INHERENT feature of PS's versus filters. Focus on that word "inherent" so that you don't get side-tracked by irrelevancies again. If filters or PS's FORCE vendors to split things a certain way, then you may have a point. But I don't see force-ness. <strong>You mistake population samples for inherent traits</strong> it seems. If there is something about filters that absolutely and universally FORCES vendors and/or shops to partition query-related API's a certain way, please identify these absolute rules and prove they are absolute. And remember, I don't care about market habits or preferences. We are not measuring marketing preferences here: something commies, capitalists, anarchists, and space aliens all have to do related to PS-versus-filters.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you measure and compare, please make double sure you are comparing something INHERENT to PS's versus filters; NOT industry preferences or habits and NOT your personal preferences.

        [The comparison shows an inherent difference between prepared statements and dynamic sql. The ability to hide that difference behind an API doesn't make that difference any less inherent.

        You invent your own personal definition of "inherent" just like you did with "value". Lovely, Hallucitor. I don't give a shit about characteristics of "dynamic SQL". They are not directly related to the prior PS-versus-filter topics, but rather some screwy side-show given by a crazy clown. <strong>The bottom line is that a query API that uses filters under the hood CAN use Example-1A -style application code and that a "poor score" for the alternative 1B says nothing inherent about filters. The metric and example, as given near the top, says nothing inherent about filters.</strong> We were talking about tire A versus tire B on cars in the topic that spawned this one, but you went off and measured ducks instead. Your duck conclusions are a <a href="UselessTruth.html">UselessTruth</a> at best.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'm using the definition in the dictionary. You, if you think it means "forced", quite clearly are not. The previous topics have always been prepared statements vs. dynamic sql.

      </p>
      <p>
        [You clearly didn't bother to finish reading the definition. If you had you would know that it also has to be sent to the "DBMS connection's "execute query" function".

        <em>Please re-read the definition of "dynamic SQL" from </em><a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> Dynamic-SQL-Def-01, particularly: "By 'dynamic SQL', I mean constructing whole SQL queries by string concatenation, in which a SQL query is created as a text string composed of static text ... and optional static string constants ... and optional <strong>external data filtered to hopefully prevent SQL injection</strong> ..."  <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition strings -- as demonstrated in Example-1A -- should only be constructed from (concatenation of) static strings.  The Example-1A grammar takes that into account.  Dynamic SQL strings should also be constructed from (the concatenation of) static strings, but <strong>must include concatenation of filtered external data</strong>.  The Example-1B grammar takes that into account.  That difference -- that dynamic SQL must include filtered external data -- is why dynamic SQL is more complex than <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps you are implying that "concatenation = complexity??? It's such horrid writing it's hard to know. And I still don't know what that "should" shit is about: that's human policy issue, not a technology issue. If you mean a goal, then state it as an assumed goal, not as a human policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course it's a "human policy issue" </em>'and<em>' an "assumed goal".  Avoiding SQL injection is obviously a human policy issue and an assumed goal.  Your computer doesn't care whether SQL injection occurs or not, and concatenation is obviously more complex than not-concatenation.  Filters are more complex than not having filters, too.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, but that's a general goal; I don't see the relationship between it and "dynamic SQL" as a general concept. You are mixing fruit and ducks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The general concept is that </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions -- in order to be secure -- shouldn't include external data and (therefore) don't require filters, but dynamic SQL requires filtered external data, so the former is simpler than the latter.  It's hardly "mixing fruit and ducks", because they're both defined as SQL that's sent to a SQL DBMS for processing.<em></em>

        <strong>Application Scope</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm going to "cut off" my concern at the application level. Whether PS-related middle-ware (query API's) are "less complex" than filter-based API's, I will not debate. I believe you are wrong on the middle-ware level, but will not challenge it for now. I will focus on application-side checking/complexity, and that's it. If you want to debate the middle-ware level and below, that's fine, but you will be debating with yourself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And note that it's not the case that "everything can be hidden away into middle-ware". If the middle-ware has application-specific concerns, such as UI form or data column names hard-wired into it, than it doesn't qualify as "middle-ware" to me here. I'll also exclude UI issues for clarity (other than maybe error messages if there is a query problem).

        <em>You appear to be constructing a </em><a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a> here.  Middle-ware with "application-specific concerns, such as UI form or data column names hard-wired into it" doesn't sound like middle-ware to me, either.  It sounds like part of the application.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, if it has application concerns, then it's NOT middle-ware. There appears to be a misunderstanding. Where did my writing give you the opposite impression? And if it has UI concerns it's not "query" middle-ware.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As examples of DIS-qualifiers. In other words, to be called "middle-ware" here, the query API should be usable in a different organization altogether ("app-neutral") and not have UI-engine-specific code or app-specific-UI code in it. (Some UI-engine-specific code may be needed for the purpose of displaying query error messages).

      </p>
      <p>
        The PS API's included with say PHP are middle-ware. Thus, if you are using PHP's PS interface API's, you are using middle-ware. ODBC drivers are also middle-ware.

      <ul>
        <li>
           PS's require implementation complexity and filters require implementation complexity. How much of that is distributed to the RDBMS compared to the middle-ware is fairly flexible (<a href="WaterbedTheory.html">WaterbedTheory</a>) and as far as I'm concerned is off-topic. You may say that since the RDBMS already has PS's implemented that it's a "sunk cost" and thus shouldn't be counted. But that's merely a marketing habit, not an inherent feature of PS. There is no Rule of Logic that says DB's couldn't be sold with and without PS's like 6 cylinder versus 8 cylinder cars. It's market quibbling, not universal partition logic. Now if you want to change your claim to be "based on what is CURRENTLY available in the market, PS's are less complex to use/implement/check/have-sex-with/etc.", be my guest.

      </p>
      <p>
        I never claimed that. I would note, though, that the examples YOU gave could be made to work either PS's or filters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To ensure that Example-1A can be "made to work" with either </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> "or filters", there would have to be middle-ware that translates the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> syntax into dynamic SQL (constructed with filtered external data) before sending it to the DBMS.  Of course, that would mean Example-1A isn't what it states it is -- an example of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> -- but is actually an example of <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>-like syntax used to create dynamic SQL.  That's obviously more complex than sending the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions directly to the DBMS without translation, which is what Example-1A is intended to illustrate.  Hence dynamic SQL aka "filters" is still more complex, in terms of code requiring security auditing (the discussion of which is what spawned this page), than <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like I keeeeeep pointing out, your example is only a "spot sample". I know what you intended in that PARTICULAR example, but it does not say anything GENERAL about PS-versus-filters because it's only a spot sample. I'm looking at generalities, NOT just your spot sample. I don't dispute your analyses for the spot sample. There is no disagreement for that specific particular one single case. And if you are looking at the overall complexity, not just in specific levels (backend, middleware, app, etc.) then you need to be fair and consider all the complexity needed to implement PS's also. If you play the "deep card", then PS's are also subject to the same deep-card rules and get counted in the complexity score. You seem to be arbitrarily cherry-picking what levels you count and don't count to rig the score toward your (wrong) claims.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, my example isn't a "spot sample".  It's illustrative of the general difference in complexity between validating </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> vs dynamic SQL in <strong>every</strong> system in which <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> vs dynamic SQL is a possible consideration.  It's of concern to anyone who writes <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and/or dynamic SQL on the client-side of a DBMS, which is (for example) most people who develop mobile applications or object-relational mappers or cloud-based applications or custom business applications or database-driven websites.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As very, very few people write DBMSs (I am one of them; I can count the others whom I know of on two hands), the relatively complexity in implementing </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> parsing and execution vs dynamic SQL execution is irrelevant.  (As an aside: Once you're able to produce a parse tree or query plan from SQL, adding support for <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is a negligible additional step.  If you've designed your DBMS well, it practically falls out.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You keep claiming it illustrates something general, but give a poor argument for that. To me it is clearly is an arbitrary API choice that is not directly dependent on whether PS's or filters are used under the hood. The alleged dependency between the API style and PS-versus-filters is a "missing link" in your explanations. We seem to be going around in circles and I should give up trying to figure out what hell you are talking about, but so far I can't kick the habit of replying. It's pretty clear our world view of software and abstraction and <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> is so very different that we don't have enough common ground to use as a bridge between our minds. Seemingly strait-forward words mean something to you so different than what they mean to me. It's like working with an alien from Kolob.

      <p>
        <em>In your work creating custom business applications, don't you frequently construct queries that involve external data?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, and?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Don't those queries often look like the ones in Example-1B?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        More often than 1A, yes, but again, we are not measuring on preference or popularity such that frequency doesn't matter anyhow. Actually, I tend to combine the form render and/or validation routines into value-filter-checking such that I tend not to use either of those two styles in practice. (Note: You asked for an example of such combining technique before, and I've yet to supply one.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's fine.  Do your query definitions consist of static strings concatenated with filtered external values?</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Query definitions? Static? It's often a dynamic language; there is no "static". I'm not sure what you mean. Concatenation of filtered "values" with SQL strings eventually happens along the line, but the app developer may not do the actual concatenation (depending on API design choices and special needs).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In a query definition like '"SELECT p, q FROM z WHERE p=" . sqlString($_POST['userinput']);', "SELECT p, q FROM z WHERE p=" is a static string whether the language is dynamically typed or not.  Do you not have those?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd call it a "literal string".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's a reasonable thing to call it, but at run-time you can't change "SELECT p, q FROM z WHERE p=" to something else.  So it </em>'is<em>' static, isn't it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a static string, yes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Good.  Then is it true that your query definitions consist of static strings concatenated with filtered external values, even if those query definitions are constructed inside a QBE-like mechanism?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the most part, yes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Excellent!  Then it isn't necessarily the case that "seemingly strait-forward words mean something to you so different than what they mean to me", as you wrote above.  So far, we agree.</em>

      <code>

      <p>
        Note that the code is highly constrained, consisting strictly of assigning variables. Variables are only assigned string literals, or the concatenation of string literals and variables. We can express that as a grammar. Assume the existence of token definitions <VARNAME> which is a variable name (e.g., $prepClauseStatus), and <STRING> which is a sequence of any characters delimited by '"'. Other tokens are identified by their literal text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The grammar, in modified EBNF, is:
      </p>
      <code>
        PHPProgram ::= "<?php" ( Assignment )* "?>"<br/>
        Assignment ::= <VARNAME> "=" stringDef ";"<br/>
        stringDef ::= ( <STRING> | <VARNAME> ) [ "." stringDef ]<br/>

        <em>Assuming you're using PHP PDO, what method would you call to pass $prepStmtDef04 to the DBMS?</em>

      <p>
        That's an implementation detail; why does it matter? I don't want to dictate arbitrary implementation details in the example. Note that additional (non-PHP-library) middle-ware would likely pre-process $prepStmtDef04 to insert the parameterized values etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It matters because it proves my point:  Dynamic SQL -- which is what your "additional (non-PHP-library) middle-ware" would have to create -- is inherently more complex than </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.

           <em>What's being measured is a logical result of characteristics of </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> vs <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>, as implemented by SQL DBMSs.

           But "what technology X must do" is in this case at an abstraction level potentially below that of application code auditing.

(All middle-ware should be inspected for general quality, but that's another story.) Only the application code would need auditing for rouge form or URL parameter input and the like. If you think that the middle-ware should also be audited for such, then the Php PS-interface libraries should be subject to the same scrutiny and complexity metrics. How do you know they don't grab input from "$_form['my_secret_form_value']" and append it to certain "direct" SQL statements?

           Arrrrrg. You said all client-side (non-RDBMS) code should be inspected. This includes PS-processing/interface API's (such as those shipped with Php). And such PS-processing/interface API's will likely have functions/methods. Thus, your example should count the grammar complexity to process (inspect) such functions/methods, but it strangely doesn't. Problem is simple; why is it tripping you up? I don't get it. Arrrg. -t

           <em>I said all client-side code should be inspected.  That doesn't mean I expect all client-side code to be passed through an automated code-checker.  I expect re-usable, generic client-side code to be audited only when it's -- rarely, presumably -- written or changed, not for every new application.  For such code, automated code-checkers are needless overhead.  However, client-side application code needs to be checked every time it's changed, which is likely to be relatively frequently, and it's likely to be tediously lengthy as a result of many query definitions.  For such code, automated code-checkers are likely to be of value.  That said, the examples at the top of the page aren't intended to be illustrations of best (or any, necessarily) practice for application development.  They're primarily intended to be proof that validating </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions is easier than validating <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> construction.  The specifics of particular APIs do not change that simple fact, which is based on the (equally simple) fact that not having to employ external data or filters (for <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>) is inherently simpler to validate than having to employ filters on necessary external data (for <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>).<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           This appears to a big contradiction. If the automated code checker is ONLY inspecting app code, then it can end up inspecting code like Example-1A under PS usage and filter-based usage. <strong>What an app-side automated code inspector examines depends heavily on the query API's</strong> and Example-1A and 1B are orthogonal to whether PS's or filters are used under the hood. If you are talking about complexity somewhere else (in your indirect meandering way), your example doesn't show that.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>There is no "big contradiction".  The core point is that constructing </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions is simpler than constructing <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> because the former doesn't require filtered external data, but the latter requires filtered external data.  (Grammar complexity is used to prove this at the top of the page, and it is noted that we can use the grammar to create automated code checkers, but that's an aside rather than the core point.)  If we assume Example-1A isn't defining <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> but is defining <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> using <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> syntax, then that core point is still demonstrated:  In this case, it's because implementing it would require a code translator to convert <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> SQL syntax to <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> syntax (with filtered external data, of course), which is obviously more complex than just sending <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions directly to the DBMS.  No matter how you look at it, the fact that <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions don't require filtered external data but <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> construction does, is going to result in more complexity to construct <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> than <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> <strong>somewhere</strong> in the SQL construction system.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But we don't need to actually build an automated grammar checker for middle-ware, and you appear to agree with this. Even IF the middle-ware (non-app) for filter usage was more complex (which I don't concede by the way), it's not something the scenario you set up would need to be concerned with. You keep flip-flopping between practical-land and theory-land when I try to nail down your example context and scope. Are we measuring app-side complexity, or total complexity, or some mutt in-between? I don't fucking know from your writing. The context and scope jumps all over the place like a goto-loving frog on crack.

           Again, you seem to waffle back and forth between theoretical complexity and "practical" complexity. As far as the way products currently are typically found (bundled) in the wild, I will agree with you on the "complexity" issue. But I do not concede the theoretical side. If you count the total stack from top to bottom, then in-the-field (vendor) bundling does not give you a free ride on the theoretical side. A service not used by the filtering technique should not count against it anymore than hypothetical bundling of positional filtering API's should count against the PS score.

      </ul>

           <em>Where do I "waffle back and forth between theoretical complexity and 'practical' complexity"?  I've never mentioned theoretical complexity, except to deprecate your attempts to include it, like here.  My measure of complexity is entirely pragmatic -- which is as it should be, because that's what's relevant to developers and security auditors.  I've merely (and only slightly) formalised the intuitive observation that string construction consisting only of concatenation of static strings is simpler than string construction consisting of concatenation of static strings </em>'and<strong> function invocations.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If it's "entirely pragmatic", then one should consider the reasonable possibility that a shop will want to group SQL into functions or classes and/or use wrappers to make using PS's and/or filters easier (both of which will use functions/methods). Excluding functions is not "pragmatic". And if you claim it is from personal experience, then we've reached an <a href="AnecdoteImpasse.html">AnecdoteImpasse</a> and we can <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> rather than bicker over what's "pragmatic".

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>My exclusion of functions is for the sake of illustration, not a necessity. (Of course, if you are doing automated code validation, excluding functions may make it easier to write code validation mechanisms, but automated code validation is not a requirement.)

However, you will inevitably be writing the same functions for the same purpose whether you're defining </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> or dynamic SQL, so they're not a distinguishing factor.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But you are lopsided about what distinguishing factors you show and which you don't. Yes, using filters requires concatenation SOMEWHERE as you correctly point out, but PS's require their own PS-only processing that you don't show. You sometimes say that's because the PS's happen at a lower level of abstraction, but concatenation can also: that's an middle-ware or DB engine design choice. As far as your "but it's already built into most RDBMSs" argument, if one accepts that argument, then THAT is the distinguishing factor, not concatenation versus non-concatenation. Your words and your presentation don't jive up such that your presentation is misleading if go with the "built-in" (bundling) argument. Your example makes it look like one needs something outright and the other doesn't need it outright, but the REAL issue is bundling (of PS-related complexity) versus non-bundling (of filter-related complexity). Granted, I'm not quite sure how to illustrate bundling either, but I DO KNOW that you did it wrong. If bundling is the difference maker, then state that clearly and CLEARLY illustrate/demonstrate it in the examples. I see no bundle-ness directly shown anywhere.

        I disagree with this repetitious summary of already stated repetition, but it appears you play word-games with "dynamic" and shell-games with "complexity" excluding certain levels to rig your metric as you please.

That's because <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions should consist only of concatenation of static strings, but dynamic SQL must consist of concatenation of static strings <strong>and</strong> filtered external data, and that's true whether they're created inside or outside some middle-ware.<em></em>

           Even if that's true, it may not affect the TOTAL complexity score, depending on what parts one counts and doesn't count; and  the issue of what one counts depends on their particular perspective or concerns, per above. As far as "molehill mountaineering", projection. Your entire function-exclusion in your grammar metric is the biggest fucking molehilling I've seen in a long time.

Therefore, <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions need not (and should not) include external data, but dynamic SQL construction must include <strong>filtered</strong> external data.

All else being equal -- and the examples at the top of this page are deliberately constructed to make all else equal between <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic SQL, so as not to make dynamic SQL look worse than it is -- not-filters are simpler than filters.

        And note I exclude the "bundling argument" from the theoretical side because how vendors bundle services is a practical-level concern, not a theoretical one because <strong>no known related theory dictates</strong> what services are bundled or not bundled. There is no inherent law of the universe that says vendors must bundle PS-related services with RDBMS, and tomorrow they may decide to bundle in filter-related services also.

        <em>I find it rather baffling that you have no idea what I'm talking about, because it's quite simple:  If you're creating </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions, you don't need filters or external data.  If you're creating <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>, you need external data and filters around it.  It seems trivially obvious that the former, therefore, is simpler than the latter.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Let's look at it notationally:</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions can be created from static strings -- let's call any static string an S -- and concatenation of static strings, e.g., S + S + S, where '+' means concatenation.  So, every <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition -- whether inside or outside middleware -- is going to be S, or S + S, or S + S + S, or S + S + S + S, and so on.  To save us writing enormously long expressions, we'll use (x)* to mean "x is repeated 0 or more times".  Thus, a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition is S (+ S)*.  In other words, a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition consists of a static string with 0 or more static strings concatenated onto it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> can be created from static strings too, but we also need to concatenate instances of external data D, and we need to filter every D with some filter function F.  So, <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> definitions can be S, or S + S, or S + F(D), or S + S + F(D), or S + F(D) + S + F(D), and so on ad infinitum.  In general, that means <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> is S (+ F(D) | S)*, where x | y means "either x or y".  In other words, DynamicSQL consists of a static string with 0 or more static strings or filtered external data concatenated onto it.  (We'll start with an S rather than (F(D) | S) because we'll assume <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> normally starts with a static string like "SELECT", "INSERT", "DELETE", "UPDATE", etc.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Trivially, we can see that S (+ S)* is simpler than S (+ F(D) | S)*, and thus </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions are easier to audit than <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> construction.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's all this page is intended to show.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But you are focusing only on the static "portion" of PS technology. The entire stack when using PS's requires more than just the static portion because "values" must also be processed SOMEWHERE (to be equivalent in results). You are comparing apples without stems to pears WITH stems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As I've done all along, I am </em>'only<strong> focusing on </strong><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition on the client-side of the DBMS.  Note the title of this page, the first paragraph, and the fact that "<a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition" shows up on this page -- as of this writing -- at least 113 times.  This page was spawned in a discussion over whether or not <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> <strong>definition</strong> construction is easier to audit for <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> opportunities than <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> construction.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is in SQL construction that errors leading to </em><a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> are likely.  <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> or <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> execution is far, far less likely to result in <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a>.  Furthermore, the difference in complexity at the point of execution is negligible:  <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> execution requires a reference to a predefined <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> (often a name, if not disguised behind an opaque handle) and a list of arguments which do not require filters.  <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> execution requires a reference to the SQL to be executed.  Since both <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> execution and <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> construction make reference to external data, the references to external data cancel out overall.  Thus, the <strong>only</strong> overall difference in client-side complexity is "no filters required" (<a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>) vs "filters required" (<a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Filters are obviously more complex than non-filters.</em>  
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Here's a more accurate view:
      </p>
      <code>
        .........DBMS......Middle-Ware...App<br/>
        -----------------------------------<br/>
        Filters: DBE.......FM,FAPI.......AC <br/>
        PS's:....DBE,PSM...PSAPI.........AC<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        AC  = App Code<br/>
        DBE = Database engine<br/>
        FM  = Filter-processing mechanism<br/>
        FAPI = API for using filters<br/>
        PSAPI = API for using PS's (PS = <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>)<br/>
        PSM = PS-processing Mechanism<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Looking at the entire stack, they both have the same number of necessary "parts": four. If there is an inherent complexity difference between PSM and FM, the two key parts, you have NOT identified it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The inherent complexity difference is the requirement for filters, which (if we're looking at the entire client-side stack; the server-side is not relevant) consists of both the filter definitions and their application.  Both </em><a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> and <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> will make reference to external data (in <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> such references are made at the point of definition; with <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> such references are made at the point of execution) but only <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> requires that the external data be filtered.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By the way, counting architectural modules -- which is what you appear to be doing -- is meaningless in terms of measuring overall complexity, because it makes the mistaken assumption that all modules are equal in complexity.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe when you say "prepared statement" you mean literally the "prepared" <strong>part</strong> of the statement, which excludes value processing. I was generally considering the full picture, not one part. If you are slicing it as such, I don't know what the equivalent "filter" version would be at this point. It's not normally thought of that way, and is an awkward comparison set to try to match up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The examples at the top of this page illustrate that.  They show the "full picture", aside from actual execution of either </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> or <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> because the intent was to illustrate creation of the constructs.  The difference in execution (an argument list vs no argument list) is negligible from an auditing point of view.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Why are you counting PSM twice on the PS side? It's part of DBE. Or maybe you want to split the DBE into three parts, a core common to PS and DSQL, a PSM, and a DSQLM. In that case, you should add a DSQLM to the Filters side. You should also add a DSAPI to the Filters side that corresponds to the PSAPI.]
      </p>
      <code>
        [DSQLM = Dynamic SQL processing mechanism]<br/>
        [DSAPI = API for using Dynamic SQL]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        PS technology requires "direct" SQL processing <em>also</em>. Remember, one can feed an HTML form's contents directly into a PS (without using "?" parameters). True, it's not a recommended practice, but still must be supported to match expected PS behavior and thus is counted as part of its required component stack. Thus, PS technology is essentially a super-set of what you call "dynamic SQL". One can process all "direct" SQL through the PS API's if they wanted, and perhaps under the hood it's the same processing paths in the DB engine (perhaps with some wasted overhead of caching, etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        [There would need to be something in the DSQLM section. It has to return a result set immediately when the statement is sent, while the prepared statement does not.]
      </p>
      <p>
        That's a minor implementation detail. One can view a direct statement as an "anonymous PS" (like HOF's, he he), a shortcut for: run_PS(register_PS($full_sql),$empty_array); instead of the usual $handle=register_PS($full_sql);run_PS($handle,$empty_array); [pseudo-code]
      </p>
      <p>
        [So now you're saying that the filters side in the database would be DBE, PSM, and DSQLM. That doesn't make things any better for your case.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Say what? Both direct SQL and PS's require the ability to process a "full" SQL statement (with values) such that it's not a difference maker. However, PS's also require caching mechanisms, value-to-statement matching (tracking), and interfaces to middle-ware to access such features.

        [When trying to defend excluding the DSQLM from the filter side, you created a simple DSQLM which used the PSM which used the DBE. You say that in your response that starts, "That's a minor implementation detail.". Since you are trying to measure the complexity of the whole system, you now have to include DBE, PSM, and DSQLM on the filters side since you claim they are being used.]
      </p>
      <p>
        That's one approach, but it's not the only approach. <strong>I'm not dictating implementation here</strong>. A full PS "kit" still requires the ability to process full/direct SQL such that processing full/direct SQL is not a difference maker. Caching it under a name or handle does not change that need. (And managing the cache and names/handles is added complexity of PS's.) How one goes about the implementation is up the DB implementer. <strong>The bottom line is still the same: PS's require PS-specific complexity that filters don't need and filters require filter-specific complexity that PS's don't need.</strong> I have not seen anything new from you that changes this fact.

           I'm not sure what you mean.

It's a "part" BOTH need. If I still didn't answer your question, I'm not understanding your question.

      <p>
        "Constructing" by who or what? R2D2? I still don't know what "complexity" you are talking about; you keep waffling up and down the abstraction ladder between DBMS guts, and the application side, and every stop in between. Yes, implementing filters requires complexity, but so does PS implementation. A clear and reasonably-general illustration would help. Your existing examples seem to revolve strangely around functions and seem arbitrary API design choices to me. You are frustrating to communicate with; very indirect and round-about and use English in peculiar ways.  -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Constructing" by programmers, of course.  The complexity I'm talking about is exemplified by the following "clear and reasonably-general illustration", which is representative of either application-level code or what goes on inside middle-ware:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        // Dynamic SQL query in PHP assuming PostgreSQL<br/>
        $qry = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = '" + pg_escape_string($userInput) + "'";<br/>
        $resultset = pg_query($dbconn, $qry);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Prepared statement query in PHP assuming PostgreSQL<br/>
        $qry = 'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = $1';<br/>
        $resultset = pg_query_params($dbconn, $qry, array($userInput));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>The above is rather poorly constructed from an application development point of view (freely mixing SQL and application logic is questionable) but it illustrates the point of this page: It's easier to determine that $qry in the second example doesn't reference external data -- because it doesn't need filters and shouldn't reference external data -- than it is to determine that $qry in the first example always wraps external data (i.e., $userInput) in pg_escape_string() or some equivalent.  That's because the first $qry assignment is always more complex than the second, because the first always needs filtered external data, but the latter should never contain external data.  There's nothing arbitrary about it -- it's a characteristic imposed by the DBMS, by the fact that DBMSs allow two different kinds of SQL constructs, </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>, to be defined and used differently.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are talking about the app programmer side, then complexity may not be the primary metric, for maintainability and grokkability of the code is usually the key concern.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This page was spawned from a discussion that assumed the primary concern is avoiding </em><a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a>, for which <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are preferable not only because they avoid risky filters, but because they're easier to audit (because they don't need to reference external data or filters).  If avoiding <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> isn't the primary concern, but the primary concern is ensuring that accesses to the DBMS are minimised, than <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> is obviously preferable.  If the primary concern is minimising CPU resource for multiple executions of a given query, than <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are almost inevitably preferable.  If the primary concern is simplicity and readability of query definitions, then <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are almost inevitably preferable.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, if we are only auditing the application code via automated code inspectors, then the "score" depends on the API style used, not the underlying injection prevention technology. You appeared to agree that such an automated code checker would only be used on app-side code, not middle-ware nor DB implementation code. As far as the last sentence, I disagree for reasons already given, but I'm not here to debate grokkability and so will not repeat those points.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Automated code inspectors" were an aside; they weren't the point.  The point is that construction of </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions is simpler than construction of <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>.  You can see it immediately above in the difference between the two examples: The first $qry assignment requires filtered external data but the second $qry assignment does not.  Hence, the second is simpler than the first.  The illustrations at the top of this page are simply a general proof of that observation, using grammar complexity and assuming we've put all the "$qry = ..." definitions together by themselves.  If you do put all the "$qry = ..." definitions together by themselves, I noted (as an aside) that you can easily use automated code inspectors, but it's not a requirement.  The point is that no matter how or where you inspect the client-side code -- whether manually or automatically, whether inside middle-ware or not using middle-ware -- <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition construction will be simpler than <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> construction because the latter requires filtered external data but the former does not.<em></em>

      <p>
        If it's an "aside", then you've failed to illustrate and measure your complexity claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please read the top of this page.

This is demonstrated by a difference in grammar between the former and the latter -- the grammar for code that constructs <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> needs to include code for filtered external data, whilst the grammar for code that constructs equivalent <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> excludes (by omission) code for filtered external data.  The fact that you can use such grammars to automate validation of code was an aside (and a bit of a bonus, perhaps) but it isn't the point.  The point is that one SQL construct needs filtered external data and the other doesn't.<em></em>

      <p>
        While I will concede that <strong>certain parts</strong> of filter technology may be more complicated (perhaps parts that don't even matter to most developers or shops because they can be abstracted away), I've seen <strong>no</strong> clear evidence that the <strong>total sum complexity</strong> is less. You appear to be improperly <strong>extrapolating cherry-picked aspects into the whole</strong>, which to me is being intellectually sloppy. Shape up! It comes across similar to: 
      </p>
      <code>
        "Bicycles require bicycle seats while cars don't.<br/>
        Therefore, bicycles are more complicated than cars."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now, maybe in the end the total complexity for filters is indeed more than that of total PS technology, but you have provided very little encompassing evidence other than a narrow selection of pet parts you keep obsessing on. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What I "keep obsessing on" is the crucial and inescapable difference: requiring filters vs not requiring filters.  Between </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions and <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> construction -- including the low-level APIs to send SQL to the DBMS and retrieve result sets or response codes -- there is <strong>no</strong> other difference in complexity.<em></em>

      <ul>

           PROVE there is "no other difference in complexity", don't just claim it. Claims are cheep. (I suspect you are going to go back to the "bundling" argument.

I'm not going to spend 5000 hours digging in source and cataloging it to prove X when likely you'll end up saying, "but I never claimed X". Do you mean "constructing" by application developers? They can be using Example-1A style construction if they want (and have the middle-ware to support it). And the fact that some parts are in middle-ware versus the main RDBMS is an arbitrary packaging choice: the position/level is not inherently forced by the nature of the two technologies themselves. <strong>There is no inherent feature of filters that keeps much of them from being implemented in the out-of-the-box RDBMS.</strong> I could fork PostgreSQL into FilterGreSql and add native filtering API's/services to put the filter services at the bottom level of the stack. It's just <strong>arbitrary packaging</strong>. And I could remove PS-related services to reduce the code size (and complexity). Support for filters adds complexity somewhere and support for PS's adds complexity somewhere; and that "somewhere" is pretty arbitrary. <strong>A total stack that doesn't support filters will be smaller than a total stack that does support filters, and a total stack that doesn't support PS's will be smaller than a total stack that does support PS's.</strong>

           <em>It may not be typical in terms of your (or anyone's) particular coding style, but it is typical in terms of the content involved in constructing </em><a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>.  SQL DBMSs invariably expose an API method that permits submitting <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> text for immediate execution -- regardless of API or coding style -- so constructing <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> text for immediate execution must involve concatenation of static strings with filtered external data.

        <em>A better analogy (to the extent that any analogy is comparable) is that cars with automatic transmissions (</em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions) are easier to drive (audit) than cars with manual transmissions (<a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> construction) because cars with automatic transmissions don't need a clutch (filters) to change gears (external data).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But the <em>total</em> manual-shift car is <em>mechanically</em> simpler: it has fewer total parts.  The <strong>"complexity" is matter of perspective</strong> (car versus user effort), and I don't know what perspective your PS claim is coming from, and attempts to narrow that down keep proving futile for reasons that escape me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Fewer parts is irrelevant.  Using the car analogy, we're talking about driving complexity (filters vs non-filters), not mechanical complexity (DBMS internals).

From the point of view of a middle-ware or application developer (or auditor), that is significant.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why are you counting middle-ware complexity but not DBMS complexity? Because it's "bundled"? You can only exclude DBMS-side complexity if you can clearly justify the reason for drawing such a seemingly arbitrary line in the stack-sand.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The focus of this page is, and has always been, the complexity of constructing and (particularly) auditing the construction of </em><a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> vs <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions.  The DBMS interprets these statements, it doesn't create them.  Obviously, creating SQL is particularly of concern in avoiding <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a>, and discussing that topic in relation to <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is what spawned this page.  Whilst auditing DBMSs is certainly a concern for a relatively small number of security-critical applications, it's not an area that the typical database-driven application developer, or the typical middleware developer, is likely to encounter.  For most database-driven application or middleware developers, auditing the client-side is a valid concern; auditing the DBMS is not.<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Furthermore, within a typical SQL DBMS there is no strong separation of </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> handling from <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> handling.  In SQL DBMSs, these are largely integrated, such that an auditor is going to be looking at the security of the DBMS as a whole.  Thus, it no longer makes sense to distinguish <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> from <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> -- at least in terms of auditing complexity -- on the DBMS-side.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "As a whole"? Please elaborate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>An application mission-critical enough to warrant a source-level audit of a (likely enterprise-grade) DBMS is almost certainly going to audit the whole DBMS, and not just stop at (say) the part that recognises </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> parameters.<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Anyway, auditing a DBMS -- relative to auditing application code or middleware -- is such a specialised, rare and unusual task as to be essentially irrelevant here.  This page was spawned from concerns over avoiding </em><a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> related to <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>, which is a concern every time a database-driven application is built.  Concerns about a DBMS sufficient to warrant auditing the DBMS source is a whole different category of activity, with different motivations, and it almost never happens.  For instance, auditing the DBMS is almost certainly not about <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> (or at least it's a negligible concern) because <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> results from constructing queries; it does not result from parsing, planning, and executing them.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The only level we both agree on is the app level. Doing middle-ware and/or DB source inspection is up the organization per needs and resource trade-offs. And app level depends heavily on the API design, which is mostly orthogonal to the PS-versus-filters issue. QED #47.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The style of coding at the application level -- or what happens inside middle-ware -- may depend on the DBMS API design but the content of constructed queries is dependent on what functionality the DBMS exposes:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If the DBMS exposes a mechanism to support immediate execution of SQL text (i.e., </em><a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a>), then the SQL will inevitably be composed of static strings concatenated with filtered (to be safe from <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a>) external data.<em>  </em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>If the DBMS exposes mechanisms to support definition and execution of pre-defined parametrised SQL text (i.e., </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>), then the SQL definitions will inevitably be composed of one or more concatenated static strings, but external data should be excluded from the definitions because external data (no filters needed) should be passed as parameter arguments at the point of execution.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>That will be true at the low-level DBMS API, no matter what API design is used, as long as the aforementioned DBMS functionality is exposed.  (Note: Every popular SQL DBMS exposes it via ODBC, JDBC, native APIs, etc.)  It will be true no matter what higher-level API design is used on top of the low-level DBMS API, though the difference between </em><a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> and <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> may only be visible inside the higher-level API.  <a href="ObjectRelationalMappingLayer.html">ObjectRelationalMappingLayer</a>s, for example, may not expose <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> or <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> (or any SQL at all) but the developer of the <a href="ObjectRelationalMappingLayer.html">ObjectRelationalMappingLayer</a> will have had to deal with either or both.<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>In short, whoever interacts directly with the DBMS will have to tackle the difference in complexity between constructing </em><a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> or <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions, because they're invariably what the DBMS exposes to the client-side.<em></em>
