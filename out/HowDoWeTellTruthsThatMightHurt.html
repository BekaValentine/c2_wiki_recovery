        Famous essay (more accurately, a collection of quotes) by <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a>.  Rather controversial and inflammatory; more so when it was written.

        Also contains lots of flames for <a href="IbmCorporation.html">IbmCorporation</a>, which in the 70s had a reputation and market position even greater than that of <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> today.

        Also contains lots of useful bits of advice.
