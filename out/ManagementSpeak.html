        To operationalize this strategy, we will:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Empower and align enterprise core competencies, with the evolving globalization of the strategic marketplace for customers and resources.
        </li>
        <li>
           Employ post state of the art, practices internally and externally to evolve our organizational ecosystem.
        </li>
        <li>
           Embrace change (even though it's prickly like a porcupine and squirms around like a Labrador pup.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Throughout, technology will allow us to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           disintermediate, throughout the distributed value chain,
        </li>

           informationalize, through a vital information ecosystem,
        </li>
        <li>
           optimize, our processes and practices
        </li>
        <li>
           and anticipate then exploit strategic, operational, and tactical opportunites.
        </li>
      </ul>

        No, no, no. Read the first half of the first sentence again. Synergize our <em>customer's</em> core competencies?!? What the heck is <em>that</em> supposed to mean? Junk like this is strictly a joke, although we have all seen similar kaka that is <em>not</em> intended to be phunny, but a real mission statement. Oy. So now the question becomes, how do we fight this drivel? What should we do to squash it?

        Seems like what used to be called Gobbledegook.  There was a column in one of the Washington D.C. papers I think that used to publish the choicest examples of this kind of thing.  It was Bureaucratic Government-speak!

        Are people susceptible to accept buzzword laden speech simply because they don't want to acknowledge the lack of meaning it conveys for fear of appearing stupid? That is to say, "Well, those are words. Words must mean something. I guess that must mean something. I don't know the meaning. I better just pretend otherwise because otherwise I'll look foolish for not understanding it."
      </p>
      <p>
        Get that into a feedback loop and that's where the real atrocities arise: suddenly these people who didn't understand the meaning in the first place are passing on such statements to other hapless individuals!
