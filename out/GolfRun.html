        <a href="GolfRun.html">GolfRun</a> is an esoteric programming language derived from <a href="GolfScript.html">GolfScript</a>. <a href="GolfRun.html">GolfRun</a> is almost compatible with <a href="GolfScript.html">GolfScript</a>, except for few details and new features. <a href="GolfRun.html">GolfRun</a> loses some of <a href="GolfScript.html">GolfScript</a>'s golfing nuances (though it is still useful to win <a href="CodeGolf.html">CodeGolf</a>) and has as aim to gain "power" and to be more useful as generic programming language. As of April 2012, the language is still under the formal definition process; a reference interpreter written in C exists.
