        Meyer Test

      <p>
        Is a statement interesting? Can you make a case for its inverse?
      </p>
      <p>
        "Love each other"--not interesting, you can hardly make a case for "hate each other".
      </p>

        <em>The reverse of "love each other" is not "hate each other"  Does this pass the </em><a href="MeyerTest.html">MeyerTest</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you make a case for "love everyone else"?</em> It seems pretty clear to me that you can make a case for "love everyone else" and for "don't love everyone else", so neither of these statements is deemed trivial by Meyer's test.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Embrace change"--interesting, because you can make a case for "avoid change".

        the <a href="MeyerTest.html">MeyerTest</a>: "Our Sun is not in Our Solar System". <em>Sure. But the statement "We are in a solar system" doesn't fail the test.</em>

        Many people assume that the opposite of "love" is "hate".  I don't.  I think both love and hate are passionate emotions.  I feel that the opposite emotion from them is apathy. So, "Love each other" could be interesting because "Ignore each other" could have merit.  Everything I know about the <a href="MeyerTest.html">MeyerTest</a> is on this page.  And from that amount of research, I find it rather faulted because it is susceptible to the interpretation of any word in a language.  Therefore, I find the <a href="MeyerTest.html">MeyerTest</a> of little use.  -- <a href="TerryLeeMoore.html">TerryLeeMoore</a> 13Jun02

        I find it of no practical use either. Note that I can make a case for "hate each other". Hate is just an extreme of abuse and exploit. Such a premise might ensure that a society doesn't get too large - a solution for overpopulation maybe.. And at least part of our own culture is based on systematic exploitation of others even if this is done subconsciously or unintentionally or by systemic effects. At least I know of an indigenous tribe (once living on the easter islands if I recall correctly) that was based on explaoitation. People were proud to exploit others. Everybody had to be careful every time. Any invitation had dangers and opportunities for exploitation. Exploitation is not yet hate but the direction is right. And love also has its shades. Please please note that I do not subscribe to "hate each other" but just play the <a href="DevilsAdvocate.html">DevilsAdvocate</a>. I think a case can theoretically be made for any statement involving social or psychological terms. The value of <a href="MeyerTest.html">MeyerTest</a> is more in its sprouting ideas than its value as a test.
