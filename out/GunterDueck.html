        ISBN: 3540673881 (<em>Why doesn't that work properly? Perhaps amazon.com doesn't list it, but amazon.de does.</em>), i.e.,

        The first two books are mainly related to theories by <a href="MyersBriggs.html">MyersBriggs</a> and <a href="DavidKeirsey.html">DavidKeirsey</a>.

        The book builds on the concepts of <a href="MyersBriggs.html">MyersBriggs</a> and <a href="DavidKeirsey.html">DavidKeirsey</a>. It mainly deals with consequences of the existence of temperament types in the fields of computer applications, education and research. He also covers in his theory that measuring and increasing quality of measurement through computer use will eventually show that happy (satisfied) humans are best for maximizing efficiency and profit. (Well this was an implicitly known thing, but computers will prove!)
        The best about his books is that they are written from a very subjective viewpoint - he admits that - and are always good for a smile or a frown.

        I had a short email exchange with him, concerning Keirsey temperaments and his theory of a connection between the limited supply of rationals (NT) and the lack of computer specialists. I think he really likes to discuss his thoughts via email.

        He has the rare talent to elegantly combine perspicacity and jokes in his admittedly deep reflections.
