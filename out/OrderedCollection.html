        Ordered Collection
      </h1>
      <p>
        A collection of items that can be accessed in an ordered fashion. Allows items to be inserted or removed by position. This is unlike an associative collection, such as a Map, or a Set that does not allow clients to positionally insert elements. Only an ordered collection can be sorted. If you have an un-ordered bag of elements, sorting them has no effect since its elements cannot be positionally accessed -- i.e. One cannot ask <em>is first element greater than second element?</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're confusing ordering with sequence, I think.  Among the various types of sorted collections you can have are:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Ordered set/bag.  Ordering does make sense here--as iteration through the collection can be made to proceed in an ordered fashion.  (Compare with a hashtable, for which such a traversal will provide the elements in an arbitrary, though deterministic, order).</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Ordered map/dict/multiset.  Similar to set/bag.  You can retrieve elements by key, obviously; but an iteration will proceed through the collection in a defined order</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Ordered array.  Elements are accessed (usually) by integers in range [0 .. size-1] or [1 .. size]; invariant that a(x) <= a(y) for all x<y is maintained.  Compare with an ordinary array; where the order of elements is the order of insertion (or changes only according to explicit order-changing operations by the program).</em>
