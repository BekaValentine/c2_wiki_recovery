        Programming Is What You Make Of It
      </h1>
      <p>
        Programming is like Thanksgiving dinner. Its either great or a flop. <em>Built on flip-flops?</em>

      <p>
        <em>I just can't agree with this. I've seen horrible and wonderful software, and 2^256 degrees between. I'd say programming is like any human, both flawed and great, both liberating and oppressive, but always resembling the system that created it. Software is like humans as humans are like god. </em>
