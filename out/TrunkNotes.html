        Trunk Notes

      <p>
        Trunk Notes is a personal wiki for the iPhone and iPod Touch, and is developed by Apps On The Move.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki entries use the <a href="MarkDown.html">MarkDown</a> syntax. Text, image and sound wiki entries can be created. The interface is designed to allow for easy creation and searching of notes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dynamic content allow you to implement a highly customized information system. One example is using Trunk Notes as a GTD tool. Write "@phone 12/02/2010 (1) Call Bob about the meeting" on a line in a note concerning an important project. On the page @phone you can generate a list of all relevant actions using {{action @phone}}. Trunk Notes will search the wiki for actions with the @phone context and sort in date and priority order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trunk Notes can export the entire wiki as a series of plain text files. The wiki can also be accessed in any web browser by connecting to a web server running on the iPhone or iPod Touch.

           Huh. Sounds a lot like the "Intelligence" system of the <a href="AppleNewton.html">AppleNewton</a>, but extendable by the user.
