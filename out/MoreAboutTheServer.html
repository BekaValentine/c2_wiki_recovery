        More About The Server
      </h1>
      <p>
        The server now runs CentOS, a <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a> clone, on a 64-bit kernel. The hardware is a Celeron clocking 10x and storing 2x our previous setup. Pages are served by a cgi (<a href="CommonGatewayInterface.html">CommonGatewayInterface</a>) script written in perl. The <a href="ApacheHttpd.html">ApacheHttpd</a> daemon runs the script for every page retrieved. It would be possible, should load demand, to <a href="RunScriptAsDaemon.html">RunScriptAsDaemon</a> and thereby avoid these per-page overheads...

        Another obvious optimization would be to run Wiki under <a href="ModPerl.html">ModPerl</a>.

        Also, FastCGI should be an easy way to speed up scripts. <a href="http://www.fastcgi.com/">http://www.fastcgi.com/</a>

      <p>
        Can someone help on this? I have scripts turned off, and when I request a wiki page the browser asks me a few times whether "Do you want to allow scripts?", whereas the Google search only asks once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also I think if I have recent changes (or new recent changes) up and if I leave these alone, 20 minutes later I am prompted by a whole bunch of "Do you want to allow scripts" questions.
