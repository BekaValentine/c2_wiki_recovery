        Before I had access to a computer, I just read BASIC code for simple games from a magazine, until I began to understand them, but I couldn't test them since I had no computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started programming in 1986 on a <a href="SinclairSpectrum.html">SinclairSpectrum</a>, in BASIC, no functions, no subroutines, just GOTO, GOSUB, RETURN, but interestingly a useful abstraction was INPUT, LET, PRINT. The abstraction was: <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>. See <a href="AllAbstractionsLie.html">AllAbstractionsLie</a>. (I don't mean to say abstractions are evil, but that abstractions can be improved).
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1987, I started a journey at the University of Chile to become a Comp. Sci. Engineer. The first year, I learned Pascal and got rid of GOTO. The third year, I learned indexing and got rid of linear search.
      </p>
      <p>
        My first programming job was in 1992 when I was still studying, in C++. Tough language, not so tough boss, I became expert by week 10, not because I was a real expert, but there was no-one around to ask anything.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, you can create several classes per hour, but as your class library matures, you can <a href="DoMoreWithLess.html">DoMoreWithLess</a> and you create fewer classes and reuse them more. Code 1 hour, debug 1 day was the pace of work. A bug made by someone else bites you, you may be debugging for 3 days if lucky. The solution: <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. I didn't automate them fully as <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> does, but it had the same purpose and result. Also, since you debug less, you have more time to refactor your code and you learn OO faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 3 years, I realized C++ was a dead end: Too many rules to remember while at the same time the same thing in Smalltalk was simple and sometimes already solved and you just needed to use it. C++ is faster, yeah right, not really because it takes the whole day to recompile the whole homegrown class library, and because of those blood sucking memory leaks and those core dumps. Besides applications used lots of memory, an Smalltalk app would have used less and be more efficient. Ever wonder there is a better life out there? Absolutely! There is no standard class library in C++ because C++ is not OO. STL is template technology and templates are not OO. Besides templates in C++ are getting slower than Java objects. See <a href="http://www.kano.net/javabench/index">http://www.kano.net/javabench/index</a> for benchmark data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Work in C++ yet? Of course, if they are willing to pay what it takes. Most rational companies prefer <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, because productivity is higher, programmers become productive faster, time to market is everything, etc. Java programmers are happier because salaries are higher too and they can be home for dinner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also benchmarks are showing that Java is catching up on C++. See <a href="http://www.idiom.com/~zilla/Computer/javaCbenchmark.html.">http://www.idiom.com/~zilla/Computer/javaCbenchmark.html.</a> Besides, the remaining development time you may use for improving the algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main problem with C++ is that it doesn't have <a href="ConceptualIntegrity.html">ConceptualIntegrity</a>, <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> is impossible because you either embrace it or you simply have an ugly octopus, <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> doesn't work as expected (although some say Eiffel got <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> right, besides Eiffel compiles into C, therefore who needs C++ if you can write in a much better language instead?). See also <a href="GenericVsObjectOrientedProgramming.html">GenericVsObjectOrientedProgramming</a>.

        <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is not <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, but it is so much better than C++ (<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>).

        <strong>If you've finally given up on this, then it's time to retract the pages you wrote about this. They're quite messy due to all the people arguing with you, and deleting them might be the best cleanup.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yep, I did remove the page, but someone must have really liked it and took it back to life. It is a excellent example of buggy software, although I prefer the following since I've seen them too many times:
      </p>
      <p>
        char * fullFilename( char * path, char * filename )
        {
      </p>
      <code>
        char * ret = malloc( strlen( path ) + strlen( filename ) * 2 );<br/>
        strcpy( ret, path );<br/>
        strcat( ret, "/" );<br/>
        strcat( ret, filename );<br/>
        return ret;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        What happens when filename == "a"?
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, memory should be returned in the same method where it was asked for. I think there is a pattern for this, do you know it's name? <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>.

        <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> is about Reuse
      </p>
      <p>
        Reuse can be declared achieved only when a module has been reused for at least 3 times. The <a href="RuleOfThree.html">RuleOfThree</a> applies here?
      </p>
      <p>
        Reuse is important for any software, not just object oriented software. <a href="ComponentOriented.html">ComponentOriented</a> software is supposed to achieve reuse too, but I have almost never reused an EJB. Have you? Reusing <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> is simpler when using XSLT transformations, and <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> may be implemented using EJB underneath. It's expensive to reuse, but you can do it. Probably using MDB is better than using SessionBeans in this case.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a module is not reusable, it is not <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>. If it has not been reused, you can't claim it to be reusable.
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="ReuseReleaseEquivalencePrinciple.html">ReuseReleaseEquivalencePrinciple</a>. It is useless to release software components if they do not specify their version. If they can communicate, which is usual in distributed environment as J2EE, they should publish each others versions and negotiate a protocol version to talk. Otherwise how do you expect to deploy a new version, all at once? You can't be serious about that.

            <li>
               Testing interfaces is wiser than testing classes, because several classes can implement the same interfaces and the interfaces are the ones that should expose behavior. Classes are just implementations: You do not want to exchange an implementation if the whole system may break down.

For example, instead of using an array to implement a queue, create a queue class. If objects can't be repeated in a container, use a set. This means that you will always create new containers instead of reusing the old containers. Creating new containers is complicated, but using them is simpler, therefore the bug count will go down dramatically if you <a href="GetTheRightAbstraction.html">GetTheRightAbstraction</a>s.

               In Java remember to use try-finally for avoiding <a href="ResourceLeak.html">ResourceLeak</a>s. In C++ destructors took care of that, and that was a very nice and clean, exception safe solution. But anyway, ReleaseResourcesAsSoonAsPossible, specially if we are talking about the locking/<a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a>/synchronization objects. The exception to this rule is when you need to write to a file, like a log file, in which case opening and closing the file for each write is <strong>obviously</strong> a bad idea. I've seen this defect too many times: Several threads try to open the same file at the same time, only one succeeds and the others lock as a <a href="ConvoyFormation.html">ConvoyFormation</a>. Each write operation takes eons, because opening a file is a very expensive operation. Instead keep the file open and cache the data in memory using a synchronized data structure like a Vector or better yet a ConcurrentQueue that has a thread writing to the file.

        UserInterfaces must be consistent, not only with itself, but with what the user is used to. Most users are used to Windows and <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a>, so most user interfaces should be modelled after that. On the other hand, UI must be reactive: Whenever a user does something, immediately something has to happen (on the screen or otherwise) to signal an acknowledge. For example if the user hovers over a button, the button must pop out immediately. That's a very important feature. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than that, <a href="DirectManipulation.html">DirectManipulation</a> is king. An ideal UI would be one in which there would be no applications, just data with behavior.

        <strong>About </strong><a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems everyone has its own favorite, different and incompatible definition of what <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> is.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was taken from <a href="NygaardClassification.html">NygaardClassification</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Object-oriented programming. A program execution is regarded as a physical model, simulating the behavior of either a real or imaginary part of the world.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'd like to express my sincere disagreement with that classification, only that it says <strong>behavior</strong> and I think that in that respect it is correct, too much correct to disagree with the whole phrase, but only I consider that word to be correct, the rest of the text is misleading, IMHO. There is nothing physical, real or imaginary on <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>, at least not more than in other programming paradigms. When you do <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming, you are modelling the world (the problem domain) using data organized in objects. This is not different from <a href="StructuredProgramming.html">StructuredProgramming</a> yet. This data has behavior that is organized in classes (object factories). So each object belongs to one and only one factory that fully determines its behavior. If it were not because of the behavior, this would be identical to <a href="StructuredProgramming.html">StructuredProgramming</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If it were not because of Inheritance, <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> would be identical to <a href="GenericProgramming.html">GenericProgramming</a> or ComponentProgramming. But ComponentProgramming does not have <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a>. <a href="GenericProgramming.html">GenericProgramming</a> does have <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a>, only of the <a href="ParametricPolymorphism.html">ParametricPolymorphism</a> kind.

        <strong>Regarding </strong><a href="NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs.html">NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think we need to define what a definition is. A definition is not just an abstraction, because not all abstractions are definitions. A definition is composed of a Definiendum and a Definiens. The definiendum is the set to which it belongs. The definiens is the characteristic that uniquely identifies the concept inside the definiendum.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any questions?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, according to that definition of definition, the definition of OOP is:
      </p>
      <p>
        Definiendum: Programming methodology.
        Definiens: Responsibility (of execution) is assigned to classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short we can say <em>OOP is the programming methodology in which responsibility (of execution) is assigned to classes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This requires a definition of class. <em>A class is an object that creates other objects and that determines the behavior of those objects through the specification of the messages they can respond to by the definition of the corresponding methods and by the use of inheritance of classes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This requires a definition of inheritance of classes. <em>Inheritance of classes is a property of classes that allows classes to use methods defined in other classes as if they were their own, while at the same time, when the reused methods are executed, unknowingly they may send messages to the class that is reusing them.</em> This is just an specification of <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>, IMHO, is <a href="ResponsibilityDrivenDesign.html">ResponsibilityDrivenDesign</a> through the use of <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a> achieved by inheritance and encapsulation.

      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AlexanderStepanov.html">AlexanderStepanov</a> says that <a href="ObjectOrientationIsaHoax.html">ObjectOrientationIsaHoax</a> because you first gotta find the <em>interesting algorithms</em> and then you can find the appropriate data structures, as in mathematics you first find the interesting theorems and then you find the axioms, not the other way around. <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>, in his point of view, therefore is: Find the axioms (the classes), then find the algorithms (the methods).
      </p>
      <p>
        IMHO, <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> is not about finding first one or the other, you can find either. But forcing developers to first find the algorithms is probably wrong. The algorithms are not <em>interesting</em>, they must just solve a problem in an object space. Maybe that's the reason why STL has not come up with anything useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AlexanderStepanov.html">AlexanderStepanov</a> argues that he has never seen interesting code from <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> developers. Maybe that's the whole point of <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>. No piece of code is the <em>central idea</em> of an <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> program. But interesting code is not about being enamored of a thousand lines, it is about usefulness. See BitBlt and the GUI, those are good examples that <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> works. Do you have anything like those in STL? STL simply doesn't work, it is just interesting for mathematicians, not for real work, because you must know everything in advance (all the theorems) before anything can be done (the right axioms are elusive). See <a href="GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem.html">GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem</a>. STL is not dynamic, you can't change its behavior incrementally, so you either have everything or you have nothing. That's not a model of programming I would like to work in.

        <strong>Regarding </strong><a href="ReuseHasFailed.html">ReuseHasFailed</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that if <a href="ReuseHasFailed.html">ReuseHasFailed</a> then ObjectOrientationHasFailed, but only in the context of your project. My projects achieve reuse because I always take the time to think in the <a href="DependencyInversionPrinciple.html">DependencyInversionPrinciple</a> and try to apply it to the classes I create, so whatever they try to achieve, they do using the narrowest possible requirements and they solve the problem they are trying to solve in the most general way. This means I spend a lot of time refactoring to <a href="GetTheRightAbstraction.html">GetTheRightAbstraction</a>, but usually it is time well spent. The usual analogy I use is the stair: If you want to get to the 20th floor using a stair, it is faster if you do it step by step.

           Regarding <a href="UseClosuresNotEnumerations.html">UseClosuresNotEnumerations</a> (should be UseClosuresNotIterators instead):
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My opinion is that by using Closures you feel motivated to create all closures in advance and then just use them. In other words, if you want to print the elements in a collection:
      </p>
      <code>
        class PrintClosure extends Closure<br/>
        {<br/>
        public void exec( Object item ) <br/>
        {<br/>
        System.out.prinln( item );<br/>
        } <br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then you use it like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        collection.forEach( new PrintClosure() );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This can be important for writing things <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. Besides, if the underlying <a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a> changes, it is easier to just reimplement forEach instead of changing all those for loops.

        <strong>About </strong><a href="MemoryLeak.html">MemoryLeak</a>s in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A memory leak is a piece of memory that is not accessible to the program or to the <i>garbage collector</i> (tm).
      </p>
      <p>
        A dangling reference is when a single piece of memory is used by two objects as if it were their own, because some object called delete on another, but there was a reference somewhere to the deallocated object. This can't happen in Java, but it can happen still in C++ and C# (for unmanaged code).
      </p>
      <p>
        A buffer overflow occurs when an array is accessed using an index out of range and no ArrayIndexOutOfRangeException is thrown. Again: This can't happen in Java, but it can happen still in C++ and C# (for unmanaged code).
      </p>
      <p>
        An unused memory reference by class invariant leak is memory that can be accessed by the program, but the class invariant does not permit to access it. For example you implement an stack in an array and forget to null out elements when popping the stack.
