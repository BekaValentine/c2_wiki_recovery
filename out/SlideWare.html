        <a href="SlideWare.html">SlideWare</a> is software that exists only on slides. Colorful, fancy, <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a> driven presentations of nothing. One form of <a href="VaporWare.html">VaporWare</a>.

        A riddle sometimes heard among developers:

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Q:</strong> On what platform does (name your bloatware) run most effectively?</dd>

        <em>Also known as Power Point Application:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An application that only works as a <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a> presentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Characteristics of such applications that solve all problems, integrate seamlessly with all existing applications, run on platforms, performance is brilliant (i.e., twice as fast as the competition), and cost a fraction of the cost of what the competition offers. The best part about PowerPointApplications is that they take next to no time to realize.

        The "setup tool" for my cable router was <a href="SlideWare.html">SlideWare</a>. After I went to the trouble of installing <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> on dual boot, all the stupid thing did was walk me through all the steps that could have been in the manual.
