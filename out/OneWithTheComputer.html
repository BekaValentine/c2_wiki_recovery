      </h1>
      <p>
        That state where you have a vague instinct that something should be changed on the computer, and, slightly hampered by the fact that you can't tell the computer directly (you have to use the keyboard), the thing is changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Important aspects to this state:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the interface the computer provides is immaterial
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
