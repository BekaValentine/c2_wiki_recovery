        Mechanism Not Policy
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Mechanism, not policy" is the mantra of the <a href="XwindowProtocol.html">XwindowProtocol</a>. Mechanism is in the <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a>, policy is up to the individual <a href="GuiToolkit.html">GuiToolkit</a>s and <a href="WindowManager.html">WindowManager</a>s. This fundamental guideline led to several architectural choices that are missing from most other graphics systems.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Low-level drawing instead of widgets. This allows for choice among toolkits, look-and-feel, and skinning.
        </li>
        <li>
           Window management outside of the server. This allowed for much customization of and experimentation on desktop (and other) metaphors.
        </li>
        <li>
           Protocol instead of API.  The X window system defines its operations in terms of asynchronous stream protocols instead of function bindings.  This allows X applications to run on different machines than the graphics hardware (network transparency).  It also allows for multiple implementations of the <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is worth noting that one of the policies that was left to the server, managing and rendering fonts, is now widely regarded as a design error.  This policy has now been migrated out of the server, via fontconfig, FreeType (Xft), and the Xrender extension.  Now the <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a> only manages the glyphs.  Fonts are managed and glyphs are rendered by client-side libraries.  This change in policy is responsible for X's ability to render anti-aliased fonts.
