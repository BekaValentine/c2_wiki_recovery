        Edit Text Variations

      <p>
        Many paths can be taken to get to a common goal. Editing wiki pages has a number of paths too.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the most part, following on from <a href="WardsOriginalWiki.html">WardsOriginalWiki</a> (where <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> is the method), <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> have an edit function located somewhere on the pages they display. Using the function, perhaps by clicking a button or following a link, a second page appears with a form for editing the text of the page. The form has a save function, most often as a button. Depending on the implementation, you may subsequently be presented with a confirmation page, as on this wiki, or returned to the page whose text you were just editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a>, like <a href="YetAnotherWikiName.html">YetAnotherWikiName</a>, and also especially micro-engines from the <a href="ShortestWikiContest.html">ShortestWikiContest</a> like <a href="SigWik.html">SigWik</a>, have the edit form displayed beneath the content on every page you view. Some <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> software, such as <a href="NoteStudio.html">NoteStudio</a> and <a href="WikiWriter.html">WikiWriter</a>, use an icon to toggle between edit mode and regular display mode on the same icon. Others such as <a href="NoteWiki.html">NoteWiki</a> offer <em></em><a href="ModeLess.html">ModeLess</a> editing<em>, in which data is saved continuously during editing.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Despite the appearances, this is a feature that might not necessarily seem promised to a great future. Granted, it makes creating links a breeze, but on the other hand being always on the edit mode seems to be creating other problems + there is no way to open other files. We'll have to wait till someone comes with a promising wiki featuring this always-on-the edit characteristic. We'll give a chance to the runner.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A few engines, such as <a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a>, support keyboard shortcuts (such as Alt-E for editing and Alt-S for saving), but problems arise with different browsers, because it is hard to find a combination that is not yet used in any browser.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In fact the Zwiki-edit-shortcut didn't work with Opera. In Mozilla, it works despite the "edit"-entry in its menubar.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Which version of Opera? I thought version 7 onwards should support Shift+Esc+e.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Of course, simple editing in general has been at times a <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>... see <a href="EmacsVsVi.html">EmacsVsVi</a>.
