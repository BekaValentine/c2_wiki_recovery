        Are Types Tied To Trees
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most static type systems seem inherently tied to trees in one way or another. This seems to stem from the need to have one and only one dispatching answer for "what type am I?" or "can I perform this operation?" (see <a href="TopOnTypes.html">TopOnTypes</a>). In order to have a fairly quick answer to such questions, a compiler cannot get lost in open-ended graphs. Thus, a static typing system seems either tied to trees or a directed graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in dynamic languages such as smalltalk, the "who answers me" search is generally a search up a class hierarchy.
      </p>

      <p>
        Pretty ambiguous question. Trees of inheritance relationships? Convertability relationships? Composition relationships (as in, a struct is composed of fields, which each have a type)?
      </p>
      <p>
        The most ubiquitous statically-typed language is C, and there is no obvious tree of types there.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No <a href="TopType.html">TopType</a>, so there's certainly no <em>single</em> tree of types.
        </li>
        <li>
           No inheritance, nor any notion of such in the built-in types.
        </li>
        <li>
           It does define both automatic and explicit conversion paths between built-in types. Those paths might form several distinct sub-trees, but, off the top of my head, I don't think that they do.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In C++, the presence of <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> to denote is-a relationships immediately negates the idea of trees among user-defined types. Rather, we have acyclic directed graphs, which are not trees. (Although you mention them in the opening paragraph.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But you said "most", so just looking at C and C++ is insufficient. A wider survey of static type systems in implemented languages would be needed to answer the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider an operator which can handle a specific set of argument types -- call them the declared types. In a valid call to this operator, you could:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Require that the argument types match <em>exactly</em> the declared types. (Whether static or dynamic is immaterial.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Require that the argument types have is-a relationships with the declared types. This assumes some notion of inheritance, and a (probably) acyclic graph of is-a relationships among types.
        </li>
        <li>
           Require that the arguments be <em>convertible</em> to the declared types. The convertability paths constitute a (possibly cyclic!) graph of relationships among types.
        </li>
        <li>
           Some combination of the former two requirement. C++ does this, limiting each argument to at most one user-defined conversiont. From personal experience, I can say that introducing user-defined conversions (via conversion member functions and implicit constructors) can very rapidly introduce ambiguity into operator calls that seem on first glance like they should be straightforward. It has to be done with great care.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since the first option is possible, I'd say that types are not <em>inherently</em> tied to trees. Built-in types can be defined without reference to other types, so certainly built-in types don't even need to have a tree implied via composition. But requiring argument types to match an operator's declared types seems rare these days, so in practice I'd say either an inheritance or convertability graph is usually present in a type system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just thoughts that came to mind, with no pretense of being rigorous or complete.

        Well, the C family is kind of "on your own" with regard to types. But languages which Costin may consider to follow <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> well seem bound to some kind of tree or restricted graphs. Perhaps another way of saying this is that the more the compiler can check and prevent, the more the typing system relies on trees or other restricted graphs.

        <em>Any sound type system must be a </em><a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a> (which trees are a subset of).  A type graph with cycles is inherently unsound.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [This follows, more or less, from the "theory of types" (a matter of pure math, not at the time related to then-non-existent CS/computers) developed in the early twentieth century to improve the foundations of mathematics by disallowing the <a href="RussellParadox.html">RussellParadox</a>. It became illegal to allow sets that do/do not contain themselves as members, roughly speaking. Instead a set at level A could only have as members sets at level A-1 or lower. Thus the overall inclusion mapping was restricted to a <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a> rather than being allowed to be an unrestricted graph. The previous anything-goes approach allowed paradox. Thus the comment "inherently unsound".]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Modern <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> seems to follow a similar philosophy; morphisms go down-level, never up-level, I believe, not that I'm an expert.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [It should be noted nonetheless that this "theory of types" approach to avoiding paradox is far from the only approach invented to do so, so I would be reluctant to say that it would be impossible to develop a sound type theory that allowed unrestricted graphs -- but the burden of proof would be on that system.]

        No.  Types are not tied to trees.  Types for both objects and values are 'patterns', which themselves are abstracted propositions (e.g. predicates are one form of pattern, so predicates can be used as types).  E.g a number can be in integer, odd, AND prime... 3 different types.   A person can be a human, an employer, a yuppie, AND heterosexual... 4 different types.

           You seem to be implying that <em>any</em> classification system is "types". This is as watered down as "everything is an object". Without a solid definition, it does not seem a very meaningful term this way, outside of providing a general notion. --top
        </li>
        <li>
           Yes.  <em>Any</em> classification is a <em>type</em>.  And it is not as useless as you're implying; if we could create a computer system that could very efficiently utilize <em>any</em> classification, I can assure you that we'd be using it.  However, I'd add that two different types only matter if they affect your behavior.  I.e. if your behavior won't change in response to signal being a 'prime' number, there is no reason to classify it in that manner.  --DB
        </li>
        <li>
           So "types == classifcation" and any classification system is by definition also a type system? --top
        </li>
        <li>
           Yes.  And any formal classification system is also a formal type system.  The only issue with the terminology is that programmers will usually associate 'class' with object-typing-systems and 'type' with value-typing-systems.  This is an artifact of naming choices in a few popular programming languages, and not inherent to the nature of typing or classification.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        By fundamental nature, types don't have objects.  Types are patterns... they might be associated with objects by an astute observer or inference system... but the 'types' themselves exist only as patterns in the observer, not the object.  Platonic forms are an inversion, a perversion... 'red' and 'triangle' have no reality in some objective universe; 'red' and 'triangle' exist only inside we who understand the universe by the use of patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trees and DAGs work well enough when you aren't dealing with a wide variety of objects.  They work when the problem domain, itself, has a very clear 'inheritance' hierarchy.  E.g. all triangles are polygons; all polygons are Area-Shapes (which might include bloboids, ellipses, etc.), which have surface-areas.  All Area-Shapes are Shapes (which can include volume-shapes, line-shapes, logical-viewpoint shapes, etc.)  All Shapes have a visual representation.  Etc. Etc. Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the use of these hierarchies begin to die a creeping, painful, hideous and 'cancerous' death of uncontrolled, exponential growth in the number of required 'types' when dealing with problem domains that do NOT present clear 'inheritance' hierarchies.  For example, let's add color... now there are 'red' things and 'green' things and 'blue' things.  A red triangle is a triangle, and it is also a red thing.  Red things have the property of enticing bulls to attack.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, some very intelligent designers have come up with a number of partial solutions to this sort of problem... they can add a color to every shape, for example... and say that the shape 'has a' color rather than 'is an' instance of a thing of that color.  The <a href="BridgePattern.html">BridgePattern</a>, <a href="AdapterPattern.html">AdapterPattern</a>, <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a>, <a href="DecoratorPattern.html">DecoratorPattern</a> etc. are all mechanisms developed largely to mitigate the problem associated with using tree-based hierarchies.

           Or better yet, use sets, or it's cousin: relational, and do away with goofy navigational patterns. --top
        </li>
        <li>
           ^_^  You like sets & relational, don'tcha?  Yes, use of relational to carry known, associative facts about external 'objects' will do part of the job.  However, it still essentially turns into the facade-tags system I mentioned below (whereby an RDF triple or the presence of an object-identifier in a table is 'tagging' the object as having a certain set of properties).  I share your general distaste for navigational patterns. (... however, I'm not much a fan of tables or Relational, either.  I'm doing work more in <a href="DataSpace.html">DataSpace</a> and <a href="KnowLedge.html">KnowLedge</a> systems.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But, still, even these begin to buckle under more advanced typing concepts... e.g. when we start to add behavioral types to objects, composite objects with emergent properties, and more.  Every orthogonal property grows the number of types needed by a factor of 2 or more... and you can only do so much to keep up... especially when you really do need lists of 'red things' and to vary your own behavior based upon what the 'thing' is.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For problem domains where exceptions to hierarchies are the norm, and for problem domains where a large number of different properties are used to classify objects for different uses, tree-based typing hierarchies are awful.  A better approach is a tagging-objects-with-property-facades (type by tag) or, better yet, using a compiler that can classify both values and objects with which it works both at runtime and (where possible) at compile-time and automatically categorize and determine behavior (e.g. via dispatch) based on -arbitrary- type/pattern criterion that is chosen (in code) at the call-site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the examples used for those design patterns brings up another issue... the sin of placing in objects those behaviors that belong to some external actor!  Triangles don't draw themselves; they are drawn by an artist that uses its understanding of the triangle to draw it.  Values don't serialize themselves; they are serialized by an actor in accordance to some sort of encodec.  Those sorts of failures cripple flexibility.  E.g. a '.css' for 3D should be casually possible, but when triangles draw themselves there is no 'artist' involved capable of imposing its own sense of style.  This inversion on behavior description that I often see in today's coding examples is, however, a rant I should save for some other day and some other page.
