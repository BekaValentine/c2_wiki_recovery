        Wiki Words Are Concepts

        <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s are not just a displeasing restriction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s are by their very restrictions more than a concatenation of their parts. Think of <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>: You have to restrict yourself to a <em>name</em>. With <a href="FreeLink.html">FreeLink</a>s you would have to give up this 'successful' restriction. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> is more a concept than a simple word. This is so partly by being unique. You have to think hard to find the "right" <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> for the concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> be considered a MiniPattern? <em>No, (wiki) words aren't patterns, some (wiki) words are used to name patterns.</em>

        <a href="RefactorMe.html">RefactorMe</a>: Can this be merged with <a href="WikiNameAdvantages.html">WikiNameAdvantages</a> (see esp. first point) or should that page be split up into its parts?
