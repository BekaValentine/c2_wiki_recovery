        It is a very capable drawing package, particularly good for diagrams with symbols and attached connections. Has anyone created new symbols/palettes for it?

        <em>Can you describe it a bit more? The documentation at the URL above is sparse and would like to know some more before spending time downloading it. Does it have templates for UML etc?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, it has "palettes" for everything, including UML, ERD, Flowchart, Booch, HP Fusion, Jacobson, OMT, network and logic circuits.
