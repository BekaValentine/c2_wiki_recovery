        Software Isa New Thing
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <em>Ecclesiastes</em> (Authorised Version) the preacher tells us that:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><em>ch1v9</em></dt>
        <dd>...there is no new thing under the sun.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        and asks:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt><em>ch1v10</em></dt>
        <dd>Is there any thing whereof it may be said, See, this is new? it hath been already of old time, which was before us.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Yes there is. Software is that thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, of course there was that thing with the little stones in the holes around Stonehenge circa Long Time Ago that turned out to be a program for keeping track of the seasons ...</em> Isn't that application specific hardware?

        At least my Genetic Programs are older than 'software', what some humans claim as having produced themselves alone. -- GodSmiling.
        | God can smile all he likes, he's nothing but a phantom emergent property of the brain, and thus wrote nothing, not the least of which would be 'Genetic Programs'...

        Software maintenance problems seem to be of old time: "And I detested all 
        the fruits of my labor under the sun, because I must leave them to a man who 
        is to come after me. And who knows whether he will be a wise man or a fool? 
        Yet he will have control over all the fruits of my wise labor under the sun."
        Eccl. 2:18-19

        Macbeth was no stranger to debugging:

        Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return<br/>
        To plague the inventor... <br/>
