        Stateful Session Beans

      <p>
        Using <a href="StatefulSessionBeans.html">StatefulSessionBeans</a> is a complex process involving Java introspection and code generation. Deployment also implies updates to or changes in the schema of the database on the server, as well as changes to the JNDI namespace contents provided by the server. For most developers, using a tool like the Application Server deployment tool is the only sensible way since it makes deployment a transparent process. The input for deployment is a deployable JAR file containing both Java classes and deployment descriptors.
