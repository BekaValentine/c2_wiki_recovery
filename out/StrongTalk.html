        Strong Talk
      </h1>
      <p>
        Actually spelt Strongtalk, this is a statically checked version of Smalltalk. The declarations and checks are optional; the underlying virtual machine does not interact with the type system and runs typed and untyped programs with the same performance.

        - See: <a href="http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/projects/strongtalk">http://www.cs.ucsb.edu/projects/strongtalk</a> to download Strongtalk. You can also read about the history and
        get hold of several whitepapers and the  (quite dated) OOPSLA 93 technical paper.

        <em>Expanding on the above: Usually people expect type annotations help improve performance, and apparently </em><a href="StrongTalk.html">StrongTalk</a> is indeed fast, but a comment on <a href="SmallTalkFrequentlyAnsweredFud.html">SmallTalkFrequentlyAnsweredFud</a> says that <a href="StrongTalk.html">StrongTalk</a> runs very fast, but independently of whether type annotations are used. In other words, the performance of <a href="StrongTalk.html">StrongTalk</a> apparently is purely due to the compiler technology, not the type annotations.<em></em>

        The OOPSLA'93 paper does NOT live up to their claims of being able to
        handle every Smalltalk program.  That paper requires changes to the
        language.  This web page claims that the next version of the system
        solved the remaining problems.  Perhaps so, since the authors are
        smart folks who worked hard at it.  However, we will probably never
        see this system, because the company got bought by Sun.  So, for all
        practical purposes, the claims on this page are just empty boasting, with
        nothing to back it up.  -<a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        We never claimed that the Strongtalk type-system could handle every Smalltalk program.  However, we do claim that it works (on a large scale, not just on toy programs), and preserves the essential flavor of programming in Smalltalk.  The system is now available for free download at the link above, so anyone is welcome to see for themself.  -Dave Griswold
