        Very Old Person

      <p>
        A <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> can sometimes be useful. It depends on the ratio of experience gained to time elapsed but it's hard to get old in this world without absorbing <a href="SomeWisdom.html">SomeWisdom</a> along the way. Consider sponsoring a <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> by including one in your team. They are easy to keep, don't mess the carpets and can contribute <a href="SomeWisdom.html">SomeWisdom</a> to the day's proceedings.

        Youth is not wasted on the young - they can have it and good luck to them. All that angst and hormones. All the chasing around trying to find a lover, a great car, a good career, an exciting image... All that religious fervor about <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s...

        What has this to do with <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>? Just this; to me xp encapsulates <a href="SomeWisdom.html">SomeWisdom</a> which must have been gained over a long time. So I suspect <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> of being a <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> himself. My efforts to implement xp in an environment where there was not a <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> on the team to calm all the hormone-induced ballyhoo have convinced me that a <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> is a key requirement of making xp work. But then I'm biased.

        I think the key is respect. Both young and old bring value to the table. The old bring tried-and-true experience; the young, not hindered by experience, may bring more creativity. The trick is to make our differences complement rather than compete. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

        One of the advantages of having a VOP on the team is that they've seen all the hype before and have perspective on it that the VYP's don't have. Respect is essential between VOPs and VYPs but patience is equally necessary since VYPs (often characterized as "young Turks" tend to think of VOPs as "old fuds.") "Been there, done that" doesn't help much unless "learned this" is included.  Those who refuse to learn from history (VOP's experience) are doomed to repeat it.

        The eminent OrsonWelles once told the then-young actor JohnHurt that <em>experience</em> isn't really all that valuable. All <em>experience</em> teaches you is that there are a lot more ways to do something than you think.

        While this may seem dismissive of acquired wisdom, I think it does point out the main difference between the young programmers and the older programmers I've worked with. The young always think there is a "right way" to do something, and finding it and doing it that way is important. The more-experienced just get things done without too much concern for whether they are doing the "best" possible way. Principles like <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>, <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, and <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> all seem to have come from people with a <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another general difference between young and old is the enthusiasm for learning all the details of new products. Young programmers will often dive in and learn every nuance of some new language/OS/tool before trying to use it. A <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> is less likely to do this, not because of lack of desire to learn new things, but because every "new" product is 98% the same as some old product that the VOP has already used, and studying the 2% difference is not an interesting activity. A <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> is unlikely to be interested in <a href="CsharpVsJava.html">CsharpVsJava</a> kinds of arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, the <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> lessons have to be gained from experience; it is almost impossible to teach them to the young. The young are most likely to see a <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> as jaded, burnt-out, or old-fashioned. Many young programmers get downright ornery when it is suggested that they should not spend so much time finding the "correct" way to do something or learning everything about a "new" technology.  Someday, they'll understand, but today, they just can't.

        Good judgement is the result of experience ... Experience is the result of bad judgement.

        Is <a href="VeryOldPerson.html">VeryOldPerson</a> synonymous with <a href="OldTimer.html">OldTimer</a>, or is there a distinction related to wisdom gained vs just being around for a while?
