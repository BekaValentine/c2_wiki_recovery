        Hi this is Mike, able to edit my page now.

      <p>
        I use Michael D Crawford always in my name to distinguish myself from the actor Michael Crawford, who starred in the London production of Phantom of the Opera.  I frequently get email from mistaken female admirers (some much older than I, and some so young I must reply to their mothers about their mistake), and sometimes I am accused of being an impostor.  I was born with the name, while the actor changed his for the stage.
