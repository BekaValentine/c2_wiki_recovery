        I'm a OO designer/developer working on my first large scale project for a company whose primary business is *not* software.  I was aware of Alexander and taken by <a href="TheTimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TheTimelessWayOfBuilding</a> before I realized that my profession was the only one that was taking the ideas seriously.  Kept me in software development when I considered getting out.

        I'm based in Eastport, Maine, at the Edge of America, but work for a firm in Watertown, Mass.  When I'm not programming I'm reading about patterns (lately); I'm also preparing to direct Shakespeare's TheTempest, and would love anyone's ideas.  Software development has taught me to value ideas people give you to steal.
