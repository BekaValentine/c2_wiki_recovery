        This is a concept which involves DataCollectionStructures in uneven, differing assemblies of information established in and recovered from various locations. A considerable number of LinkableObjectsActionsAndMessages, made ReachableObjectsOrArtifacts in a massive InformationUniverse.

        Any link you may choose to use can be assigned a unique name to be used as the intersection. WikiWords are good choices because they are identifiers which have links which are either reachable, or can be made so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="BusinessIdentifier.html">BusinessIdentifier</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>I have no idea what you're on about, but it sounds interesting. Could you explain? To me, it looks like you're reinventing the notion of a "unique identifier" or "key", but I'm not sure. Does it involve an index, too? "[I]nvolving a </em><a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a> similar to a jagged array in the ... recovery of ..." stuff sounds like it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I have an idea which is somewhat foggy, but which I can imagine as having great potential for organizing information in new ways. For example <a href="BusinessIdentifier.html">BusinessIdentifier</a> can be conceived as an intersection of the terms (which can also be thought of as avenues) "Business" and "Identifier". This intersection is unique and is of type_Information. If it is discoverable as existing in an InformationArray, the array can be said to have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An InformationType
        </li>
        <li>
           A singularValue as in "CunninghamAndCunningham" (particularBusiness)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A seriesOfValues as in "PublicWikis" (businessType as a listArray or even a Uri or another <a href="InformationIntersection.html">InformationIntersection</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to being an "identifier", it includes words which are "navigators" which serve as guides taking you through a series of intersections, thereby allowing you to arrive at a unique location or value, or at a location identifying a series of locations or values. As such they may actually lead you to create ReportableValues, even to those including snapshots at a particular point in time, of artifacts which change with time. An example is the index in this wiki which is the <a href="InformationIntersection.html">InformationIntersection</a> of an artifact called a page and the pages which point to it, which we call "<a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a>". Note that as such it uses words, not numbers, to relate the objects. When we navigate to the intersection Back and Links in an InformationArray or InformationUniverse at a valuedIntersection, we will build the index for the valuedObject residing at that intersection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, I do believe you are describing a key, as defined in the </em><a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You mean like this?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <img src="http://service-architecture.static-barryandassociates.com/images/database/relational.jpg" />
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="http://www.service-architecture.com/database/articles/relational_model_concepts.html">http://www.service-architecture.com/database/articles/relational_model_concepts.html</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, exactly like that.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Does the model above apply if the <a href="InformationIntersection.html">InformationIntersection</a> is the name of a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>, and the page includes many words which can act as InformationIntersections which allow a user to navigate to one of several LinkableLocales?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Probably. What are "</em><a href="InformationIntersection.html">InformationIntersection</a>s" and "<a href="LinkableLocale.html">LinkableLocale</a>s"? This page doesn't make it clear.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How would you illustrate this concept using the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> you suggest? How would you represent a typical <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> and its linkages as keys? Are you suggesting a model which instead of rows and columns is a multidimensional component having 3, 4, 5, 6 or many more dimensions?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't know what you mean by "multidimensional component". One possibility would be the following:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        pages (pagename pk, creationdate, content)<br/>
        links (url pk, pagename fk)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>I've used the convention of indicating primary keys with 'pk' and foreign keys with 'fk'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Any number of alternatives would be equally viable, depending on your requirements and intended application.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        A wiki page can be said to be a sort of InformationArray because it is made up of words, WikiWords (which can be said to be InformationIntersections), processes and/or queries which are executed by identifying the particular object and by actualizing the <a href="InformationIntersection.html">InformationIntersection</a> by clicking on it. (This holds true of those things which are processes associated with the page, such as <a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a>, <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a>, <a href="MoreAboutCodes.html">MoreAboutCodes</a>, Save, <a href="CodeWord.html">CodeWord</a>, <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> of this page (last edited July 19, 2010), <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> by searching, or browse <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a> or take a <a href="VisualTour.html">VisualTour</a> ....
      </p>
      <p>
        I use a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> to illustrate this, because it is easily understandable. Forms other than <a href="WikiPages.html">WikiPages</a> exist such as  InformationArrays, InformationUniverses, URIs, WikiSites, Categories and Classifications, etc. The only thing necessary in an <a href="InformationIntersection.html">InformationIntersection</a> is that it includes at least two ArtifactNames. The intersection can contain almost an infinite number of ArtifactNames.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="InformationIntersection.html">InformationIntersection</a>s may be arrived at as a Physically Reachable location - Geo.Locale (<a href="LatLon.html">LatLon</a>)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Form example shown on <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a>'s page (32.82541nw117.22279))
        </li>
      </ul>

        Navigating
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Process of navigating to a specific <a href="InformationIntersection.html">InformationIntersection</a> moving down InformationAvenues, turning when required down a secondary avenue, repeating this process until arriving at the desired destination.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Examples:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Earth_The Country_StateOrProvince_City_StreetAddress_NameOfPerson
                </li>
                <li>
                   JohnQSmith.PresentAddress: Earth.USA.MO.KansasCity.812W29
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       <em> Each of the components in the above can also be considered to be "locales" or "domains" as well as "avenues".</em>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When the terminology is used in a InformationEngine where the components appear and are existing, reachable information links, they can be used as such.
