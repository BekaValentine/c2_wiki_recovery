        I'm a software developer at Progress Software in Bedford, MA. I'm now living in Benbrook, TX but telecommute to Progress machines in California and Massachussets. (Progress acquired my former employer--Persistence Software--based in San Mateo).

        I think I came across the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a> a few years back but didn't grok <em>Wiki</em> then. I recently came across <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (backing into it from <a href="TestFirstDesign.html">TestFirstDesign</a> :-)) and <strong>Wiki</strong> was there again!
      </p>
      <p>
        I got <a href="TheWikiWay.html">TheWikiWay</a> and am trying to get other developers in my company to use a wiki for discussing process issues. But if I take <strong>Wiki</strong> to the eXtreme, does that mean we all have to have our own wikis?  <em>Yes!! See </em><a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>.<em></em>

        OK. After playing around with several <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>s, I've put in a <a href="UseMod.html">UseMod</a>:<a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> for work even though it seems a bit broken in handling mixed numbered vs. bulleted items. <em></em><a href="TheWikiWay.html">TheWikiWay</a> handled that pretty well, but didn't have diff support<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, getting people to <strong>use</strong> it is another issue. Not a BuildItAndTheyWillCome situation. :-)
