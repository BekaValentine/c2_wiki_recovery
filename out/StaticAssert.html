        Static Assert
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> is something of the <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> version of <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>.  As with <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>, use of <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> also allows the compiler to <a href="ProveAssumptions.html">ProveAssumptions</a> that keep the code very efficient.  It significantly extends the abilities of the relatively 'dumb' type checkers aimed at <a href="StaticTypeSafety.html">StaticTypeSafety</a>... though, by corollary, it requires that the language implementer greatly extend the abilities of these same 'dumb' type checkers.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In many ways, <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> is equivalent to <a href="DependentTyping.html">DependentTyping</a> in a statically <a href="TypeSafe.html">TypeSafe</a> language.  Accordingly, one must generally give up the property of 'guaranteed termination' in the <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a> checking.  In practice, such features are implemented in AutomaticTheoremProving or ProofAssistant environments where explicit <a href="ProofOfCorrectness.html">ProofOfCorrectness</a> can be supplied, so this is not likely to be an issue.  Additionally, a good <a href="IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.html">IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment</a> can support <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> typecheck phases by issuing warnings around the problem areas (so programmers can clean them up later) and also have a tuneable 'fail' timer to stop typechecking in error.
      </p>
      <p>
        A language that provides <a href="SoftTyping.html">SoftTyping</a> might still provide <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a>, but would do well to also support 'soft' assertions wherever one normally sees an 'assert' statement - i.e. qualifying such an assertion as an 'error' only if it can be proven to fail, and removing the assertion from the runtime if it can be proven to pass, otherwise leaving it in (and optionally issuing a warning) when one 'cannot prove' either consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a>, the counterpart of <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> is RefinementType (see ProgramRefinement).  A RefinementType of the form {x: A | P} denotes all elements of type A which also satisfy predicate P.  Operationally, it is a (dependently typed) record containing x plus a proof that P holds for x.

        <em>Can we have some examples, please?  Thanks!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure.  Consider a typical operation with three conditions:
      </p>
      <code>
        Collection Collection::get_range(int start, int end) {<br/>
        <strong>static_assert</strong>(start <= end);<br/>
        <strong>static_assert</strong>(start >= 0);<br/>
        <strong>static_assert</strong>(end < size());<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Collection result;<br/>
        for( ; end != start; ++start) <br/>
        result.push_back(this->at(start));<br/>
        return result;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In code lacking <strong>static_assert</strong>, you could use <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> principles and include a regular assertion or throw exceptions in order to get something of a <a href="RunTime.html">RunTime</a> safety.  This costs you three comparisons every time you run the check (which is utterly trivial in this didactic case, but might be more significant in a O(1) function).  Alternatively, you can just <em>assume</em> these three conditions are true, not check them, and thus save a little bit of time on the call (albeit not much in this case) and get <a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a> when you ask for 'this->at(-10)'.
      </p>
      <p>
        With <strong>static_assert</strong>, however, it would be up to the compiler to <em>prove that the conditions are met</em>.  Sometimes this would be really easy:
      </p>
      <code>
        myCollection.get_range(-10,11);  /// compiler error! violates condition 'start >= 0'.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Sometimes it would be a bit more difficult:
      </p>
      <code>
        int sum_range(Collection& c, int range_start, int range_end) {<br/>
        // inefficient didactic example...<br/>
        int result = 0;<br/>
        foreach item in c.get_range(range_start,range_end)<br/>
        result += item;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        int main(args) {<br/>
        Collection c = collection_from_file("myCollection");<br/>
        int range_start = get_start(args);<br/>
        int range_end   = get_end(args);<br/>
        int result = sum_range(c,range_start,range_end); /// compiler error! cannot prove range_start <= range_end!<br/>
        /// compiler error! cannot prove range_start >= 0<br/>
        /// compiler error! cannot prove range_end < c.size()<br/>
        print(result);   <br/>
        return 0;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course, the compiler error may be better or worse than that (emitting good compiler errors associated with <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a> is really difficult, and static_assert requires errors similar to those seen in <a href="DependentTyping.html">DependentTyping</a>).  
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, you could fix this by putting some assertions or checks in prior.  Static assert, like <a href="DependentTyping.html">DependentTyping</a>, can be program-path dependent.
      </p>
      <code>
        int main(args) {<br/>
        Collection c = collection_from_file("myCollection");<br/>
        int range_start = get_start(args);<br/>
        int range_end   = max(get_end(args),c.size() - 1); <br/>
        if((range_start < 0) || (range_start > range_end)) {<br/>
        print("range error!");<br/>
        return -1;<br/>
        }<br/>
        int result = sum_range(c,range_start,range_end); // no more compiler error<br/>
        print(result);   <br/>
        return 0;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        <strong></strong><a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> and <a href="GateKeeper.html">GateKeeper</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is worth noting that <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> only affects a whole component or module at a time - that is, it can't help you with the pieces the compiler can't touch at <a href="CompileTime.html">CompileTime</a>, such as different modules or communications.  You'd need true <a href="DependentTyping.html">DependentTyping</a> to manifestly state at module interfaces that which one might <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> within the procedural code.  With communications (I/O), you're stuck with whatever support the language offers for <a href="TypeSafe.html">TypeSafe</a> deserialization (or you need to do-it-yourself).
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> does not miraculously save you from needing to perform runtime checks.  What it DOES do is make it very easy to figure out all the duties of a <a href="GateKeeper.html">GateKeeper</a>, since the compiler will keep complaining until the <a href="GateKeeper.html">GateKeeper</a> checks all the right things.  This allows you to push discovery of input errors very close to the input source and thus minimize the amount of work performed in a failing state.  This also helps with optimization, since many of these checks can ultimately be pulled outside of the tight loops that might be found deeper within the module or library.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a sense, <a href="StaticAssert.html">StaticAssert</a> is a form of explicit language support for the <a href="GateKeeper.html">GateKeeper</a> pattern.  I expect that is how you'd end up using it 90% of the time.  However, it also serves a role in code proofs and just ensuring the code to be correct.
