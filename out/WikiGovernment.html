        I personally think that government is likely to lead to oligarchy (as per the Iron Law), and that therefore who needs it? Keep it small, and consensus works, and if consensus doesn't work, then who cares? You can always start another wiki, or maintain two (or more) pages on the same subject with differing opinions. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
