        Donate For Free
      </h1>
      <p>
        Give to charity by simply clicking on a link!  This is not a hoax!
      </p>
      <p>
        This is for a major UK childrens (NSPCC) charity and is backed by big name sponsors such as Microsoft (who actually do the paying).
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically it is EU residents only, and you may click once per day.  Each time these criteria are met the sponsor donates cash.  Put a link in your favorites or desktop, and visit each day.

        Anyway, rather than clicking every day, you could put
        something like this in a cron job:
      </p>
      <code>
        lynx -source <a href="http://www.nspcc.org.uk/donate-4-free/donate-mainhome.asp">http://www.nspcc.org.uk/donate-4-free/donate-mainhome.asp</a> > /dev/null<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Would this do cookies?
