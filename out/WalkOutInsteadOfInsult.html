        Walk Out Instead Of Insult
      </h1>
      <p>
        Rather than insult somebody who frustrates you, consider just "walking about": abandoning the discussion. Insults rarely have their intended affect and usually just result in counter-insults and <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a> escalations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps walking out also allows one to calm down and gather their thoughts so that they can try a different angle to the dispute.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Topic happy, are we? </em><a href="IveLeftToCode.html">IveLeftToCode</a> already explains this quite well.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't feel they are similar enough. <a href="IveLeftToCode.html">IveLeftToCode</a> is not self-describing enough. But let's entertain other opinions on this and see if we can reach a consensus.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Start yet another page... </em>WalkOutSlowlyInsteadOfNameCalling since the word insult is too insulting. Name calling is much nicer. And the word slowly lengthens the page title more, which is good - and it emphasizes how nice we are. The word insult, is just too damaging to all of us. It is just like <a href="BrainDamage.html">BrainDamage</a> - just saying that out loud hurts my feelings.. and so does the word <strong>insult</strong> since it is so powerful and cutting. And it was obviously directed right at me - not just a pattern - it was definitely direct at me, directly. Directly.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have no problem with the "name calling" suggestion, but don't see the necessity of "slowly".

        <em>Could start an </em>IveLeft page, with page anchors too. Different reasons for temporary leaving.. etc.<em></em>
