        IMHO, the best Windows <a href="TextEditor.html">TextEditor</a> on the planet. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I second this. Man...I remember thinking that Brief for DOS was the best! I made so many cbrief macros. Whatever happened to Brief? I can never understand how people use VI or EMACS. I'm not smart enough for those editors. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        Without reservation, the finest text/source code editor I have used in twenty-five years. I've used them all. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        According to <a href="http://www.borland.com/codewright/">http://www.borland.com/codewright/</a> Borland has discontinued the development of <a href="CodeWright.html">CodeWright</a>. Oh, well. Once perfection has been achieved...
      </p>
      <p>
        Will there ever be anything to replace this editor?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've heard that </em><a href="SlickEdit.html">SlickEdit</a> is a reasonably-close analogue.<em></em>
        Boxer is also very good.

        I guess that Borland jr. is in charge of the Borland editors. Borland bought brief and killed it, then bought <a href="CodeWright.html">CodeWright</a> and killed it. The philosophy seems to be "if something is better than ours, KILL IT" -- Erikm
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, Borland supported CodeWright for a number of years. When they had fully-integrated IDEs for all their premier development products they dropped CW as a separate product. Understandable, but it still sucks.</em>

        The <a href="ZeusForWindows.html">ZeusForWindows</a> editor has many of those features include <em>Brief</em> keyboard emulation.
