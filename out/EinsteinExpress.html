        <em>MAD Magazine</em> once did a satire on a "slow" delivery service - that promised to deliver your package/letter etc. <em>weeks</em> (if not more) after it was mailed; often with "accidental" damage, etc. (The customer could specify the earliest delivery date. The item in question would, of course, be postmarked on the day it was sent).
      </p>

        Useful for sending wedding invitations, etc. to those annoying relatives who you <em>have</em> to invite (or else there will be hell to pay) but whom you would rather not attend.

        No... it was back in the '80s....  <em>Games</em> Magazine once mentioned a similar service in the "find the fake ad" feature they had back in their heyday.

        Heisenburg Express presents a new tracking feature, just don't ask exactly where your shipment is or we can't gaurantee when it will arrive.

        Schroedinger Express:  Your package has and hasn't arrived until you check the mail. <em>At which point the wave function collapses...</em>
