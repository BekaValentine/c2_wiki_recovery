        TUNES (Tunes is a Useful, Nevertheless Expedient System)
      </p>
      <p>
        A project begun in 1996 to create the ultimate operating system and the ultimate programming language. The web site includes a lot of interesting analysis of existing individual programming languages, hosts the defunct LispOS mailing list archives, etc. It's hosted at: <a href="http://tunes.org/">http://tunes.org/</a>

        A project that hasn't created much else than analysis. Great. People who never have developed a large software system talking about large software systems.

        <em>Agreed -- it appears to an outsider like a classic case of </em><a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a> (although to try to be fair, apparently <strong>some</strong> code is now rolling out). However, when things are analyzed to death, the discussions and references can be useful to other people for other reasons. This is a potentially valuable site regardless of what you think of the project itself, based on many things I've seen there. On a certain cluster of topics, Google search has listed them in the first 5 results a surprising number of times in recent months, and reasonably so. Your mileage may vary. Anyone impatient with vaporware no doubt has reason to be impatient with <a href="TunesProject.html">TunesProject</a>.<em></em>
