        Loser Mentality
      </h1>
      <p>
        The logic inside the brain of a loser that makes him fail all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        If he didn't fail all the time, he would not be a loser, just a normal person who succeeds and fails from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also a normal person may have <a href="LoserMentality.html">LoserMentality</a> from time to time.
