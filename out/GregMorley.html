        Fascinated by design philosophies and logic. A combination of 'Thinking in Java' (Bruce Eckel) and "Focault's Pendulum" (Umberto Eco) introduced me to this absorbing subject. Email address is <a href="mailto:greg.morley@btopenworld.com">mailto:greg.morley@btopenworld.com</a>

        After spending five years and lots of money studying industrial psychology in Cape Town, <a href="GregMorley.html">GregMorley</a> quit his degree in 1997 to study a diploma in information technology, offered by the UniversityOfCambridge, facilitated by the Computer Science Institute (<a href="http://www.csc.co.za)">http://www.csc.co.za)</a> in Cape Town.

        Now head of an Internet start-up in the UK, Greg has combined design patterns and logic theory with his background in medical anthropology and psychology to break new ground in multicultural project management methodologies.
