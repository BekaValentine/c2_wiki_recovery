        I've been interested in Software and Computers since the age of 11 when I was bought a CP/M home computer and an Oric Atmos. Both companies went bankrupt shortly afterwards and I had to learn both Z80 and 6502 machine code programming. I did make an effort to get out more after that, before finding both <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming and <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.
