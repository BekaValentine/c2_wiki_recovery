        Use of your text editor--especially those with macro, regexp, or other programmable features--to assist with code generation.  An example of <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a>.  It can be as simple as cutting-and-pasting code from one area to another, or as complicated as writing (parameterized) macros that emit code.  (In the cruder cases of the latter, the code emitted is boilerplate which is then completed by hand).

        There are 2 ways that <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> programmers can have the power of Lisp.  One is by <a href="GreenSpunning.html">GreenSpunning</a>; the other is by using emacs and writing a whole bunch of Emacs macros (in Lisp) to automagically emit C code to do various things.

        Of course, many consider <a href="EditorMetaProgramming.html">EditorMetaProgramming</a> to be an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, as it must be done manually.  OTOH, it sure beats typing it all in by hand, especially in languages/environments which don't make true <a href="MetaProgramming.html">MetaProgramming</a> easy....

        An interesting question:  Is the <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> the ultimate case of <a href="EditorMetaProgramming.html">EditorMetaProgramming</a>?
