        I am a Java Programmer
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I admit I program in Java
        </li>
        <li>
           I can be restored to sanity
        </li>
        <li>
           I will take fearless inventory of my Java programming
        </li>
        <li>
           I am ready to remove Java programming from my character
        </li>
        <li>
           I apologize to everyone I harmed with Java
        </li>
        <li>
           I will make amends for my Java
        </li>
        <li>
           If I slip back into Java I will admit it and improve
        </li>
        <li>
           I will carry this message to other Java programmers
        </li>
      </ul>

        <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> is an activity deep-rooted in economics. Current economic conditions where I choose to live and work favour Java as the target language. This was not so once, it will not be so again. <a href="ToEverythingThereIsaSeason.html">ToEverythingThereIsaSeason</a>... -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

        When I finish the last refactoring on an algorithm in Smalltalk (and recently the first time I used Python), I often gain an insight into the essential nature of the computation. I love the feeling when this happens and spend a good deal of effort to make sure it happens. When I finish with an algorithm in Java, the best feeling I've ever gotten is relief that the language didn't totally prevent me from saying what I wanted to say. However, as you say Keith, economics are currently on the side of Java. The list above is a reminder to myself that I'm in this for more than money. I could as well have quoted <a href="DarthVader.html">DarthVader</a>, "Don't be too proud of this technological terror you have created. The power to destroy a planet is insignificant next to the power of the Force." -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>
