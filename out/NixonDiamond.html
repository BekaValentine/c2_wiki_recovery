        Nixon Diamond

      <p>
        An interesting problem in <a href="NonMonotonicLogic.html">NonMonotonicLogic</a>, and one which demonstrates why simple, deterministic <a href="PredicateLogic.html">PredicateLogic</a> is often a poor model for the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider US president Richard Nixon. Two well known facts about Nixon are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           He was a Republican
        </li>
        <li>
           He was a Quaker (a small Protestant denomination. How devout a Quaker Nixon was is an interesting question...)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The Quaker faith is quite pacificist, so in a logic system we could write:
      </p>
      <code>
        Quaker(x) -> Pacifist(x)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The Republican Party has (at least since WWII) been the more bellicose of the major US political parties, and has generally been willing to flex US military muscle.
      </p>
      <code>
        Republican(x) -> !Pacifist(x)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now: From those facts and rules, is Nixon a pacifist or not? If we are to consider the above system of axioms, we discover a contradiction. This is the <a href="NixonDiamond.html">NixonDiamond</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In real life, of course, we realize that the two rules given above, are both approximations and not absolute. In Nixon's case, he was demonstrably not a pacifist, despite his Quaker faith - he oversaw a major escalation of the Vietnam War. OTOH, the bit about Republicans not being pacifists is also not absolute; a former Republican senator from Oregon - Mark Hatfield - was a strict pacifist, and one of the few (if only) senators to vote against the first Gulf War. He has since retired from office.
