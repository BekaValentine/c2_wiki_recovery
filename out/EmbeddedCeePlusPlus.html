        Embedded Cee Plus Plus
      </h1>
      <p>
        A dialect of C++, proposed by many embedded systems tools vendors in the early 90's, seeking to "scale" C++ so that it was appropriate for embedded systems.  This was to be done by deleting several features that were <a href="ConsideredHarmful.html">ConsideredHarmful</a> due to (alleged) code bloat and compiler implementation difficulties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things which EC++ lacked:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Templates
        </li>
        <li>
           Exceptions
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fortunately (IMHO), this went nowhere.  This was due to several things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The AnsiCeePlusPlus standard was approved, allowing implementations of the above to stabilize.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Compilers got better -- templates don't add tons of code bloat with a good toolchain.  (Efficient template implementation when all you have is a dumb Unix linker is difficult; but most such linkers have been replaced with ones that understand C++).  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Embedded processors have gotten more powerful; memory has gotten cheaper.  Excluding the 8-bit variety where you wouldn't consider C++ regardless, removing the above seldom makes a difference.  (MI and exceptions, in particular, don't contribute much to code bloat).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nowadays, you seldom hear of Embedded C++ any more, other than on Wiki pages like this one.
