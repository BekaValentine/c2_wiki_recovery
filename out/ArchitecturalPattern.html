        Architectural Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am not sure I can come up with a defn for <a href="ArchitecturalPattern.html">ArchitecturalPattern</a>s, but I think they do exists (or at least we ought to be able to create them). <a href="PatternsOfClientServerArchitectures.html">PatternsOfClientServerArchitectures</a> may contain examples of at least one style of the thing I may be talking about.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that so far we seem to have focused on how <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> build an architecture from the bottom up. (See <a href="PatternsGenerateArchitectures.html">PatternsGenerateArchitectures</a> for a bit more about this.) - However I think we need to have something which we can use at a larger grain. <a href="ArchitecturalStyle.html">ArchitecturalStyle</a> does go some way to this but they are still not really what I am look at.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know that <a href="PaulDyson.html">PaulDyson</a> is interested in this stuff, and he did a session called Patterns in Software Architecture BCS-OOPS Patterns day.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what he said about Patterns in Software architecture...
      </p>
      <p>
        Design patterns describe the right kinds of things for an architecture (structure, communication, philosophy) but they consider the wrong level of scale for a large system.
      </p>
      <p>
        May be Paul would like to enter a bit more about his ideas and may be even a few patterns he proposed at that day.

        Tom Mowbray's <a href="AntiPatternsBook.html">AntiPatternsBook</a> contains a few decent <a href="ArchitectureAntiPattern.html">ArchitectureAntiPattern</a>s that I think are at the same level as the kind of stuff you're looking for. For instance one of his that I like is "don't build <a href="StovepipeSystem.html">StovepipeSystem</a>s". Also, <a href="FrankBuschmann.html">FrankBuschmann</a> and his cohorts in the <a href="PartyOfFive.html">PartyOfFive</a> have a few good <a href="ArchitecturalPattern.html">ArchitecturalPattern</a>s, notably PipesAndFiltersArchitecture and a few others. I could list those out, but I don't have <a href="PoSa.html">PoSa</a> handy. :( -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

        There seems to be general agreement that <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> is an architectural pattern. I'd also claim that <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> is an architectural pattern. <a href="PartyOfFive.html">PartyOfFive</a> distinguish between idioms, <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> and <a href="ArchitecturalPattern.html">ArchitecturalPattern</a>s, where each seems somewhat independent of the other; just as <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> can be composed of varying idioms, so an <a href="ArchitecturalPattern.html">ArchitecturalPattern</a> is one that can be composed of varying <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But I'll go further out on the limb than this and actually venture a definition: an architectural pattern is any pattern concerned with the construction context of a whole system, rather than just some part of it. In physical architecture equivalents would be SkyScraper, LofstromLoop, IgLoo and so on.

        I think this is pretty much spot-on ... it just depends on what scale your system is. If your system is 4-5 objects then the Gof-style design patterns are architectural patterns because they consider the structure, relative communication and design philosophy for these 4-5 objects. I'm interested in the patterns that describe the structure of systems where the number of objects is measured in millions and the organizational unit is much larger than the class ... so perhaps these should be LargeScaleSystemPatterns? <a href="ThreeTierDistributionArchitecture.html">ThreeTierDistributionArchitecture</a>, <a href="FourLayerArchitecture.html">FourLayerArchitecture</a>, <a href="IsolationLayer.html">IsolationLayer</a> and the ubiquitous <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> all seem to fit the bill. -- <a href="PaulDyson.html">PaulDyson</a>
