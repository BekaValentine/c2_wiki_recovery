        has a hard constraint to be OO. We were using 2708 EPROMS that held
        only 1K bytes of memory each. We had a 32K program. If we compiled
        that program as a single executable, then every time we made a one
        line change we'd have to reburn 32 EPROMs per machine and ship them to
        all the hundreds of installed sites. This was unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, I partitioned the system into 32 little objects, each of which
        fit neatly on a single EPROM. Each EPROM declared a set of entry
        points into itself. These entry points were copied into RAM vectors.
        Anybody who wanted to call a function, called it through the RAM
        vector. (We'd now call them vtables).
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows us to recompile individual EPROMs and ship them to the
        customers. They could pop out the old ones and push in the new ones
        and the system would just run. We could also make easy patches by
        rerouting a vector to RAM, copying some code to that RAM and then
        patching it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This may not seem like traditional OO, and certainly the system was
        not designed with this kind of partitioning in place. On the other
        hand, from a purely mechanical point of view, those EPROMs were
        objects that used DynamicPolymorphism to break dependencies between
        them.

        <em>I did similar work on 8080s and 2780s, and what he's describing is very familiar. He's just dressing it up in OO terms as far as I can tell.</em>

        <em>To be truly OO requires more: for each unit of encapsulation to be a single data item of a single type along with exactly those operations that concern that data type/item; no more, no less.</em>

      <p>
        <em>Martin's 8080/2780 may or may not have done this. I very much doubt that he did, actually, given my own experience back then in this area (and yes, I knew what OO was at the time).</em>

      <p>
        <em>It is definitely possible to do OO in assembler, of course, and I have. So no, no language is </em>'inherently<em>' procedural. However, assembler doesn't give any support for non-procedural methods. Obviously.</em>

        <em>I should mention that people find ways to do purely procedural programming even in OO languages, and I don't mean just in C++.

        I think the point is that OO is simply a way of thinking, a way of spreading around responsibility. It can be done in any language, OO languages just help enforce some of the ideas and make things easier, but the code is OO whether or not the languages enforces the concepts. For example, a lack of forced encapsulation doesn't mean it's not OO, as long as the code uses encapsulation as a concept. OO is about certain concepts, not the implementations of them. Rob Martin is a respected OO vet, if he says it's OO, then it's OO, who are you to question him on something he wrote?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>RCM's definition of OO is essentially the </em><a href="DependencyInversionPrinciple.html">DependencyInversionPrinciple</a>. This is useful at times, and IMHO far better than the C++/Java notion of "a bunch of related functions with their associated data." But it's at odds with other respected OO vets, notably <a href="AlanKayOnObjects.html">AlanKayOnObjects</a> and the <a href="NygaardClassification.html">NygaardClassification</a>, along with the common definition that appears on <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> (which appears to be what Doug is going by). RCM's definition is also overbroad for many practical reasons. For example, <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> would classify as OOP under the dependency inversion principle, as would any form of first class procedures (including eval!) -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a><em></em>

        No, that's not his definition, that's one of the principles he abides by, probably the most controversial of the bunch. You can't look at this principle in isolation; you must include the others to see the full picture. The <a href="SingleResponsibilityPrinciple.html">SingleResponsibilityPrinciple</a>, The <a href="LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple.html">LiskovSubstitutionPrinciple</a>, The <a href="InterfaceSegregationPrinciple.html">InterfaceSegregationPrinciple</a>, The <a href="DependencyInversionPrinciple.html">DependencyInversionPrinciple</a>, Stability, Granularity, and The <a href="OpenClosedPrinciple.html">OpenClosedPrinciple</a> are all things <a href="RobertCecilMartin.html">RobertCecilMartin</a> subscribes to. Some of his beliefs seem strong, <a href="DependencyInversion.html">DependencyInversion</a> possibly, but I'd say that's from his Manifest typed C++ heritage and long compile times.

        Jonathan is making a better argument than I would have (thanks!), so I will just add that this is a classic example of why appeal to authority is a logical <strong>fallacy</strong>.

        Assembler instruction pointer(IP) handling is usually done through jump commands(JMP), essentially a GOTO to named addresses.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "essentially"? What is the difference between a GOTO and a JMP?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>A JMP will pass arguments to a function through the stack. I've never seen GOTO used in that way.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't follow you. You mean a JMP instruction with an operand that pushes something on the stack? You need to give more details; my point is that, without extra specificity, JMP and GOTO are synonyms. We haven't said which languages or architectures we're talking about, after all.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Comparing GOTO and JMP is like comparing "+" and ADD or "=" and MOVE. This may be valid if you have a certain use of these instructions in mind, but doesn't hold true in general. Thats because assembly provides inherently more low level control, which may or may not be used (e.g. in a macro). After all a function <strong>call</strong> may be implemented with a JMP.
      </p>
      <p>
        To map members and methods, a way to meld them in memory would be needed. Object files(.OBJ) act as OOP objects at this level.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How so?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>They encapsulate the members & methods. Of course multiple objects could be in one object file, so it's really a matter of terminology - since multiple classes can exist in a single class too</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, an infinite form of polymorphism is possible with self-modifying assembler(code=data=code).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Nitpick: self-modifying machine code, not assembler.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Really? Self-mod assembler functions are written with the understanding of how the generated machine code would behave, but the code is still written at a "higher level" than machine code, allowing polymorphism(in a sense). </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So classes "are" OBJ files, methods are memory addresses, members calls are JMP commands, encapsulation is possible through memory IO privileges, and inheritance by calling linked code

        <em>My intent was to state how OOP code becomes assembler/machine code. i.e. the machine code from say </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> might be indistinguishable from the machine code from assembler written with understanding of OOP principles. Someone writing assembler can still apply OOP concepts. . . it's just not as automatic. OOP needs assembler(at some point), so it's not a fair comparison to begin with, since assembler is a "subset" of OOP.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [I feel there is a risk of confusion in <em>assembler is a "subset" of OOP.</em> <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> is only a "subset" in the way that bricks are a subset of house, or that molecules are a subset of brick. Any house can be built with the bricks. OO is just one style of house, and bricks are not confined to this style. And while I'm in here making trouble: JMP and GOTO are synonyms, but it's a bad comparison. There are many kinds of JMP, and in Assembly contexts they're the only way to mechanize a loop, a switch/case statement, and so on, while the GOTO is a "primitive" command in a "high level" language with advanced conditional and looping constructs. The use of GOTO is often the failure of the language designer to provide a construct, or of the programmer to grasp a structured way to do the task. The use of JMP is unavoidable in Assembly. The programmer is charged with the invention and preservation of structure. And yes, this structure can be OO.] -- gh

A "method selector" is an offset into that table. A "message send" is a JSR through the method table, using the method table address and aformentioned offset, to the desired function.

        I'm afraid I'm 1000 km away from my literature now, but I remember one of the methodology books mentioning that they took some procedural coders (Forth guys, I think), measured their productivity (somehow) and taught them an OO language, let them program in that language, then measured again. Productivity went up, measurably. They took this as evidence that this other language was better. But a later measurement showed that they still showed this higher productivity when returning to their old language. It was not the language, it was the thought patterns it encouraged.
