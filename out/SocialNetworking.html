        Using physical meetings or online media to make new contacts (e.g. for dating or business purposes), to participate in self-selecting communities, to collaborate, to maintain a large friend network (including finding lost acquaintances, keeping in touch with distant friends, etc.), and various other purposes. C2's Wiki is a form of social networking. So are Friendster, <a href="MySpace.html">MySpace</a>, Tribe, <a href="LinkedIn.html">LinkedIn</a>, Ryze, etc. (all based in general modus operandi on the now-defunct sixdegrees.com). So are singles mixers, church picnics and parties. The term, however, is mostly used as shorthand for <em>online</em> social networking. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Social_networking</a> for a lot more information on the topic.
