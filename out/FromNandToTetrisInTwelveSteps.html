        Basically, it is a class, put together by Noam Nisan and Shimon Schocken (who wrote the accompanying textbook "The Elements of Computing Systems", and accompanying software), to help students understand how all the different computer science disciplines fit together.  Professor Schocken describes his approach briefly here:

        This is a class I would <em>really</em> like to do, at least as a self-study project; perhaps even as a group project with my children someday.
