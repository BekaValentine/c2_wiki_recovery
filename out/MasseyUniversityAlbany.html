        Massey University Albany

      <p>
        The Albany campus of MasseyUniversity.  Albany is a suburb of NorthShoreCity, which in turn is part of <a href="AucklandCity.html">AucklandCity</a>, part of the GreaterAucklandArea, part of <a href="NewZealand.html">NewZealand</a>, and so forth.  I could go on, but that would quickly get ridiculous.

        It's a nice friendly campus with only about 8000 students as of this writing, but it has top-notch facilities.  Mostly.  :)
