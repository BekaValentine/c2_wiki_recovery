        Evidentally, the <a href="UnitedStatesOfAmerica.html">UnitedStatesOfAmerica</a> FederalBureauOfInvestigation has plans to route all Internet traffic through its central servers (presumably traveling through US routes). It's not clear from the article if this is actually a routing issue or if it is simply monitoring ISP traffic. Ignoring all the CivilLiberties issues, I wonder what all the technical wrinkles (aside from the obvious ones such as bandwidth and <a href="SinglePointOfFailure.html">SinglePointOfFailure</a>) there are in such a scheme.

        Possible issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Getting major ISPs to agree to mirror traffic to the FBI</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Bandwidth</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Encrypted (</em>SecureSocketLayer / PrettyGoodPrivacy) communications<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>How easy is it to set up private routes to bypass known collection points?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I doubt <a href="SinglePointOfFailure.html">SinglePointOfFailure</a> is a concern, since they don't need to be the middleman in the traffic, they just need a branch off every path to pass through their collection point. OTOH, bandwidth is a concern.

        I find it hard to believe that anyone could think this is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Technically Feasible
        </li>
        <li>
           Legal
        </li>
        <li>
           Actually Useful
        </li>
      </ul>
