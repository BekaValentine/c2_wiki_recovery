        When I read a page on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, I consider the well-written ones to be a TableOfContents, for they include links to relevant concerns. I am KeepingScore on the pages I read and archive as to depth as a measure of value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The score kept is meant be the size in readable pages of the <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> and all of its first-level links. When pursuit is made of further meaningful levels, depth increases for each page which has a high score of its own.
        For now the level of pursuit is kept at no more than three for obviously much reading is involved for even this level of search. For a page to become a added member of <a href="ReallyValuablePages.html">ReallyValuablePages</a>, the score should be somewhere above a later to be determined level.
