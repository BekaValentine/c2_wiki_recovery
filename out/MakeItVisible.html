        Humans brains handle between 5 to 9 chunks of information at a time<br/>
        The Eye-Brain system handles a lot more but has no memory.<br/>
        Groups need a common record of a meeting and consensusses.<br/>
        Sometimes a group is dominated by one individual who does all the talking.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Solution
      </p>
      <p>
        The talkative member of the group volunteers to act as recorder and stands by
        a chalkboard, flip chart, over-head-projector, or sits at a lap-top hooked
        to a projector.  The recorder may not make suggestions.  He/She can only ask
        for ideas, record and display them, and request confirmation and refinement.
      </p>
      <p>
        After the meeting the group, or members of the group, can ask for some of the visual aids to be preserved, copied, and distributed to the people in the group as a record of the key decisions.
