        Measuring Abstraction
      </h1>
      <p>
        If somebody says, "My language/paradigm/technique is a higher level of abstraction than yours", how does one go about measuring abstraction level?
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a paper on this topic that may or may not have the <strong>ultimate</strong> answer, but I believe does a good job of addressing and dismissing the general sort of argument below, and moving on to more workable approaches: "A Definition of Abstraction"; Martin Ward, January 17, 2003 <a href="http://www.dur.ac.uk/martin.ward/martin/papers/abstraction-t.pdf">http://www.dur.ac.uk/martin.ward/martin/papers/abstraction-t.pdf</a> -- 
        ( the link above seems outdated, here's one indirection from web.archive.org : <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20060303025056/http://www.dur.ac.uk/martin.ward/martin/papers/abstraction-t.pdf">http://web.archive.org/web/20060303025056/http://www.dur.ac.uk/martin.ward/martin/papers/abstraction-t.pdf</a> )

        A summary of that paper:

        <li>
           Abstraction says "what" instead of "how"

           Abstraction is a process of generalization, removing restrictions (???), eliminating detail, removing inessential information.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Problems: defining "generalization", "inessential". What is "essential" tends to be situational and relative. A water fountain which may otherwise be ignored by somebody late to a meeting may be very essential to a dehydrated person. </em><a href="EverythingIsRelative.html">EverythingIsRelative</a>.<em></em>

           Abstract specifications have "more potential implementations"

        <em>You skipped the interesting part where they concluded that size-based definitions are inadequate, and their best attempted definition...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It also tends to focus on "toy" examples like sorts and tower-of-honoi. I often find these hard to extrapolate to "real" applications because they don't deal with enough factors. The hard part of real stuff is dealing with all the interweaving variables (dimensions or factors), not just taking simple inputs and getting simple outputs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>True. Do you have further suggestions for reading that might be better, or at least also interesting? I found that one by googling today, and didn't find much else so far.</em>

        Less and/or simpler code may be one way. However, sometimes smaller code requires more rework to incorporate changes. For example, if your system currently serves five countries, it might be less code to hard-wire in those five countries. But adding more countries could require more work than looping through a centrally-defined list, especially if that list of 5 is used in more than one place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, perceived abstraction probably depends on things as how one perceives the likelyhood of certain changes. Are there ways to measure besides those that typically lead to <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s?

        Take a simple task, such as gaining an array which contains all of the squares of the first n numbers. In C:
      </p>
      <code>
        for (i = 0; i < n; i++) {<br/>
        array[i] = i*i;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In APL
      </p>
      <code>
        array [assigned to the value of] [iota] n * [iota] n;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (bear in mind that [assigned to the value of] and [iota] are single characters, so the whole thing is eleven characters long)
      </p>
      <p>
        Having accomplished the same task in both C and APL, I get the feeling that APL has greater abstraction when it comes to arrays.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not sure symbol counts make a very good measure because APL uses symbols in place of words by extending the alphabet. It is sort of like Chinese compared to English. Pictures tend to be more compact. However, they complicate your base "alphabet", which may not be a good thing. I tend to consider things like LISP more abstract because you can make your own sub-language easier rather than rely on APL Inc. to include the right symbols/operations in its library. However, I don't know how to measure that either.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          But it's not (just) about symbol count.  One of <a href="KenIverson.html">KenIverson</a>'s original objectives was to introduce some logic into the use of Greek symbols in mathematics.  For example, "+/" became the Sum of a series (generally represented as a capital Sigma) while "x/" became the Product(instead of capital Pi). This example is a trivial illustration of the contcept; probably all that should be inserted here.  If more is desired by anyone, simply post a request on <a href="AplLanguage.html">AplLanguage</a>.  There seem to be enough of us here that there should be a timely response.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For methodologies like <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a> for which there can be no simple example, it gets tricky.

        I think it's like asking the "right" way to unscramble an anagram. You could always make the argument that language feature A in language Z is isomorphic to lanugage feature B in language Y. Which makes a task "simpler" is a difficult question.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          (k+j) or 3k + 3j - which is "simpler"? If it's in the equation 3k + 3j = 6x then you'd want the first form; if its in the equation 3(k+j) = 7j you'd want the second form.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There is no "good" answer. But you might not want abstraction for its own sake, you might want abstraction for the sake of ease of extension. In which case, measure ease of extension, not abstraction.
      </p>

      <p>
        Before you can measure something (in this case "abstraction"), you need to
        define it - and the measurement becomes trivial.  So the problem present by this
        page is not really measuring abstraction, but <em>defining abstraction</em>!
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know what the formal definition of abstraction is, by the one that I
        personally devised is this:  "Abstraction is the process of mapping a model onto
        the thing being abstracted".
      </p>
      <p>
        While I have explained this in more detail on <a href="ArgumentsAgainstOop.html">ArgumentsAgainstOop</a>, a terse
        explanation follows.  A model of something is a simplified representation of
        that thing, which doesn't necessarily have any relationship to that thing; so a
        mechanical mental model or a real scale model are both valid models.  Mapping is
        the process of associating parts of the models with parts of the thing being
        abstracted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore an abstraction excludes non-essential details by not having anything
        to associate those non-essentials details with on the model.  Conversely, the
        essential details are associated with elements of the model.  One extreme for a
        model is to use the thing being abstracted as the model itself - this provides
        <strong>zero</strong> abstraction because no details are lost.  Therefore the more details
        that are ignore (become irrelevant), the more abstracted you are becoming.  In
        the limit, only a single element is mapped onto the (very simple) model, and
        this provides the ultimate abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        So with abstraction clearly defined, you can see that to measure the relative
        abstraction of two languages (which need to be made to perform the same task),
        you need to compare how many "details" each language requires.  I would suggest
        that anything which can <strong>vary</strong> is a detail, since it provides something
        meaningful.  This means that keywords are ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, concatenating two (immutable) strings:
      </p>
      <p>
        In the <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> requires at least three pointers (one for each string), two
        variables to calculate the length of the new string, an index variable for
        stepping through the string being read, an index variable to step through the
        string being written, and a variable to hold the value of a character so that
        you can see if it is the zero terminating character.  A total 8 details.
      </p>
      <p>
        While the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> requires just three string variables.  A total of 3
        details.
      </p>
      <p>
        So in this crude example, Java is 2-3 times more abstract than C.  A
        counter-argument against this is that if C came with a library of string
        functions (as it probably does:-) then appending a string would be no more
        complex in C.  My response to this would be that because both languages support
        abstraction, you must consider the most *basic* representation that is
        reasonable in each language.  Since C supports direct memory access, use that.
        Since Java doesn't, you can't.

      <p>
        <em>{That's a cute definition.  I disagree with the counter-counter-argument, though.  If C has to ways of doing something, one more abstract than the other, that shows the language has a range of possible levels.  I note many high level languages allow you to drop directly to assembly code.}</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But one can measure that to some extent by comparing code size. But it may also imply that Python is more abstract than Java because Python will usually be smaller. Python proponents would agree, but not Java propononets. The only thing anyone will agree on is "abstraction is that language/paradigm/methodology which makes me most happy." We need a way out of the subjectivty black-hole that software engineering is trapped in. --top</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I was rather pleased with my definition since it seems intuitively right (to
        me).  To better justify my counter-counter-argument, remember that pretty much
        all languages support some kind of abstraction, and yes some support access to
        lower-levels (Java's JNI could be seen as that).  The job in question is not to
        determine how good those languages are at providing abstraction (or providing
        special-case access to low-level features), but rather to evaluate the
        abstraction level of the <strong>lowest commonly-used features</strong>.  I agree this is a
        tricky call to make, but it is way better than saying you can't measure
        abstraction at all!  --<a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>

        <em>Perhaps it is time for a specific example.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a problem with defining abstraction as just eliminating details. I thought, in addition, an abstraction includes generalization (which may occur when you eliminate details but may not). --<a href="DoraiThodla.html">DoraiThodla</a>
