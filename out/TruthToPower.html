        Truth To Power
      </h1>
      <p>
        A phrase to summarize the role of the consultant. "What do you do?" "I tell truth to power."
      </p>
      <p>
        The role was often fulfilled in days of yore by the CourtJester, which isn't so different from a consultant.
      </p>
      <p>
        First heard on WestWing.

        <em>The phrase is most certainly older than that: A quick web search turns up the phrase "Speak Truth to Power" in the title of a book from 1996 (</em><a href="http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Topic/WomensStudies/ReadingRoom/BookReviews/swwnc.html).">http://www.inform.umd.edu/EdRes/Topic/WomensStudies/ReadingRoom/BookReviews/swwnc.html).</a> And in this article (<a href="http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/01/03/human_rights.html)">http://www.columbia.edu/cu/news/01/03/human_rights.html)</a> a Columbia university professor is credited with having originated the phrase, although no date is given.<em></em>
