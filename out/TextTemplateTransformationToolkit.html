        Text Template Transformation Toolkit
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="TextTemplateTransformationToolkit.html">TextTemplateTransformationToolkit</a>, or T4, used to be a part of the <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> add-on for <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a>, but it has been mainstreamed.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was part of Visual Studio 2008 (even without downloading any add-ons), but it was hidden; to create a text template you would add a file to your project with the <strong>.tt</strong> extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Visual Studio 2010, you can create two different kinds of text templates from the File | New menu.
      </p>
      <p>
        A text template is sort of like PHP, except that the code parts are written in VB or C#. You can use the code to make portions of the text conditional or repeating. You can also insert the results of computation into the text.
      </p>
      <p>
        One type of text template inserts the generated file directly into your project. So you can, for example, generate C# code, which can then be compiled as part of your project along with everything else. However, text templates can generate any (text based) type of file; for example, they can generate plain text, or comma-delimited files, or HTML, or XML.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other type of text template generates a class which will then generate the output at runtime. So if you have a program that generates HTML output, you can use a text template to describe the output, and then use the generated class to actually generate it, based on the template.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code in a text template can also read from files, databases, or other sources.

        The <a href="TextTemplateTransformationToolkit.html">TextTemplateTransformationToolkit</a> and <a href="ReflectionEmit.html">ReflectionEmit</a> are both used for <a href="CodeGeneration.html">CodeGeneration</a>. T4 is used at compile-time whereas <a href="ReflectionEmit.html">ReflectionEmit</a> can be used at runtime.
