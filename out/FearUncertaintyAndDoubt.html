        Fear Uncertainty And Doubt
      </h1>
      <p>
        "FUD", for short.

        The term "Fear, Uncertainty, and Doubt"  was apparently coined by <a href="GeneAmdahl.html">GeneAmdahl</a> who supposedly used it when describing a tactic used by the <a href="InternationalBusinessMachines.html">InternationalBusinessMachines</a> salesforce to cause potential customers of Gene's new company, AmdahlCorporation, to think again about buying products from any company but IBM.

        More generally:  1. The tendency of human beings to let negative emotions such as <strong>fear</strong>, <strong>uncertainty</strong>, and <strong>doubt</strong> constrain their choices and decisions, which might otherwise be based on a more rational or pragmatic basis.  2.  A marketing strategy to get consumers to choose a particular brand (or, more often, pass up a competing brand), or purchase a good or service they might not actually need, using the emotional factors discussed in definition 1.

        Today it is often applied to <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> (especially with regard to their recent comments about <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> being akin to cancer).  <em></em><a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> has been using FUD successfully for at least ~10 years ago, e.g. DR-DOS and Windows compatibility.<em></em>

        Thirty years ago no-one ever got sacked for buying IBM. Today, substitute Microsoft. Tomorrow: who knows?

        "FUD" can be an effective tactic a "market leader" can use to discourage customers from going to the competitors:
        The more fear, uncertainty or doubt a person has, the more likely they'll want to "go with the safe bet" -- the market leader.

        The human trait that empowers <a href="FearUncertaintyAndDoubt.html">FearUncertaintyAndDoubt</a> is the probably the same one that empowers <a href="AdVerecundiam.html">AdVerecundiam</a> and <a href="QuotingNotThinking.html">QuotingNotThinking</a>.
