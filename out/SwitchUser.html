        Switch User
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SwitchUser.html">SwitchUser</a> is a Unix-ism.
        'su' is the unix command.
        It's used as:
        'su <username>'
      </p>
      <p>
        (where <username> is replaced by a valid user account name).
        'su' will then ask for the password, and will then make your
        effective user id the <username>. If no username is specified,
        'su' will change to the <a href="SuperUser.html">SuperUser</a> ('root')
      </p>
      <p>
        This lets each user have their own account (which they use
        to log in).  You can then define an account for a role to 
        be used by more than one person, which each person can 'su' into.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Isn't this what groups are for?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This has implications in ownership and access of files.  An
        'su' account can own the files, and each user can 'su' into
        that account to edit or modify the files.
