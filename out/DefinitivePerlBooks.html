        ISBN 0-59600-027-8) The "Blue Camel"; everything you need to know about the language, most of the standard library, the interpreter, and "oddments" such as the debugger.

      <p>
        (ISBN 0596001320) The most commonly recommended book for anyone needing a gentler introduction than the Blue Camel.

        [ISBN 0-596-00478-8] Perl is a versatile, powerful programming language used in a variety of disciplines, ranging from system administration to web programming to database manipulation. One slogan of Perl is that it makes easy things easy and hard things possible. This book is about making the leap from the easy things to the hard ones. -- perl.org Review

        (ISBN 1565922433) Solutions and Examples for Perl Programmers Remember all the examples that came with the "Pink Camel" (Programming Perl, first edition, for Perl 4)? They're back, and then some, and updated for Perl 5. In some ways, a collection of Perl idioms and patterns, though as source code. From foreword by <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a>: "Cooking is perhaps the humblest of the arts, but to me humility is a strength, not a weakness... Cooking is also one of the oldest of the arts... So the essence of a cookbook ... is to pass on various bits ... that have been found useful ... don't be surprised when they in turn cook up some recipes of their own ..."

        (ISBN 1-56592-257-3) The "Perl Way" is to slurp everything into a string, match a regular expression against it, and grab what matches.

        (ISBN 1-56592-286-7) is a wonderful reference to the most commonly used modules including the standard modules and CGI, Database, Network, Perl/Tk and even Win32 (not something I use, but many do). It also has a great summary of the language. Of course, you can always grep the manpages... but my eyes get tired looking at the screen for too long, don't yours? -- Cullen O'Neill

        (ISBN 1-861004-49-4) would be my choice for a third book after the Blue Camel and Perl Cookbook (well maybe 4th, I treasure the Pocket Reference). It covers a range of topics from the basics through much of what is in Advanced Perl Programming plus still other topics. It is much more readable than Advanced Perl Programming.

      <p>
        [ISBN:0201795264] The medical metaphor for this book stems from the rather drastic nature of the work we do as maintenance programmers. Often we must perform triage, deciding what code is worth saving and what is beyond redemption. Frequently we only have time for first aid, applying a field dressing to a ruptured program. We also have a hard time explaining our bills to the client. There may not be a Hippocratic Oath for programming, but it wouldn't hurt to come up with one. -- Amazon review
