        Reasons To Refactor
      </h1>
      <p>
        When should we refactor?
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Because you planned to, <em>after</em> a test passed*.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Something smells bad.  
        </li>
        <li>
           You need to add something, and want to make it easier.
        </li>
        <li>
           Your pair wants to understand the code better.
        </li>
        <li>
           You want to try an experiment with a different structure.
        </li>
        <li>
           The code doesn't say something that it should
        </li>
        <li>
           The code does say something that it shouldn't 
        </li>
        <li>
           The code says something more than once.
        </li>
        <li>
           You want to make it easier to test.
        </li>
        <li>
           Fixing bugs needs a lot of time. <em><-- please clarify</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>*</em> if you refactored before it passed - meaning if you integrated new behavior into existing behavior - you would be integrating untested behavior. Only integrate tested behavior.
