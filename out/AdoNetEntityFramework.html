        <a href="AdoNetEntityFramework.html">AdoNetEntityFramework</a> is an <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> framework for the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> Framework.

      <p>
        ADO.NET Entity Framework abstracts the relational (logical) schema of the data that is stored in a database and presents its conceptual schema to the application. For example, in the database, entries about a customer and their information can be stored in the Customers table, their orders in the Orders table and their contact information in yet another Contacts table. For an application to deal with this database, it has to know which information is in which table, i.e., the relational schema of the data is hardcoded into the application.

        In other words, is a typical <a href="ObjectRelationalMapper.html">ObjectRelationalMapper</a>... but thanks to the <a href="LanguageIntegratedQueryProject.html">LanguageIntegratedQueryProject</a> it could become much more powerful solution that Java based ObjectRelationalMappers which still use string manipulation to define queries, and that still can only run queries against database stored objects (most of them can not run queries against in memory objects)
