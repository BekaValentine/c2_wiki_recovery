        Is Scheme Suitable For Developing Larger Systems
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is the <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> suitable for developing larger systems? The reason I ask is the following: suppose that I have the following definitions, which are supposed to define an abstract datatype:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (make-customer name telephone)<br/>
        (cons name telephone))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (define customer-name car)<br/>
        (define customer-telephone cdr)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A bit too simplistic, but you get the idea. Now if I want to add some more
        data later, e.g. an e-mail address, this is extended to:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (make-customer name telephone email)<br/>
        (list name telephone email))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (define customer-name car)<br/>
        (define customer-telephone cadr)<br/>
        (define customer-email caddr)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        OK, so any code that used customer-name and customer-telephone will be fine after this change. But what if someone used car and cdr directly, instead of going through the accessor functions? Before the change, all <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s still work if someone breaks the abstraction layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is there a way to prevent this accidental breaking of abstraction to happen? Can we perhaps devise some <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s that check for this? Or do we just have to live with it? It seems to become a rather big issue when one tries to create a large system.

        This seems like an odd objection: there is a mechanism (described below) for enforcing this kind of information hiding. That the language does not enforce its use is probably a good thing. Neither <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> nor <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, nor <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> for that matter, enforce their available mechanisms for information hiding. Does any language? <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a> maybe?
      </p>

        Yes there is a way to stop this. Change from using simple functions to using closures. If the 'customer' is not a list, but a function with access to the list that others cannot see, then you can use it in an object-oriented style and rely on the encapsulation.
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (make-customer name telephone)<br/>
        (lambda (msg)<br/>
        (case msg<br/>
        ((name) name)<br/>
        ((telephone) telephone))))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (define customer (make-customer "Kent Beck" "1-800-<a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>"))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (customer 'name) => <em>Kent Beck</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I may the syntax a bit off here, there are schemers hanging around like
        <a href="ChristianLemburg.html">ChristianLemburg</a> who'll be able to correct me. The point is though, that
        you can no longer directly access the name and telephone number.

        [Many Schemes also provide a range of other data structures so that you don't have to emulate everything with closures.]

        Anyway, our company did have a big system built with a scheme engine at
        the core - unfortunately the runtime leaked memory so they replaced it
        with a new language for the job. For my sins I wrote the program to turn
        the scheme into this lingo.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You mechanically changed Scheme into some other language? May I ask what that other language was?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It was called 'DSL' (Dave's Scripting Language) for the guy here who wrote it. It was very much a vertical language - over the two years since they first used the scheme engine they had gained enough experience to know exactly what was needed from the scripting engine. I wrote the translator twice - in Java and also in Perl; eventually we used the perl version because it was faster, and could do a more complete conversion (though the java code was cleaner).
      </p>
      <p>
        It was pretty brutal really - while most people had used the functions 'they were supposed to' some people had hacked in real scheme (not quite as bad as the situation you describe above, but nearly!), so I only converted the subsets of scheme that were actually used. DSL didn't have nested scope, but all of the scheme code had used this, so I handled it by adding numbers to uniquely identify symbols as I flattened the scripts. It was a bit of fun, but if it sounds like a hack that's because it was.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to say that the Right Tool for this job was probably scheme itself, but my scheme wasn't nearly good enough. (I did write a skeleton program in this direction but my progress on the other two versions was much, much faster).
      </p>
      <p>
        The system the scheme engine, and later the dsl engine, were deployed in was big, mission critical, and would have got us on the front pages of the national newspapers if it had fallen over. Hence why they were so keen to get the memory-leaking scheme runtime out. It's also the reason why I haven't signed this, or identified the system more directly, as I seriously doubt if my employers would be happy about me talking about its bugs...

        <em>One more question: why didn't you switch to another Scheme implementation that didn't leak memory?

        <dd>I have since implemented a small Scheme core in Java using this object framework I dubbed the ExpressionObjectModel. It supports call/cc! But I want a C++ implementation, so that it's easier to communicate with the libraries and APIs available from C++. The ExpressionObjectModel uses functionality from Java which C++ does not have, so it's not portable to C++. I am still working on it, very slowly... -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a></dd>

        Depends on what you mean by "larger". The ACIS SolidModeller (the engine underneath <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a> and a bunch of other full-strength CAD/CAM applications) wraps its C++ core in Scheme. The <a href="DocumentStyleSemanticsAndSpecificationLanguage.html">DocumentStyleSemanticsAndSpecificationLanguage</a> is written in (a dialect of) Scheme.

        Going back to the example code above, why not use an alist for each customer. Since the alist is dynamically extendable and only accessed with you have the customer, why would using an alist not work? -- <a href="MikeEggleston.html">MikeEggleston</a>

        If there is a language around which is suitable for large projects, I have yet to hear of it - and I know more languages than many programmers are aware exist. Scheme does about as well as any of them, and considerably better than most. - <a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>

        Naturally many implementations these days also have class/object models. A few seem to aim for something like <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a>.
