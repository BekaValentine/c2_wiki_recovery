      <p>
        Due to other changes in a system, existing class names often become ambiguous, misleading, or otherwise inadequate to their task of conveying meaning in the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Change the class' name.  Change all references, across the system, to use the new name.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In practice, there are other issues that also need to be addressed...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Change file names, if you have one source file for each class.
        </li>
        <li>
           Change both "body" and "header" files, if your language has them.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you are using Reflection in your application, do what you have to do to bring the changed classname in line.
        </li>
        <li>
           Deal with source code management issues when file names change -- by having conventions to rename the files, or delete and create files under source control.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RenameClassInVbClassic.html">RenameClassInVbClassic</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        "conveying meaning in the system" Is this the reason we have such a structure? Or is it rather creating and using of meaningful names in a system?
