        A Relation on domains D1 x D2 x D3 x ... x Dn:

      <code>
        is potentially infinite so long as at least one domain is infinite <br/>
        is potentially uncountable so long as at least one domain is uncountable<br/>

        A <a href="FiniteRelation.html">FiniteRelation</a> is a Relation possessing the quality of being finite.  FiniteRelations have nice qualities for use in <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a>s.  In particular, it is possible to compute a list of all things in a finite relation, and it is possible to represent the relation as a simple list (aka. a 'table').  <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> operations over FiniteRelations, excepting Inverse, are closed.
      </p>
      <p>
        All <a href="FiniteRelation.html">FiniteRelation</a>s are also CountableRelations.
