        (Power-) Users of software don't seem to be very happy, if they have to change modes for simple procedures: Keying versus Mousing, Editing versus Browsing.
      </p>
      <p>
        E.g. in the <a href="AmayaBrowser.html">AmayaBrowser</a> there is no duality between presentation mode and edit mode.
        The same holds for the <a href="WikiMode.html">WikiMode</a> in Emacs. Other examples welcome.

Give me a ModeFul editor any day.<em> --</em><a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        As you sing this, it may help the effect to imagine a dozen women, all of
        whom resemble Bill Joy, dressed in black and dancing sinuously.

        You press the keys with no effect,<br/>
        Your mode is not correct.<br/>
        The screen blurs, your fingers shake;<br/>
        You forgot to press escape.<br/>
        Can't insert, can't delete,<br/>
        Cursor keys won't repeat.<br/>
        You try to quit, but can't leave,<br/>
        An extra "bang" is all you need.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--<br/>
        Oh yeah?<br/>
        You won't look at emacs, no you'd just rather die<br/>
        You know you're gonna have to face it;<br/>
        You're addicted to vi!<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        You edit files one at a time;<br/>
        That doesn't seem too out of line?<br/>
        You don't think of keys to bind--<br/>
        A meta key would blow your mind.<br/>
        H, J, K, L?  You're not annoyed?<br/>
        Expressions must be a Joy!<br/>
        Just press "f", or is it "t"?<br/>
        Maybe "n", or just "g"?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Oh--You think it's neat to type an "a" or an "i"--<br/>

      <code>
        You press the keys without effect,<br/>
        Your life is now a wreck.<br/>
        What a waste!  Such a shame!<br/>
        And all you have is vi to blame.<br/>
