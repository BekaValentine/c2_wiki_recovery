        Os Virtualization
      </h1>
      <p>
        For some time now, I have been watching virtualization options for my PC. The rationale being that virtualization offer me the convenience of testing different configurations easily. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Up to now my option is to have different harddisks set to these alternate environments. The applicable hard disks are pluged in manually when required. This task has been eased a bit with the arrival of firewire and USB based external drive caddies.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I cannot do this for my laptop. My laptop, like most other peoples, come preinstalled with this Windows XP configured in a certain way. And the BIOS does not have USB/firewire boot option. Supposedly the new <a href="MacIntosh.html">MacIntosh</a> can boot to firewire, but only heaven knows whether it works in a reliable manner.

        OS virtualization software, most common examples are <a href="VmWare.html">VmWare</a> and <a href="MsVirtualPc.html">MsVirtualPc</a>, offer the possibility of converting my (next) laptop to a virtual machine. I would love to have full linux, and a few different windows configurations, available on demand from the laptop.
