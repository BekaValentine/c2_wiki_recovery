        Assign Variables Once

        Pattern: <strong>Assign Variables Once</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        ...this pattern helps complete the <a href="SimplyUnderstoodCode.html">SimplyUnderstoodCode</a>
        pattern. This pattern helps solve the problem of relating a use or
        reference to a variable to the place where its value is assigned.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           * *
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If a variable is assigned twice, you might have trouble figuring out
        which assignment provides the value at a particular use place, and
        your inclination is to remember the last assignment you looked
        at. This could lead to misunderstanding and incorrect changes to a
        program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Local variable names are frequently chosen to remind the code reader
        of the purpose of the variable. Sometimes the quantity that a local
        variable represents will change, and there will be a need to reassign
        the variable.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, suppose someone is reading that chunk of code later on and sees a
        reference or use of the variable. If the variable has been assigned in
        two places, the person will have trouble figuring out which assignment
        is the one that the use will see. This problem is made worse if there
        is a complicated control structure and the code reader is not scanning
        the code in the order of control flow. The natural thing to do is to
        remember the assignment you most recently saw. If the code's control
        flow is top-to-bottom and you are reading top to bottom, there is less
        of a problem, but confusion is still possible. And, the more complex
        the code fragment - the more re-reading is necessary - the more likely
        the wrong assignment will be associated with the use or reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the problem is made worse if the assignments and the uses
        are not on the same page or screen.
      </p>

        <em>Therefore,</em> Assign local variables only once, and, if possible, do that at the
        place where the local variable is defined. Make sure these places all
        fit on one page or screen. If you need to reassign a local variable,
        try to make a new local variable with the same name and arrange for
        the chunk of code containing its definition (and only assignment) and
        its use to fit on one page or screen.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           * *

        This should really be AssignVariablesOnceAndOnlyOnce. That is to say, a variable which is never assigned at all is bad news. I would give more emphasis to assigning at point of definition. Even better is to declare it as "const" (C++) or "final" (Java), so that the language enforces the rule. In fact, this idiom should be so common that it should be the default. That is, in a perfect language, all variables would be constant unless explicitly declared otherwise. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        This is <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> ... certainly a Good Thing in many ways, but as a C/C++/Perl programmer, I've become accustomed to variables that, well, vary. I think this pattern has gone too far, or needs some context and/or forces definition so we can figure how and when to apply it.  --<a href="PaulChisholm.html">PaulChisholm</a>
