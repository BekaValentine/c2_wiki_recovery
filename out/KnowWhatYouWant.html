        Know What You Want

        Before entering a negotiation, you should always <a href="KnowWhatYouWant.html">KnowWhatYouWant</a> and KnowWhatYouCanGet.  <a href="KnowWhatYouWant.html">KnowWhatYouWant</a> means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Knowing what offers you are willing to accept (where "offer" includes all parts of the deal as appropriate--price/salary, working conditions, options, perks, make, model, color.  But keep in mind that this is seldom a single-variable parameter; many negotiators will try to give a customer what they want but <a href="GetThemOnTheTradeIn.html">GetThemOnTheTradeIn</a>).  But <a href="NeverStateYourNumber.html">NeverStateYourNumber</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Knowing how much time and effort you are willing to spend on negotiations.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="BeReadyToWalk.html">BeReadyToWalk</a> away from the deal if you don't get it.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>I told a friend that I had a hard time negotiating in e.g. Mexican marketplaces, as do many Americans, in part because I had no idea what my true maximum prices was; I just didn't want to screw up.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He pointed out that in this case, it wasn't that I truly wanted to negotiate well (which would imply that I did know some non-ridiculous maximum price), what I wanted was the </em>'experience<em>' of negotiating well, which might be a very different matter.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He's right. If the guy selling me the turquoise ring made me feel like I was the world's best negotiator, I might well pay twice what he usually charges! (This all assumes that everything is relatively affordable to my budget even at twice the price, which is why I don't have a true max figure in mind.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, this is what all of them are doing most of the time, so it is not really "twice what he usually charges" but simply <em>as much</em> as he usually charges. :-)

        In my experience, I observed something quite different from the one-upsmanship and ego satisfaction from sticking it to the customer or the seller, it is a matter of making a sale, any sale, which makes the seller a profit, and satisfies the buyer. It should be a matter of utility and affordability, not just in making a good deal. Is the article really wanted and is it a <a href="UsefulUsableUsed.html">UsefulUsableUsed</a> artifact? Do I really need it, and what is it worth to me? (This assumes a purchase for use, and not a purchase for resale or accumulation).
