        </li>
        <li>

        <li>
           Mother about her young son: "He's very highly strung."  Basil: "Well, he should be."

           "Did you get the dead pigeons out of the water tower, dee-har?" "No, dee-har, I left them in. They're nearly done."

        <li>
           "This is a hotel not the Burma railway." 
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           "Most of our guests manage to struggle down in the morning." 
        </li>
        <li>
           "Why don't you syringe the donuts out of your ears and use the dormant organ you keep hidden in that rat's maze of yours?" 
        </li>
        <li>
           "Yes, my little piranha fish?"
        </li>
        <li>
           "Ho, yes, it's amazing to see the chef at work, opening a tin. He gets all of it in the bowl, none of it on the walls!" <em>(To a family disgruntled the food wasn't preprocessed enough...)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Basil: "Don't drive over any mines, darling..."

        Both series are on a 3-DVD set from the BBC and worth every penny.

        Many people think Fawlty Towers is a comedy. It's actually a hard-hitting documentary about British hotels.
