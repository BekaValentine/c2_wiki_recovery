        Uh -- this "no spaces" stuff really hurts (BTW, my first name is Volker, all the rest is last name).
        I'm working for ATMEL (former part of TEMIC) at the Design Center Integrated Circuits in Ulm, Germany.
        Listening to a very interesting talk of Jim Coplien around 2000 in our Research Center when we were still a Daimler-Benz company, inspired me to  apply the
        patterns approach to my work, which is CAD for (analog) IC layout.
