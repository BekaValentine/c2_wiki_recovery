        <a href="NetVillage.html">NetVillage</a> is another wiki (no longer brand new, it has been running since 2002). It can be reached at <a href="http://www.netbros.com/.">http://www.netbros.com/.</a> It is mainly my personal scratchpad, but it is open for anyone to use, as long as things are keep tidy (pretty non-Wiki thing, but hey!).
