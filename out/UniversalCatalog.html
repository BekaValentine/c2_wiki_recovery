        Universal Catalog
      </h1>
      <p>
        A universal catalog is a system embodying a <em>few-to-many</em> publication model aimed at disseminating <em>metadata</em> and <em>location</em> information for <em>static content</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What that means is that if you're looking for some, possibly unspecified, static object (e.g., a novel, movie, music, software) then you'll be able to find information <em>about</em> that object in a universal catalog, using a combination of browsing and searching. In addition, your client might find a <em>repository</em> for that object. If it does, it will then attempt to retrieve it automatically, and it shouldn't matter a whit whether that repository is a web site, bittorrent peer, or Usenet over carrier pigeon.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is superficially similar to IMDB, Amazon, library card catalogs, and AudioGalaxy. However, to be worthy of the name, a <em>universal</em> catalog must also adhere to the following <strong>principles</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Universality and Openness, unlike the above services.
        </li>
        <li>
           Unity of Content, unlike Usenet, IRC, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Freedom of Publication, unlike Wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           No central point of control/failure, whether physical (storage) or legal (company), unlike Wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           Resilience against attack and sloth, unlike web novel archives.
        </li>
        <li>
           Accessibility and Usability, unlike libraries.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To accomplish the above, a universal catalog must be massively distributed, <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>, versioned both inside and out, fault-tolerant, completely automated, searchable, easy to use, have bidirectional references, and a next-gen interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Universal catalogs were conceived and designed by <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>. An implementation called Objects is now currently being implemented, also by RK, both for its own sake and as a stepping stone in a comprehensive plan to remake the entire computing experience from the top down. The long-term goals for Objects itself include the destruction of Hollywood and the shrink-wrap software industries by making seamless distribution completely effortless.

           3G UI, a <a href="DirectManipulation.html">DirectManipulation</a> framework (but will use a shit UI to begin with).
        </li>
        <li>
           book, author, category, keyword, content, and search objects (will have a fixed ontology for now).
        </li>
        <li>
           log; reverse maps; repository index; content; request stack.
        </li>
        <li>
           log, maps, index and content distribution (<a href="FreeNet.html">FreeNet</a> model limited to groups); log writing proposals, and arbitrations (piggy-backed over Usenet); groups management (group memberships, groups list, membership lists, export lists).
