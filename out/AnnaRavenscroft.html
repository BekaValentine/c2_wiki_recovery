        Anna Ravenscroft
      </h1>
      <p>
        Anna (no relation to the homonym Welsh artist and calligrapher!) lives and works with her husband <a href="AlexMartelli.html">AlexMartelli</a> (currently -- late 2011 -- they live in California, USA), and, in her own words, is not a programmer but just uses Python to get her work done.  Nevertheless, she's co-edited with Alex and DavidAscher the second edition of "Python Cookbook", published by O'Reilly in 2005; she then became the first woman member of the Python Software Foundation; she's holds a Psychology bachelor's degree from  Stanford University (a small switch of major from her original focus into Symbolic Systems).
      </p>

        The marriage of Alex and Anna has been described as "The first Pythonic Marriage" (and indeed Alex gave a lightning talk about it at OSCON 2004!), partly because among their readings (<a href="http://www.aleax.it/mar.html)">http://www.aleax.it/mar.html)</a> was a lightly edited version of Tim Peters' "Zen of Python" (great advice to any couple, they claim).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anna presented an excellent introduction to distutils at PyCon2004, finding a way to interest both the gurus in the room and the newbies.  Other talks she's given at OSCON and EuroPython in 2003/2004 were about "how NOT to write a Python book" and about date/time processing in Python.  Googling for her finds all the materials (just skip the many references to the artist/calligrapher!-).

        Somehow her name just seems to fit her hair. ;-)

        Anna Ravenscroft sounds like the name of a Bronte heroine!
        And well it might as she is witty, bright, insightful, lively, and wickedly gorgeous.
