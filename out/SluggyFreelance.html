        "Did you ever wonder what would happen if a computer nerd, his demon-summoning best-friend, the world's unluckiest college co-ed, a ferret on a sugar-high, a form-changing alien and an absolutely evil mini-lop got together in an online comic?"

        Sluggy Freelance is amazing. Pete Abrams only distributes the comic via sluggy.com; no newspapers, nothing. He is almost making enough revenue from the site to quit his normal existence. (or maybe he has by now) I bought a Bunbun hat! -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I got ripped off when buying a Zoe t-shirt. I often wish <a href="SluggyFreelance.html">SluggyFreelance</a> would use less crazy storylines and glitz and more sneaky tricks like <a href="CalvinAndHobbes.html">CalvinAndHobbes</a>. -- OriFolger

        SF also supports a growing community of rabid fans with nothing better to do with their time than drool over "canon" (see <a href="IfYouDontLikeItDontClickOnIt.html">IfYouDontLikeItDontClickOnIt</a>), and produce insipid fan-art like this:

        Of particular interest to <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>s is Pete Abrams's relationship to his <a href="CustomerTeam.html">CustomerTeam</a>. As an early WebComic, Sluggy has several forums and mailing lists teeming and teaming with fan-boys and -girls.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like most of <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>, their links to reality are tenuous at best. Because one of Sluggy's best loved characters is an evil bunny with a switch-blade, they tend to start screaming in protest each time Abrams dares to run a strip lacking a quorum of the beloved main characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        A healthy project would employ a CustomerLiaison or <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> to sort these things out. But because Pete himself participates in these online discussions - both his duty and his daily 'net habit - he gets a very skewed version of PetitionTheKing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two of his story lines, <em>Punyverse</em> and <em>Oceans Unmoving</em>, were miniature epics, and the products of an artist in his prime. And Pete has found himself publicly <strong>apologizing</strong> for these majestic stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lesson for Pete is obvious - if someone could scream it loud enough at him over the din of the asylum. The lesson for programmers is that <a href="GroupThink.html">GroupThink</a> among the <a href="EndUser.html">EndUser</a>s is not the same thing as an <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> who speaks with one (sane) voice!
