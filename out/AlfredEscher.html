        <a href="MauritsCorneliusEscher.html">MauritsCorneliusEscher</a>'s second cousin and often collaborator, <a href="AlfredEscher.html">AlfredEscher</a> (1898-) was the artist responsible for rendering the sky in "hand with reflecting globe" & "three spheres II", as well as the famous (infamous) hole in the middle of "the print gallery". Working mainly in textiles and shunning the popularity enjoyed by his famous cousin MC, <a href="AlfredEscher.html">AlfredEscher</a> is best known as the creator of the dramatic stage settings for JohnCage's "4'3<em>". Although suffering from a skin-disorder for much of his life, </em><a href="AlfredEscher.html">AlfredEscher</a> is still alive and rumoured to be the inspiration for TV's "fluke-boy". -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
