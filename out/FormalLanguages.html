        Formal Languages
      </h1>
      <p>
        Languages designed to specify system. Theoretically, one can execute some specifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Executable specification languages include Maude and OBJ3.

      <p>
        The theory is that the formal language allows one to prove that you have correctly implemented the specification.  The problem is that a specification for a formal language is harder to get right than a normal program.

        Is BirdMerteensCalculus (see "Functional programming with bananas, lenses, envelopes and barbed wire" and "Bananas in space") a formal language in this sense? <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> has a strong grounding in Bird-Merteens theory -- DiegoNavarro
