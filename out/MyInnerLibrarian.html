        <a href="MyInnerLibrarian.html">MyInnerLibrarian</a> is one of the cacaphonic, nagging, internal voices.

        What this helps, once you've got that, <a href="MyInnerLibrarian.html">MyInnerLibrarian</a> must become MyInnerGraffitiArtist, because the task is no longer to file things, but to tag them with appropriate metadata so you can find them again. Every iTunes fan knows the smart playlists become really useful if (a) you've got correct ID3 tags, and (b) you've added at least some metadata (especially ratings) to your songs.
