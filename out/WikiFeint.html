        Touching a Wiki page.. making a small grammatical or formatting correction in order to pop it onto <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and possibly influence thought on pages that are currently being developed.

        Another, less subtle method is to add a link from one of the pages to the other. This is more permanent, and <a href="LinksAreContent.html">LinksAreContent</a>, but much more blatant and possibly not what's wanted. On the other hand, a <a href="WikiFeint.html">WikiFeint</a> would only last a couple of days, and may never be noticed (too subtle?). Surely, for the long-term health of Wiki, a link is a much better solution. Perhaps a <a href="WikiFeint.html">WikiFeint</a> would be appropriate on topics where being explicit could damage your argument, but that's not what Wiki's about anyway.

        Useful both in exposing the <a href="WikiIceberg.html">WikiIceberg</a> and in <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s triage.
