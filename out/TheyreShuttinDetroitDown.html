        "Detroit" stands for the Canadian and American auto industry, located in Ontario and the American Midwest. For the better part of a century, most Americans were quite proud of this industry. Its achievements, and the eco-system it was part of, include the stuff of legends:

        The auto industry is intensely competitive, though they don't always compete by producing high-quality products that consumers need...
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to thrive, the auto industry invests in new technologies. Some are technologies that computer programmers would do well to emulate:

      <ul>
        <li>
           LeanProduction
        </li>
        <li>
           Good user interfaces (many of the "good" examples in <a href="TheDesignOfEverydayThings.html">TheDesignOfEverydayThings</a> are from automobiles)

        <strong>Discussion:</strong>

      <p>
        If the American auto industry is shut down, what do we stand to lose? What are we likely to lose?

        <em>Also, maybe it's the first place to make a stand against lopsided trade. Many of us disagree with the claims made by "free trade" proponents. Their models are too simplistic to mirror reality.</em>
