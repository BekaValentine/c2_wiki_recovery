        Share Ware
      </h1>
      <p>
        A method of software distribution where you let people copy your program, and trust them enough to say "if you like it, register your copy by sending me <em>x</em> amount of money." Pioneered by Jim Knopf (a.k.a Jim Button) with PC-File in 1981. It has the distinct advantage of near-zero distribution cost, but generally doesn't pay out quite like requiring people to pay up front for permission to even possess a copy of your software.

        Modern <a href="ShareWare.html">ShareWare</a> generally doesn't trust its users to pay up, so it resorts to disabling itself or nagging the user after a set period of time. This tends to frustrate the user, but apparently it works, much like dongle-based license managers frustrate the user yet apparently work. ("Works" is defined as making the user pay up.)
