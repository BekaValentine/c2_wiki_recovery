        Logo Turtle Robot
      </h1>
      <p>
        An ancestor of <a href="LegoMindstorms.html">LegoMindstorms</a> robots. In the original Logo labs the "turtle" the kids programmed was an actual robot that looked a little like a turtle, and had a real pen that drew on paper on the floor as the robot moved.

        You can still buy the Valiant Turtle (<a href="http://www.valiant-technology.com/usa/turtle1.htm)">http://www.valiant-technology.com/usa/turtle1.htm)</a> although the price is steep.  There is also Roamer (<a href="http://www.valiant-technology.com/usa/roamer1.htm)">http://www.valiant-technology.com/usa/roamer1.htm)</a> which can be controlled by a computer, and with a pen attachment can draw pictures on paper on the floor, but doesn't seem to be able to pick up or put down the pen.

        I've been looking for a cheap (under $100) tethered turtle for a while now.  <a href="LegoMindstorms.html">LegoMindstorms</a> (about $200) can do the trick, but it is major overkill if all you are trying to do is draw pictures on butcher paper in <a href="LogoLanguage.html">LogoLanguage</a>.

        See <a href="LogoLanguage.html">LogoLanguage</a>, GeneralTurtle.
