        Here are some of the accepted ways to use <a href="CeePreprocessorStatements.html">CeePreprocessorStatements</a>:

      <ol>
        <li>
            In the implementation of assert macros, to prevent a performance hit at run-time.  <em>This is an excellent practice, except that it means that any otherwise useful code performed by the assert statement becomes an undesirable side-effect.</em>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Macros.  <em>In-line functions work just as well.  Functions don't bomb the program if they are not wrapped in enough parentheses.  Functions can be stepped into and debugged; most debuggers cannot step into macros.</em>  Most importantly, function calls always evaluate their parameters only once.  (Try using 'x++' in a 'min(,)' macro.  Surprise!)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            To create enumerated lists (e.g. of Windows dialog controls), without creating an enum. (<em>Yuck!</em>)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           To comment out blocks of code from the compiler. (We can't use actual comments because in C++ comments don't nest. We can't use "if(false)" because the commented-out code may not compile, and because the removed block may be bigger than a single function.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Stringify code. For example, stringifying a failed assert expression.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Conditional compilation. Used in a variety of ways. For example:
          <ol>
            <li>
               Enable Multiple Character Types -- compile differently based on a static character type of Single-Byte, Multi-Byte, or Double-Byte.
            </li>
            <li>
               Enable Multiple Platform Builds -- compile differently based on platform. For example, typedef a Unicode character type as <em>uint16</em> #ifdef _WIN32 but as <em>uint32</em> #ifdef _UNIX.
            </li>
            <li>
               Enable Multiple Build Grades -- change the verbosity or rigor of debug code based on the BUILD_GRADE. For example, a build may have the following grades: DEBUG, INTEG1, INTEG2, and RELEASE.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Defining booleans in C.  <em>(Why not use "enum bool { false, true };" instead?)</em> [Because <em>true</em> in C is any non-zero value it makes more sense to #define FALSE (0!=0) / #define TRUE !FALSE]
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Getting the file name and line into a debug statement (__FILE__ and __LINE__).  This is especially useful when the target system's debugger is incompetent.  However, using this creates some interesting <a href="UnitTesting.html">UnitTesting</a> problems (using (__LINE__ + 2) for the expected error statement, for instance).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Here are some less accepted, but still very common, uses of <a href="CeePreprocessorStatements.html">CeePreprocessorStatements</a>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            To make it easier to use the debug version of the program than to use the release version of the program.  For example, to create a backdoor around the password protection system.  <em>If the developers think that the system is too much of a hassle to use regularly, shouldn't they make it easier to use for everybody?  Plus, if the developers don't use a feature, it is much less likely to be properly tested.</em>  -- generally this is done in order to get to the piece of functionality that needs testing without wading through all of the startup steps on the way there.  However, if you're unit testing properly, you shouldn't need to do this.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>

            Many kinds of configuration management where a variation in the program can and should be fixed at compile time.

        I implemented rudimentary reflection in C++ using macros. The preprocessor is my friend. I especially enjoy the # and ## operators. On the other hand, having read the Apache source code and the MFC headers, the #ifdefs are brutal. Trade offs, trade offs. Might as well outlaw gotos while you're at it. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, I'm with Stroustrup on this. The C preprocessor is nasty. There is very little to enjoy about the # and ## operators. In general, the C preprocessor does little but expose the deficiencies in the <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> language. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        Well, it's certainly not the <em>best</em> thing ever. Scheme and Lisp have better macro support. Imports are better than includes. But it's workable and powerful and certainly usable to get things done during the day. The same apologetics are used for Java, I know, but at least most of C++ was thought out. (And Java is in desperate need of a macro system, too.) Besides, the preprocessor is just an inheritance from C. Two competing forces: elegance vs. backwards compatibility. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That would just be horrible if Java added a preprocessor! Ugh! How is Java in desperate need of one? For stringifying assert expressions? Big deal! The problem with the C preprocessor is that most people over-use it. They end up using it to create mini-languages or object-models that are difficult to maintain and usually over-complex. The C preprocessor should be something one uses when there is simply no other choice. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Often a problem with Java in constrained environments such as embedded devices is that the some of the class library or even some of the language (e.g. reflection) is not available on the platform. Sometimes, the best choice to minimize footprint is to conditionally compile. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I'm not sure what you are saying, but you can conditionally exclude byte-code in Java using static finals. --<a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

      <p>
        True. Though the compiler would still have to evaluate the code block even if it was not emitted. One problem might be making use of java.lang.* classes that don't exist on a impoverished platform. I have had to write code that didn't use all of java.lang.* because it wouldn't compile in certain environments. Unfortunately, since I don't have a cross-compiler handy, I cannot verify or demonstrate my experience. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I see include guards as a way of reducing coupling. If a .h file must see the definition in another, then there are 2 possibilities: either you require the user of the .h to include the dependencies, or you need to have the .h file include another. There are good arguments for each but, in general, I favour not forcing the user of a class to know its dependencies. This limits the scope of changes because it reducing the coupling. --<a href="DaveWhipp.html">DaveWhipp</a>

        If someone attaches a smell to a general language feature (e.g. the C preprocessor) then we are in an extreme form of <a href="LanguagePissingMatch.html">LanguagePissingMatch</a> ("this whole language smells"). This should not be done. Languages have weaknesses, it's our job to avoid them. A smell is something that can be avoided because there is a better way to do it. There is no way in C to avoid the preprocessor, so the C preprocessor can't smell. Only a certain use of the preprocessor can smell, if there is a better alternative. -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I see the C preprocessor feature as similar to a "goto" statement:
        it is a low-level language feature that can be used to fake high-level stuff like a module system. In general, one should use the high-level feature if available. If not available, one should stick to a highly stylized idiom that simulates the high-level feature. And complain loudly to the C standardisation committee.

        The preprocessor was a very good thing for the "C" language.
        It is largely useless in the C++ language, and should generally be avoided.

        Okay.. So the preprocessor is evil. I'd like to change these MIN & MAX macros to C++ inline functions. I'm not especially worried about MIN(a++,b++) etc, because everyone knows about the double increment of the lesser variable, but there are MIN(vec1.len(),vec2.len()) or other function calls which could be bad (perhaps optimized away though). So I'm thinking 'What better way is there to do it than to use a template function?'
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm going from <em>#define MAX(a,b) (((a)>(b))?(a):(b))</em> into <em>template <class T> inline T MIN(T a, T b) { return a<b?a:b; }</em> and rebuild the product. But there's problems ahoy! MIN(type1, type2) is not defined. For example double and float, or double and char, double and int, etc etc... Overloading is a hassle because there's so many types.

        How can you overcome this problem with this incredibly simple macro?

      <p>
        <em>Well, you should use std::min or std::max from <algorithm>, rather than rolling your own.  Of course, you can't call these methods with arguments of different types, but you can explicitly select a specialization.  Example stolen from Josuttis:</em>

        If one writes a macro, the discussion above shows how to let other people safely use the macro in their code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macros should not be used <strong>unnecessarily</strong>.
        Some disadvantages of macros:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The compiler can be trusted to read and expand every nested include file, but humans can't.  
        </li>
        <li>
           It is common to define C macros in headers.  Nested includes often cause macros to interfere with each other in ways that are difficult to untangle.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you choose to use header files, there are also standard techniques for making sure they don't tangle up with each other. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Using header files is quite a different topic than using macros. Many languages use something along the lines of header files, albeit with something like the #import unique inclusion approach.
        </li>
        <li>
           People don't hate header files as much as they deplore macros.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Macros can do some things functions can't do.</strong>  Some people would rather not do those things.  Among them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You need to pass an argument which is not a valid expression in the calling scope, such as passing the name (or partial name) of a type or variable that you intend on defining in the macro's body. You cannot pass an unevaluated symbol into a function - use of a symbol as a function's actual argument will either cause the symbol to be evaluated, or a compiler error (if the symbol is not defined or has a type mismatch).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You need to pass as an argument something which isn't an expression at all!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Interpreters are often written by <a href="GenericProgrammingUsingCeeMacros.html">GenericProgrammingUsingCeeMacros</a>.  (Some people prefer to use EBNF and ANTLR instead of C, when writing interpreters.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CallByName.html">CallByName</a> semantics are needed. Most folks think <a href="CallByName.html">CallByName</a> is evil, but occasionally it is handy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sometimes you need inlining with macro semantics ("unhygienic macros", in Lisp speak), that access globals or what not (and don't lecture about globals; they too are rare, but not nonexistent).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Here's one I've done moderately often. In debugging via an assert() that calls abort() on failure, in one environment abort() calls raise() which calls kill(), so in the debugger I have to keep going up multiple frames, and the conceptual bottom-most frame isn't the actual bottom-most. So I do #define abort()  kill(getpid(), SIGKILL) to avoid the clutter. Using a function would not do what I want.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You need access to the enclosing scope - a macro is the closest thing C/C++ has to a <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>. From a macro, you can return from the enclosing function (try doing that in an inline function - all you will do is exit the inline function. You can also access the local variables in the procedure enclosing the macro call; inlines can't do that either.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Implementing something as a macro allows for it to be used as an lval, not just an rval: #define INFO(x) ((x)->information_record.user_information) allows usages like INFO(a) = INFO(b); which, in some circumstances, can be considerably nicer than the alternatives.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Speed</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You want to <em>force</em> the compiler to expand something inline (declaring it as "inline", or "__inline" on older compilers, is merely a suggestion and not a requirement).  <em>This case should be rare, as most modern compilers will respect inline directives (with optimization enabled); and there are better ways than #define to declare manifest constants.</em> Rare, but it still happens...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The stdio getchar and putchar as implemented by Bell Labs/ATT (and by many later vendors) were macros for two separate reasons: speed, and to access certain stdio singleton global variables. The GNU /usr/include stuff also implements them as macros but I never examined them to see why. The speed difference of getchar() vs fgetc() was quite noticeable back in the old days. Not sure about these days.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Encapsulation: ctype isdigit etc as a macro hides whether the implementation is done as a function, lookup table, inline expression, etc., which is a good thing, and also since the point is extreme speed, typically it is implemented as a table lookup, but wrapping that in a function rather than a macro would defeat the speed and encourage people to reinvent their own isdigit/isalpha etc.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Exception Safety</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider
      </p>
      <code>
        X* f() { return new X; }<br/>
        Y* g() { return new Y; }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        try { do_something(f(), g()); }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This code can be exception safe. However, if you replace f() and g() with equivalant macros, then it cannot. This is because the C++ standard explicitly does not require naked "new" operations to completely create one object before starting on the next. So, in the macro-based implementation, the compiler is free to allocate memory for both X and Y before calling either of the constructors. If the first of the constructors (we don't know which will be first) throws an exception, then the memory for the other might not be reclaimed. When the "new" operations are encapsulated in functions, this optimization is not permitted. (Which means that even inline functions might be slower than macros).

For instance it is sometimes handy during debugging to redefine a widely used function from pass-by-value to pass-by-reference via a macro, just temporarily, without needing to change 50 source files to go back and forth.<em></em>

        <em>I fully understand people's distaste for the C preprocessor, but nonetheless I can't fathom living without it, either. The above stuff all applies even when using C++, for that matter; they didn't come up with enough features to completely displace it.</em>

        Language idioms are things that all experienced programmers in that language learn.

        [In my experience, this is not a common C language idiom.]

        [My primary audience (after the compiler, of course) contains many junior programmers.  Some are less bright than others, but they all deserve code that is as easy to understand as I can make it.]

        IMHO the C preprocessor is the WORST macro processor in wide use.

        <em>Probably. Just for the record, for years it wasn't considered part of the C language per se, and was advocated, designed, and implemented by different people than the rest of C: Alan Snyder, Mike Lesk, and John Reiser. See Ritchie's history of C </em><a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html''">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/dmr/chist.html''</a>

        <em>Incidentally, skipping past the </em>'design<strong> of the C preprocessor for a moment, Reiser's </strong>implementation<em>' of it is an amazing case study in how to make software run really, really, really fast. In one environment I used in the 1980s, it was faster than "cat file.c > /tmp/foo"! ("cat" uses getchar() and the stdio lib was inefficient)</em>

        <em>Which is perhaps fine for FSF posix-only "free" code, but doesn't work well when one of the branches uses undefined identifiers, which occurrs quite often when you're doing portability.</em>

        I use not only the C preprocessor, I program in the preprepreprocessor!

        Here is one example, which is used to automatically unroll loops. Preprocessor commands can also be included in the unrolled loops.

        Here is another example. \addkind is a TeX macro, defined earlier in the program, which sorts and prints a summary of the entries.

        ``k"@<Data of kinds@>=<br/>
