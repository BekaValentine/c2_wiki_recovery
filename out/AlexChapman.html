        I have worked for IBM (UK and USA), Fujitsu-ICL and NCR in various development roles since 1988. Each of the organizations I have been part of have used their own home-grown development process, with varying degrees of rigor and quantity when it came to requirements and design documentation.

        I had heard of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and read a few articles, but it wasn't until around the time that I attended a talk on <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> by <a href="LaurieWilliams.html">LaurieWilliams</a> in 2001 that I became interested. I read <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange</a> by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and it clicked. I couldn't understand why I hadn't seen it before.

        In September 2001 my team began to adopt some of the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices</a>, and now have <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> with <a href="JakartaAnt.html">JakartaAnt</a>/<a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a> and hundreds of <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> tests. We do occasional <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>. These practices have had a significant impact on quality and confidence. I would like to adopt more <a href="ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices</a>, and am especially interested in the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>.

        At <a href="XpUniverseTwoThousandTwo.html">XpUniverseTwoThousandTwo</a> I met <a href="BillKrebs.html">BillKrebs</a> and began discussing the idea of <strong></strong><a href="TriangleXpUsersGroup.html">TriangleXpUsersGroup</a><strong>. I also did a little </strong><a href="XpFest.html">XpFest</a> with <a href="DuffOmelia.html">DuffOmelia</a> of <a href="RoleModelSoftware.html">RoleModelSoftware</a> and through him met <a href="JeffCanna.html">JeffCanna</a> who was thinking along the same lines. The first meeting of the <a href="TriangleXpUsersGroup.html">TriangleXpUsersGroup</a> (<a href="TriangleXpMeetingOne.html">TriangleXpMeetingOne</a>) was held on Monday October 29, 2002.
