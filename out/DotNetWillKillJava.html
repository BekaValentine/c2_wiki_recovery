        "Can be ported" is not the same as portable. First, let's see a real implementation on something other than windows that - and this is important - does <em>not</em> depend on have a windows box somewhere to have full functionality. Second, if the CLR on a non-windows platform lacks anything that is available on windows (modulo restrictions for low-end devices like PDAs) then it's not really all that. Heck if I want to use DCOM from a non-windows box I can do that now with Java through jIntegra. It doesn't magically confer DCOM onto Linux, though. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This has nothing to do with DCOM. SOAP is the replacement for that. This has nothing to wih Windows. The <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a> is a VM that hosts languages and makes services available to them. It doesn't need any Windows functionality. You will see a real implementation on other platforms when <em>(ha!)</em> they <em>(heh!)</em> finish the <a href="EcmaProcess.html">EcmaProcess</a>. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'm also looking forward to non-Windows implementations of <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>, but unlike others here, I don't see it as a terribly big challenge. From the discussion, there are four core technologies that drive <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>: SOAP (which implies XML), HTTP, and C#. SOAP, XML, and HTTP are certainly not Windows-specific. And while people fear C# will somehow be Microsoft-specific or Microsoft-centric, I'm less concerned with that because if C# is a useful language, it <em>will</em> be ported to other platforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've not heard any indication from Microsoft that <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> will be ported to any platform but Windows. COM is also an "open standard" but it has never been effectively ported to any other platform. Also, while portions of the <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a> and the entire <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> are being submitted to ECMA for standardization the library isn't. That almost certainly means non-portable applications. Finally, while the <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a> can potentially support many different languages, it doesn't actually support <em>any</em> existing language in its original form (not even VB). That means that there are very few existing applications that can just be recompiled and run on <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>. In all fairness the porting process should be fairly easy for most applications. I would expect the kinds of changes needed to be fairly trivial technically; like changing the names and expected sizes of some of the primitive data types you are using for instance. But the time and money needed to make those changes may not turn out to be so trivial in some cases. Don't get me wrong <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> has lots of potential, but it's no Java. At least it isn't yet. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        Yeah, DotNetWillDefinitelyNotKillJava. However, if Microsoft breaks with tradition and actually creates a VM for all the major platforms (including stuff like PalmOS, not just Windows CE) then there might be a chance for C# to supersede Java. However, this has never happened any other time they've promised support for multiple platforms so I don't see why it would happen this time. Remember when MS called DCOM portable? However, how many people use DCOM over CORBA in a heterogenous computing environment - some, but not <em>many</em>. I'll take the <em>wait and see</em> approach before I proclaim <a href="JavaIsDead.html">JavaIsDead</a>. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

      <p>
        Clearly, the greatest benefit of <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> is the <a href="MicrosoftIntermediateLanguage.html">MicrosoftIntermediateLanguage</a> (or IL) which <em>every</em> <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> language is compiled down to (Yes, this includes Smalltalk, C#, VB, C++, Python, Perl, Cobol, Eiffel, the list goes on). You can derive VB objects from C++ base classes or create Python collections of C# objects. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The JIT compiler can compile to native code during installation rather than runtime (No doggish VM! Yeah!). ASP+ web pages become compiled and cached rather than interpreted and stateless.

        Interesting. Does this mean "<a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> is going to simplify things by supporting lots of different languages." How can one have "the simplicity of Java" in say, C and C++? (I thought that a major part of the "simplicity of Java" came by throwing away the low-level and overcomplicated stuff from C++.) Could whoever made that claim explain exactly what "the simplicity of Java" is if it isn't all language specific. It's also going to be interesting to see how a common type system is going to work with Smalltalk and prototype-based languages.

        I may misunderstand what I've read, but it was my impression that .NET is essentially just a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> and Runtime. I don't understand these comparisons of .NET to various languages. Seems like comparing an OS to an Application that runs on an OS. Maybe because C# and .NET were hyped at the same time, people tend to confuse them, but it is my understanding that C# could be implemented without .NET and that .NET can be used as a VM for many other languages than C# (Take the Eiffel implementation, for example). -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

      <p>
        Of course, if the VB and smalltalk experience is anything to go by .NET will not support any other languages unchanged. VB.NET has a different syntax and semantics to the old VB (see: penultimate paragraph here: <a href="http://www.devx.com/upload/free/features/vbpj/2000/11nov00/en0011/en0011.asp)">http://www.devx.com/upload/free/features/vbpj/2000/11nov00/en0011/en0011.asp)</a> and its the same for the smalltalk implementation. Perhaps we should say that .NET will support multiple new languages that look a bit like various old ones.

      <p>
        <em>Q: Does this mean Microsoft is supporting the Java platform?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Absolutely not. Microsoft is supporting Java as a programming language, and is helping developers migrate from the Java platform to the .NET platform. Customers interested in pursuing Sun's vision of Java will need to go elsewhere to find that support. -- <a href="DrewMarsh.html">DrewMarsh</a>

        <em>Given that the vast majority of java developers (as far as I can tell) are indeed interested in pursuing Sun's vision of Java, and are already going elsewhere to find support for doing so... I don't see how this could have much of an effect on Java. Is there more on that link which speaks to this point? -- </em><a href="BrettNeumeier.html">BrettNeumeier</a><em></em>

        I don't really think so either... I only posted that because it suited the topic and I thought people might find it interesting.

      </p>
      <p>
        JUMP isn't a death blow, it's just good business. There are lots of Microsoft-platform programmers that used J++ for important systems. Microsoft can't leave those people out high and dry - they need a migration path. Hopefully the new WinForms API will be similar to J++'s WFC, which was actually quite pleasant to work with despite the keyword additions. Microsoft's innovation on Java in the past has benefitted one audience: Windows developers. They're continuing to follow that path with this approach.

        <em>I only used J++ for "100% pure" development and found it to be excellent for that. A very neat IDE and it turned out to be perfectly simple to add the Swing .jar file to my project. Thanks to the lawsuit, it goes to the ends of the earth to warn you if you're going to use something Windows-specific. And it runs so much faster (and in less memory) than all the IDEs written in Java, of course.

I and others inside </em><a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> would have been very happy using Java as a language for COM and Windows development but Sun had to whine. Now they eat the results.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The only concern I think is that Microsoft really wants to win back developers' hearts, and hasn't quite found a way yet. We'll have to see how well .NET does as a whole - my current feeling is that it will definitely keep Windows developers from migrating elsewhere, but won't attract a horde of people back to the mothership (those that veered away to Linux or Java). I work for a company that was a die-hard Microsoft shop before I joined, and it just happens that our clients and direction are (currently) drifting away from what Microsoft is aiming at with .NET, and more towards Sun & Oracle's vision. On the bright side diversity is good, on the bad side, industry fragmentation is becoming higher. -- <a href="StuCharlton.html">StuCharlton</a>

        <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> wants to have the hearts of minds of the individual developers. Two things have happened to erode <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>'s legendary grip on developers. One is that many people, for better or worse, adopted the Java language and platform as their choice. <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> wants to win some of those people back. <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> is not likely to have much effect with them.

        From what I have read, the .NET runtime does not give you true multilingual interoperability. Many languages have to be modified to conform to the VM's type model. E.g. the VM does not support multiple implementation inheritance, covariant return types or contravariant argument types (sounds very similar to the JVM).
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, multiple inheritance of implementation is a fundamental design technique in the Eiffel and C++ languages that is not supported by the VM. Eiffel has been modified to work on the VM, and I assume that C++ has had to be as well. Similarly, most statically typed OO languages (apart from Java) support covariant return types.

        What I've learned thus far about the relevance of a cross-platform .NET: what good is the platform without all of the goodies? The majority of people interested in .NET are enterprise developers, I would imagine. Solaris/Linux/AIX/OS390 versions of the CLR and C# will not support ADO.NET, ASP.NET, Microsoft's XML libraries, <a href="ComPlus.html">ComPlus</a> services & the DTC, clustering, etc. It would require other companies to create their own fragmented / competing implementations. What incentive do these companies have to compete with Microsoft? Especially when Java is effectively as sophisticated as .NET is?

      <p>
        Borland look like there going to make the next version of JBuilder Dot Net, Delphi 8 certainly will be. Microsoft are currently making a <a href="VisualJaySharpDotNet.html">VisualJaySharpDotNet</a> for the the dot net platform, before they make C++ fully Dot Net incidentally.
      </p>
      <p>
        So should the question be, will Dot Net kill the Java Virtual Machine rather than will Dot Net kill Java?

        What <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> requires is a proper UNIX implementation. Already, VB/VC++ combination is dominant in desktop systems. Only area Microsoft is lacking in is server side application (although they have good share in this arena, Java is dominant because of J2EE implementations). Once there is a viable alternative on UNIX (like Mono, DotGNU, etc), I think .NET will become more dominant over the time. The .NET technology is good, APIs are available, there is a good and integrated IDE, only requirement is multi-platform implementation. -- <a href="VhIndukumar.html">VhIndukumar</a>

        Dot Net will not kill Java; if Java dies, it will be because Java killed itself.  I am not saying I expect to see Java to die, I am just saying that Dot Net will not influence Java much one way or the other.

        In the best of worlds, Bill Gates and Scott MacNeally would quit squabbling and agree to a common virtual machine for both Java and Dot Net.  The end result would benefit both companies and save wasted effort.  Unfortunately, that will not happen, so we will have to live in a world of both technologies and bit twiddle to bridge between them.

        There are many very large businesses that will not agree to the <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> EULA. J2EE is more comfortable for them as they feel there is less chance of getting shafted, regardless of any technical pros and cons.

        <em>On Transaction Management</em>
        At end 2005 <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> <a href="EnterpriseServices.html">EnterpriseServices</a> library is (still) used to generate <a href="ServicedComponents.html">ServicedComponents</a>, within which <a href="ComPlus.html">ComPlus</a> ComComponents are invoked if you want transaction facilities. There is also a mechanism for ComComponents to reference managed code via ComCallableWrapper (see <a href="ComInterOp.html">ComInterOp</a>). I am not aware of any commercial grade Java products that can access legacy ComComponents (And outstanding <a href="WebServicesInteroperabilityConcerns.html">WebServicesInteroperabilityConcerns</a> will probably discourage people thinking of integration via the <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> route). In future <a href="WindowsCommunicationFoundation.html">WindowsCommunicationFoundation</a> may provide a different mechanism of implementing transactions.

        <em>On Distributed Objects</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What kind of requirement scenarios dictate the construction of comlicated distributed object computing solutions? Could a company like Amazon not function well with a solution constructed differently? In a post <a href="DotCom.html">DotCom</a> era do we have much need for business solutions "requiring" distributed objects?" -- dl

           Probably good reasoning in a DevelopersGetToChoosePlatformTools company, but useless in a SeniorManagersChoosePlatformTools company.
