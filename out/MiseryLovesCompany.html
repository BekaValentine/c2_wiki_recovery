        Misery Loves Company

        Not sure of the origin of this phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase seems to indicate that if I am really unhappy and you are really unhappy, then we would love to get together.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems highly unlikely.
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase is commonly used to refer to situations where people get together and vent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are they really enjoying each others company? Probably not.
      </p>
      <p>
        After venting <strong>with</strong> you, if they had their preference, they would then be able to immediately find someone else they could vent with <strong>about</strong> you.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is probably really going on is that people like to vent, a lot. And, people probably feel more comfortable venting in a collaboration.
      </p>

        Perhaps this is really, <a href="PairedVenting.html">PairedVenting</a>?

        This misunderstands the meaning of the phrase. Actually, it means that when person A is unhappy, they don't get satisfaction from other people being happy and cheerful, in fact that can be annoying. Instead, unhappy person A may take a certain dismal pleasure in someone else experiencing a misfortune, especially a similar one.

        It's a form of schadenfreude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: Bob is running a race, and is winning, although Joe is just a step behind him. But Bob falls down and loses the race, and is extremely unhappy - until he notices that Joe fell down, too, and then Bob cheers up, because <strong>misery loves company</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not that the person enjoys the company of other miserable people, it's that the abstract state of misery enjoys the company of its own kind - more misery.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's a name for that kind of metaphor but it slips my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps this is the inversion of the "</em><a href="HowDoesThatMakeYouFeel.html">HowDoesThatMakeYouFeel</a>" annoyance. People in misery don't want to be told to cheer up. They don't mind being cheered up, but the last thing they want is it "put on a happy face" while denying the source of the original misery"

        Another interpretation. If I am miserable, I am more prone to mistakes. And these bring more misery. -- dl

        This was actually intended to have a bit of a TongueInCheek aspect to it. I do think the second definition above is the more correct definition, but I think it's also used (misused) as in the first. It's definitely become a TriteExpression.
