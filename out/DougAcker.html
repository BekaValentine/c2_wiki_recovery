        Greetings, I am the owner and chief consultant for KnowledgeNet Consulting located in Dayton, Ohio, USA. For too long companies have neglected to harvest the value of tribal knowledge. For most, it is simply a case of uneducated management staff who fail to understand the foundational premise of business; to turn intellect into capital. Wicki now provides a means to capture, store, and disseminate implicit tribal knowledge. I am interested in ways Wiki Wiki Webs have helped companies advance their efforts. If you would like to share a case with me, please email dacker@donet.com. 
        Thank you for your attention.
      </p>
