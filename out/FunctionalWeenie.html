        Functional Weenie
      </h1>
      <p>
        One who advocates <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s above their imperative cousins.  Unlike the weenies of <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> and <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, the <a href="FunctionalWeenie.html">FunctionalWeenie</a> doesn't get the label "smug", as they are advocating a technology still being actively researched, rather than one which elegantly solved all the world's problems twenty years ago and is slowly being integrated into mainstream technologies (which are arguably <em>still</em> of lesser quality) <em>ex post facto</em>.  In other words, the <a href="FunctionalWeenie.html">FunctionalWeenie</a> is not in a position to say "I told you so!"  
      </p>
      <p>
        At least not yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <a href="FunctionalWeenie.html">FunctionalWeenie</a>s are not a superset of <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>s (though the two overlap), as many of the latter gloss over (or ignore) the purely-functional aspects of <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>.  Most Lispers happily indulge in unclean things such as side effects, for instance.  Also, <a href="FunctionalWeenie.html">FunctionalWeenie</a>s often go agog over <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> and the like--an issue sidestepped completely in a dynamically-typed language like Lisp.

        <li>
           Think that constructing the natural numbers (and other algebraic sets) is a useful exercise for practicing programmers working on deadlines.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Have spent man-years researching (and advocating) mind-warping contortions such as monads, just to avoid typing an assignment statement.  When that fails, would prefer to make a copy of the world rather than mutating it in some fashion.  (After all, the <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a> can always throw away the old world when you're done with it...)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Are proud of languages which feature complicated <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> schemes--but have different operators for integer and floating-point arithmetic.  <em>(Like </em><a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, for example? :)<em> </em>'(Dude, this is an obvious reference to OCAML, where + is for ints, and +. is for floats)<strong></strong>

        <li>
           Can't write a paragraph without use of the word "lambda" at least once.

           Will go through loops to avoid writing loops.

           Have come together as a community to specify a language whose syntax makes Perl look like pseudocode.  <em>And that language would be... </em><a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>.  <a href="YourMileageMayVary.html">YourMileageMayVary</a>, of course<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Know what the <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> is.  Extra points if you've ever written a function that returns Bot (often spelled _|_ just to confuse the imperative unwashed)--despite the fact that according to type theory the <a href="BottomType.html">BottomType</a> is empty (no instances of it exist).
        </li>
        <li>
           Is that really so confusing?  I mean, there's an easy mnemonic: just think of it in parentheses.  (Anyone who doesn't get this one is invited to open up a text file and try it out now.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't think of Indian food when someone says "curry".

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't think of religion when someone says "church". <-- This is false, the ideas of Alonzo Church <em>are</em> the religion of any true functional weenie ;)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Consider multi-argument functions to be an abomination. <em>Nope, just a special case of a function that takes a tuple as </em>'the<em>' argument. :)</em>.  Nah.  A true <a href="FunctionalWeenie.html">FunctionalWeenie</a> uses <a href="CurryingSchonfinkelling.html">CurryingSchonfinkelling</a>, rather than <a href="CartesianProduct.html">CartesianProduct</a>, to handle multiple argument function.  Addition is really a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>, after all...  <em>Of course, but "true" multi-argument functions </em>'are<em>' a special case of functions that take tuples as argument.  Curried functions are better (more powerful) in a number of cases...</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Routinely put down other functional languages for being <em>impure</em> or <em>unsafe</em>, preferring whichever language is the most unsuitable for actual programming.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Insist that any program which passes the type-checker is correct.  If an incorrect program does pass through the type-checker, then the type system isn't good enough.  
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>This despite the fact that demonstrating the absence of many bugs, such as </em>DivisionByZero, is impossible<em> </em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Not so fast!  It wouldn't be at all impossible to make a type that can carry any number -except- zero, then define division as taking a number and a 'not-zero-number' to produce another number.  Allow this to percolate through the code... it will enforce checks to avoid zero prior to division where it cannot be proven.  The fact that current type-systems don't allow you to prevent division-by-zero is proof that they aren't good enough... (heh heh)
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>I'd like to hear more about this one argument thing, anybody have some good links?</em>

        Fast search on google gave this: <a href="http://www.cs.hmc.edu/courses/2002/fall/cs80/sml/lecture03.html">http://www.cs.hmc.edu/courses/2002/fall/cs80/sml/lecture03.html</a> (scroll down to the "more than one parameter" part).

        Usually, Haskell / Ocaml programmers tend to prefer curried style, SML programmers tuple style.  Both are isomorphisms of true multiple argument functions; isomorphisms such that they only need one-argument functions for their semantics; <a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a> in practice.  To confuse things more, let's note that under category theory the isomorphism between tuple and curried functions is equivalent to the logical claim,

        (a and b => c) <=> (a => (b => c))<br/>
