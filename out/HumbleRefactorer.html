        Humble Refactorer

        One who quietly cleans wiki pages to the benefit of even more quiet readers.

        Is this to be considered a virtue?  I sign my major refactorings, not out of ego, but because I am making myself accountable if I have mistakenly caused someone's viewpoint to be misrepresented, or worse, made a falsehood out of a truth.  That way, the offended party can SynchronizeIntents with me, and we can work together on a refactoring that will convey truth and opinion to a wider audience.  --<a href="DavidSaff.html">DavidSaff</a>

        <em>Of course, a true </em><a href="HumbleRefactorer.html">HumbleRefactorer</a> would never have made this page since other extant pages would have done better...<em> </em>

        I think you may be referring to the OmniscientRefactorer
