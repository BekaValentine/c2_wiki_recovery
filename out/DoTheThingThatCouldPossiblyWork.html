        Do The Thing That Could Possibly Work
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you got tired of all the DoThe*ThingThatCouldPossiblyWork, or if you are a beginner who wants to program stuff before putting tons of useless ideas in your head, then forget about all the principles that you are taught, and write a good program.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Without the principles, is it likely to be a good program?  With them?</em>
      </p>

        With all due respect to all the various buzzwords we bandy about, my philosophy tends to be to:

        I see that and raise the abstraction to: I just write programs.  The devil, of course, is in the details. -- <a href="JoeWeaver.html">JoeWeaver</a>

        Sadly, all these discussions completely ignore the need for process in the creation of a working product. Process is not an end-all, be-all of its own, but it needs to be there to insure that you are creating a good product that meets requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        So that means you have to start with requirements (<a href="CategoryRequirements.html">CategoryRequirements</a>). You refine these into a specification (<a href="WhatIsaSpecificationAnyway.html">WhatIsaSpecificationAnyway</a>), which formalizes the requirements into a set of measurable criteria that you use to determine if the product is good or not. Then you create an architecture (<a href="CategoryArchitecture.html">CategoryArchitecture</a>) defining the components of the product, the services they provide, and those services' interfaces. Once you have an architecture you then need a design (<a href="CategoryDesign.html">CategoryDesign</a>) that separates the duties of components into hardware, software, electromechanicals, myth, legend, and vapor. Finally, after all that stuff, you get to the implementation (<a href="ImplementationDefined.html">ImplementationDefined</a>). Then you can talk about code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Extreme Programming is the shortcut to all this stuff that goes directly from a client's babblings to "working" code. If you are building a product where this is possible then gofer it. For most of the world, however, you need some process in place to avoid moving goal posts in terms of product performance.
