        Inline Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        When a layer of functional call indirection no longer serves a communication or factoring purpose, remove it by textually substituting the body of the function at the call sites. The inverse of <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a>, and by far the less common of 
        the two.

        <em>Given that most languages will do this as an optimization, or can be told to do this (the inline keyword in C/C++), this should be </em>'very rare<strong>.  I would only recommend </strong><a href="InlineMethod.html">InlineMethod</a> in two cases:<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Profiling tells you that the function call is a performance bottleneck, and other ways to encourage the compiler to inline the call are not working</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The number of arguments to the function are huge and it is only called from one place--in other words, the function is </em>'tightly<em>' coupled to its caller and manual inlining actually makes the code more readable, not less</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Both of these are quite rare, in my experience.</em>
      </p>

        Also an optimisation performed by some compilers, whereby a method call is replaced by the actual code of the method being called.  More usually referred to as <a href="MethodInlining.html">MethodInlining</a>.
