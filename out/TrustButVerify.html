        Trust But Verify
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> has already a good reference to further details on the concept of <a href="TrustButVerify.html">TrustButVerify</a>. My view is we need lots more verification for the same level of trust we grant people we interact with, compared to just a few decades ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        And on this open wiki, where an excellent analogy of a bar was made, more verification is needed due to the combination of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a state of flux (and therefore an unstable set of <a href="WikiSocialNorms.html">WikiSocialNorms</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           lots of people operate behind <a href="IpUsername.html">IpUsername</a> masks, even long-term participants and regulars who sometimes do identify themselves
        </li>
        <li>
           there have not been effective mechanisms to stamp out trolls, or other people who do not respect <a href="NonviolentCommunication.html">NonviolentCommunication</a>.

        While maintaining respect for the <a href="RealNamesOnlyOrAnonymous.html">RealNamesOnlyOrAnonymous</a> viewpoint (more so as <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> preferred it this way), I hate to say that <a href="NeKs.html">NeKs</a> made some valid points and we need to <a href="MakeRoomForAllViewpoints.html">MakeRoomForAllViewpoints</a>.

        One of the issues with <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>s is that <a href="TrustButVerify.html">TrustButVerify</a> tests have shown people who consistently use <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a> suffer more from <a href="WikiNoisePollution.html">WikiNoisePollution</a>.

           Another way, make it known that you reserve the right to change your mind. People go through different stages of life, and different circumstances call for different responses.

        I have recently seen the movie ShatteredGlass which is a docudrama that told the story of a real life journalist for a reputable magazine who had a short period of fame through getting a series of sensational but fabricated stories published there. Subsequently a <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> led to this link for people who is interested <a href="WhatHappened.html">WhatHappened</a> to this individual, date in URL. ef <a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/perspective/bal-pe.journalism05jun05,1,5612367.story?coll=bal-perspective-headlines">http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/opinion/perspective/bal-pe.journalism05jun05,1,5612367.story?coll=bal-perspective-headlines</a> [dead link 7/11/2005]

           The main character in the film actually wrote a book called TheFabulist and could have even profited from it. See how (some of) the media see things at <a href="http://www.cheatingculture.com/stephenglass.htm">http://www.cheatingculture.com/stephenglass.htm</a>

           StephenGlass is not the only reporter who became a celebrity for his creativity, see the story of another at <a href="http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/11/DDG4SD61TU1.DTL">http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/06/11/DDG4SD61TU1.DTL</a>
