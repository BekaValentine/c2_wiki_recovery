        This function does exactly what <em>ff-find-other-file</em> does, and less. I did not know about ff-find-other-file when I wrote and posted this code. I wish I could delete this page, but PagePruning seems to say I'm stuck with it. Oh, well. This page can serve as a reminder to look *really* hard in emacs before you implement a new function. Odds are it's already there. -<a href="ScottDe.html">ScottDe</a>

        <dd><em>Ha!  I wrote that a version of that function too.  I didn't know about ff-find-other-file.  BTW, my version of emacs (XEmacs 20.4) doesn't seem to have ff-find-other-file.  Is it part of a particular package?</em> -- <a href="JimWeirich.html">JimWeirich</a></dd>

        Don't worry about it, the same is true for just about any emacs feature. I once wrote a CORBA ORB in emacs lisp, and was shocked to find a few days later that there was already a (much) better one around. -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>

        Here is some elisp to switch between twins [.h and .cpp files for the same class]. The entry point is "load-twin". It works if the files are stored in the same directory or if you have parallel "src" and "include" directories for
        your files.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not really a lisp person, hope this code isn't too ugly. If you
        try it and it doesn't work, let me know, I may have forgotten to
        include a helper function (I extracted this code from a couple of .el
        files I wrote, hopefully I got it all). You need to get the <a href="AnaphoricLispMacros.html">AnaphoricLispMacros</a> before this code will work.
