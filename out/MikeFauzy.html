        I have been a Java developer since my internship 1997. I have held a variety of roles including developer, lead, architect and mentor. My skills have shifted to Information Security, but I've kept my hand in Java web and Android development. Roles have included Security Testing Lead for a major health maintenance organization (HMO) and Information Security Architect for a major bank. I am currently with Aspect Security.
