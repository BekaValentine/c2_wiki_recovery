        I've always liked the 'making sausage' metaphors better than those scatalogical, because
        most sausage is actually pretty tasty despite what goes into it. Butt here goes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When you gotta do it, you gotta do it
        </li>
        <li>
           It stinks while you're doing it  <em>Sometimes it even hurts while you're doing it...</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           It stinks after you've done it
        </li>
        <li>
           You feel better when it's done
        </li>
        <li>
           Nobody, not even your aunty, wants to touch or see or even know what you've done
        </li>
        <li>
           Even after you flush it continues to cause a stink somewhere else
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm sorry, but I keyed off one word in the title, and this is what came out.
        (Don't recurse too deeply on that.)
