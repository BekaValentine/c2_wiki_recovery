        Game Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        Designing a game is, in essence, creating a system in which one or more players interact with the system by making interesting choices which influence the system - resulting in success or failure.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This holds true whether the game is an economic <em>game</em> (more like a ThoughtExperiment), a board game (Monopoly), a card game (Bridge), or a <a href="ComputerGame.html">ComputerGame</a> (The Sims).  The format of the game influences the definition of <em>interact</em> and set limits on the scope of the system.
