        <strong>Why I'm Here</strong> (on Wiki, not the planet)
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm here thanks to <a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a>' <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/">http://www.extremeprogramming.org/</a>
        So for the same reasons I was there, I'm here.  For <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.

        <strong>What I Do for a Living</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I wanted to start this area with a paraphase of Doctor 'Bones' <a href="McCoy.html">McCoy</a>, along the lines of 'Dammit Jim! I'm a doctor not a programmer!'  But I'm not a doctor, I'm a process engineer. I'm also a bonefide SEI-Authorized CMMI appraiser and Instructor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in helping companies implement process discipline without sacrificing their ability to develop/produce their product/service speedily or creatively.
      </p>
      <p>
        I especially concentrate on creating processes that balance the business' objectives with the role/use of technology and their people, organization and resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where does </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> come in?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote an article (still in work for publication) about the whole process discipline idea in agile development environments.  I used <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> as the agile development environment and CMM (<a href="CapabilityMaturityModel.html">CapabilityMaturityModel</a>) as the process discipline framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> has written <a href="XpAndTheCmm.html">XpAndTheCmm</a> (actually located at <a href="http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/xp_and_cmm.htm).">http://www.xprogramming.com/xpmag/xp_and_cmm.htm).</a>  But my article (written before I read Ron's article) is from the specific CMM KPA perspective, and not the XP or the programmer's perspective.  It's all about process and not about achieving any particular levels.  A draft of the article is located in the pvXP area of my company's site (see below).

        <strong>Personal Crusades</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        o Spreading the word that Agile development methods and CMMI can co-exist within the same organization on the same projects.  <a href="AgileCmmi.html">AgileCmmi</a> is possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        o Dispelling as much of the bad PR and dis-information as I can about CMMI and explaining <a href="WhatIsCmmi.html">WhatIsCmmi</a> to the best of my ability.
      </p>
      <p>
        o I'm also on a personal crusade in the software development world to clarify that <a href="QaIsNotQc.html">QaIsNotQc</a>.
