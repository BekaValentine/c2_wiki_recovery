        The <a href="VademClio.html">VademClio</a> (aka Sharp Tri Pad) is a three-pound pen-based Windows CE (<a href="WinCe.html">WinCe</a>/<a href="PocketPc.html">PocketPc</a>) computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm wondering whether anyone has been working with Squeak on it.
        (I'm aware that there are Windows CE (<a href="WinCe.html">WinCe</a>) versions of Squeak, though I haven't read much about what folks are doing with it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        With its pen-based screen, seems to me it's got a lot of potential.
        If I get any free time I'll try it ... has anyone else started already?
