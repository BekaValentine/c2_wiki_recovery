        Forget To Close The File
      </h1>
      <p>
        In code that looks like
      </p>
      <code>
        open a file<br/>
        process the file<br/>
        close the file<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I often forget to close the file. I guess I just get so excited about what's in the middle.
      </p>
      <p>
        In VW Smalltalk, I discipline myself to use #valueNowOrOnUnwindDo: whenever I use files. So now I make the mistake only when I'm hacking.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Smalltalk/V, I had a method on String and Filename that accepted a block, passed the open file into it, and closed the file outside. Something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        'input.txt' processFile: [ :f | self processInput: f]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In C, I used a keyboard macro that generated the open and the close at the same time, and edited the middle. Disciplined myself to use it. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> <a href="ItsNotAboutDiscipline.html">ItsNotAboutDiscipline</a>.

        That looks just like the <strong>with-open-file</strong> and related macros of Common Lisp. -- <a href="JohnDouglasPorter.html">JohnDouglasPorter</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, File#open can be called with a block, in which case it does the same thing.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Yes; and it's not just files, it's graphic contexts, bitmaps and other GUI stuff; any resource which the O/S has an interest in.
      </p>
      <p>
        In C++, the <a href="ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization.html">ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization</a> idiom puts the close into the file's destructor, so it gets called as the stack unwinds. This is similar to the idioms you suggest. My impression is Java programmers have a lot of problems with this kind of thing. People are surprised that they can get resource leaks despite having garbage collection.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have finalization, it can be worth sticking assert(!isOpen()) in the File one to catch the mistake. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have finalization, why would it not be preferable to simply have the file close automagically?
      </p>
      <p>
        Because finalization is not guaranteed to happen, and if it happens, there is no guarantee as to <em>when</em> it happens.
      </p>

        In C# there is a "using" block for similar functionality - if you call the constructor for a class in the block opening, its IDisposable.Dispose() is implicitly called at the end of the block. Unfortunately, not supported in other <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> languages like <a href="VisualBasicDotNet.html">VisualBasicDotNet</a>. However, now that C# and VB have better support for closure-like functionality with implicit delegates and anonymous methods, one could do it in the more functional approach.

        <em>This is one of the big advantages of using IO::File (in </em><a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>) rather than the old-fashioned TypeGlob-as-FileHandle. IO::File objects auto-close when they go bye-bye. -- <a href="JohnDouglasPorter.html">JohnDouglasPorter</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Just to clarify: this is the behaviour as soon as you declare a lexical scalar for the file handle (as opposed to the typeglob), you don't have to use IO::File explicitly.
      </p>
      <code>
        open(my $fh, "<", $file) or die;<br/>
      </code>

        On a related note:
      </p>
      <p>
        As stated above, in C++, with <a href="ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization.html">ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization</a>, the file will close as part of a destructor. If the file is open for writing, the close will flush. If you don't flush first manually, errors can occur during close (like ENOSPC:"out of disk space", etc.) and you will never know it - Destructors don't throw. Therefore, you should flush before close.

        If it is likely to be a small file, then perhaps read the result into memory in a small block and then process it. <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it is a large file, then perhaps consider random-access, as-needed reads within a tight open-close block. In other words, treat it more like a database. This works best in situations where the processing or wait-time between reads is long.

        I recently forgot to do this in some of my <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> code... mainly because I thought the GC would do it for me. Apparently not, even though it seems it would be nigh-trivial:
      </p>
      <code>
        let new_open_in x =<br/>
        let fd = open_in x in<br/>
        Gc.finalize close_in fd;<br/>
        fd<br/>
        ;;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Anyone know why this might be?
