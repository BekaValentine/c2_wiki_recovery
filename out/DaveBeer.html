        I've totally fallen in love with this Wiki idea. But I am not having any luck introducing it to my workplace. (I like the idea of everyone being able to edit content... it's not as if there isn't a good enough AuditTrail either!)

        <strong>Update</strong> - Well, after a little effort, I managed to get a nice Wiki installed at work. (I work for a large food/beverage company who all almost exclusively Pro-<a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>.) Linux wasn't an option (against corporate policy), so I opted for <a href="FlexWiki.html">FlexWiki</a>. So far only my team (Web Application Development) and the Security Team use it in anger. <em>(Instead of "anger", did you mean "earnest"?)</em> <em>(No, I meant "anger". It's a nice turn of phrase which means 'to use for real' -- </em><a href="DaveBeer.html">DaveBeer</a><em>) But it beats the pants off our CMS tool when it comes to pure simplicity (you can imagine which vendor we purchased our CMS from).</em>
