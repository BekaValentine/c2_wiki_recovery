        <a href="SoapToolkit.html">SoapToolkit</a> is a series of interim <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> offering, free from <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a>, to entice larger companies to embrace a web centric computing paradigm.

        That was before the days of grave concern over security over internet. Currently I have seen an article where it was said Microsoft itself gets 6 million spams, out of 7 million email traffic.

        <a href="SoapToolkit.html">SoapToolkit</a> expiry date of end June2004 has been extended to April 2005.

           "SOAP Toolkit support will be retired in April 2005." from MS download webpage checked on 6 Apr05. Is it for real soon?

           Anyone can tell me merits "document mode" vs "RPC mode" of <a href="SoapToolkit.html">SoapToolkit</a>? (<a href="http://sys-con.com/story/?storyid=48934&DE=1">http://sys-con.com/story/?storyid=48934&DE=1</a> ) <- A <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> article drew my attention to the "modes" of toolkit based webservices-- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           A colleague of mine said there were <em>problems in a </em><a href="WebService.html">WebService</a> using <a href="SoapToolkit.html">SoapToolkit</a> to get more than 1 datatype at once<em>, and that webservice would probably be orchestrated thru a </em><a href="WebMethods.html">WebMethods</a> integrator intermediary. Any comments on what seems to be an unlikely restriction? BTW the server is a stored proc in <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> <a href="DbTwo.html">DbTwo</a>, whereas the client is a <a href="ActiveServerPages.html">ActiveServerPages</a> (ASP) based <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>.

        As expected, Microsoft is not helping people who are still using the <a href="SoapToolkit.html">SoapToolkit</a> as it does not help the adoption of <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> platform. See for example
