        From LongWalkToFreedom, the autobiography of NelsonMandela: (ch1)
      </p>
      <p>
        "At first, I was astonished by the vehemence -- and candour -- with
        which people criticised the regent.  He was not above criticism -- in
        fact, he was often the principal target of it.  But no matter how
        serious the charge, the regent simply listened, not defending himself,
        showing no emotion at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meetings would continue until some kind of consensus was reached.
        They ended in unanimity or not at all.  Unanimity, however, might be
        an agreement to disagree, to wait for a more propitious time to
        propose a solution.  Democracy meant all men were to be heard, and a
        decision was taken together as a people.  Majority rule was a foreign
        notion.  A minority was not to be crushed by a majority.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only at the end of the meeting, when the sun was setting, would the
        regent speak.  His purpose was to sum up what had been said and form
        some consensus among the diverse opinions.  But no conclusions were
        forced on people who disagreed.  If no agreement could be reached,
        another meeting would be held.  At the very end of the council, a
        praise-singer or poet would deliver a panegyric to the ancient kings,
        and a mixture of compliments to and satire on the present chiefs; the
        audience, led by the regent, would roar with laughter.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a leader, I have always followed the principles I first saw
        demonstrated by the regent at the Great Palace.  I have always
        endeavoured to listen to what each and every person in a discussion
        had to say before venturing my own opinion.  Oftentimes, my own
        opinion will simply represent a consensus of what I heard in the
        discussion.  I always remember the regent's axiom: a leader, he said,
        is like a shepherd.  He stays behind the flock, letting the most nimble
        go on ahead, whereupon the others follow, not realizing that all along
        they are being directed from behind."
