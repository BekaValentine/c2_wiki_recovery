        Technical Lead

        A less pretentious term than <a href="ChiefArchitect.html">ChiefArchitect</a>. Or a more politically correct term than <strong>system architect</strong> - one that allows the role of architect to be carried out without ruffling so many feathers.

        Being a technical lead requires balancing technical and leadership talents. A technical lead has to more than a good programmer. A real desire of working with people is needed. A very good checklist for what it means to be a good technical lead can be read here: <a href="http://littletutorials.com/2008/07/07/success-as-technical-lead/">http://littletutorials.com/2008/07/07/success-as-technical-lead/</a>

        Our <a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a> doesn't do any designing, architecting, or even much coding. For that matter, most <a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a>s I've met here don't either.

        Ours spends his time fiddling with requirements, GUI designs, meetings fighting with people over requirements, conducting interviews, talking with his boss about nothing useful, fiddling with new software that has nothing to do with ours, or looking at Yahoo! Finance.

        I made him inspect some code a little while ago (I'm going with inspections because <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> seems impossible here.. I know it's not a direct substitute, but it's the best I can do right now) which seems to have prompted him to take a Java Applications class.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm usually the one that processes requirements into stories, designs, schedules + assignments, or better code! or best.. rejection! I love rejecting requirements... especially when I've got a good reason. (<a href="TerminationCanBeSuccess.html">TerminationCanBeSuccess</a>)

        I'm beginning to think that repeated visits to Yahoo! Finance during work hours is an <a href="AlarmBellBehavior.html">AlarmBellBehavior</a> for programmers (kind of like an <a href="AlarmBellPhrase.html">AlarmBellPhrase</a> for employers).

        On the other hand, I know of "System Architects" in this company that do designs. Sadly, leads here seem to be working towards MBAs (away from code).

        Yeah, to me this sounds more like either a <a href="ProductManager.html">ProductManager</a>, DevelopmentManager or <a href="TeamLead.html">TeamLead</a>. Not that all of these roles couldn't be done well, but its pretty nasty to have <a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a>s and <a href="SystemArchitect.html">SystemArchitect</a>s that do no design!!! -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        <em>Well, it's not like that here at </em><a href="NuMega.html">NuMega</a>. Our <a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a>s do 100% programming in addition to architectural design. In fact, they are totally responsible for a technical part of a system like the Java part or the Web Scripting part. They are a chief technical resource that people consult on their areas of expertise. Our DevelopmentLeads do the managerial stuff.<em></em>

        I've been calling myself "<a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a>" for a while now. When I say it, I mean that I start programming in a better way, and people tend to see that it is working and find themselves drawn into working the same way. Then I start looking for the next better thing to do. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I frequently tell my manager, nobody listens to me. They just <a href="DoAsiDo.html">DoAsiDo</a>. When it is good, usually. On rare occasions they <a href="DoAsiDo.html">DoAsiDo</a> in negative ways. This has taught me a lot about what it means to be a <a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a>. Sometimes, the most important part of the job title is simply recognizing that people will propagate your behavior if they respect you, so you should make your behavior the way you want other people to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another important note: By being a technical lead in this way, and talking to people about it, I have helped other people on the team start moving toward being leads themselves. You can't necessarily teach leadership, but sometimes you can lead the way there!

        I really don't mind <a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a> at all though I do think it is one of those politically correct terms so people don't get upset about someone being called the architect. After all, if you did create or even facilitate the primary architecture of a system why <em>shouldn't</em> you be called the System Architect? In any case, I <em>do</em> think there is a substantial difference between <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> (or <em>Team</em> Lead) and the Architect (or <a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a>). For example, I don't think an architect <em>has</em> to be a good manager or that a manager <em>needs</em> to be a good architect. Many successful projects have a project manager that is distinct from the lead designer. So, with those caveats in mind, I think <a href="TechnicalLead.html">TechnicalLead</a> is a fine term. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        <strong>Original:</strong> All the senior levels like Technical Leads, project managers, project lead, Project coordinators, Project lead's, Archtect... etc., should be given and defined correct <em>roles</em> and <em>responsibilities</em>. Then they may start working with the team. Otherwise, they may think that being and conversing with other senior people is their job, trying to convince their seniors that their work is important. Other than that, they should be made to convince their subordinates. Then, all problems will be solved.

        <strong>Proposed:</strong> All the senior levels like Technical Leads, project managers, project lead, Project coordinators, Project lead's, Archtect... etc., should be given and defined correct <em>roles</em> and <em>responsibilities</em> which must incorporate the notion of <strong>lead</strong>. The work is with the team, not being and conversing with other senior people, trying to convince them seniors that their work is important (see <a href="ImpressionManagement.html">ImpressionManagement</a>). They should concentrate on convincing their subordinates that they are leaders. Then, all problems will be solved.
