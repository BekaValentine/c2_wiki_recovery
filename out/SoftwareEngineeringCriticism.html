        Software Engineering Criticism
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have seen much criticism on <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> recently (<a href="MayZeroFive.html">MayZeroFive</a>), which I want to group here:

      </ul>
      <p>
        I have seen much BullShit with false pretension of criticism in <a href="MayZeroFive.html">MayZeroFive</a>; do you want to consolidate it for posterity? -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        What do you expect? Letting it lie as unrefactored <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> and clutter the <a href="WikiSpace.html">WikiSpace</a>? I'd rather document what is there and belongs together as long as that it clear. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a>

        Well, you could refactor something else instead or you could contribute some real content, but of course, it's your privilege to decide how you choose to waste your time. -- Costin

        Doing some less liked cleanup work for the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> is part of the professional responsibility of a <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>, don't you think? But of course, it's your privilege to let some corners of this wiki become a WikiSlum, where WikiTrolls live in a <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>. -- .gz

           Costin - highlighting things like this and drawing them together for comparison is an important part of recognising the wheat from the chaff and starting the editing and refactoring process. Please <a href="StopHarassingTheGnomes.html">StopHarassingTheGnomes</a>, the time is not wasted.
