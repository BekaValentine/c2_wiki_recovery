        Parallel Lines Postulate
      </h1>
      <p>
        Also known as Euclid's Fifth Postulate.
      </p>
      <p>
        The oddest of the axioms proposed by <a href="EuclidOfAlexandria.html">EuclidOfAlexandria</a>'s <em>Elements</em> for describing the plane. There are many equivalent formulations of it (equivalent, that is, given the other axioms). The usual one, which wasn't actually the original, is:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Given any line, and any point not on the line, there's another line on which the point </em>does<em> lie and which doesn't meet the given line at all; furthermore, there is only one such line.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        For quite some time, many mathematicians (including Euclid, who added it as a postulate after being unable to prove it) thought that the <a href="ParallelLinesPostulate.html">ParallelLinesPostulate</a> was derivable from the other axioms (in that it should be a <em>theorem</em>), and looked for proof.  Others insisted it was indeed a fundamental axiom.  What actually occurred caused a scandal in the mathematical community; it was shown that consistent geometries could be constructed by <em>altering</em> the parallel lines postulate.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, it's an axiom but not a required one for a consistent system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Altering the <a href="ParallelLinesPostulate.html">ParallelLinesPostulate</a> leads to the various <a href="NonEuclidean.html">NonEuclidean</a>
        geometries, including, but not limited to, elliptic geometry and hyperbolic geometry.
        AnalyticGeometry in two dimensions exhibits this postulate as a consequence of the definition of parallelism as having the same slope (including infinity as a slope).
