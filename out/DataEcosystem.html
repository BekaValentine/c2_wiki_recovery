        Data Ecosystem
      </h1>
      <p>
        The idea of a data ecosystem is an extension of the <a href="WikiPhilosophy.html">WikiPhilosophy</a> across the whole of the Internet to a theoretical ideal to include all the web and its interactions. It is composed of <strong>data</strong> and the <strong>objects</strong>, which encode, programmatically, the functionality for <em>interaction</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among those who work with social data, two main axes have emerged: "most recent" and "most popular".
      </p>
      <p>
        As many community-driven sites have found out, these two cannot be combined after scaling beyond approximately a few dozen items without <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to solve this problem is to from a <a href="CrowdSource.html">CrowdSource</a>d with both <a href="PerItemVoting.html">PerItemVoting</a> and <a href="UserRanking.html">UserRanking</a>. Most sites implement the former, but not the latter. Another way is with an <a href="AttentionManagementSystem.html">AttentionManagementSystem</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there isn't a way to combine a 2-dimensional <a href="VotingModel.html">VotingModel</a> on a single page, our vast, interactive knowledge repository would require a <a href="ThreeDimensionalVisualizationModel.html">ThreeDimensionalVisualizationModel</a>. Throw away the tired desktop metaphor for interacting with your data. When <a href="AllDataRelatesToOtherData.html">AllDataRelatesToOtherData</a>, we can build a better, <a href="KillerUserInterface.html">KillerUserInterface</a>. Under the post-Internet model of <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>'s, <strong><em>data rules over applications</em></strong>. This upturns the traditional monolithic <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> stack.

        <a href="FairCredit.html">FairCredit</a>: The term "data ecosystem" was copied from an IEEE member who coined the term, as far as I can tell. <find citation>.

        <em>Google reports: About 91,900,000 results (0.34 seconds) for a search on </em>data ecosystem<em> and there seem to be a number of commercial organisations using the phrase. It looks like a crowded field.</em>

           Thanks, "data" and "ecosystem" are common terms, so you have to use quotes. My search yielded 141k results. I added IEEE, but no luck.
