        Cost Of Learning
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some language and tool cultures have a very high <a href="CostOfLearning.html">CostOfLearning</a>. Oracle, Java, C++, Vim, and anything for which there is a certificate beginning with the letters MS come to mind. Others have a lower <a href="CostOfLearning.html">CostOfLearning</a> - present winner is probably Ruby.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CostOfLearning.html">CostOfLearning</a> is related to whether the culture is <a href="ExtremelyInterstrangled.html">ExtremelyInterstrangled</a> and consequently whether its underlying language(s) have much <a href="SymmetryOfLanguage.html">SymmetryOfLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What other factors are involved?
