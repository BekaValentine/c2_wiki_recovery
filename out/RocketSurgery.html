        Rocket Surgery
      </h1>
      <p>
        The term <a href="RocketSurgery.html">RocketSurgery</a> is used to mean a difficult task. It is an amalgamation of the terms "rocket science" and "brain surgery".
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase "It's not rocket surgery" therefore indicates an easy task.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amusingly, in one of the <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> movies, Spock (Rocket Scientist) and <a href="McCoy.html">McCoy</a> (Brain Surgeon, at least with some assistance) performed rocket surgery.  Between the two of them, they installed a new sensor (that sniffed out exhaust from a cloaked ship or something like that) into a torpedo as it was going down into its tube.
