        Smug Cee Plus Plus Weenie
      </h1>
      <p>
        The language <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> seems to have replaced Ada as the language that the programming cognoscenti just <em>love</em> to hate.  The hacker and cowboy crowd (see <a href="SmugCeeWeenie.html">SmugCeeWeenie</a>) thinks it's a fat bloated pig; the high-level language community point out its numerous low-level and unsafe traits.  Even <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> fans (the language that is Most Likely To Replace C++ As The Most Hated Language) love to dump on C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there is rare (if not endangered) species out there, which is hard to find but beautiful to behold--the <a href="SmugCeePlusPlusWeenie.html">SmugCeePlusPlusWeenie</a>.  These are the guys that think C++, due to its wealth of features and its unrestricted access to the hardware, remains the epitome of programming languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        How to spot one:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Preaches the virtue of <a href="MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage.html">MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage</a>s.  However, if you utter the words "O'Caml" or "<a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>" in his presence, he pretends not to hear you.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Either that, or he thinks that Common Lisp is a silly-ass academic language that was written back in the 50's, and O'Caml is an Irish dromedary.  <em>And Oz is that place full of wizards and munchkins and yellow brick roads.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Considers the language runtime to be a post-processor for the template mechanism.  Engages in <a href="TemplateMetaprogramming.html">TemplateMetaprogramming</a> tricks that will make your head spin (and that of <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a> as well).  
          <ul>
            <li>
               Thinks that C++ should deprecate the >> operator, because he's tired of having to put spaces between closing > braces in his template code.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   And wishes he could overload the <strong><></strong> braces in templates.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       Probably unlikely.  But <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a> considered allowing the overloading of operator <strong>.</strong>.  Now <strong>that</strong> would be cool, and enable all sorts of fun <a href="ThreeStarProgramming.html">ThreeStarProgramming</a>.  (See <a href="TheDesignAndEvolutionOfCpp.html">TheDesignAndEvolutionOfCpp</a>).
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Thinks the C++ "extreme templating" example of <a href="NinetyNineBottlesOfBeerOnTheWall.html">NinetyNineBottlesOfBeerOnTheWall</a> is an example of how <em>all</em> programs should be written. Simply using a loop to count down from <em>n</em> to 1 is so...banal.  The template version will eliminate the inefficiency of looping.  :) Why waste precious CPU cycles on branch statements and other pipeline-stalling extravagance, when via the magic of templates you can unroll your loop at compile-time and eliminate this onerous overhead.  The fact that program size is now O(<em>n</em>) in the number of beer-bottles is irrelevant (as is the fact that the loop body is doing I/O, so the alledged "overhead" of the looping instructions is <em>de minimis</em>).  The instruction cache be damned, obviously.
            </li>
            <li>
               Makes <em>every</em> function a template (except for virtual ones, which can't be...)
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Can decipher the hieroglyphic error messages the compiler emits when he makes an error doing this sort of thing.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Thinks the only useful <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a> is the one that empties his trash can every Thursday morning (the 30-gallon can he puts out on the curb, not the icon on a Macintosh).
          <ul>
            <li>
               However, is fond to point out that alone among HLLs, C++ is suitable for <em>implementing</em> a <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a> (and other systems programming tasks) by way of reference counting pointers, implemented of course by overloading almost all operators (see below).
            </li>
            <li>
               Has his own reference-counting <a href="SmartPointer.html">SmartPointer</a> class anyway.
            </li>
            <li>
               Believes that any template type name more than one character long is a sign of poor style and mental weakness (has similar beliefs about class and member names) 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Speaking of Macs, thinks that <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a> ought to get with the program and quit peddling this <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> nonsense.
        </li>
        <li>
           Even if he hates Microsoft, thanks <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a> on a regular basis for making C++ the preferred language for Windows systems programming (thus ensuring that C++ will be in industry for a long time).
        </li>
        <li>
           Doesn't understand what's the big deal about <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>.  Reasons that if he wants to do sloppy things like <em>that</em>, he can  roll his own framework for that sort of thing.  (See GreenspunsTenthLawAtWork).
        </li>
        <li>
           Thinks that overloading "operator ," is a neat trick.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Especially when the same class overloads the operators <strong>()</strong>, <strong>[]</strong>, unary <strong>&</strong>, etc, preferably to do amusingly non-traditional things like delete files. A class that doesn't overload <strong>all</strong> operators just isn't finished yet.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Thinks that it is silly that you can't overload operators on intrinsic types.  
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Agrees with the <a href="SmugCeeWeenie.html">SmugCeeWeenie</a> on the subject of things like <a href="PointerArithmetic.html">PointerArithmetic</a> and such.
        </li>
        <li>
           Agrees with the <a href="SmugCeeWeenie.html">SmugCeeWeenie</a> on the issue of speed (and bitches that most C++ compilers won't stick small objects in registers).  Disagrees with the <a href="SmugCeeWeenie.html">SmugCeeWeenie</a> on the subject of program <em>size</em>; whereas the <a href="SmugCeeWeenie.html">SmugCeeWeenie</a> likes programs that are both fast and concise, the <a href="SmugCeePlusPlusWeenie.html">SmugCeePlusPlusWeenie</a> prefers to throw code size to the wind in order to squeeze out that last cycle of performance.  The differing attitude of the two groups of weenies on templates is an indicator of this underlying philosophical difference.
        </li>
      </ul>
