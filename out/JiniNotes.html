        Jini Notes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Keywords to identify jini. Jini uses <em>well-known</em> interfaces to provide <em>plumbing</em> for jini services for <em>spontaneous networking</em> between devices and applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jini services use a discovery protocol to form into <em>communities</em>. Jini communities are <em>fault-tolerant</em> and <em>self-healing</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>original author's opinion</em>: Jini will emerge to dominate the <a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a> future internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wish it would. I've had <a href="JiniTechnology.html">JiniTechnology</a> on my list of Neat Things for several years now. I even proposed it as a solution to a project that never took off, but wanted self-healing, fault tolerant distributed services. But it's taking a little too long to make the move from "good idea" to "practical application". If I could find a Jini-enabled stereo, or even toaster, I'd be willing to buy it just for the HackValue. -- <a href="CharlesMiller.html">CharlesMiller</a>
