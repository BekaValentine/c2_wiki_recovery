        Introducing Index Cards
      </h1>
      <p>
        Managers and most other people in business are pretty well accustomed to attending training sessions where they are asked to do strange things--fall on the ground, walk around in circles, etc. They are willing to do those things because they believe they will learn something in the process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where there is resistance, or I strongly suspect it will be there, I teach people to use index cards as a planning exercise and as a metaphor for planning. I tell them, "You may not be able to do this for your real projects, but let's investigate the benefits that would accrue if you <em>could</em> do it."  They are generally willing to stretch the exercise to larger and larger (imaginary) projects, just to see what happens--a very <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>ish thing indeed. At the end, some of them will use index cards directly on real projects--usually the smaller ones that don't involve getting anyone else's approval.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the other people and projects, index cards become a metaphor for a better way of doing things. By setting up the index card as a sort of ideal that cannot be reached--at least not in the cave of their current environment--they have a simple way to seek out improvements within their current planning approach. For example, from the cards they may learn to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be brief 
        </li>
        <li>
           Identify clear tests for knowing when something is done 
        </li>
        <li>
           Leave details for discussion later and to make sure the discussion happens 
        </li>
        <li>
           Create, change, or delete only one requirement at a time
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The last seems to be particularly useful. So many non-agile companies construct baroque review processes that call for practically everyone to review practically everything in a requirements document whenever any single thing changes. For them, short of going to XP, learning how to look at one story at a time is one of the biggest improvements they can make.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cards as a metaphor is not nearly as good as real cards, so I don't do it if there is actually a chance of using cards themselves. But it's still a useful approach and a sneaky way to talk about something that might otherwise get shut down.  It can even lead to doing the real thing once people start thinking about it.
