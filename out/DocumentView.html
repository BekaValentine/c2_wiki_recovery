        Stingray software has a good white paper on the relationship between MVC and Document/View (at least the MFC version). The original link disappeared after Stingray was purchased by <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a>. The closest approximation that I could find is <a href="http://www.roguewave.com/products/whitepapers/mvcwp_wl.cfm.">http://www.roguewave.com/products/whitepapers/mvcwp_wl.cfm.</a> (Use caution, it has locked up my browser every time so far.)
