        Cyber Fundamentalism
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Fundamentalist has all the answers.  Whether by sacred text, or common tradition, each avows an indubitable law, and whosoever shall blaspheme the one true doctrine is not only immoral, but criminal, disloyal, ... and a threat to the true and proper way of life.

        So chill, <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a>.  <a href="TheyreJustRules.html">TheyreJustRules</a>.  LearnToQuestion.  There are many, many things that we do not yet understand about computation, mathematics, or psychology.  It is arrogant to assume that you know any, let alone all, of the answers.
