        Configurable Modularity
      </h1>
      <p>
        Term coined by Raoul de Campo of <a href="IbmThomasJayWatsonResearchCenter.html">IbmThomasJayWatsonResearchCenter</a>, and developed by <a href="NateEdwards.html">NateEdwards</a> of the same institution, to denote the characteristic of being able to (re)combine things without modifying their internals.

        He pointed out that this is a characteristic of most systems that can be said to be "engineered" - if you think about it, this actually covers most manufactured things in the real world!

        <em>It wasn't always that way.  Before </em>EliWhitney (1798) manufactured goods were custom made and couldn't be reconfigured without modification.  It wasn't until the end of 19th century that interchangeable parts became common.  It requires a high level of precision to produce modules that can be reconfigured in this way.<em></em>

        True: <a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a>, also, stresses the importance of EliWhitney - maybe you <em>are</em> <a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a>!  We definitely have to encourage the same revolution in software!
