        Great Place To Work Institute
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute.html">GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute</a>, if you ask them to, they will analyze the conditions in your company and tell you if it is, or it is not, a great place to work.  According to them, a <a href="GreatPlaceToWork.html">GreatPlaceToWork</a> is a place in which you "trust the people you work for, have pride in what you do, and enjoy the people you work with."

      <p>
        Companies are selected for "Best Companies", listed primarily on the basis of their employees' responses, in the <a href="GreatPlaceToWorkTrustIndex.html">GreatPlaceToWorkTrustIndex</a>, using a proprietary employee survey developed by the <a href="GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute.html">GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute</a>.

        I have seen many companies showing with pride that they were given a good grade in the studies this institute provides, but I wonder what do enterprises that get a really bad grade think about the institute...?
      </p>
      <p>
        I also find it strange that I have been unable to find a single place where someone disagrees with what the <a href="GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute.html">GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute</a> thinks about a particular enterprise...  Why would that be (maybe it is not that popular)?
      </p>
      <p>
        And finally, I wonder, is the <a href="GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute.html">GreatPlaceToWorkInstitute</a> a <a href="GreatPlaceToWork.html">GreatPlaceToWork</a>?  And, how can they determine that objectively...?  Can it even be determined objectively?  Maybe the people that work in a particular place think it is great just because they have not worked anywhere else...?  I wonder if they take into consideration, the experiences of workers who have worked at multiple workplaces, verses just one?
