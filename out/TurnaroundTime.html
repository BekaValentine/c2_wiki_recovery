        Turnaround Time
      </h1>
      <p>
        Turnaround time is the time from the entry of a defect into code to when it is discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not influenced by the same independent variables as defects per KLOC, and can be estimated by anytime algorithms (that progressively grow more accurate as more defects are discovered).
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems to be an interesting way of keeping track of the effectiveness of testing because:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It does not seem to blame developers as defects per KLOC does
        </li>
        <li>
           It takes into account how much time it took to find a defect
        </li>
        <li>
           It is not time-dependent
        </li>
      </ol>
