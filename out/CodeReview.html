        There have been a whole series of quite scientific experiments on Code Reviews published in the IEEE Tansactions on Software Engineering and at the International Conferences on Software Engineering.   Various researchers have tried varying the numbers of reviewers or compared virtual vs face-to-face meetings to see how to find the most defects for the least time and effort.  You can find 37 detailed refs by following my signature to my bibliographic search and looking for INSPECTION
