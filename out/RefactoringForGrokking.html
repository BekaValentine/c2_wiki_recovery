        Refactoring For Grokking
      </h1>
      <p>
        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> a lot. When going over some code I'l use RenameVariable, RenameField or <a href="RenameMethod.html">RenameMethod</a> a lot (thanks <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a>) and to a lesser extent AddMethodComment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like it as it makes it very clear which code I have seen/read before and it makes my misunderstandings very clear (for example when a variable <em>boolean back</em> that seems to echo the value of a <em>Search Backwards</em> checkbox , that I just renamed to "isSearchingBackwards" is actually used so that <em>true</em> means search forwards). Then another refactoring occurs...
      </p>
      <p>
        AddMethodComment helps me a lot keeping me from needing to hold information in my head as I find it. Also it makes the <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> that is there so much easier to see and fix afterwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        This occurs a lot to me - though I shy away from doing other refactorings for grokking, as I fear breaking things (no tests around usually...)
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the only refactorings I use for grokking I'd like to know if some of you use more or different ones. Perhaps I'm missing something?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I </em><a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a>s.  Then extract methods some more.  This really works on legacy procedural stuff.  It may be less effective on code where <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> are already the norm.<em></em>
