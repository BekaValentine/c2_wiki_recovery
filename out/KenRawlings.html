        I've been a Java guy for years now, but in my spare time lately I've been doing a lot of work with the <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> Beta2, and as much as I hate to admit it, it's pretty compelling technology. <a href="HailStorm.html">HailStorm</a> and Passport are scary, but as for the rest: if you're a programmer, spend some quality time with C# and the .NET Framework Classes (particularly System.Windows.Forms, System.XML, and System.Reflection.Emit) - you won't be sorry. And definitely check out <a href="SharpDevelop.html">SharpDevelop</a>, a GPL IDE for .NET (I just love the irony of that).

        I first heard of Wiki a few years ago on the <a href="MetaKit.html">MetaKit</a> website but didn't Get It and found the idea that someone could delete everything unsettling. Then I ran across <a href="TheWikiWay.html">TheWikiWay</a> at the local Borders the other day and decided to take another look. There's something subtly compelling about all this that's quickly grown on me. It reminds me of <a href="ManilaByDaveWiner.html">ManilaByDaveWiner</a> with everything not absolutely needed removed. Simplicity taken to the extreme. [Wow, 30 seconds after writing this, someone added <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a> to this page. I didn't even know what that is, but now I do and I'm glad they did it. Then someone came in and noticed I was doing lists wrong and fixed 'em. Cooooool.] [More coolness: typing <a href="MetaKit.html">MetaKit</a> automatically linked to the aforementioned Wiki I first heard of years ago].

        It bothered me for years that I didn't update my webpage more often. Even though I know HTML well, I just never got around to it. I kept thinking about designing some sort of XML/XSLT/Whatever engine to streamline it, but never did. Now that I'm a <a href="WikiAddict.html">WikiAddict</a>, I ended up moving my homepage to a custom <a href="QuickiWiki.html">QuickiWiki</a> and have been extremely happy with it (plus, it gives me a great sandbox to try implementing things like <a href="ModestWikiProposal.html">ModestWikiProposal</a>).

        Thanks for being here. I love <a href="SharpDevelop.html">SharpDevelop</a>! That's you? You have your work cut out here. They hate <strong>all</strong> things <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> here and especially <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>, so it doesn't matter if it's compelling technology. If it's <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> and not <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, forget it. From another <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> fan.

        <em>No, i'm just a happy user of </em><a href="SharpDevelop.html">SharpDevelop</a>, although recently I've started transitioning to VisualStudioNet. I can understand a lot of the resistance to .NET, in fact it wasn't until reading an interview with MiguelDeIcaza that I took a serious look at it myself.<em></em>
