        Committees Dont Read

        Well, if generally it is accepted that committees don't code and we have to live with that fatality, at least they ought to read, and read a lot. Guess what happens in real life ?
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is that very often standards contain design errors that ought not to have happened because the committees ought to have done a serious documentation on the subject.

        Just ask yourself what was the last standard you read that did contain a bibliography.

        One of the problems with standards is that they tend to get written with a word processor. Last year I had to design some software to check data against a standard. Rather than type the standard into a database I used the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> to parse the text and extract all the rules and conditions. Of course I found lots of logic errors in the standard that no-one seemed to have noticed. Committees not reading is a problem aggrevated by the tools they use to write. If rules were typed into a database that then generates a written document if required, it is a lot easier to check for errors. This is a good reason to <a href="AutomateProcesses.html">AutomateProcesses</a>.
