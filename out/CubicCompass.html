        One of the last remaining unregistered adjective-noun domain names remaining after the dot-com bubble. I suppose the imagery is self explanatory... it's a sort of cube thingy (much like a <a href="RubiksCube.html">RubiksCube</a> I suppose) that has a compass on each of its 6 sides... probably used by Gandalf in middle earth for navigation. ;-)

        Well, not really. Cubic Compass is a portal software company in Portland, Oregon, US that uses <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> architecture.   -- <a href="MichaelLeach.html">MichaelLeach</a>

        "One of the last remaining", indeed.  One of the last remaining sensible ones, <em>maybe</em>.  Sounds like a cool-looking gadget though.

        <em>Hmmm....  </em><a href="http://www.CubicCompass.com">http://www.CubicCompass.com</a> just rolls off the tongue, doesn't it.  I think I'll go register it.  ;-><em></em>

        Umm...folks...from where I sit, <a href="http://www.cubiccompass.com">http://www.cubiccompass.com</a> already is registered, and is an active business.  It appears to have been registered for quite some time now.
