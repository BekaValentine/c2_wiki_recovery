      <p>
        All over the world (well, except the bits of it that are truly broken and/or uninhabited), then demand for software is ever increasing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Software is an every more widespread and common component in all manner of goods, or if not in the goods themselves, in the processes that made them. Or that maintain them. Or that manage the processes that make or maintain them, or...it's a software-driven world these days. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, as a software professional, you should be happy, right? Your domain is ever expanding. As a software professional you have the opportunity now to work at your chosen profession in parts of the world that never had a need for your skills before. You have the opportunity to experience the full range of human habitat and culture while doing the work you love, if you choose to. Few other professions offer these opportunities.

        Forget about the "day", get out there and seize the <em>world</em>.
