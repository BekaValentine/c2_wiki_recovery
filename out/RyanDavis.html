        I'm a <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> and Ruby geek. I started the SeattleRubyBrigade (Seattle.rb) and continue to run it. I've got a major thing for object systems / ontologies, languages, and interpreters. I've worked at <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>, Amazon, Omni Group, and am now consulting doing ruby and rails gigs.

        I worked with <a href="CorwinLightWilliams.html">CorwinLightWilliams</a> at all three locations above. I left Amazon feeling dirty, abused, and rather stale skill-wise. I spent three months afterwards coding like mad and not really wanting to stop. It was nice, and fairly cheap really... You should try it. Good therapy. I wrote an interpreter a week for 8 weeks. It was lovely. I even wrote a lisp interpreter in pascal!

        I think <em>The School of Niklaus Wirth, The Art of Simplicity</em> (ISBN 1558607234) is one of the most inspiring books I've read in a long time. I re-read the book every summer.
