        Architectural Design Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="PatternForm.html">PatternForm</a> was invented by <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>, who is an architect (the kind who designs buildings, bridges, and the like; as opposed to a <a href="SoftwareArchitect.html">SoftwareArchitect</a> or <a href="SystemArchitect.html">SystemArchitect</a>) and professor emeritus of architecture at <a href="CalBerkeley.html">CalBerkeley</a>. The term <a href="ArchitecturalDesignPatterns.html">ArchitecturalDesignPatterns</a> is used to differentiate between Alexander's <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, and the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> in software, which are distinguished as <a href="SoftwareDesignPatterns.html">SoftwareDesignPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This </em><a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a> would be more useful if people here were actually documenting <a href="ArchitecturalDesignPatterns.html">ArchitecturalDesignPatterns</a>. Mostly, though, Wiki seems to be about software, which makes the badge seem a bit like <a href="PrematureGeneralization.html">PrematureGeneralization</a>, or maybe PrematureCategorization?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It wasn't intended as a <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a>. It's purely to justify the distinction between <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> and <a href="SoftwareDesignPatterns.html">SoftwareDesignPatterns</a>. For example, on the timeline presented on <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>, if someone wanted to cite Alexander's contribution to <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, they would put an entry for <a href="ArchitecturalDesignPatterns.html">ArchitecturalDesignPatterns</a>, to separate it from the existing entry for <a href="SoftwareDesignPatterns.html">SoftwareDesignPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is this something that is genuinely causing confusion among us here on Wiki? Are there cases where the extra verbiage is worth making the distinction so specifically?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> just calls them "patterns", not "design patterns".  So, calling them <a href="ArchitecturalDesignPatterns.html">ArchitecturalDesignPatterns</a> is a bit of a misnomer.  Perhaps they should be <a href="ArchitecturalPattern.html">ArchitecturalPattern</a>s, but software people have their own definition for that word.  Software people think patterns are like objects containing algorithms and data structures.
