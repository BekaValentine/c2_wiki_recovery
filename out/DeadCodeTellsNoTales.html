        An interesting expression of a concept I've tried to 
        bring up in developing systems with at least a minimal 
        ability to leave some kind of TrailOfBreadcrumbs to 
        allow the SoftwareMedicalExaminer to perform a useful
        SoftwarePostMortem.

        In embedded systems there are often no disk drives or
        other storage media and no user interface interface.
        If it dies, and no one is there to see it your forensic
        abilities are really tested.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've worked with computers that had a ROM monitor that
        allowed you to stop everything, examine or trace areas
        of RAM, and resume or restart.  Nowadays such toys are
        available only to hard core development & diagnostic
        shops, not to mere mortal users.
      </p>
      <p>
        In our recent systems (embedded and otherwise) we have
        added the $0.89 parts and taken the development time to
        give the forensics guys a head start -- saving state to
        NovRam (NonVolatileRam) or FlashMemory when impending 
        turd/fan collisions are detected -- or writing to disk 
        when there is one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unfortuantely, $.89 buys you very little of FLASH or NVRAM--at best, one of those </em><a href="EyeSquaredCee.html">EyeSquaredCee</a> serial thingies that can store a couple of kilobytes.  Which may or may not be enough for such post-mortem diagnostics.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Another good strategy (assuming fiberglass real estate is not at a premium) is to design in a (larger, more expensive) diagnostic memory and delete it from the design (leave the pads on the ECB but don't install the parts) when you go to production.  Assuming, of course, that you won't need to do such troubleshooting in the field.  (And for many consumer items, you won't)</em>

        Once the program is deceased, especially in the hands of
        user site personnel, the only clues you have are the ones
        you left yourself.
