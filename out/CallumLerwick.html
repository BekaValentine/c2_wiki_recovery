        Hey Callum, can you give some suggestion how someone totally disinterested in 3D could create, say, a 3D model of a hand to use as a mouse pointer? Or even simpler, how about a disc with circular holes arrayed around its rim? The former is something that can't be done in most free editors. The latter is something that seemingly can only be done badly, though it can be obscured by suitable textures. -- rk
