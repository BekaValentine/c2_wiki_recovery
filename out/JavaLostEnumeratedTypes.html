        Java Lost Enumerated Types
      </h1>

        C and C++ have "enum."  Now Java does too.  So why aren't you happy?  
      </p>

        <em>Shouldn't this link to the </em>CeePlusPlusDesignFlaws page, instead? :-)<em></em>

        <em>Yes, I know you can define a class with "static const final" definitions of valid values, but that still doesn't give you an enumerated type -- the values aren't instances of the class, now are they?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="EnumeratedTypesInJava.html">EnumeratedTypesInJava</a> for a solution which is actually <em>more</em> useful than C/C++'s "enum".

        <em>I've seen this gripe a million times and you know, I've been working in Java for over two years now (with C++ before) and have not yet missed typedefs or enums... Just goes to show you can't be all things to all people.</em>

        Enumerated types have been added to Java 1.5, and yes they are proper class instances which means that you can do proper polymorphism.
