        You've spent months, even years, of your life on a project which you've poured blood, sweat, and tears into. You've completed <a href="VersionOne.html">VersionOne</a> successfully, congratulations! <a href="ShamelessSelfPromotion.html">ShamelessSelfPromotion</a>! Now... <a href="HowDoYouLetGo.html">HowDoYouLetGo</a> and move on, trusting another person or team to carry "your baby" through its next stage of life?

        I have a very hard time dealing with handing over even pieces of a project, let alone the whole thing. It's very hard for me to let go and watch people who I know don't care, or care as much about their code as I do, take the reins. I think this stems from the fact that I take everything so personally when it comes to coding... I <em>really</em> care about my code.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can I overcome this feeling or is this something I need to learn to accept?

        Either let go of it completely (probably keeping <a href="VersionOne.html">VersionOne</a> for yourself in case you'll need it later), or use <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> to see what people do, discuss the changes with them and gradually start to trust them. -- <a href="PanuKalliokoski.html">PanuKalliokoski</a>

        For me, one key is to remember that it is not <em>my</em> code: it is the team's code, my employer's code, or my client's code. I remind myself that personal <a href="CodeOwnership.html">CodeOwnership</a> is a bad thing, even when it is my own elegantly perfect code under consideration. Another key is to remember that whenever I can turn something over to somebody else, it's an opportunity for me to start working on something new. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>
