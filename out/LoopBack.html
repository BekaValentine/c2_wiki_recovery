        Loop Back

        I just learned that TCP/IP has a <a href="LoopBack.html">LoopBack</a> mechanism - when you run decoupled, it defaults to a fixed IP address and routes that to some internal code.   I have for years been calling this the <a href="ShuntPattern.html">ShuntPattern</a>, and it seems I was wrong, and should have been saying <a href="LoopBack.html">LoopBack</a> all this time.  VincentCoetzee of eBucks.com mentioned this design idiom just in passing.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>
