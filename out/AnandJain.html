        <em>Welcome to Wiki. (I take it you are a person, not a definition.) Now I know what 'anand' means. I happen to know a vegetarian restaurant called Anand Bhavan which served </em>'the tastiest<strong> almond halvah dessert. Unfortunately, the restaurant lost its lease a few months a go and had to shut down. :-( Now I need to find out what 'bhavan' means. -- </strong><a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a><em></em>
