        What Isa Window
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an attempt to classify a "window" in GUI terms.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Independent window is generally treated like an independent application from a UI perspective. It can be moved away from the parent/launcher window. It may still have "data ties" to a parent application, but the UI behavior generally acts like an independent application.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Dependent windows
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           MDI window - Must be contained in the "parent" or application window, but otherwise can be moved around within that space.
        </li>
        <li>
           Tabbed Window - A window that is activated or made visible by selecting its "tab" from a list of tabs or tab-like buttons.
        </li>
        <li>
           Embedded Window - A window that is embedded in a parent window or document, but otherwise behaves like an independent window. For example, one may be able to put focus on one of its controls without losing the (tracked) focus from another portion of the parent window/document. Ideally some kind of border is included to make its window-like nature clear to the reader. In HTML, an "IFRAME" is often used to create such. However, it lacks flexible sizing ability.
        </li>
        <li>
           Side-pop or side-slide window - A window that is attached to one or more edges of the parent window. It may be activated (popped-out) by clicking on a tab or "minimized" version of itself. Many fold back up (slide back in) if focus changes to another window. If not, a clear way should be provided to fold it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Collapsible tree window - This accordion-like window treatment is common in portable devices where windows have a "stacked" hierarchy and slide out or back in when selected or an open/close button is pressed (similar to the "[+]" and "[-]" buttons found in some folder browsers). Care must be taken to make clear what are parent nodes and their levels. Generally different colors are used for different levels. For example, level 1 may be burgundy, level 2 blue, level 3 grey, and leaves be white (mirroring paper) regardless of level.
        </li>
        <li>
           Tiled windows - A group of windows that are "tiled" together. A typical example is an email reader with a list of messages in the top panel and a reading window in the bottom view. Often they have size sliders between them to adjust their relative sizes. Html FRAMESET's are used to create these in HTML.
