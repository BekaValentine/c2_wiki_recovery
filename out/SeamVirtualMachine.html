        Seam Virtual Machine
      </h1>
      <p>
        SEAM (Simple Extensible Abstract Machine) is a  virtual machine architecture and library. SEAM is designed to be  language- and platform-independent, to be simple  and based on few principled services.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Uniform data representation and memory management.</strong>  All datastructures used to represent computations, including code and  threads, reside in an abstract store, which represents  an abstract graph of data nodes.  Language specific datastructures are modelled on top of the  language-independent store structures. The store manages the allocation  of nodes and their efficient layout in memory.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Platform-independent external representation.</strong>  Store values are converted to a portable representation during  export (pickling), and converted back during  import (unpickling). A language-independent  transfer language is defined  to describe values independent from platform.  Unpickling operates with respect to runtime-pluggable  language-dependent transformation. For example, language specific code  can be instantiated either to byte code or to native code.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Abstract execution model.</strong>  Computations are defined by a generic evaluator interface.  SEAM supports arbitrarily many codes and  evaluators to be used at the same time and interact freely. In particular,  common virtual machine services like foreign  function interfaces are easily expressible.
