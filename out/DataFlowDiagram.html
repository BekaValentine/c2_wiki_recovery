        Data Flow Diagram
      </h1>
      <p>
        A "semi-formal" way of representing computer system functions in a diagram. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           represent major components or functions with Circles 
        </li>
        <li>
           actions for input by a user or system go in Rectangular Boxes 
        </li>
        <li>
           Databases are represented by parallel lines enclosing a phrase 
        </li>
        <li>
           Display or output information is represented by a box with a truncated top right corner 
        </li>

        What is a DFD 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Graphical Description of a System's data & how the process transform the data is known as Data Flow Diagram or simply DFD. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Unlike detail flowcharts, DFDs do not supply detailed descriptions of modules but graphically describe a system's data & how the data interact with the system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To Construct a Data Flow Diagrams, we use: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Arrows 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Identifies data flow-data in motion. It is a pipeline through which information flows. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Circles 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Like the rectangle in flowcharts, Circles stand for a process that converts incoming data to information. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Open-Ended Boxes or Parallel Lines 
          <ul>
            <li>
               An Open-Ended box represents a data/store-data at rest, or a temporary repository of data. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Squares. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               A Square defines a source or destination of system data.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Actually, DFDs have broader application than just software.  They can be used to describe business processes in a way that's a lot more readable than <a href="FlowChart.html">FlowChart</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have actually used a variation on this theme as a part of a job turnover project, wherein I had to describe everything I did and everything and everyone I touched.  The DFD variant was the cleaner, more direct way of expressing this.
      </p>
      <p>
        And, yes, I use them as an outline tool for software design.
