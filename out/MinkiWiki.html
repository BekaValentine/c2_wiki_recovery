        Minki is designed to be lightweight and simple, but that doesn't mean it was designed to be devoid of useful features -- rather, it's designed to be ultimately utilitarian for individuals and smaller websites.  What it lacks in multi-user account functionality it attempts to make up for in robust syntax and other features like exporting and version comparison.

        The following are the functions I think are most import to keep in mind when deciding whether or not Minki is worth your time.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Robust syntax for easy, readable formatting without having to resort to html.  (HTML can be enabled from the options page, however).
          <ul>
            <li>
               Lists and tables are properly formed; nested lists are truely nested rather than simply increasing margins per level.
            </li>
            <li>
               Almost all block-level elements (tables, paragraphs, preformatted blocks, blockquotes) and selections can have text and background color applied easily.
            </li>
            <li>
               Easily create targets within pages and link to them
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Page change difference hi-lighter allows you to see how the page has changed compared against older versions (the number of versions saved can be changed in the options); if you are the site owner, you can easily revert to a previous version. (Handy if spammers or not-nice people erase or replace your data with junk)
        </li>
        <li>
           Plain text and html export allowing you either export the page as plain text (That's how I create the README file for Minki) or as html (The template is stripped and a plain html file is exported. Great for presenting documentation online).  Internal links can be formatted as normal links or link to these exports /Examples:/
          <ul>
            <li>
               {features:text} links to 'features' page as text
            </li>
            <li>
               {features:html} links to 'features' page as html
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Simple template system that allows you to completely overhaul (or write from the ground up) the template without having to touch the Minki code -- all you need is HTML and the {template macros}.
        </li>
        <li>
           Settings/Options are stored as a Minki page, so you can easily edit them if you're logged in.
        </li>
        <li>
           All system text is stored in an external language file for easy customization or translation.
        </li>
      </ul>
