        <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> [<a href="http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/]">http://phpwiki.sourceforge.net/]</a> is a wiki originally
        developed by <a href="SteveWainstead.html">SteveWainstead</a> in the <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>. There are now several active developers on the project.

        <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> can run on relational databases (<a href="MySql.html">MySql</a>, PostgreSQL, etc), DBM files, or flat files. Features include a plugin architecture so you can add all kinds of functionality, full version history, a large set of default pages (which document <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a>), <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> support, support for several languages, themes, RSS, many administrative functions (dump all pages as HTML, as a zip file, with metadata in mail-compliant headers, page locking, page deletion, and many more).

        Has someone experience with this? The wiki on the <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> homepage is down often or gives error messages for every step you do. I also don't like that it lacks so many features - don't even seem to have many backup options. I was kind of surprised, since I thought this would be a widely used <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a>...

        <strong>File Storage</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is more efficient, storing Wiki pages in a flat file, like JSPWiki does? Or in a MySQL table, like <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> or XWiki do? I am concerned about the efficiency of handling big number of pages and attachments as well. Is a MySQL table good enough to keep up with the growth of a Wiki? What do people think of that? -- Marion Hanz

      <p>
        Answer: Storing Wiki pages in a MySQL table is going to be a lot more efficient than in a flat file. In addition to that, <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> offers certain speed advantages with optimizers that run alongside such as Zend. I know of a wiki host that has a very efficient implementation with MySQL and PHP optimizers, Centada (<a href="http://www.centada.com/).">http://www.centada.com/).</a>
