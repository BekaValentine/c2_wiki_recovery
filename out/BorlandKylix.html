        Borland Kylix

        Borland's port of <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a> to <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a>.  Not <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>.

        <em>A nice product. Easy to develop small GUI applications. For large applications, nowadays a garbage-collected language is surely more appropriate? I look forward to some future Kylix-like product targetting the dotNet platform.</em>  -- <a href="RogerBrowne.html">RogerBrowne</a>

      <p>
        Isn't it nice to see commercial practice and frameworks finally catching on to GC languages for this sort of development.  Only took 25 years :)

      <p>
        So what's new? Delphi has been around for more than 5 years. Kylix is just one more platform to port it to.
        If you are looking for a garbage-collected language with the Kylix featureset, what about J-Builder? <em>See </em><a href="LanguagePissingMatch.html">LanguagePissingMatch</a><em> [Yah, so what about C++? </em><a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>? Python?  What's new? Comeon.... This is a <a href="BorlandKylix.html">BorlandKylix</a> page...]

        <strong>Q.</strong> How does this compare to <a href="FreePascal.html">FreePascal</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, FPC, </em><a href="LazarusIde.html">LazarusIde</a> (which uses freepascal) is similar to Kylix. FPC is more mature now than even kylix, as kylix is put on the backburner at borland/codegear. One can even use both compilers side by side since FPC has a "mode delphi" switch. <em></em>
