        Markoff Chaney, one of <a href="RobertAntonWilson.html">RobertAntonWilson</a>'s most enduring characters, is a dwarf whose mission is to throw a spanner into the corporate machine. Chaney's prime M.O. is to forge announcements and signs that increase stress levels, like:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>	 </dt>
        <dd>To meet new Business Health Guidelines, employees are required to wash their hands <strong>both</strong> before and after urinating. Thank you.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        and invariably signs himself,
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"--<a href="TheMgt.html">TheMgt</a>"</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        CatBert seems to draw on Chaney as his inspiration. Not to be confused with <a href="MarkvShaney.html">MarkvShaney</a>.
