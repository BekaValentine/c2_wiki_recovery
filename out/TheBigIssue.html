        The Big Issue
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TheBigIssue.html">TheBigIssue</a> is the name of a magazine, first published in UK?, now available in this corner of the world in the land of Oz.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is an example of a <a href="ThinkWinWin.html">ThinkWinWin</a> strategy that appear to have an impact. And in early 2005 it was profiled in a TV documentary series called Compass, a series on religion and life and values.

        It is a magazine with articles written by people with training in journalism. Sold in the streets by unemployed and/or homeless persons who gets half of the proceeds for themselves. Although contents do favor social justice issues, it tries to communicate minority views in a manner acceptable to the society at large.

        An example include a recent feature article on <a href="ArundhatiRoy.html">ArundhatiRoy</a>, winner of the booker prize for TheGodOfSmallThings. It reported on how the now famed author/activist is hounded by different fractional groups, bent on recruiting her to their causes, and in the end discovered her own desire to get more publicity for <a href="TheBigIssue.html">TheBigIssue</a> publication by association.

        <em>When the publication first appeared in our streets in 2004, I often walk by the vendors without pausing to find out what it stands for. I had the picture in my mind of a rebel publication without a cause and unable to communicate.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sad thing is to this day, probably lots of other workers walked to their offices probably still pass by the disadvantaged vendors and think the same way that I did then.
