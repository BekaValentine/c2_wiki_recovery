        Forth Culture
      </h1>
      <p>
        The users of the <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> may be said to share certain cultural attributes. 
        The forth culture appears to include a high level of enthusiasm and evangelising about the 
        forth language as well as a constant reference to what forth <em>could</em> do. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, since the inventors of the <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> made their living by selling
        implementations and applications in Forth, it appears the culture of forth has always 
        been highly commercial. For example, in Elizabeth Rathers books about the Forth language,
        such as <em>The Forth Programmers Handbook</em> she refers to her companies (Forth Inc) products
        on numerous occasions. She also users the phrase, "refer to your products documentation" many
        times throughout her books about forth.
