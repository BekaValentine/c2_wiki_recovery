        The <a href="DotComBubble.html">DotComBubble</a> typically refers to a period of meteoric business growth and media attention to the Internet and the World Wide Web, roughly from 1997 to early 2000, noted for dubious Internet-based business proposals attracting significant amounts of venture capital.  When returns did not materialise, funding dried up, the dubious businesses went bust, and the investment bubble burst.  Internet-based businesses with sound business models, or the very lucky, survived.  See <a href="DotCom.html">DotCom</a>.
