        Define Syntax Vs Def Macro
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the more vituperative parts if the LispVsScheme debates is over the relative merits of traditional Lisp macro systems, as exemplified by Common Lisp's (defmacro) form and the (define-macro) systems of earlier Scheme revisions, and the R5RS (define-syntax) system of 'hygienic' macros (that preserve <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>). Defenders of (define-syntax) claim it is more stable, and easier for newcomers to use correctly; critics assert that it is too limiting, too complex, that it is poorly defined in the standard, and that there are several commonly used macro idioms that cannot be implemented easily (or at all) with (define-syntax). The few who argue that the two systems can be seen as complementary have, by and large, been dismissed by both sides.
