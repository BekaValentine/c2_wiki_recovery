        Self Standing Evidence Is Impossible
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="SelfStandingEvidence.html">SelfStandingEvidence</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SelfStandingEvidence.html">SelfStandingEvidence</a> is impossible. Every word in the dictionary is defined by other words in the dictionary. All theorems depend on axioms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As stated below, nobody is suggesting it in absolute or extreme terms. There should be some "axioms" or definitions we can assume the reader knows without proving upon each usage that 2 + 2 = 4. But which ones has not been agreed on yet. See </em><a href="WikiPrerequisites.html">WikiPrerequisites</a>. If you write "I fell off my chair", we assume that everyone knows what "fell" and "chair" means.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Right, since there is no such thing as <a href="SelfStandingEvidence.html">SelfStandingEvidence</a> let's not use the term. It has no meaning and adds no value.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, if it is a useless concept it is probably because nobody will agree on the prerequisites, not because such wouldn't be helpful.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, it's a useless concept because it doesn't exist, regardless of any prerequisites. You just said so yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Huh?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If evidence relies on collective agreement to some set of prerequisites (which you argue for above) then it doesn't stand by itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Like I keep saying, it is not an all-or-nothing thing. If you want a longer title that makes that clear, be my guest.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If "self-standing evidence" doesn't stand by itself, it isn't a thing at all. I don't want a longer title. I want to delete this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Evidence A can be MORE self-standing than evidence B.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How is that? If evidence A relies on 1 axiom and evidence B relies on 2 axioms, why is A any more "self-standing"? It still relies on an axiom.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Something that relies on fewer external axioms is generally "better". We are striving for better here. Perfect would be nice, but it ain't gonna happen.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you have any evidence that "something that relies on fewer external axioms is generally better"? And "better" in what sense?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A form of </em><a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Occam's Razor says that if you can eliminate an axiom then you should. It says nothing about fewer axioms making something "better". 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Are you saying you have no preference for an idea that uses only 10 axioms over one that uses 1000?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, that is what I am saying. There are very simple ideas that require little previous knowledge to understand and apply. There are very complicated ideas that require a great deal of previous knowledge to understand and apply. The simple ideas aren't "better" than the more complicated ideas. Often times they are less accurate and/or less useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All else being equal, would you take the 10 or 1000?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the same proof could contain 10 or 1000 axioms, then I'd chose the proof that used 10. That's <a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a>. But we aren't talking about the same proof, we're talking about different arguments. I wouldn't reject one argument because it relied on more facts than another argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Okay, but what about argument A that has 50 axioms here and 50 external, versus one that has 90 here and 10 elsewhere. From a practical perspective, readers are going to pay more attention to the second. We should be nice to readers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You lost me. Are you saying the people who read this wiki are likely to read only this wiki, and that they haven't studied computer science elsewhere? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I believe there should be </em><a href="WikiPrerequisites.html">WikiPrerequisites</a> that expect a minimum knowledge. This wiki should target practicioners, not really newbies to computer science. There are better places for that.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you are saying that, are you further arguing that we should only discuss ideas that are already heavily documented here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, I am saying that one should not insult an opinion based only or mostly on external evidence. Thus, nobody should say, "If you knew what I know, you would know that you are flat wrong." Under </em><a href="SelfStandingEvidence.html">SelfStandingEvidence</a> thinking, that is not acceptable wiki edicate.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiPrerequisites.html">WikiPrerequisites</a> are spelled out on that page (web browser, internet access, working knowledge of English). Will you answer my questions?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Which ones were not answered? Information that relies on too many external axioms is of less use to most readers. I am just the messenger of that </em>'fact of human nature<strong>. As an example, my "side flag" typing model described under </strong><a href="AlternativeTypeDefinitions.html">AlternativeTypeDefinitions</a> may (allegedly) be less thorough than Reynold's typing model, but more may find it useful because they don't have to deal with massive <a href="BookStop.html">BookStop</a>s. They get a usable model (perhaps a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> like Newtonian physics) much quicker. Suppose they are getting a 95% useful model at a cost of 10 units of energy as opposed to Reynold's 99% useful model at the cost of 200 units of energy.<em></em>
