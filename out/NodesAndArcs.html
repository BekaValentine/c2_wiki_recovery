        Nodes And Arcs
      </h1>
      <p>
        Starting with the ideas of <em>some things</em> (nodes) and <em>some arrows between things</em> (arcs), and throwing in a few simple axioms (<a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>), one can construct pretty much all of the maths used in computation; numbers, grammars, the <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>, <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a>, etc. and so forth. Relational models are already in nodes and arcs, and after a little thought, objects are too. Formally, <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> is the algebra of functional composition, so <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> falls out of it almost immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the pure maths field, <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> can be used to construct set and group theories, and abstract algebras, after which pretty much the whole rest of the subject may be derived.

        Walters' <em>Categories and Computer Science</em> ISBN: 0521422264 is a good intro for formally-minded IT types.

        I only started to look into this seriously a little while ago - it's one of those subjects that makes my brain itch, which is a feeling I like. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
