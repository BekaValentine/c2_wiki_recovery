        <a href="VisiCalc.html">VisiCalc</a> on Apple ][ and <a href="PageMaker.html">PageMaker</a> on Macintosh were typical <a href="KillerApplication.html">KillerApplication</a>s. Mosaic and the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a> have been the most famous <a href="KillerApplication.html">KillerApplication</a><strong>s</strong> these days. People had to buy computers to run the <a href="KillerApplication.html">KillerApplication</a>s on. The origin of the word is :

        Lotus 123 was the "<a href="KillerApp.html">KillerApp</a>" for the PC.

        It's interesting that you list <a href="PageMaker.html">PageMaker</a> as a <a href="KillerApp.html">KillerApp</a> for the Mac. Certainly it was the "right software in the right place at the right time", but it was only a niche product for the mac at that time.
      </p>

        Also, <a href="PageMaker.html">PageMaker</a> was released at the same time for Windows 1.0, and with almost identical functionality. (<em>But Windows 1.0 didn't support </em><a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> printers<em>) I can't think of any other serious application that was released under </em>WindowsOne. (<a href="CorelDraw.html">CorelDraw</a> and Excel were released for Windows 2.0, and Word for Windows was released just before Windows 3.0.)

        Not that I used <a href="PageMaker.html">PageMaker</a> for Windows 1.0 - it was just too slow. VenturaPublisher ran under Gem (from DigitalResearch), was fast, and had style sheets which <a href="PageMaker.html">PageMaker</a> lacked at the time.

        At the time, there was no dominance of MS-Windows; there were many competing windowing systems. There was IBM TopView, and something less graphical from QuarterDeck (sorry can't remember the name).

        Sorry, rambling a bit off topic here.

        The next question is: what will be the next <a href="KillerApp.html">KillerApp</a>, and how can I make enough money to retire from it?
