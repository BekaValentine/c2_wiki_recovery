        I solve problems. Writing software happens to be my method of solving problems. I attended Carleton University in Ottawa to become a software engineer. Along the way, I met <a href="WilfLalonde.html">WilfLalonde</a>, who has influenced me a great deal.

        I have worked at The Object People in Ottawa and worked on interesting projects including TOPLink. This is also where I had a chance to work with the likes of <a href="AnthonyLander.html">AnthonyLander</a> and <a href="AlanKnight.html">AlanKnight</a>. Anthony (also a Wilf disciple) showed me the fun in problem solving.

        Currently, I am working at Sanga Research Ottawa. Development over here is 100% Java, and I look forward to prove that <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> will work equally well in Java.

        Over the years, I found that I did not particularly enjoy how software was being written. I knew how I liked to code, and knew there had to be other people who thought similarly. Wilf introduced me to <a href="NeedsDrivenProgramming.html">NeedsDrivenProgramming</a> which was a great starting point. Anthony gave me the convoluted url of the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> web page, and thus I found the answer.

        I am currently looking forward to using EP on an upcoming project.
