        The story told in Rich Dad:
      </p>
      <p>
        Robert's family moved from Japan to Hawaii several generations before he was born.  His father was a public school educator who rose through the management ranks to eventually become head of public education for Hawaii.  He run for political office against his boss, who he thought exemplified the worst of back-room political shenanigans, lost, and was "blacklisted" from further political opportunities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through a coincidence of public school districting, Robert went to high school with the son of a business owner and investor.  The friend's father later rose to be one of the most prominent financial figures in Hawaii, and the friend took over the family "empire" of great wealth and opportunity.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Robert's dad's career required more and more time away from home, Robert spent more and more time with his friend's "rich dad", who had increasing leisure to pass along his advice to the two boys.  Robert ultimately found financial independence through following the advice of his "rich dad", and wrote a series of books about the experience.  "If you want to be happy, don't go to school" was written while his own father was alive.  After his father's death, Robert continued writing with "Rich Dad, Poor Dad" and several follow-up books about various investing, life planning, and financial and business success topics.

        The story is fiction.  Nobody's ever been able to come up with who the "rich dad" was.  Some of his advice will either leave you looking really stupid, is wrong, or plain illegal.

        I'd go on, but the URL is pretty good for such things.
