        Fu Bar

      <p>
        <a href="FuBar.html">FuBar</a> is an acronym or a <a href="BackroNym.html">BackroNym</a> for Fouled Up Beyond All ( Repair | Recognition ). Most often it'll have a different f-word in place of 'foul'. It dates back to World War II, possibly earlier - I'm too lazy to chase down its semantic history, but I certainly recall an old neighbor talking about the use of the term in WWII context.

        This expression has a cousin, "SNAFU" -- Situation Normal; All F---d Up. The story I heard was that during WWII, sergeants who had more important things to worry about were often given the responsibility of filling out status reports to send back to non-combatant bureaucrats, and they would discharge the task by scrawling "SNAFU" across the form and sending it in.
