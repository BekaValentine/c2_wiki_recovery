        Apostrophe Catastrophe
      </h1>
      <p>
        Also referring to the common misuse of the apostrophe, as pointed out in the book <a href="EatsShootsAndLeaves.html">EatsShootsAndLeaves</a>.

        <strong>Q:</strong> How does a person with an Apostrophe in his/her name (e.g. Paddy O'Furniture) make a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> out of it without:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           losing the apostrophe and
        </li>
        <li>
           destroying preferred capitalization.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> He or she doesn't. However, there are alternatives:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           PaddyOfurniture  <em>(destroys capitalization)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           PaddyOhFurniture <em>(messes up name)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           PaddyOapostropheFurniture <em>(fun to type)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           PaddyO%27Furniture <em>(let wiki work it out)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PaddyO%27Furniture">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?PaddyO%27Furniture</a> <em>(almost works -- but you can't create the page)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           PaddyOfFurniture <em>(Isn't that what the "O'" stands for, anyway?)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

        How necessary<br/>
        the apostrophe<br/>
        so small so cute so quaint<br/>
        it fits between the letters<br/>
        to point out where they ain't<br/>

        Hey, what about those of us with periods embedded within our names? (<a href="BrianStPierre.html">BrianStPierre</a>) We've lost punctuation too!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The convention is that "st." is an abbreviation for "stone", but no dot is used when Saint is abbreviated to "St". Doubtless, a few people choose to flout that convention, but let's just encourage them to quietly drop the dot.</em>

        And we of the 'Land of the Umlaut'? I have to rape my name to <a href="JuergenErhard.html">JuergenErhard</a>, when in fact it's Jürgen Erhard. (Yeah, that's a minor problem in my case since "Juergen" is not a valid spelling anyway.)

        Or people anywhere where accented letters are used? I doubt RenéGade would like to be called ReneGade. -- RhesaRozendaal

        Try to think of it like a virtual Ellis Island, where sometimes you have to change your name to gain entry if the immigration official finds your original name too difficult.

        "O" and "Mac" are both of Gaelic origin. "O" means "grandson of" (not simply "of" as mentioned above); "Mac" means "son of". Personally, I wouldn't have invented "O"; "MacMac" is clearly the appropriate refactoring. -- ConanDalton
