        I offer consulting, facilitation, and training services to help people in organizations turn resistance into energy for moving forward.

      <p>
        I have worked in the software industry since 1980, as a developer, manager, process steward, and consultant.  From 1995 to 1999, I consulted to IT and software product development organizations about software development, project management, and team and interpersonal effectiveness.  From 1999 to 2002, I worked in Sun Microsystems' IT organization to define, promote, and support effective software development, project management, and leadership practices.

        My personal mission is to help people create value, joy, and meaning in their work. I especially enjoy the challenges and rewards of helping people discover how to use their talents to serve their deeply held values.

        Another cool thing that Dale said on the <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a>:
        <em>The desire to remain the same is the single most powerful motivator for change.  People will change anything if it helps to preserve something that's even more important.  In order to preserve something, people will change anything that's less important.</em>
