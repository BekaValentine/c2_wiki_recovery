        Boost For Dummies

      <p>
        <a href="BoostForDummies.html">BoostForDummies</a> is the manual that does not yet exist for the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason it is needed is because the manuals are written mainly by the developers of the libraries and often do not explain clearly how to use the libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        The examples given are incomplete because the <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> headers needed are not given fully.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples are written when the library is developed and sometimes not checked when the library is updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a need for code which starts easy and leads the user deeper in by stages.

        I should mention <a href="BeyondTheCppStandardLibrary.html">BeyondTheCppStandardLibrary</a> which does something in this direction. It is not recent (2006).
