        You might be one too. Most people in high-tech are <a href="BuzzwordMasochist.html">BuzzwordMasochist</a>(s).

        <strong>Choose a young company</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They are hyper-innovative. They innovate on top of other innovations. They don't know old stuff and will reinvent everything for you.
        </li>
        <li>
           The company's name should include the words "net" or "web". This guarantees  that they have less than 4 years of experience. The less, the better. At   least they should have less experience than yourself.
        </li>
        <li>
           Be suspicious if they claim to have 10+ years of experience. Probably they use binary numbers.  <em>(Or, they did a sum from everyone connected with the company.  No really; small startups really do this!)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Big companies are no fun to work with because they are too stable. No risk no fun.
        </li>
        <li>
           IBM is evil. Oracle doesn't develops the real Java, it's just a database and a hardware manufacturer. Nothing else exists on the world than start-up companies. (Check also derivates and the new market   frequently.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Don't care about Java</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pure Java is only about coffee. A better name would be cholesterol-free. A   Java Application Server is basically a coffee machine.
        </li>
        <li>
           Choose a 4JL. It's almost the same as a 4GL. If nobody knows what a 4JL is,   you can "own" this new buzzword. You will be famous.
        </li>
        <li>
           Who likes programming anyway? Consider coffee instead. Let external   contractors do the dirty work.
        </li>
        <li>
           Enjoy debugging. Work only with beta versions. Delivery is the end of joy.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make it more fun by using a framework without source code. You can not only   be a detective but rather a secret agent or spy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Choose a product by name</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To the company naming rule add liberally "Active", "object", "component".   The ideal product is <a href="ActiveNetObjectWebComponentCoffeeMachine.html">ActiveNetObjectWebComponentCoffeeMachine</a>, Ver. 37alpha.
        </li>
        <li>
           Measure the importance of your project by the price tag of the product. If   your project is not worth that $$$ product, it's not worth working on the   project anyway.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Make "</strong>VapourTechnology" a key requirement<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If no product supports it, you can choose anything you like. Wouldn't you   like to have a new palmtop?
        </li>
        <li>
           Strongly believe in "the next release will have it". 
        </li>
        <li>
           If you don't know the VT, include all RFPs, beta and 1.0 specifications   around.
        </li>
        <li>
           To exclude most products ask for object-level transactions. The only choice   -- OODBs -- are nonexistent for management. You won't have to use an OODB  because you have an RDB already.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Misc</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't make pilot projects. The word "pilot" devalues a project. Call it   "strategy" instead.
        </li>
        <li>
           Everybody should make his/her own strategy. The nice thing about strategies   is that there are so many to choose from (and they look good on your resume).
        </li>
        <li>
           Apply <a href="PoliticalEngineering.html">PoliticalEngineering</a> techniques to promote your strategy upon others.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't base product choice or strategy on experience. Experience is futile.
        </li>
        <li>
           Avoid people with experience. They will invariably be against you.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ignore operations. If you follow these recommendations you will not make it   that far anyway. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Ignore the customer. That should be obvious.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>New buzzwords</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           develop an instinct for new buzzwords.
        </li>
        <li>
           use them wisely and have new ones ready. Example: we all know that client/server is dead. Now we build multi-tier achitectures. But you know better. Don't tell the customer that this really means <a href="MultiTearArchitecture.html">MultiTearArchitecture</a> unless he finds out himself during roll-out. 
        </li>
        <li>
           if you want to amuse everyone in a meeting, then keep straight face and say "Let's ask the <a href="StandardsAndMethodologyGuy.html">StandardsAndMethodologyGuy</a> in your company about this."
        </li>
        <li>
           create a new discipline: buzzwordology.
        </li>
      </ul>
