      <ul>
        <li>
           Write only factual information.
        </li>
        <li>
           Give concrete advice, rather than abstract.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make editing and elaboration easier by avoiding the use of &quot;I&quot; where possible (except in your <a href="WikiHomePage.html">WikiHomePage</a>).
          <ul>
            <li>
               Write and sign first-person accounts when reporting experiences and opinions not easily reduced to facts or objective advice.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Place words where they are easy to read; this is not always at the bottom, but they should not be placed before the &quot;<a href="OpeningStatement.html">OpeningStatement</a>&quot;.
        </li>
        <li>
           Respect the freedom you have been given.
        </li>
        <li>
           Edit pages to emphasize the flow of ideas, not the order in which they were contributed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Be concise.
        </li>
        <li>
           Stay <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> for the page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use language you'd be comfortable reading out loud - use versus utilize - and keep it simple. Simple language often communicates better.
        </li>
        <li>
           Check for spelling and grammar errors - errors detract from the content.
        </li>
        <li>
           Edit only when you think a page is lacking - don't just sign your name at the bottom of every page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Delete only if doing so adds value.
        </li>
        <li>
           Remember, if you want a nice page, make one.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't say things that are likely to make others mad. Practice civility and understatement.
        </li>
        <li>
           Above all, be good, and play nice!
        </li>
      </ul>

        The following additional points are true, useful and relevant, but are not specifically about style:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The server has very simple <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>. Start each line without spaces, and separate paragraphs with a blank line. You can run capitalized words together to make <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use <a href="HorizontalSeparator.html">HorizontalSeparator</a>s to make things easier to read. Lots of different comments with no separation can otherwise be confusing.
        </li>
        <li>
           As a visitor to this site or editor of this page, you have some responsibility; the responsibility is <em>&quot;Spirit of Freedom</em> and <em>Spirit of Quality&quot;.</em> Everybody can <em>contribute</em> constructively by not contributing when he/she doesn't have anything to contribute. Learn what John Cage didn't.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Write only factual information.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How does someone distinguish between fact and theory, between opinion and authority? See <a href="MostHolyWarsTiedToPsychology.html">MostHolyWarsTiedToPsychology</a> and <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a>. Personal opinion is unavoidable, but that does not absolve you from aiming for objectivity.
        </li>
        <li>
           Where differences arise, use wording that clarifies the source. Stating an opinion is factual when phrased as &quot;According to &lt;source&gt;, ...&quot;
        </li>
        <li>
           Writing in the past tense helps some of us to stick to the facts. :-) Writing without past or future tense (i.e., in the NOW) helps the truth come out. :-)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="NeverWriteRecently.html">NeverWriteRecently</a>: stick to <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Re: &quot;Write only factual information.&quot; - Does this exclude anecdotes? Software engineering lacks both in theory and in empirical studies outside of machine performance issues. It's largely still a dark art. If we followed that rule, this wiki would be nearly empty. Anecdotes are almost all we have to go on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, it includes anecdotes as long as they're true. It excludes lies and fiction.</em>
