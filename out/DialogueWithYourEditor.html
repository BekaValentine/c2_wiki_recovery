        Dialogue With Your Editor
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes, when I am trying to think about how to solve a problem (of object-modeling mostly, since that is what I am paid to do), and I am in an environment where I can't properly get into <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a> (because a noisy office prevents SoloFlow, and I can't discuss the problem with a colleague in order to get PairFlow), I end up entering into a dialogue with my editor to think around the problem. I just hit '//' and start typing away any old ideas that come into my head. Usually after a while I see a way to go, delete the comment, and GetBackToWork.
      </p>

        It is fairly one-sided, as you can imagine; it is a bit like PairingWithYourself, which I find to be better than just trying to think on my own.

        Does anyone else do this?

        It seems like a silent version of the <a href="CardboardProgrammer.html">CardboardProgrammer</a> or <a href="RubberDucking.html">RubberDucking</a>.

        I do it very often as well, when I'm working on a new piece of code, or trying to debug a nasty bug.   Although I wouldn't call it a dialog, but rather just recording my thoughts as they come to me about ideas on how to attack the task and what I know as facts.

        I've been known to "talk through" tough problems to focus my attention.
        It seems like a helpful approach, both alone and with others.
        (...particularly important <strong>with others</strong> -- to ensure that we're "on the same page.")
        Sometimes I write or draw.  I'm big into pictures.
        In a few extreme cases I developed a unique form of symbolic manipulation to attack a problem -- a "mathematics," if you will.

        I often flesh out a method in a similar way be adding TODO comments for each of the steps that I believe need to happen.  These then tend to get turned into method call, re-arranged, some removed, others split-up, etc.  It also means that if you get pulled away on a diversion that you don't loose (too much of) your train of thought. -- <a href="PaulRuane.html">PaulRuane</a>
