        Design Patterns Catalog

      <p>
        'Catalog' is a technical term in the <a href="PatternCommunity.html">PatternCommunity</a>. A list of patterns is called a catalog. The <a href="DesignPatternsCatalog.html">DesignPatternsCatalog</a> page should probably be restored. (<a href="RestoreMe.html">RestoreMe</a>.) Or see <a href="CategoryPattern.html">CategoryPattern</a>.

        <em>The old content seems to have been moved without loss to </em><a href="DesignPatternsRoadMap.html">DesignPatternsRoadMap</a>, and that consists of very little content, so it would be more to the point to just come up with new substantive content.<em></em>
      </p>

        I don't remember whether the old <a href="DesignPatternsCatalog.html">DesignPatternsCatalog</a> page had good content. It seems that the most useful content for a catalog/roadmap of <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> at the moment is on the <a href="CategoryPattern.html">CategoryPattern</a> page.

          I don't see much difference in the old versions of this page:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsCatalog">http://web.archive.org/web/*/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?DesignPatternsCatalog</a>
      </p>

        Thanks for the research. So it appears that the old <a href="DesignPatternsCatalog.html">DesignPatternsCatalog</a> page was pretty worthless, as is the new <a href="DesignPatternsRoadMap.html">DesignPatternsRoadMap</a>. I suppose both pages should be deleted. Or both pages could be kept just to direct the reader to <a href="CategoryPattern.html">CategoryPattern</a>, since that's where the good content is nowadays.
