        Attention Management System
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="AttentionManagementSystem.html">AttentionManagementSystem</a> is a system which manages input from email, social networks, handheld devices, broadcast messages, offers and information based on a users description of what is more important to them vs what is less important to them. All communication can be tagged with a few interest endemes each of which is an instance of an interest focus oriented <a href="EndemeSet.html">EndemeSet</a>. The user inputs their interest endemes and the system provides those communications which match one <a href="InterestEndeme.html">InterestEndeme</a> of theirs. Then broadcasters can tag each broadcast with a particular <a href="InterestEndeme.html">InterestEndeme</a> and only those with a close interest match will see it. --<a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
