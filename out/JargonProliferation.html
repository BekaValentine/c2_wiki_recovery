        Jargon Proliferation

        <a href="JargonProliferation.html">JargonProliferation</a> will take place when others feel the uncontrollable urge to use the unneeded term for reasons which are not to clear.  If enough acceptance and use accrues, the jargon may indeed become needed and perhaps preferred over the old term used to describe the concept. Use does seem to make the transition possible regardless of what some may feel or think about it.
