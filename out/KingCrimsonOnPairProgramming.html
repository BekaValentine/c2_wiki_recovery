        I remembered this lyric while browsing over on <a href="KillYourDarlings.html">KillYourDarlings</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Title track from the album Three of a Perfect Pair:
      </p>
      <code>
        she is susceptible<br/>
        he is impossible<br/>
        they have their cross to share<br/>
        three of a perfect pair...<br/>
        he has his contradicting views<br/>
        she has her cyclothymic moods<br/>
        they make a study in despair<br/>
        three of a perfect pair...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        one<br/>
        one too many<br/>
        schizophrenic tendencies<br/>
        keeps it complicated<br/>
        keeps it aggravated<br/>
        and full of this hopelessness<br/>
        what a perfect mess...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It's a great lyric to a great tune, but without Robert Fripp's rhythm and Adrian Belew's lead it loses something in transcription.
