        Sprint Burndown Chart
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a>, a Sprint burndown chart depicts the total task hours remaining per day.  Ideally the chart burns down to zero by the end of the <a href="ScrumSprint.html">ScrumSprint</a>.  If your <a href="ScrumTeam.html">ScrumTeam</a> members are reporting their task hours realistically, the line should bump up and down chaotically.  The chart is often produced by a <a href="ScrumWebTool.html">ScrumWebTool</a>.
