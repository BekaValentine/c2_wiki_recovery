        Model View Presenter

      <p>
        <a href="ModelViewPresenter.html">ModelViewPresenter</a>(TM) is a derivative of the <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> Pattern. Its aim is to provide a cleaner implementation of the Observer connection between Application Model and view.

      <p>
        This Pattern was devised by Taligent; the original paper is at

        It is used in the <a href="DolphinSmalltalk.html">DolphinSmalltalk</a> System and they have a lot of good documentation on it. <a href="http://www.object-arts.com/EducationCentre/Overviews/ModelViewPresenter.htm">http://www.object-arts.com/EducationCentre/Overviews/ModelViewPresenter.htm</a> is an introduction and <a href="http://www.object-arts.com/EducationCentre/Overviews/MVC.htm">http://www.object-arts.com/EducationCentre/Overviews/MVC.htm</a> relates <a href="ModelViewPresenter.html">ModelViewPresenter</a> to <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a>.

        It's also interesting to constrast this discussion with the <a href="DocumentView.html">DocumentView</a> Architecture, and <a href="FourLayerArchitecture.html">FourLayerArchitecture</a>.

        For a lengthy explanation with Java examples, see <a href="http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/ModelViewPresenter.html">http://www.martinfowler.com/eaaDev/ModelViewPresenter.html</a> , though it's not a typical pure MVP.

        MVP actually names more than 3 classes. In summary, they are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Presenter - represents and coordinates the application. It creates and/or wires together the other objects. The presenter is an instance of the <a href="MediatorPattern.html">MediatorPattern</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Interactor - maps (eg) keyboard or mouse events onto Commands and/or Selections.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Model - the domain data.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Selection - specifies a subset of the Model (eg to be manipulated by a Command).
            </li>
            <li>
               Command - something that has an effect on the Model (same as <a href="CommandPattern.html">CommandPattern</a>).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           View - displays (part of) the model.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Breaking an application down in this way tends to give a good <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a>, and hence good reuse of the various pieces.*
      </p>

        A variant of MVP is <a href="PresenterFirst.html">PresenterFirst</a> approach.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The Presenter is NOT an instance of the <a href="MediatorPattern.html">MediatorPattern</a>. This is also true of <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a>. In MVC and MVP, the GUI/View , Presenter/Controller, and Model are drawn as a triad. While the Model is loosely coupled to the View (it only knows the View as an Observer type), the View, however is more tighly coupled with the Model in order to be able to pull values from it. To reduce this coupling, you could create a Facade of the Model that only exposes methods to obtain values that the View requires (and hide methods that modify the Model, as that is the Controller's job), but it is still somewhat tightly coupled.

        See <a href="http://www.dossier-andreas.net/software_architecture/pac.html">http://www.dossier-andreas.net/software_architecture/pac.html</a> for a description of the <a href="PresentationAbstractionControl.html">PresentationAbstractionControl</a> that uses the <a href="MediatorPattern.html">MediatorPattern</a>. In PAC, the View and Model and completely decoupled (at least in this particular description).
      </p>
      <p>
        If I have learned anything though, it's that one paper, article or book's idea of MVC, PAC or MVP differs from the next. Everyone has a different idea of how they should work and which objects may access what, and how.
