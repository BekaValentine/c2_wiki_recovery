        John Fletcher
      </h1>
      <p>
        John Fletcher is an academic chemical engineer with an interest in computer programming and a lot else besides. After more than 40 years as an academic I signed up to spend one more year, working three days per week, I have now retired at the end of August 2014. This does not mean the end of my involvement here, but I want to let folks here know this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am one of the <a href="PunchCardGeneration.html">PunchCardGeneration</a> as I started work in 1969 and my <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> programs existed entirely on the deck of cards. There was no copy stored electronically anywhere. I have realised only in recent years how the work then instilled in me an attention to detail which has stayed with me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am amazed when I think back to when I started as an academic in 1972 and how much the technology available to me has changed in that time. The computer power I have here at home is probably more than several universities had in total in 1970.

        Current wiki persona <em>ict-nat-90.aston.ac.uk ict-nat-254.aston.ac.uk</em> (at work) <em>bunbury28.plus.com</em> (at home) or just <em>jpf</em>, although I have now removed as many of these references using my initials as I can find, except on my own home page and the one of <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>, where there are numerous uses in dialogues from some time ago. This is in response to the discussion on <a href="ShortWikiSignaturesSmell.html">ShortWikiSignaturesSmell</a>.

      <p>
        This page has several sections. Probably the most useful to me and hopefully to readers is a section where pages are indexed by topic and in alphabetical order within the topics. The rest of it is an accumulation of thoughts and sometime dialogue with others. Some of those people no longer write on C2 and I miss them, though of course I don't know their faces. I have been around on here on and off for a lot of years. I started in 1997 - I am in <a href="VisitorsInNinetySeven.html">VisitorsInNinetySeven</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That statement about faces shows how things change with time. Now I could much more easily see their faces using modern tools such as Facebook and Linkedin.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That is an interesting comment which I had not noticed previously. I do indeed use such systems now.

        Rather than focusing on disagreements about <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> topics, I would encourage you to add your personal expertise to any pages here that interest you. I note that you listed <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>. A friend pointed out to me quite recently that the semi-new Algebraic Geometry foundation espoused in what's-his-name's 2001 Oersted Lecture was in fact the same thing, modulo ...something, as <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>s, which I had missed before, since I haven't digested the new foundational approach being championed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some people prefer to say Geometric Algebra instead of </em><a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>. See page 36 in Hestenes paper (below)<em> jpf</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [I think Doug must mean Hestenes's 2002 Oersted Medal Lecture, "Reforming the Mathematical Language of Physics" (<a href="http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/pdf/OerstedMedalLecture.pdf).]">http://modelingnts.la.asu.edu/pdf/OerstedMedalLecture.pdf).]</a> (See <a href="HestenesOerstedMedalLecture.html">HestenesOerstedMedalLecture</a>.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Correct, that's what I meant, thanks for the correction and the link. Incidentally, I got side-tracked and hadn't reached page 36 yet, which is why I was surprised when, upon describing the paper to a friend, he said "<a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>". I hadn't spotted nor read about an equivalence. They cannot be identical topics, as opposed to equivalent, though, as I think jpf would agree considering his comment on <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>, since the latter is mostly approached purely algebraically, whereas the new foundations suggested by Hestenes inherently is about the <strong>geometric</strong> application. -- Doug
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Thanks for that, it is on the printer - Hestenes is a key person in this and I am putting this reference onto </em><a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>.<em> jpf</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you happen to know something about that, that would be something of great interest to me, since I'd like to learn more about the subject, and might therefore be of interest to some others here, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or similarly with any of the other subjects in which you have expertise. -- Thanks, <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oops, excuse me, I see that you long ago contributed to page <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>. I hope you see that there might be still more to be said, in the context I raised. Thanks again, -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        <em>My main focus at the moment is on implementing computer algebra for </em><a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>. This has led me deep into <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> as a means of implementing all the overloaded operators I need. I am currently looking into <a href="DaixtroseLib.html">DaixtroseLib</a> which seems to have been rather ignored. It has compile time differentiation of expression templates, which I have never come across anywhere else. I am also interested in ways of storing the complicated algebra results which can be made.<em> -- jpf</em>

        Interesting. Theorem databases seem to get frequently reinvented. One would think that there's some handy off-the-shelf answer that would work for you, but the devil is in the details. The most recent mention of something similar I've seen is the most recent post on <a href="http://mathforge.net">http://mathforge.net</a> -- I forget which system he was using. -- Doug

        Problems with presenting highly technical stuff on Wiki
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There are obvious limitations of plain text.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>One thing I can do more of is point people to some other web pages, in particular my own papers which are online although retypeset because that is university policy so they look very odd to me.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Special symbols are not conveniently available (but mention a few you'd particularly like, as images can substitute).
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>I would like to be able to do suffix notation e.g. e1 e2 e3 f1 f2 f3 would be very nice for what I have in mind next.</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   You might try e₁e₂e₃f₁f₂f₃ (but these require browser support and the spacing may be unwelcome as it varies by browser).
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Even when an article can be read online, there are often references to papers or books which are not online. Even standard results and standard terminology are often not given online, leaving parts of online papers semi-incomprehensible. This is particularly a problem with mathematical work, since there are often many references going back dozens of years.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>I am very lucky that the </em><a href="HestenesOerstedMedalLecture.html">HestenesOerstedMedalLecture</a> is on line, though it is true that it refers on. There is a lot available on this topic if you can read either postscript or pdf formats.<em></em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           There is often so much to explain that it's difficult to give enough in a wiki page of reasonable size.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Hence the idea of leaf pages - do you think that helps?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So far, so good. Well-named leaf pages are okay. I download interesting pdf (or postscript) files as they are generally bulky. Please note the availability of the symbols <img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/cross.gif" /> and <img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif" /> amongst others (see <a href="OpenWikiGraphics.html">OpenWikiGraphics</a>).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Thank you, I have applied these in </em><a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>. I also now have <img src="http://www.eit.org.uk/del.gif''" /> -- jpf
          <ul>
            <li>
               Ah! That symbol is okay, but needs to be copied rather than linked direct. If necessary, further symbols can be designed from scratch if they can't be found somewhere where copying is allowed.
            </li>
            <li>
               I have swapped to a different source, and cannot tell if your comment is on the first one or the second, sorry. So could you tell me please? -- jpf
            </li>
            <li>
               I couldn't find a restriction regarding the current site, but the previous site does contain a request not to link direct. The best course is to collect (or create) the gif files needed (together with permission to use them), and then ask for them to be made available as <a href="OpenWikiGraphics.html">OpenWikiGraphics</a>. If you don't want a space next to a symbol, replace the space with <a href="SixSingleQuotes.html">SixSingleQuotes</a> (or just omit it if the next character is emphasized using quotes already).
            </li>
            <li>
               The "del" symbol should now be linked at <img src="http:''''//php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math2/del.gif" /> (it's the same symbol, copied with permission).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Regarding the broken link you noticed in <a href="TemplatesSmell.html">TemplatesSmell</a>, I found a version of it using the <a href="WaybackMachine.html">WaybackMachine</a>, then used Google to locate what seemed to be the current version (or new location) of it. Regarding the change you intended to make to <a href="TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction.html">TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction</a>, please note what actually happened - Wiki has a big problem with lines that end with "\", so I restored the page (using the history file, <strong>not</strong> the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>) then added a trailing space to the lines affected.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thank you for finding FADBAD. I am interested to find such things. As regards the second, all I did was to add the categories. I am aware that wiki seems to wrongly credit changes sometimes, and I do not know why it should do that. The changing of the format of all the code was someone else.</em> -- jpf
      </p>
      <p>
        No - you unwittingly made other changes, due to a bug in Wiki. To confirm that, view <a href="http:histDiff.cgi?page=TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction&old=8&new=9">http:histDiff.cgi?page=TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction&old=8&new=9</a> to see the two changes occurred in a single edit.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>O.K. That changes reports the edit as 39 years ago!! In any case, I take no responsibility for the line endings. I took a copy of the code in order to try it out. What I can report is that before I made my changes, the changes to the code had been made by a previous editor, and were shown as such. I have experiences several occasions where the wiki change system reports as mine things I have not done. It may be caused by a bug in the save mechanism, or automatic reformatting, but it does not make me responsible.</em> -- jpf

      <p>
        Perhaps that depends on your operating system. At any rate, <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/history/TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction/8">http://c2.com/wiki/history/TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction/8</a> shows the original, and <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/history/TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction/9">http://c2.com/wiki/history/TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction/9</a> shows the result of your edit, whilst <a href="http:posts?TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction">http:posts?TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction</a> shows you created version 9. A corrected link for the changes you made is <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/histDiff.cgi?page=TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction&old=8&new=9&ip=80.229.30.99&time=1135641090.">http://c2.com/cgi/histDiff.cgi?page=TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction&old=8&new=9&ip=80.229.30.99&time=1135641090.</a> If you know of any other recent time when a change seemed to be misreported, please mention the pagename here, as the history files are kept for only a few days.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I tried looking for older history e.g. </em><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/histDiff.cgi?page=130.76.64.14&old=7&new=8">http://c2.com/cgi/histDiff.cgi?page=130.76.64.14&old=7&new=8</a> and there is no change reported at all. Your previous edit of this page (Revision 219) show you as changing my paragraph as well as your own. The only change appears to be that the lines are longer. I wonder if this is what is causing it - format instructions. That will of course be replaced by this edit.<em> -- jpf</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Version 8 of the <a href="TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction.html">TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction</a> page was probably created by 130.76.64.14 (a US ip address) on August 5 2005. That's far too long ago for the history file to be around still, but you would have been able to see the changes by that person by looking at the <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> for the page before editing it. When the specified history files are unavailable, no changes are listed by <a href="HistDiff.html">HistDiff</a>. The missing files(s) don't cause an error message. The problem lies with certain software treating a "\" character at the end of a line in a special way. As for revision 219 of this page, I did change your paragraph - I added a comma to it. That's a technique for keeping the previous contribution visible - it shows as a paragraph with a minor correction or punctuation change. Had your previous edit changed several paragraphs, I would not necessarily have re-edited all of them. Most people don't use this technique, so you can't rely on it.

        <em>To go back to where all this started, I have been looking at the code on </em><a href="TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction.html">TemplateMetafunctionHasFunction</a> and related pages. I have been able to generate some of the incomprehensible error messages discussed on <a href="TemplatesSmell.html">TemplatesSmell</a> and have made some progress. I think I need to move to a better compiler than gcc 3.3.3, which I have been able to crash with this code. That then raises the problem of how to make code available on Wiki without causing the problem before of lines ending with '\' causing problems for Wiki. That means that the long macro which is central to that code would have to be done in one long line, or else put the code up with spaces which would be a problem for someone copying it and trying to use it.<em> -- jpf</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the compiler needs lines ending in "\", just add a trailing space for wiki purposes, but add a note telling people to remove those added trailing spaces if they are copying the code to compile using it. It's unlikely that source code would need a mix of lines with and without the trailing space.

        <strong>Creating </strong><a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a> pages<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a humbling experience. It is a bit like writing a paper which writes itself. I set out a few days ago to adapt what was there already, keeping all of the contributions which were already there, including some of my own from long ago. These were all jumbled up, as they would be on wiki, as different things had been added. I designed a scheme and set about it, but cannot do all that in one session, owing to the need to sleep, eat, work etc. Usually, when writing a paper, the feedback comes when I ask for it. Here, the page <em>does not belong to me</em> so it grows in its own way. So that what <em>I</em> want in the end is unimportant. Which is the case anyway as what I really want is to share the knowledge, and for that I have to let go of control. The knowledge was not mine anyway to keep. Even the bits I have figured out for myself, which are not on these pages <em>yet</em>, don't belong to me. So thank you to all those who are involved, including some I know only from their electronic tags. -- jpf

      <p>
        I should add that "Signature Change" is a shorthand for moving between Clifford algebras of different basis type but the same dimension e.g. from Cl(4) (<em>all real</em>) to Cl(3,1) <em>(1 imaginary)</em> to Cl(1,3) <em>(3 imaginary)</em>.

        It is interesting to note that general relativists have found that, in almost all situations (with apparently certain exceptions in certain extensions to GR), Cl(1,3) and Cl(3,1) (spacetime signatures +++- and ---+) are ultimately equivalent, e.g. in yielding the same predictions. I alternate between seeing that as natural and seeing it as surprising. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        There is an article in <a href="NewScientist.html">NewScientist</a> this week ("A leap into hyperspace" 7 January 2006, p.24) which discusses the work of Burkhard Heim. See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heim_theory">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heim_theory</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkhard_Heim.">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burkhard_Heim.</a> My interest is that this is a mathematical theory of everything which includes extra dimensions. I have only begun to read the various articles, including this reference given by the <a href="NewScientist.html">NewScientist</a> - <a href="http://www.heim-theory.com/.">http://www.heim-theory.com/.</a> I have not seen any link to <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>, but there do seem to be some similarities to <a href="WickRotation.html">WickRotation</a>. Does anyone else know anything about this? -- jpf
      </p>
      <p>
        Heim theory's inclusion of extra dimensions is not the uncommon thing you seem to think it is; extra dimensions (particularly compactified ones) arose in the 1921 Kaluza-Klein theory (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza-Klein_theory)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kaluza-Klein_theory)</a> that fairly successfully unified <a href="GeneralRelativity.html">GeneralRelativity</a> and MaxwellsEquations/electromagnetism by adding a fifth, compactified dimension to the 4 of space-time in GR. Heim uses very much that same approach - as does <a href="StringTheory.html">StringTheory</a>, for that matter; Kaluza-Klein was and is famous and influential in fundamental physics, because it was so successful. "Merely" adding still more dimensions to Kaluza-Klein in order to further unify the weak and strong nuclear forces turned out to be extremely problematic, but in a certain sense, <a href="StringTheory.html">StringTheory</a> is more or less just the most recent and most sophisticated approach to doing exactly that.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Wick rotation is nothing more and nothing less than converting -x^2 to (x*i)^2 in some equation, any equation, in any area of physics, although as I mentioned it signals a negatively curved dimension and hence is particularly interesting in special relativity. But by the same token, it sort of <strong>has</strong> to be lurking in any similar theory, including Heim's, whether it is done explicitly or just left implicit.)
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, the most interesting claims about Heim's work are <strong>not</strong> peer reviewed, and therefore the claims are almost certain to be either wrong or misleading. For instance, the wikipedia article claims fundamental particle mass prediction accurate to within 1:10000. I have the following critiques of this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Contrary to common opinion, and contrary to explicit claims on that wikipedia page, the Standard Model can in fact predict the mass of fundamental particles, and far more accurately than merely one part in ten thousand. The misunderstanding comes up because a major critique is that the Standard Model is not the ideal of being parameter-free; it requires (IIRC) somewhere around 50 parameters - and masses of fundamental particles are one of the <strong>traditional</strong> input parameters. However, one can input other kinds of experimentally-derived parameters instead, and use the Standard Model to predict masses pretty accurately.
        </li>
        <li>
           In the absence of peer review, this claim may simply be false; his equations may not produce any such accuracy.
        </li>
        <li>
           Even if the predictions <strong>are</strong> that accurate, this is nowhere near as amazing as it may sound, because he clearly fitted his theory to the data, rather than making a <strong>prediction</strong> (well, he does also make some predictions, some of which are known to be wrong, and others predict particles that others have also predicted but that are as yet untestable).
        </li>
        <li>
           He uses multiple mass formulae rather than one unified one, for instance. Retrodiction is desirable simply because the lack thereof means a theory is <strong>wrong</strong>; retrodiction, especially with loose error bars, is not necessarily a big deal in itself.
        </li>
        <li>
           Compare with back when the (inverse of the) fine structure constant was thought to be the integer 137, there were any number of theories that showed that "137" was magic for one reason or another - all of which of course turned out to be wrong, since it's actually known to be something more like 137.03600977 (and approximately mu0 c e^2 / 2 h with less precision).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It would appear that physicists consider his work very fringe, but is popular with e.g. UFO fans, because of his notions for a space drive. That doesn't mean he's wrong, but fundamental physicists are not so closed-minded as those UFO fans always think they are. If someone thought they could win a Nobel prize by continuing Heim's work, I guarantee you they'd be all over it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not really qualified to evaluate his work in fine detail, but in broad approach there doesn't seem to be anything unique about it at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the usual rule of thumb is, "why spend time proving whether an apparently fringe theory is actually true or not?".
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want a truly qualified opinion, though, try asking about it in sci.physics.research. People like Bill Unruh and John Baez could give a truly expert opinion, and the question doesn't appear to have been asked there before, although it was in other newsgroups (science fiction, ufo, etc) over the last decade, including today.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want a really good overview of how these things are approached, see Physical Review D, "Particles and Fields -- Review of Particle Properties", published every two years. It summarizes all of the best experimental results and evidence for and against the Standard Model, predictions of other theories that contradict the Standard Model, tests that potentially could falsify the Standard Model, and of course, highly detailed tables of all particle properties. The stuff that has been carefully tested to try to disprove the Standard Model is pretty mind blowing; far more wide ranging than one would every guess.

But I wrote about <a href="JayRuby.html">JayRuby</a> here a couple weeks ago and just finished ranting about <a href="SmugRubyWeenie.html">SmugRubyWeenie</a>s.

        I have started to look at items in CategorySemanticWeb such as <a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a>, <a href="DublinCore.html">DublinCore</a>, <a href="PracticalRdf.html">PracticalRdf</a> and <a href="ResourceDescriptionFramework.html">ResourceDescriptionFramework</a>. The pages existing before I started seem to have been contributed by a number of different intiatives over a period of time and were not all linked. I am attempting to build a more complete framework. There is now a page for <a href="RedlandRdfLibraries.html">RedlandRdfLibraries</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has lead me on to look at ways in which I could organise my software. One way is to use <a href="GnowSys.html">GnowSys</a>, a set of software built on the <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a>. I have now been promised uptodate source for <a href="GnowSys.html">GnowSys</a> and so am creating a page for it. In the meantime I have done some tidying work on the old references to ZoPe and have learned a lot in the course of doing it. I thought I had done this job, increasing <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> to over 70 references. It turns out that there are another 100 or so to Zope or zope which were not showing up at all as it is not a wiki word by itself. A lot more work is to be done collecting them in. The reference count is now up to 91 on 20071225. Most of the unchanged ones are in home pages or are the string <em>zope</em> in a web reference. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are several <a href="ContentManagementSystem.html">ContentManagementSystem</a>s built on top of Zope. I have installed <a href="PloNe.html">PloNe</a> and <a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a> as a way of capturing my own information. These do not (yet) have an interface to <a href="ResourceDescriptionFramework.html">ResourceDescriptionFramework</a> data. I have then found <a href="CollaborativePortalServer.html">CollaborativePortalServer</a> which does have an interface to <a href="RedlandRdfLibraries.html">RedlandRdfLibraries</a> and also runs on top of Zope. I have been using <a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a> for the first time and I find it very different from other wikis because of the automatic <a href="PageHierarchy.html">PageHierarchy</a> which is not present in other wikis I have used.

        I have created a page for myself on <a href="SemanticMediaWiki.html">SemanticMediaWiki</a>s as as follows

        I am starting to get a feel for how to use a wiki with semantic features. What would be very nice would be to construct a tool which could extract information from an existing wiki e.g. this one and add semantic content.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also beginning to get a feel for how to enrich the connections between pages. For example, in the pages linked to <a href="http://www.semanticweb.org/wiki/Periodic_table">http://www.semanticweb.org/wiki/Periodic_table</a> I have been able to enrich links such as <em>See Periodic table</em> to have the meaning <em>Has explanation: Periodic table</em> where the wiki will collect and index this information, which can be exported using RDF (<a href="ResourceDescriptionFramework.html">ResourceDescriptionFramework</a>). Also, the category concept can be carried much further.

        I have been looking at <a href="FunctoidsInCpp.html">FunctoidsInCpp</a> again with particular reference to the problems discussed last year in <a href="ContinuationPassingStyleInCeePlusPlus.html">ContinuationPassingStyleInCeePlusPlus</a>. Particular problems have come to light which I had not realised before. These come in the <strong>FC++</strong> lambda language, which makes use of <a href="OverloadingCommaOperator.html">OverloadingCommaOperator</a> in combination with <a href="ArgumentDependentNameLookup.html">ArgumentDependentNameLookup</a>. This makes some assumptions about the types of the arguments which are usually valid but lead to some unexpected failures. I have been finding ways around these and learning yet more about the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the problems is that when <a href="ArgumentDependentNameLookup.html">ArgumentDependentNameLookup</a> of the comma operator does not succeed, the compilation process proceeds by ignoring the argument before the comma. I have been able to modify the behaviour by changing the types of the arguments so that they are found. I cannot find a way to generalize this so that the problem objects are retyped automatically. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        September 2008. I am revisiting my previous work on the <a href="ParallelProgrammingModel.html">ParallelProgrammingModel</a>. There is a new way of doing efficient matrix computation in single precision, which is to use the processor capacity of the graphics processor!! This leads to thinking whether double precision all the time is the best way to do things. Instead, using single precision to start with and then refining the answer may be quicker. I plan to start a page on this. One resource in use at the moment is the book <a href="PatternsForParallelProgramming.html">PatternsForParallelProgramming</a>. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

Along with this I want to explore links between the ideas of <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> and the <a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a> -> <a href="LiterateProgrammingAndTheSemanticWeb.html">LiterateProgrammingAndTheSemanticWeb</a>. <a href="CubicWeb.html">CubicWeb</a> has an option to use <a href="ReStructuredText.html">ReStructuredText</a> (which has had a page here since 2004). It is used by <a href="DocUtils.html">DocUtils</a> which is a <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> thing not yet mentioned here. I have also just found <a href="PyLit.html">PyLit</a>. I am getting rather excited about the potential of <a href="CubicWeb.html">CubicWeb</a> and some of the other interests here are concerned with ways of getting information out of other wikilike things and into it. It always turns out to be easier to get presentation information out than structural information including links. A warning there not to be enthusiastic too quickly without checking the export options. I am finding <a href="CorePythonProgramming.html">CorePythonProgramming</a> helpful for this work.

           I have looked at the descriptions about <a href="CubicWeb.html">CubicWeb</a> and it appears to be promising. I appreciate the work you have put in to contribute useful commentary and information, and I note that you have been around for about ten years doing so! I am a fan of <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> and utilize it everyday and on every browsing session.

           I am making notebooks which are resultant of particular topics or certain individuals. I established one today with the name of C2_Wikizens_JohnFletcher. It starts with a capture of this page and the links from it to this wiki and includes external links. One of the great things about <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> is its indexing capabilities, which I find <a href="UsefulUsableUsed.html">UsefulUsableUsed</a> on many occasions. I am starting another one called Information_Forms_Textual, which will include the links you have made just recently.
        </li>
        <li>
           As you know, I have been working on some software which deals with some of the same things you are interested in, including approaches addressing the <a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a>, I am taking a somewhat different approach than the <a href="CubicWeb.html">CubicWeb</a>. Where they have "Cubes", I have "Artifactories". My software is in the building mode and will employ both local executables and the use of the browser and Websites, with the Home site being <a href="SunflowerSynergies.html">SunflowerSynergies</a>, which will be my Web Collective for the various ideas and implementations which will be synergistic, therefore the name. 
        </li>
        <li>
           I agree that the discourse on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> has been several degrees less than in the past when people talked "to" other wikizens about areas of common interest and not "about" others and problems of wiki socialization. I have continued in what I see as the core of what this wiki is, and that is Dialogue. I will continue to expose my thinking in my <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a> contributions and in conversations such as this one. The <a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a> is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>, and also a huge idea. It is being approached, but so far does not have many personally applicable executives to employ it in a Personal InformationManager and management system. I would rather use than build, but have been forced to do the later until something fitting the bill comes along. Building is an effort which in today's dynamically developing scenarios, is changing the rules, fabric, users, and needs at a pace difficult for a small development team to keep up with.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ideas and their development in the area of personal usability is where I am at. When something like <a href="TiddlyWiki.html">TiddlyWiki</a> and <a href="CubicWeb.html">CubicWeb</a> come along, I see more in them a promise of an idea, sort of like a nugget or metallic ore. The idea is there, refined, but not yet refactored for use in a simple schema, using text and text derivatives (no complicated databases), in an ongoing, consistent, connected, and in an extensible, exchangeable format, using words for ArtifactNames, including, ExtendedWords, CompoundWords and compound words joined but separated by underscores. 
        </li>
        <li>
           It has seemed in the past that what I have had to say, and the ideas I am working on, have except for a few persons, escaped much dialogue. It may be that only 3 or 4 people have seen in what I am seeking, a common interest. 
        </li>
        <li>
           In my <a href="SunflowerSynergies.html">SunflowerSynergies</a>, I am trying to create a venue for a clearer exposition of my ideas and the ideas of others in applicable, reachable and realizable reality. It will be a slow development, but hopefully one that will past the test of time, and not be here today, gone tomorrow. With the affordability of space on the personal level of massive proportions (in the tens and soon hundreds of terabytes), what you do, build and use need not disappear, and should attain a permanent "reachability", both for personal and shared usages.
        </li>
        <li>
           An new form of permanent survivable archival storage is required for what I propose as the <a href="LibraryOfNewAlexandria.html">LibraryOfNewAlexandria</a>, where all of what is to become "reachable" is stored and made available by various, including future schemes and scenarios.

        <em>This site is more about the organization of experience than the preservation of history.</em>

        The thought I am having is that without some history to reflect on I cannot organise my experience. He does use the word <em>more</em>.

      <p>
        <em>organization of experience</em> vs. <em>preservation of history</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Interesting. Although I think they describe the same dichotomy, these words make more sense to me than the words <em>document mode</em> vs. <em>thread mode</em>. It's funny - there are some wiki pages I consider "good pages", but I cannot say what makes a good wiki page. Some good pages have history, some do not. Maybe Ward's comment has to do with history being a "means" of organizing experience on wiki, not an "end", or "purpose", of wiki. -- <a href="StanSilver.html">StanSilver</a>

I noticed that there was a page called <a href="EtPlusPlus.html">EtPlusPlus</a> on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Anything with PlusPlus in the name looks interesting to me. What is this? It turns out that it some code which no longer exists, but the reference was on the web page of <a href="IvTools.html">IvTools</a> which still does exist and is in current development. So I have followed that up and found also <a href="IplPackage.html">IplPackage</a> (<em>Invocation Programming Language</em>) and a number of other related pages, explained best by looking at <a href="ScottJohnston.html">ScottJohnston</a>'s page. There is also a link to history as some of this code was written while people were discovering patterns, which is the reason this wiki is here in the first place. Time well spent.

        I have started a page for <a href="GeometricAlgebraForComputerGraphics.html">GeometricAlgebraForComputerGraphics</a> by John Vince, which I found recently in a bookshop.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Until recently I thought that the best approach to the solution of a set of linear equations, or related eigenvalue problems, could be found through use of LAPACK (<a href="LinearAlgebraPackage.html">LinearAlgebraPackage</a>) or related libraries which apply standard numerical methods to the matrix or matrices and produce answers subject only to the roundoff errors. I have now found that there are a class of iterative methods which can solve some large matrix problems using less memory and more quickly. Some of these have only been clearly defined in recent years. There is very little on this wiki about numerical solution of equations, so I don't think I am going to start a lot of pages on this topic here.
      </p>
      <p>
        By 'large', do you mean 'large, but sparse'?
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a good question to which I am working on the practical answer. I had assumed that the matrices were not sparse and so had not looked at techniques directed at sparse problems, with the exception of the Arnoldi method (ARPACK) which I have used to find a small number of eigenvalues. However, the matrices are now so large that it looks as though there is an advantage to use e.g. GMRES.
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer to the question is that for an example, about 60% of the matrix entries are zeroes, but the rest are so distrubuted that sparse methods are difficult to deploy. It does mean that there are some methods which are called 'sparse direct methods' do help.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the problems get larger and larger, the methods needed have to be more and more parallel in implementation, something which is coming to be known as <a href="ExascaleComputing.html">ExascaleComputing</a>.

        I find this very interesting. The links LeftBrain and RightBrain are unfilled. This has been around since at least 2007. I wonder if there has been much debate about this. I did get a comment on <a href="TheMasterAndHisEmissary.html">TheMasterAndHisEmissary</a> to the effect that left and right brain had been debunked. I am tempted to start the pages.
