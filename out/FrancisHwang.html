        Every time I edit a page here, I try to make Wiki more useful. Sometimes I add words, sometimes I edit words, sometimes I move words, and sometimes I delete words. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a problem with any edit I make, please feel free to speak up about it. Please note that I'm human like everybody else, which means you'll get further with me if you are polite.

        I'm a software engineer, artist, and writer who lives in <a href="NewYorkCity.html">NewYorkCity</a>. My day job is at Rhizome (<a href="http://rhizome.org),">http://rhizome.org),</a> where I have discovered that I enjoy fulfilling tech requests from artists and academics far more than I enjoy fulfilling similar requests from marketing execs. Astounding!

        <em>I saw the following reference "Hwang, F. Commando Line Interface. Wired 8, 2 (February 2000), 52" in an article about PSDoom. Is that you?</em>

      <p>
        Yup. That article (minus the screenshot that ran with it in the print version) is at <a href="http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/eword.html?pg=4">http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.02/eword.html?pg=4</a> . -- francis

        I am looking for a good book (or two or three) to help me get a good foundation in dealing with concurrency in general. I tried to find references to such books in our pages but couldn't find any. Anybody have some pointers for me? -- francis

        If you're working in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, or are willing to try to extract general principles from a language-specific book, <a href="DougLea.html">DougLea</a>'s <em></em><a href="ConcurrentProgrammingInJava.html">ConcurrentProgrammingInJava</a><em> covers the topic reasonably well. He concentrates on principles and techniques, using Java for the examples. -- </em>MarkIrons
