        Companies Hire Like Minded
      </h1>
      <p>
        Companies tend to hire people that think like they do (for good or bad). Thus, statements such as, "companies I worked for tend to do X", may not extrapolate to preferences of every company. We leave a lot of subtle and not so subtle clues about what tools and style we prefer and how we think in our resumes, interviews, references, social media sites, and referral channels.

        <em>Wikis can be similar, attracting a certain crowd of people.  For example this wiki originally attracted smalltalker/XP people - but now that a lot of them are dormant and non-active, other relational/formal/imperative/functional lunatics have taken over the wiki ;-)</em>
