        The code generation rate of a development group is a linear function of the number of developers, while the idea generation rate is exponential. The ratio, <em>i.e.</em> productivity, therefore approaches zero.

        And I thought, the idea generation rate was quadratic, because the communication possible/required is quadratic. At least, I don't think that it is exponential.

        But the productivity approaches zero anyway :-)

        <em>It could be exponential because the ideas may come as </em>'2^n<em>', being the number of ways you can get a sub-collection of developers.</em>

        Remember that not all idea generators are developers, some aren't even employers.

        Can you buy an IdeaGenerator at Amazon? I want one!

        <em>Sure. It's called a "book". ;-)</em>
