        Primitive Recursive
      </h1>
      <p>
        Primitive recursion is a weak form of recursion where one only recurses upon sub-structural elements of an input. Perhaps oddly, many non-recursive functions can be stated to exhibit primitive recursion under common definitions of the phrase.
      </p>
      <p>
        A traditional target of primitive recursion are natural numbers expressed in Peano arithmetic s(s(s(0)))). In languages such as <a href="CharityLanguage.html">CharityLanguage</a>, this is the form of natural numbers exposed to users even when, under the hood, one is still using a fixed width small integer (up to two billion or so). It is common in such languages that 'Nat' is treated as primitive and 'Int' is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow, short of running out of memory and stalling like a naively written Fibonacci function, <a href="PrimitiveRecursive.html">PrimitiveRecursive</a> functions are 'total'. They will always terminate. They are not <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>, and enforcing primitive recursion allows one to achieve <a href="TotalFunctionalProgramming.html">TotalFunctionalProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>First order</em> primitive recursion is insufficient to express <a href="AckermannFunction.html">AckermannFunction</a>, but <em>second order</em> primitive recursion may do so:
      </p>
      <code>
        ;; Traditional formulation is not expressed primitive recursive due to recursive call on s(M)<br/>
        Ackermann   0    N  = s(N)<br/>
        Ackermann s(M)   0  = {Ackermann M 1}<br/>
        Ackermann s(M) s(N) = {Ackermann M {Ackermann s(M) N}}<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; Instead, define it in terms of one primitive recursive function returning another<br/>
        define Ackermann = <br/>
        fun Ack:    0   => {fun: N => s(N)}<br/>
        s(M)  => {fun Aux:    0   => {Ack M s(0)}     ;; 'Ack' on sub-structure of its argument<br/>
        |  s(N)  => {Ack M {Aux N}}} ;; 'Ack' and 'Aux' each recurse on their respective arguments<br/>
      </code>
