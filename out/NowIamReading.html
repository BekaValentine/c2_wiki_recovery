        What are the <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> reading right now? If you are curious, click on the title of this page and see who is reading what.

      <p>
        If you want to tell the other <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> what you are reading, put a link to this page in your homepage, with the name of the book, the ISBN code and, if you want, a link to the <a href="BookShelved.html">BookShelved</a> wiki.

        <em>Interesting idea, but it seems like a lot of trouble on this wiki, compared to very little trouble on </em><a href="BookShelved.html">BookShelved</a>.  Assuming the page refers only to books, not wiki pages .. are we gonna need it?<em></em>

        Well, I found lots of interesting books (SW Engineering related or not) just reading the homepages of the wikizens, so I think it would be useful.
