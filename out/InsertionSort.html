        The Insertion Sort works by picking an element, figuring out where it should go, then putting it there. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="BinarySearch.html">BinarySearch</a> to figure where the item should go gives the following runtime analysis:
      </p>
      <code>
        Worst case  Average case  Best case<br/>
        Comparisons    O(n log n)   O(n log n)   O(n log n)<br/>
        Swaps            O(n^2)       O(n^2)        O(1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If you use <a href="LinearSearch.html">LinearSearch</a> to find the item location this changes to:
      </p>
      <code>
        Worst case  Average case  Best case<br/>
        Comparisons      O(n^2)       O(n^2)        O(n)<br/>
        Swaps            O(n^2)       O(n^2)        O(1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If you expect your data to be mostly sorted the <a href="LinearSearch.html">LinearSearch</a> version might be faster, but <a href="BubbleSort.html">BubbleSort</a> might work better anyway. Beware of <a href="BinarySearch.html">BinarySearch</a> - it is subtle and error-prone, even when using versions from the published literature.
      </p>
      <p>
        If comparisons are cheap and swaps expensive you'd be better using <a href="SelectionSort.html">SelectionSort</a>.

        <a href="InsertionSort.html">InsertionSort</a>, <a href="SelectionSort.html">SelectionSort</a> and <a href="MergeSort.html">MergeSort</a> are all <a href="StableSort.html">StableSort</a>s, whereas the famous <a href="QuickSort.html">QuickSort</a> is not.

        I think this is an example of YAGNI <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>. -- <a href="TakuyaMurata.html">TakuyaMurata</a>

        <em>I don't. See the comment in </em><a href="SelectionSort.html">SelectionSort</a>. It also means you can <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> the binary search, which is notoriously difficult to get right first time.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that binary search is rather difficult to implement correctly. -- <a href="TakuyaMurata.html">TakuyaMurata</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Aren't most things notoriously difficult to get right first time? In the above case, it's very easy to find a correct algorithm in a book or internet site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, yes, but I think the point about abstracting for clarity still stands. In this case the real YAGNI benefit comes from using a library routine and not writing or looking up any algorithm</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, we can use upper_bound of STL though you have to implement it in C. -- <a href="TakuyaMurata.html">TakuyaMurata</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I meant that you shouldn't code a sort at all. Are there any languages for which this isn't in the standard library or the language itself now?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many languages have implementations of sort, but not all implement a stable version when it's possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And if you want one of those, you probably shouldn't choose </em><a href="InsertionSort.html">InsertionSort</a>. A copy of Knuth to hand would be a good idea.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Not only is a binary search difficult to implement correctly, it doesn't gain you anything in this case. Every element in the already-sorted set greater than the element being inserted will have to be accessed in order to make room for the element being inserted, so you may as well combine the movement of the data with the comparison:
      </p>
      <code>
        void insertion_sort(int a[], int elementCount) {<br/>
        int i;<br/>
        for (i = 1; i < elementCount; i++) {<br/>
        int insertee = a[i], j;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        for (j = i - 1; j >= 0 && insertee > a[j]; j--)<br/>
        a[j+1] = a[j];<br/>
        a[j] = insertee;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Incidentally, this approach is also stable, unlike the binary-search version. It's also about half the size.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>I think I should design and write a test case that drives my code with the kind of data that I think demands a special kind of sort, and that confirms that the sort routine answers within whatever performance criteria my customer requires. In a call center, for example, the initial redirect to an agent </em>'must<strong> take place within five seconds or the caller will hang up (this has been confirmed empirically with decades of experience). I think that any sort routine that passes my test is appropriate, regardless of algorithm or origin. If I think I really </strong>need<em>' an insertion sort, I should find a test case that demonstrates the need.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        May we discuss an algorithm without worrying about how we would do it while extreme programming? Pretty please, can we just discuss the algorithm?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why? It's not as if sort algorithms were a poorly-understood area. Any decent algorithms text will cover them adequately, and there's always Knuth if you want all the details</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think a library of test cases that illustrate the key differences of the various sorting algorithms might be a useful component of </em>'any<em>' modern instructional text.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the recipe (in favor of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>) should be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Need sorting anyway? Surprisingly, many times you don't need to sort data. You could use another <a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a> that stores items in order, such as SortedSet of Java.
        </li>
        <li>
           Need coding sorting anyway? As you might guess, the library usually provides some sorting facilities, some do as library some do as built-in feature. If it is not the case, you can find out public-domained sorting code just like I put here.
        </li>
        <li>
           Need to use complex algorithm rather simple one (in this case <a href="SelectionSort.html">SelectionSort</a>)?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words, if you are a computer scientist student, want to kill spare time and want to have fun (like me), write sorting code. -- <a href="TakuyaMurata.html">TakuyaMurata</a>

      <p>
        <a href="InsertionSort.html">InsertionSort</a>: assume the first section of your array is sorted, take the next element and put it where it has to go. You can use a binary search to find the right place to put it, but on average when you do insert it you have to move half the items already sorted. Time-complexity is either (n-1)*(n-2)/2 comparisons if you use linear search to find the right place to put your item, or a much smaller and more complex expression if you use binary search (roughly log2(n)), and an expected (n-1)*(n-2)/2 moves. Can easily be stable.
