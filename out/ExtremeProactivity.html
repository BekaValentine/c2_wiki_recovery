        Extreme Proactivity
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ExtremeProactivity.html">ExtremeProactivity</a> is what is often called "courage" or "aggressiveness" of "fearlessness" in XP. It is one of the <a href="ExtremePrinciples.html">ExtremePrinciples</a> XP uses to achieve its goal to <a href="EmbraceChangeContinuously.html">EmbraceChangeContinuously</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tend to categorize the various ways to respond to change (<a href="EmbraceChange.html">EmbraceChange</a>) as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>Inactive</em>::	Doesnt do anything about it. Pretend it doesnt exist; Ignore it and maybe it will go away (Psychologists call this denial - see the <a href="FiveStagesOfGrief.html">FiveStagesOfGrief</a> ;-)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <em>Reactive</em>::	Wait to do something about it until it kicks you in the seat of the pants; Then start running around in a frenzy and do a quick rush job or hack-job.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <em>Responsive</em>::	Respond to it very quickly and take action as soon as you are made aware of the problem.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <em>Proactive</em>::	Make yourself aware of the problem (or potential problem) and respond to it before others have to bring it to your attention.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I would consider the description of <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> to be a clear example of <a href="ExtremeProactivity.html">ExtremeProactivity</a>. You dont wait for the "code-owner" to do it. If you perceive the problem, you address it right then and there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some might consider <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> (YAGNI) as an example where XP recommends being reactive over being proactive. I would disagree. I think YAGNI is an example of <a href="ExtremeProactivity.html">ExtremeProactivity</a> tempered by <a href="ContinuousSimplicity.html">ContinuousSimplicity</a>. YAGNI is talking about waiting to add something to the design because it is more of a "possible want" rather than a "definite need" (see <a href="ExtremeNeed.html">ExtremeNeed</a>). There's no problem yet, just a possibility that might or might not turn into a need someday. <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> tells you to <em>fix</em> a problem yourself when you see it; it does not tell you to add something to fulfill a need that hasnt been asked for yet.
        So I would say YAGNI is about being extremely proactive with regard to <em>simplicity</em>!
