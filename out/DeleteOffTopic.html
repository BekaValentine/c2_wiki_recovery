        Hi there!
      </p>
      <p>
        You've probably come here from a recently created page whose text may soon be deleted, or has already been replaced with this message.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you created the page, we are sorry, but your content doesn't appear to fit within the topics of this wiki, namely <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>. Please understand that we mean no harm in deleting your page. In fact, we'd be delighted to have you contribute some on topic pages. Please read <a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a> for more information about this wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        While your content may not fit in here, there are many other <a href="PublicWikiForums.html">PublicWikiForums</a> available. Have a look through the list at PublicWikiForumsCategorized and see if there's an existing wiki that will fit your needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Failing that, there are many, many <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> available with which you can run your own wiki. See <a href="RunningYourOwnWikiFaq.html">RunningYourOwnWikiFaq</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wish to access the content of the page you created, it can still be accessed for a short time at <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/history/'''Name''''''Of''''''Page'''/">http://c2.com/wiki/history/'''Name''''''Of''''''Page'''/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've read this page, it would be appreciated if you finished the deletion by replacing the text <em>DeleteOffTopic</em> with the text <em>delete</em> on your off topic page.

      <p>
        If you're not the person who created the page, please wait at least a full day before seconding this deletion, so that the original poster will have time to see this message. Also consider using <a href="DeleteOffTopic.html">DeleteOffTopic</a> yourself when deleting off topic pages; it keeps Wiki a welcoming environment for newcomers who are unfamiliar with the wiki social norms.
