        Ozymandias Principle
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>The least important and/or most embarrassing part of a computer system is the part which will inevitably outlive all the others.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        From the poem 'Ozymandias' by Percy Bysshe Shelly
      </p>
      <code>
        I met a traveller from an antique land <br/>
        Who said: `Two vast and trunkless legs of stone <br/>
        Stand in the desert. Near them, on the sand, <br/>
        Half sunk, a shattered visage lies, whose frown, <br/>
        And wrinkled lip, and sneer of cold command, <br/>
      </code>

      <code>
        Tell that its sculptor well those passions read <br/>
        Which yet survive, stamped on these lifeless things, <br/>
        The hand that mocked them and the heart that fed. <br/>
        And on the pedestal these words appear - <br/>
        "My name is Ozymandias, king of kings: <br/>
        Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!" <br/>
        Nothing beside remains. Round the decay <br/>
        Of that colossal wreck, boundless and bare <br/>
        The lone and level sands stretch far away.<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Wouldn't a better principle (more related to the poem) be that "all systems will eventually decay"?  After all, Ozymandias (a fictional King, though likely a reference to Ramses of Egypt) was probably a rather powerful fellow in his time--all that remains of his rule and his realm is a broken statue.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The principle is all systems fade away, except the most embarrassing horrible parts (think XMODEM). They decay slowly, leaving sad monuments to themselves.

        <em>Now really this Ozymandias guy, could we not find him a better name ? I mean geeks remember concepts like </em><a href="DontRepeatYourself.html">DontRepeatYourself</a>, design patterns like <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a>, etc, even people's names have found their way into concepts: see <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>, or the nice theorems of Pythagora, Ceva, Ptolemy. But <strong>Ozymandias</strong> ? Give me a break. One can only imagine naming this guy in a discussion and reading on the face of everybody: "this guy is full of it". <em></em>

        <em>The bard has chosen such a stupid name with the purpose to achieve a stylistic effect. It makes sense in the context of a rusty old piece of poetry, but as the name of a "principle" the name of Ozymandias is completely oblique. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why yes. The stupid name of the principle will withstand the tests of time, while all else crumbles to dust around it. Utterly appropriately wrong name there, hum?
