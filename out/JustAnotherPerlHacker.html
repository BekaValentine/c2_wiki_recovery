        after the perl interpreter got through with it.  It has since grown into
        a favourite past-time of PerlHackers to strain their knowledge of the
        language in both creating and trying to understand these bits of code.

        I've always found it fascinating that C and Perl programmers take such
        delight in ObfuscationContest(s).  This, as much of anything else, tells
        us about the cultural mindsets prevalent in this community.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find it telling that there is no obfuscated <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> contest, nor
        <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a>, etc.  Could users of these languages be more
        interested in solving difficult, real world problems instead?
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always found writing clear C/C++ a challenge (and I don't think I've
        ever succeeded in writing really clear Perl, after many many years).
        Those language's emphasis on HeavySyntax make the task of getting the
        program right difficult at the expense of the overarching design and
        problem being solved.  I think that SyntaxConsideredHarmful applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our field mature, I think we will need to cease trying to impress
        each other by how many obscure exceptions to the language we can remember,
        and concentrate instead on solving difficult <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> Problem(s).
        In this respect, I think the development of <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> is a step
        in the right direction.  --<a href="AlainPicard.html">AlainPicard</a>

        Not a problem, my friend.

      <p>
        To paraphrase <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a>, the same thing that makes it possible to
        write really obfuscated code in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, is the same thing that
        allows one to write really beautiful code.  Perl, to me, is freedom.
        As I program in it, I get the feeling that
        <a href="ThereIsNothingPerlCannotDo.html">ThereIsNothingPerlCannotDo</a>.

      <p>
        Of course, not every PerlProgrammer is a FreedomLovingPerlPoet.
        WithFreedomComesResponsibility and there are many programmers who
        are not disciplined enough to wield this freedom effectively.  Many
        people have faulted <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> for allowing this to happen, but I
        ask you -- can discipline <em>really</em> be enforced by a language?  Is
        not the only true discipline <em></em><a href="SelfDiscipline.html">SelfDiscipline</a><em> ?</em>

        I have a friend who will take your beautiful <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> and make
        it his bitch.  This is not a boast on my part -- I'm actually rather
        disturbed.  My point is that writing code in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> will not
        magically make my friend write beautiful code.  --<a href="JohnBeppu.html">JohnBeppu</a>

        People have compared <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> to <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> in readability; one can write really good object-oriented code very clearly.  And yet it's flexible enough that you can obfuscate the hell out of things if you so desire.  It has some great features that contribute to this, like Perlish regexps, and C++ish overloaded operators.  --NickBenesma
