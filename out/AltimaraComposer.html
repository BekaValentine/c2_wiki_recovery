        Altimara used to make a nifty still compositing package (think <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a> layers, except on steroids). Then <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a> came out with layers, and while <a href="AltimaraComposer.html">AltimaraComposer</a> was better, <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a> was <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> for most people, thus making Altimara lose MarketShare. Altimara sold out to <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>, which renamed the program MicrosoftImageComposer, which is a surprisingly nifty program that can only be gotten with FrontPage2000.
