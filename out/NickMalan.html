      <p>
        Nick Malan has recently separated from the United States AirForce. He currently is working as a server administrator in Oklahoma. JesusChrist has been a driving force in his life and seeks a more intimite relationship with God. JesusChrist is king and ruler and I hope that one day all would come to know JesusChrist as a personal Lord and Savior. He is currently improving the content on his churches website. Check out his pasters messages on <a href="http://www.choctawroad.org">http://www.choctawroad.org</a> .

        It is obvious that he desires to learn more about computing and using such technology in the things he feels strongly about. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20080130

        Another large contribution I have made to the web is on a website called Geni. I have a family website with a large database. Geni has made collaboration within my family easy.

        You had previously written "anything done by him only comes from God". 
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this no longer apply or does it mean your poor spelling comes from God?

        My Poor spelling comes from my lack of attention to detail. I enjoy contributing on the web and hope that those that read what I have pay more attention to what is being said and less on my grammer. Bad thing about IE is spell check is off. I have switched to firefox and google's browser but some of my older works have mistakes. Also if anyting I write is not at my home computer I use IE.
