        A competitive market places extreme demands 
        on software development teams and the
        products they produce. Under time to market 
        pressure a just acceptable product
        developed quickly will be preferred to an 
        excellent product produced slowly. (cf. <a href="TheBestIsTheEnemyOfTheGood.html">TheBestIsTheEnemyOfTheGood</a>) Invisible
        attributes of a product, such as its software 
        architecture, are often the most
        compromised in the name of acquired market 
        share. However, market share brings its own
        set of problems.  The once satisfactory 
        architecture of a successful product will
        often crumble under the weight of 
        continuous revision and enhancement. 
        It would seem
        that the choice is between failing in 
        the race to the market or failing under the
        pressure of success once in it.

        It is my position that small teams using 
        an evolutionary development method in a pure
        object-oriented environment have the best 
        chance of walking this tightrope. Each one
        of these factors, team, method and 
        environment, can be adjusted and studied in
        isolation. However, when we consider 
        the whole of the software development system we
        find debatable decisions for one factor 
        can create surprising efficiencies for
        another.  Using the terminology of patterns 
        we would say that competitive forces, when
        resolved, expose unique patterns of lesser 
        forces, which have solutions which might
        not have occurred in isolation. I have 
        assembled a network of forty patterns of
        competitive development and studied the 
        interactions between them. Competitive
        developers will find the particular 
        patterns useful while organizational theorists
        might benefit most from adopting the 
        pattern form.
