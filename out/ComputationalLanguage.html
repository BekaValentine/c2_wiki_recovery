        Computational Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="ComputationalLanguage.html">ComputationalLanguage</a>, if one were to exist, would be a language that makes primitives of the fundamental components of computation (as opposed to <a href="FunctionalLanguage.html">FunctionalLanguage</a>s, which make primitives of values and calculations, and <a href="ImperativeLanguage.html">ImperativeLanguage</a>s, which make primitives of actions and schedules).
      </p>
      <p>
        Computation is the process of calculation, and is the fundamental thing done by computers.  Processes are series of actions, and calculations are transformations over values -- substituting equals for equals.  Since all actions are based upon communications, and the content of any communication is a value, a <a href="ComputationalLanguage.html">ComputationalLanguage</a> needs to make primitives of both communications and calculations.

        <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a> once said: <strong>Computing science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes.</strong> Functional languages make a point of <strong>not being</strong> about computers.

           Unfortunately, functional languages aren't even about computing. <em>Computation</em> involves both <strong>calculation</strong> and <strong>communication</strong>, and functional languages only describe half the job. While such a language is useful for mathmaticians, it's not a redeeming feature for forays into computing science.

           <em>You have a peculiar notion of "computation" -- you speak above about CPU and electrical impulses, as if they matter (- as per Dijkstra they don't). Also a peculiar notion of computing science. So what are your sources ?</em>

          I had an issue with someone calling a CPU an <em>emulated</em> computational environment. The electrical impulses, CPU, hardware etc. create a <em>real</em> computational environment. It has all the necessary components -- communication, storage, transformation, values, and value representation. If it were emulated, the CPU would need to be running on top of something else. CPUs, Human Brains, and many Human Systems (e.g. paper-pushing bureaucracies, ChineseRoom), all qualify as true computational environments. As far as my sources: look to a dictionary. <em>Computing</em> is the <strong>process</strong> of <em>calculation</em>. A <em>process</em> is a <em>series of actions</em>, and the only actions any closed process may ever perform are <em>communications</em> with an environment that said process can't even deductively proves actually exists (read up a little on Solipsism). <em>Calculation</em>, itself, boils down to its natural mathematical foundation -- simple transformation of <em>value to value</em>, substituting <em>equals for equals</em>. Computing science, naturally, is the empirical study of computing: the study of the process of substituting equals for equals. As such, it is a study of both <strong>calculation</strong> and <strong>communication</strong>. This is all obvious, natural, and fundamental. I expect that your own notion of computing science isn't in conflict with mine... but it might be incomplete and/or from a different perspective.
