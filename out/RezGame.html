        Rez Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        Rez is a musical shooter from Sega. It was heavily inspired by the works of the artist Wassily Kandinsky, and in particular his concept of synaesthesia: sound and image fusing into a single experience.

        Techno music and trippy, rave-like visuals are the theme of the game. You play a pulsating humanoid figure zipping through an intense, surreal cyberspace that somewhat resembles the <a href="TronMovie.html">TronMovie</a>. Enemies come at you and you must lock onto them and shoot them all down. When you do, bursts of color and sound are released in perfect sync with the background beat. As you progress through the levels, the sound becomes more complex, and the visuals fill in to resemble one of four ancient civilizations. This is done by finding and unlocking the 10 "network openings".

        If you have found all network openings in all four levels, then a fifth level will open up, which is an eye-opening journey through the history of evolution on planet Earth. At the end of the fifth level you must fulfill the game's goal: to rescue and awaken "Eden", the AI in the system's core.

        Rez is more than just a game. It is an altogether unique experience, and a compelling argument for <a href="VideoGame.html">VideoGame</a>s as art form. It has even been said to induce altered states of consciousness in some.
