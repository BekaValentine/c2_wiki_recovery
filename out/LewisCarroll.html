        Oh, and a couple of strange books for children called "<a href="AlicesAdventuresInWonderland.html">AlicesAdventuresInWonderland</a>" and "<a href="ThroughTheLookingGlass.html">ThroughTheLookingGlass</a>, and what Alice found there", which for some reason have outlasted his mathematical works. They're certainly more amusing.

        One or the other of these two personalities also had a deep fondness for both hashish and very young pouty girls. Hardly the kind of thing you could base a Disney movie on...

        Dodgson was also a talented, and progressive, photographer (often of those self-same pouty girls, and especially AliceLiddell); see <a href="http://www.lewiscarroll.org/photo.html.">http://www.lewiscarroll.org/photo.html.</a>

        A major contribution to software design is the quote: <em> "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less." </em>

        <em>Whereupon Humpty's pair, disliking the word did not come from the </em><a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>, was impossible to pronounce, and did not describe the concept it named, gave him a little nudge.<em></em>
