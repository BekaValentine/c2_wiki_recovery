        Internet Inter Orb Protocol

        Usually known as <strong>IIOP</strong>.

        In the CORBA protocol interoperability architecture, the standard 
        GeneralInterOrbProtocol (GIOP) is defined by the <a href="CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture.html">CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture</a> (CORBA)
        specification.  
        The GIOP specification consists of the following elements:
      </p>
      <p>
        A CommonDataRepresentation (CDR) definition: CDR is a transfer
        syntax that maps <a href="InterfaceDefinitionLanguage.html">InterfaceDefinitionLanguage</a> (IDL) types from their native host format into a
        low-level bi-canonical representation, which supports both
        little-endian and big-endian formats.  CDR-encoded messages are used
        to transmit CORBA requests and server responses across a network.  All
        IDL data types are marshaled using the CDR syntax into an
        encapsulation, which is an octet stream that holds marshaled data.
      </p>
      <p>
        GIOP message formats: The GIOP specification defines seven types of
        messages that send requests, receive replies, locate objects, and
        manage communication channels.
      </p>
      <p>
        GIOP transport adapter: The GIOP specification describes the features
        of an ORB transport protocol that can carry GIOP messages.  Such
        protocols must be reliable and connection-oriented.  In addition, GIOP
        defines a connection management protocol and a set of constraints for
        GIOP message ordering.  CORBA defines a TCP/IP
        mapping of GIOP, which is called the Internet Inter-ORB Protocol
        (IIOP).
