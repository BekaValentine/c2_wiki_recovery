        <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> are great.

        When using them I find that I have been saying to myself "You have been using this style to describe the functionaliy of a system for years, what makes this any different?" I can answer by saying "Before it was on scrap paper and emails to others, this is more directed". A measured step to add a little bit of formalism without sacrificing the usability of the process goes a long way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The trouble I am in now is that I am trying to use the same style to describe EVERYTHING I am doing. This is the intense desire to have 'one mechanism'. But what I end up with is a bunch of stories that describe everything lumped into the one category.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had some success in placing stories into categories. Uncomplicated enough to get pass the quagmire of 'everything'. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do I have the desire to write a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> for this? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are my categories:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Business/Feature       "Display the account history for the client"
        </li>
        <li>
           Techincal/Architecture "The current (whatever ex:AccountService) needs data from the old (whatever ex:Mainframe)
        </li>
        <li>
           Technical/Science      "The data is persisted in some proprietary data structure, the service needs it in XML"
        </li>
        <li>
           Technical/Engineering  "The system must have a minimum response time of 3 seconds"
        </li>
        <li>
           Technical/Construction "The system should be written in Python"
        </li>
        <li>
           Business/Admin         "This joker needs to pay me for (whatever)"
        </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Categories could run along the lines of traditional requirements engineering:
      </p>
      <p>
        Functional Requirement == "When cancel is clicked the action should be stopped!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Non-Functional Requirement == "It would be great if it was written in Python and utilized our RDBMS licence"
      </p>
      <p>
        Process Constraint == "Task A must be completed within 30 seconds"
      </p>
