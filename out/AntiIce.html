        A novel by <a href="StephenBaxter.html">StephenBaxter</a> that took as its premise that sometime in the mid 1800's a large chunk of anti-matter went into Earth Orbit.  For some reason, the anti-matter would only interact explosively with normal matter if its temperature went above freezing (something to do with magnetic fields...).
      </p>
      <p>
        A chunk of <a href="AntiIce.html">AntiIce</a> (as it's called) fell to Earth in the arctic and was exploited by Victorian English engineers as the ultimate power source -- imagine what you can do with a really BIG steam engine and a dewar flask ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And how did this stuff get from outer space to the arctic without heating up on entry?</em>
      </p>

        Hey, it's only a story. Remember <a href="IsaacAsimov.html">IsaacAsimov</a> 's robots with their PositronicBrains? He had no idea in hell how they worked!

        I found my copy of this book at a local FleaMarket. That's the only (good) <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> book I've found there, but I keep coming back to try to find more. Upon finishing this book, I was shocked to find how little our society today has changed from the Victorian society in <a href="AntiIce.html">AntiIce</a> -- <a href="JonathanRosebaugh.html">JonathanRosebaugh</a>

        PS. Regarding the question in the first section, i think it's sorta like the meteors that fall to earth today. A very large chunk came down very fast, and some of it survived.

        <em>Yes, but some of the energy from the parts that did burn would have gone into the rest, heating it in a chain reaction.</em> --<a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think so.  A few years ago there was a story about a farmer who found a meteorite in his field.  It had only landed that night, and something I remember from that - since it struck me as odd - was the statement that "it was so fresh, it was still <em>cold</em>."
      </p>

        <em>Perhaps this is something like the effect where you can float a drop of water on an above-100-degree hotplate. The outerlayer heats up and boils, but the layer of steam it forms insulates the drop against further heating. -- </em><a href="AdamBerger.html">AdamBerger</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope - doesn't work like that. With a drop of water, or a meteor(ite) on entry, matter that's been boiled off insulates the core - yes - but here we need to insulate matter from anto-matter. That's not possible with either matter or anti-matter - it's only possible with vacuum.

        <dd><em>Upon re-reading the original I observe that we do in fact only need to keep it cold, so it would work. The real nonsense is that the anti-matter only explodes when it gets warm.</em></dd>

        Look, folks -- this is Stephen Baxter we're talking about. This author's science is a little, um, loose, y'know? Just dismiss this title as the trivia it is.
