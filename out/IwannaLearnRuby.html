      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Just curious: how does this ("learning together") work, as opposed to the more conventional "read a book/web page and just start hacking" approach?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine sitting down with a couple people, a copy of a few Ruby books, and a laptop. Together, study Ruby, write code, play around. Now, do the same thing, but not co-located.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apocryphal story (from memory, the original may vary):
      </p>
      <code>
        Reporter: Professor Einstein, how does radio work?<br/>
        Einstein: Begin with telegraph. Imagine a very long cat, stretching<br/>
        from New York to San Francisco. You step on its tail here, and<br/>
        in San Francisco the head of the cat meows. That is telegraph.<br/>
        Reporter: Ok...and radio?<br/>
        Einstein: Radio is <strong>exactly</strong> like telegraph, but there is no cat.<br/>

        I'd suggest starting with the ruby-talk mailing list. If you think that list is too high-volume or doesn't cater well enough to your needs as a newbie, try drumming up support for a newbie mailing list there. I would encourage you to try and make sure that there are some experienced ruby users looking over your shoulder (I would volunteer, but I've only got a couple of months of ruby under my belt) -- <a href="DanielSheppard.html">DanielSheppard</a>.

        I'd suggest mentioning any topics you want to discuss right here. No time like the present. Do, rather than talking about doing, and all that.

        <em>Sure. I've been reading </em><a href="ProgrammingRuby.html">ProgrammingRuby</a> online, and I'm a longtime <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> guy. I know there are others who are in a similar boat, so I thought it might be fun to do it together. So, I'm inviting others to learn Ruby with me. Anyone who wants to be a Ruby mentor is welcome, too. I figure 3-5 people would be ideal. I'll host a mailing list, and we'll work EnWiki as well, so lurkers can follow along...but it would focus on a few people interested in learning. Like a study group. So, who's in? -- <a href="MichaelIvey.html">MichaelIvey</a><em></em>

           Primitive looping, but friendly iteration: 3.times { puts "I'm going to say this three times" }
        </li>
        <li>
           Consider using <em>unless</em> rather than <em>!someBoolean</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           At least once, you are going to type <em>else if</em> rather than <em>elsif</em>  and spend more time than you should figuring out what went wrong, unless, of course, you remember this bullet.
