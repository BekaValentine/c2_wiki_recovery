        Request For Xyz To Leave
      </h1>
      <p>
        Historical context: <strong>RequestForRobertAbitbolToLeave</strong> was started as an informal poll on whether Wikizens believe the community would be better off without him.  Within 5 minutes, Robert had started <a href="RequestForXyzToLeave.html">RequestForXyzToLeave</a> pages for all people voting against him.  The pages, and their associated <strong>*</strong>Discussion pages, were deleted to LimitTemptation.

      <p>
        This was the original meta-discussion page, and perhaps should be kept so as to have a record of what has not worked.

        Just one thought: Please don't start a page of the <a href="RequestForXyzToLeave.html">RequestForXyzToLeave</a> kind if you have been attacked by "Xyz" or been in a flamewar with him/her - it's probably best if such pages are started by parties which have so far remained neutral (and only as a "means of last resort", of course). -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        They are <em>only</em> required for legal purposes if you are preparing to press charges for harassment or stalking. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
