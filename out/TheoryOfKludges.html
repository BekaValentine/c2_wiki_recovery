        Theory Of Kludges
      </h1>
      <p>
        Principles explaining the phenomena of computer systems that are constituted of poorly matched elements or of elements originally intended for other applications, a clumsy or inelegant solution to a problem.

        Stan Kelly Bootle's "Devil's DP Dictionary" had an excellent two page presentation of
        the <a href="TheoryOfKludges.html">TheoryOfKludges</a>.  It was a glorious parody of academic computer science research.
        A key part of the theory was that every kludge k has a unique anti-kludge k' that undoes
        it, plus a large number of counter-kludges k* that didn't quite undo it correctly.  The
        theory proceeds to the consequences of doing a kludge, applying a false anti-kludge, and
        then the correct anti-kludge = x.k().k*().k'().  When in fact you should have done
        a x.k().k*().k*'().k'()...
