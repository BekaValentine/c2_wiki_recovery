        Everyone fell asleep reading their books. :-) (Some of the ones listed seem low-content and/or dated...)

        What's the <a href="GeekBookClub.html">GeekBookClub</a>?

        It's a bunch of nerds reading books, and talking about them afterwards.

        Get together with your friends/colleagues, read something, and discuss the valuable insights you gleaned from them. You never know - you might learn something.

        How about reviewing websites for information as well, such as <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/?">http://www.oreillynet.com/?</a> We're all very busy and it's often very difficult to find online information that is accurate, reputable, and informative - so perhaps it would be very useful (to lots of people in the dept, not just the tech team) to know which sites our experts trust for information. For example, where does Elson go for definitive XML info, Wayne for accessibility, John for server info, and of course where does Will find all the geeky stuff! - GilHoggarth
