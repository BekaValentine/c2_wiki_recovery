        Else Considered Smelly

      <code>
        if (condition()) {<br/>
        ifBlock();<br/>

        and not about anyone with the given name <em>Else</em>. <strong>Big excuses to all those!</strong>

      <p>
        "Smelly" is solely meant in the sense of program code that calls for improvement!

      <code>
        <strong>First smell:</strong>:	When the condition() is the least bit complicated, the else is twice as complicated, because the reader has to invert the condition().<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <strong>Second smell:</strong>:	When the ifBlock() contains a little more than reasonable number of lines it is easy to forget what the condition() was.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <strong>Third smell:</strong>:	Nested if-if-else, if-else-if (<a href="ArrowAntiPattern.html">ArrowAntiPattern</a>), etc. are likely to confuse the reader even more.  Nested if's without any else's are not so bad.<br/>

        <strong>Proposed Solution:</strong>

      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a> uses this idiom in <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>, which doesn't have <em>else</em> at all:
      </p>
      <code>
        : doCondition   condition if ifBlock ; then elseBlock ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Converted to C (for the benefit of those unfamiliar with <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>):
      </p>
      <code>
        void doCondition() {<br/>
        if (condition()) {<br/>
        ifBlock();<br/>
        return;<br/>
        }<br/>
        elseBlock();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Every such test is factored into its own subroutine.  The <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> strongly favors factoring, with its low subroutine overhead.  The same thing might not make sense for C and other high-level languages. (And the C version looks a lot yuckier than the Forth version anyway.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The benefit to this is that there is no branch from the end of the <em>if</em> part around to the end of the <em>else</em> clause.  (Chuck is really big on minimizing code.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Another benefit is that every <em>if</em> is in its own subroutine, so it is easier to analyze things to ensure that the right branches are being taken.  And you have to come up with a meaningful name for the routine: if you can't come up with a good name, then you might want to think about whether you really know what you're testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't think Chuck Moore would consider this to be a case of </em><a href="GuardClause.html">GuardClause</a>.  This is how he does all of his conditionals: the first clause is not necessarily an exceptional or rare case.  Instead, he does it this way because he's a big proponent of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>, and he sees no need to have ELSE in his language.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Putting every "if" into its own method is an interesting idiom.
        It is similar, perhaps, to the LISP idiom that all looping should be done with tail recursion -- refactoring each loop into its own function.
        <em>(...a pair of concepts I just expanded in </em><a href="LanguageIdiomsEncouragingSmallMethods.html">LanguageIdiomsEncouragingSmallMethods</a>.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (BTW, <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a> also favors Scheme-like tail-recursion for loops in Forth.)
      </p>
      <p>
        But, especially when looking at the "C" example above, I don't see how "return;" makes the code more readable than "else":
        An "else" very clearly says to the reader, "we'll do the code above or below the 'else,' but not both."
        -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Agreed.  The C version is ugly and less readable than using "else".  But the </em><a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> version is simple, and users would be familiar with the idiom.<em></em>

        No, it's not.  ANSI Forth programmers will often make use of ELSE.  Just as <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> strongly prefers iterative, rather than recursive programming styles as encouraged by <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>, so too does <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> and <a href="MachineForth.html">MachineForth</a> prefer to take a bit more functional approach than ANSI Forth does.  This change in the design of the Forth environment is due to <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a>'s realization that it maps better onto the generated binary image, and is thus closer to the machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there is more than one way to skin a cat.  One technique that I use a lot in Forth to eliminate the arrow pattern is to use <em>structured returns</em> -- since Forth exposes the return address stack, I can do stuff like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        : isItA?             dup anA? if r> drop handleConditionA then ;<br/>
        : isItB?             dup aB?  if r> drop handleConditionB then ;<br/>
        : isItC?             dup aC?  if r> drop handleConditionC then ;<br/>
        : defaultAction      neitherA norB norC soDoSomethingUsefulHere ;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        : makeDecisionHere   isItA?  isItB?  isItC?  defaultAction ;<br/>
        : foo                ... makeDecisionHere ... ;<br/>

        No, it's not an issue of "else" being smelly, the problem is the complex condition in the if statement:

        This [checking for side effects] is absolutely essential. The proposed construct is very like a construct which I have often seen and even written:

      <p>
        (usually I would have an else cause on the second if to deal with the case when the line can't be recovered.) In this case changing the code to an if else would not allow for the recover line operation changing the line status. -- ChrisBrooking

        It is not the "else" that is smelly itself but it easily leads to smelly constructions (same argument like with temporary variables, cf. <a href="ReplaceTempWithQuery.html">ReplaceTempWithQuery</a>). --<a href="DierkKoenig.html">DierkKoenig</a>

        Think also how "good" a GOTO (<a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a>?, Inflection?, <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a>?, etc.) can be. It can be very clear and elegant when used wisely. But still, we don't use it if we can easily avoid it.

        Writing rules in an expert system that didn't have user-defined ordering of the rules quickly convinced me of the value of "else" and "otherwise" when writing business logic.
        After writing rules for "screen posted successfully", "common error #1", "common error #2" and "common error #3", I then had to write a rule to catch the "anything else" case.
        Without some kind of "otherwise" syntax, it's really hard to ensure that your rules always cover all possible states, and have no overlap.

        Could you show a real hairy if-else example that you would resolve in some other way (even by using a different programming paradigm, like logical programming)? This "<a href="DarkPattern.html">DarkPattern</a>" has a smell of its own.

        While <strong>if</strong> can be a ticklish structure, there isn't really 
        a way to completely avoid it.  When a series of values is to be 
        used to "decide" what to do next, then a <strong>switch() { case: }</strong>
        construct can work, or a vector table, or some similar <strong>case</strong>
        concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where it gets a bit dirty is when the <strong>else</strong> side of the
        structure doesn't evaluate the same elements.  One of my 
        favorite examples of this is the "bed of snakes" code that
        we used to implement a parser that separated names into their
        component parts (prefix, first, middle, last, suffix) when
        one or more parts could be missing.

        The essence of this problem is that the <strong>if</strong> clause has
        eliminated one whole category of checks, so the <strong>else</strong>
        clause(s) must now inspect the remaining possibilities.

        The only language I've used that allowed a flexible <strong>case</strong>
        type of structure was <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>, where each <strong>case</strong> was
        evaluated separately (as though it were an <strong>elseif</strong>).

        In <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, we had to get more creative to make the
        logic clear as well as effective.  It was still a BedOfSnakes.

        It was, however, an interesting excursion into a kind of
        <a href="PredicateLogic.html">PredicateLogic</a> applied to name structure.

        What's the difference between a Foxpro DO CASE versus a series of IF-ELSEIF in other languages? And what is this BedOfSnakes...do you just mean messy code?

        I've been thinking about how this relates to long (cond) clauses.  (cond)'s are seldom nested at all; in the "classical" style, there's one cond per function.  They're practically long if-else if-else if-else constructs.  I don't find them hard to read, usually I don't even want to know the condition of the "else" part unless I've also seen what the other parts <em>do</em>.  Maybe it's the same thing as the <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> idiom above.  Basically, if you have one cond per function, you don't need to track various execution paths, just make sure that every (cond) clause obeys the contract of the function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because resource allocation and deallocation doesn't really fit this scheme, it's not done via (cond) or (if) in lisp-like languages, but rather via function wrappers.

        Seriously? Some people seem to try very hard to find alleged smells. SmellingTooManySmellsIsaSmell. You should get your nose checked out. -- AdrianWillenbuecher

        In the chemical industry, people who work with strong smells can find that their nose is desensitised even to the point of being unable to detect the smell at all. I wonder if that is a risk here as well. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        I agree. However, your analogy doesn't apply here. Not the ones that smell it are the vast majority (as would be the case in your analogy), but those that don't smell it are. And, as has been shown above, the alleged smells either don't originate from the <em>else</em> itself, or the "solutions" are by far worse then the "problem".

        Coming up next: FunctionsConsideredSmelly. Long, unfactored code, undescriptive names, missing comments, recursion and non-termination: the use of functions is often a sign for bad code that calls for improvement. Tune in at 10pm to see how gotos and global variables can help you get rid of this stench. -- AdrianWillenbuecher
