        <a href="FrankStone.html">FrankStone</a> here. I want to talk a minute about CMM.

        What pisses me off is that these propeller heads rattle on and on about how "disciplined" they are. What they are talking about isn't discipline. It takes no discipline to shove toy tanks around on a sand table.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll tell you what discipline is. Discipline is hearing the bullets pinging off the armor and ordering your driver forward anyway. Discipline is providing fire support for your buddy because you know he'll provide fire support for you. Discipline is puking in your foxhole from fear, then going over the top anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're a general, discipline is going forward when the shells are dropping, because you can't lead if you haven't smelled the fear from your grunts, and you haven't seen the enemy muzzle flashes yourself, and you haven't gotten the mud on your own boots.
      </p>
      <p>
        Discipline manifests in <a href="ArmCl.html">ArmCl</a> as coming to grips with the enemy--writing tests and writing code.
