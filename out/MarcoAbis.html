        I founded the first and biggest Italian developers web site <a href="http://www.programmazione.it">http://www.programmazione.it</a> in 1999.
        I worked for many years as a consultant in software development & project management in Italy & Switzerland and, in 2000, I founded an ICT company (I'm the Chief Technology Officer).
        I'm coordinating the Italian Agile Movement (<a href="http://www.agilemovement.it),">http://www.agilemovement.it),</a> the official Italian Agile User Group (listed in the Agile Alliance User Group directory).

        In the last few years, I studied the chaos theory for my pleasure in my spare time but one day, as in a lightning flash, I realized that it was applicable to software development and I started looking for someone who shared my "revelation" :-), I found Jim's 'Adaptive Software Development' and some others like K. J. Dooley 'A Complex Adaptive Systems Model of Organisation Change' and T. Peters 'Thriving on Chaos, Handbook for a Management Revolution'.
        I discovered then the <a href="AgileManifesto.html">AgileManifesto</a> (and the <a href="AgileAlliance.html">AgileAlliance</a>) and now here I am. :-)

        In 2003 I have been elected as member of the <a href="AgileAlliance.html">AgileAlliance</a> board of directors.
