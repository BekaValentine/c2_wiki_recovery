        Describe <a href="DirkMeeussen.html">DirkMeeussen</a> here.
        Hi, I 'am a SW developer working for a company in Belgium. I 'am responsible
        for the coordination of a team of about 10 Java developers.
        We are looking for tools to improve communication in the team.
        Maybe Wiki Web is a solution. At this very moment I cannot yet evaluate it.
        So I keep browsing around to try to understands its capabilities.
        Greetings.
