        A <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> that is completely self-contained - it includes its own HTTP server, and so does not require CGI support, Perl, or even a separate Web server such as Apache or IIS. Also, apropos of recent discussions, it does not use a database to store the Wiki pages, but instead uses a separate file for each page (which is simply a text file containing the content of the page). Another unique feature of <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> is that it is not a script like most wikis - it is an actual application coded in Visual C++.

           The first <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> (Eddie's <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a>) was developed by <a href="EddieEdwards.html">EddieEdwards</a> around 1997

        <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> (a.k.a <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a>) won hands down in the <a href="EasiestInstallableWikiContest.html">EasiestInstallableWikiContest</a>.

        <em>But slower in doing things, what happens in </em><a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> in fractional seconds takes from 5 to 20 seconds in <a href="EasyWiki.html">EasyWiki</a>! Try listing All pages in both. This will demonstrate what I mean. Ease of installation (questionable) is trumped by performance measures in my book.<em></em>

        There's a semi-official site at <a href="http://www.wikiserver.org">http://www.wikiserver.org</a> - which runs the improved (based on the original) version by <a href="RyanNorton.html">RyanNorton</a>.

          Similar software (a wiki engine self contained in an executable) now seems to be emerging.

        From Eddie Edwards' original introduction (of historical relevance only):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> is a C++ program implementing the bare bones of HTTP/1.0 and providing a <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> for WIN32 environments. I have run it at two jobs (including this one) and it has been reasonably popular for note sharing, although I try to send people to this site to try and "get" the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The parser is an ugly clump of char* dealings, which means the STL isn't needed. As <a href="WinSock.html">WinSock</a> is used, however, my attempts at <a href="PlatformIndependence.html">PlatformIndependence</a> are rather shallow, and I just look like a hacker. I can assure you, I am not. ;)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I am currently working on Wiki2, an uberWiki which tries to both (a) keep the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> and (b) enable average users to update their websites from any web browser in the world. Work is going slowly, however.
