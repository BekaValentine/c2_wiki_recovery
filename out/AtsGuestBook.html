        Jim, I am getting a lot of value out of following your day-to-day accounts using XP software development.  Thanks for the effort of keeping us informed.  Cheers, Ian Stephenson

        I missed the creation of the <a href="AtsDiary.html">AtsDiary</a>, and had not been following it at all. But having been lured there by this page, I expect to be a regular reader.

        Jim, keep this up. After the <a href="VcapsProject.html">VcapsProject</a> and the <a href="CthreeProjectTerminated.html">CthreeProjectTerminated</a>, 
        it's good to see the ongoing progress of another real project, rather 
        than people just talking methodology. I hope it ends up showing us PassingMilestones and not a <a href="PostMortem.html">PostMortem</a>.... -- <a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>

        Keep it up.  I think this could spawn more discussion especially about PitfallsOfXpDevelopment and hopefully solutions to them.
