        Authors badly want to be recognized as contributing
        members of their community, and publication in a
        prestigious refereed conference is the epitome of
        approval.  ECOOP and OOPSLA are two of the most prestigious
        conferences of the object paradigm:  ECOOP with more of
        a theoretical focus, and OOPSLA with an applications focus.
        Some papers are fair game for either conference.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid overlap, OOPSLA and ECOOP happen at different times;
        ECOOP usually mid-year, and OOPSLA usually in autumn.  The
        deadlines for papers are corresponding staggered: ECOOP early
        in December, and OOPSLA in mid-February.
      </p>
      <p>
        People are willing to let a paper set around a couple of
        months before re-submitting it, but not for a full year
        (in other words, if an author has their paper rejected one
        year, they are unlikely to improve it and re-submit it
        a year later).
      </p>
      <p>
        Both conferences have stringent admission requirements, and
        admit a small fraction of the papers that are submitted.  The
        chances of having your paper accepted at either conference is
        low.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>  Authors submit their papers to ECOOP in
        time for the conference deadline.  There is usually enough
        time to establish whether the paper has been accepted before
        the OOPSLA deadline, in which case the paper can be re-submitted
        to OOPSLA.  As long as the paper isn't in the "submitted"
        status at both conferences at the same time, this practice
        violates no ACM or SIGPLAN rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        One result is that ECOOP gets first shot at some of the best
        papers, particularly the theoretical ones.  It also means
        that papers received at OOPSLA may have benefited from the
        feedback generated by the ECOOP committee.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1996, out of 165 papers submitted, about 37 (22%) had
        been submitted to (and rejected by) ECOOP. At this writing,
        we believe one had been accepted by ECOOP.
