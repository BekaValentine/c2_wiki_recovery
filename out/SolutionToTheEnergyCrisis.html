        Solution To The Energy Crisis
      </h1>
      <p>
        With the recent (March 2005) discovery of fossilized soft tissue from <em>Tyrannosauras Rex</em> in Montana (and the possibility that dino DNA might be recovered), a simple solution to the energy crisis presents itself.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Extract DNA from the soft tissue.  (If none can be recovered, never mind)
        </li>
        <li>
           Like in <em>Jurassic Park</em>, clone a herd of T. Rex.  Feed 'em lawyers.  Unlike <em>Jurassic Park</em>, have better security so they don't run amok among the general populace, wrecking things and eating folks (other than lawyers).
        </li>
        <li>
           Let them breed until a sizeable population exists.
        </li>
        <li>
           Kill 'em off.  Obviously, a meteor strike or super-volcano eruption is impractical and will have side effects, so those techniques are out of the question.  But I'm sure that sufficient ordnance will do the trick.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wait 65 million years.
        </li>
        <li>
           Fire up the oil well.  Presto, instant (OK, not <em>instant</em>) petroleum!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Once the initial process has started, we can harvest and store dinosaur DNA so the <em>next</em> time we run out of oil, we don't have to wait for someone to find a well-preserved fossil; we just go to the freezer and get some more.

        Wow, I didn't know President Bush's science advisors knew about wiki!    ;) ;)

        <em>No, this didn't come from Bush's science team.  Bush's science team considers theories about dinosaurs (or anything older than 6000 years ago, when God created the Earth) to be heresy.</em>
