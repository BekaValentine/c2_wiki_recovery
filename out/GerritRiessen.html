        I just wanted to define the <a href="IdeaMethodology.html">IdeaMethodology</a> (<a href="YetAnotherMethodology.html">YetAnotherMethodology</a>) page but couldn't
        find the appropriate place :) 
        <em>Actually it should be IDEAMethodology but that wasn't picked up by Wiki</em>

        About me: Started out in Adelaide, Australia as a undergrad in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>,
        did Honours year at the ANU in Canberra, worked for the CSIRO with the
        SIS Group, then moved to Berlin, Germany working on the MMM [basically
        an ASP [*not* the Microsoft ASP] for mathematical models] at the 
        Humboldt Uni, and currently at Oracle in the Object Technology and 
        Middleware Group.

        How did I get onto XP? Through a book review of <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>-s book in the iX [or was that the c't?]. [Which i then read -- the book that is, the article was duly skimmed] Why do I like XP? Because I believe that there has to be a better to build software then the current method of <a href="GoldenEggLaying.html">GoldenEggLaying</a>. BTW has anybody done a study comparing <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> with XP ? I would be interested in doing something like that -- perhaps finding the best of both worlds .... or is XP really <a href="CorporateOpenSource.html">CorporateOpenSource</a> ....

        Of course, now the Microsoft has released .net, alles ist vergiftet, und ich bin total-verruckt. I have to finally admit that open source has been appropriated for the greater good by Gates und Ballmer - is this the end of the struggle?
        <em>Someone involved in </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> development in Java once said to me that they saw <a href="GrayBoxTesting.html">GrayBoxTesting</a> as the key thing the two approaches have in common. We should have more about this on Wiki I think. But as my experience of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> development is zero, I'll let others lead the way. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>
