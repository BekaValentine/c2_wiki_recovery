        The purpose of this group is to act as a forum both for people practicing Xp and those thinking of starting Xp to exchange ideas informally. The group is not sponsored by any organizations and will remain independent.
      </p>
      <p>
        The format of our meeting is very relaxed, with no fixed agenda. The emphasis is on exchanging experiences and picking up tips. We have a range of people including practitioners, academics, and even those still unsure.
      </p>
      <p>
        We meet on the second Monday of every month. Check here for times and places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Locations may vary but will be in a pub and will be in the North of England.

        Meeting (or should that be gathering) 13th May 2002
      </p>
      <p>
        There was no agenda but 
        Topics discussed today included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How to persuade teams to be more disciplined in unit testing when they integrate code and the associated issues over the use of cvs with multiple pairs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Test driven development. (<a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/)">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/testdrivendevelopment/)</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           When to stop refactoring. Does refactoring mercilessly mean you don't stop until it's perfect?
        </li>
        <li>
           Reviews of sessions at OT2002. (<a href="http://www.ot2002.org/)">http://www.ot2002.org/)</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Fish and chips or bubble and squeak with sausages?
        </li>
        <li>
           If you take the view that you should throw away designs and code then start again when you hit a deadend, do you can you reuse your previous designs, have patterns got a place? Just how should it all hang together?
        </li>
        <li>
           What other companies use XP in the North? If you do then let Simon know.
        </li>
        <li>
           To mock object or not to mock object? (though some had left at this point)
        </li>
        <li>
           How to have small development teams when you have lots of developers.
        </li>
        <li>
           Should we change the format of these meetings? Will this attract more people? Would a more formal afternoon session be better? (mail Simon with your thoughts).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It was my first visit to the group and I enjoyed it. I was welcomed despite being a bit of an XP cynic. I think the next meeting will be the 10th June but I'm sure it will be announced officially at some point. (<a href="AnotherMikeThomas.html">AnotherMikeThomas</a>)
