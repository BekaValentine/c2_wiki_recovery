        "Expect" is a TCL library that's good for driving text-based user interfaces from TCL scripts. It's used to script interaction with servers, and can be used for testing, and many other things.

        I do this all the time in Perl, using LWP. Generally, I subclass LWP::UserAgent? to get something like FooTester, and then write code like this: 
      </p>
      <code>
        use Test;<br/>
        BEGIN { plan test => 14 }<br/>
        my $t = new FooTester;<br/>
        $t->get('/');<br/>
        ok($t->is_success);<br/>
        ok($t->content =~ /<TITLE>Front Page</TITLE>/i);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        $t->post('/login', user => 'fred', passwd => 'xsecretx');<br/>
        ok($t->is_success);<br/>
        ok($t->content =~ /<TITLE>Successful Login</TITLE>/i);<br/>
        ok($t->content =~ /fred/i);<br/>
        ok($t->content !~ /xsecretx/i);  # don't leak passwords...<br/>

        At Amazon.com we use a tool that I wrote called Frank. It is a Web testing scripting language that uses a basic grammar to define test cases. It uses Perl regular expressions (although the latest version is written in Java) to define most of the assertions we use. Here is a simple example:
      </p>
      <code>
        GET "/some/url.html";<br/>
        validate urls;<br/>
        validate images;<br/>
        pass if regex m/Some Content/;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        the validations generate more tasks like the one above and every task gets a bunch of "implicit tasks" that apply to everything by default. Some can be overridden (like status code checks, by default they check for 200 but can be made to check anything else if explicitly stated).
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest version is built on top of a distributed task engine that allows us to test an extensive regression test in under 30 minutes. The previous version, which is written in Perl, is single-threaded and I'm trying to get in released as open source. We shall see...

        I rely mostly on my HTML write stream class. It will catch misspelt tags, unbalanced tags, INPUT tags not inside FORMs, and suchlike as the code generates them. I believe it will avoid most of the problems a general parser would find, very cheaply, because it starts from a high level representation. Eg I have methods like #putSubmit:value: so the checker knows a lot about what is going on without having to parse it. And of course it is easier for me to use than typing all those fiddly angle brackets by hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use some other tests, for example asserting that the generated text contains a <BODY> and </BODY> and ends with </HTML>, which gives me some confidence that text was actually produced. Apart from that I mostly care about aesthetics (which I don't know how to test for), and the concrete HTML is changing frequently (so I don't care about byte-for-byte regression), so I don't do any more. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        I worked on Http Testing at my previous job (they canceled that project but still own the code *sigh*). Fortunately, most of what we used was open-source, so it wouldn't be too hard to reproduce. We would retrieve URLs with standard Java URL class, parse the results using the JTidy (<a href="JavaHtmlTidy.html">JavaHtmlTidy</a>) HTML parser, and apply tests to the resulting DOM, reporting the results using JUnit. Tests were in terms of expected results, at whatever granularity of the DOM is desired. Once you have the basic framework it is trivial to add features such as load testing, HTML validity testing, link testing, etc. -- <a href="DetheElza.html">DetheElza</a>

        I've been using it too, it's called Watir now (<a href="http://wtr.rubyforge.org/),">http://wtr.rubyforge.org/),</a> it does actually push buttons and write into text fields in IE, and then reflects the DOM so that you can ask "do I get what I expect here or there?". I find it very effective, both because you don't rely on someone's idea of how should a browser work, and because ruby excels at this sort things. --Loop

        I've actually created a program in Python that simulates an Internet user. It's just a series of test cases that goes to specified URL's and downloads the content and runs searches on them. For example <a href="http://server/index.jsp?user=test&pwd=test.">http://server/index.jsp?user=test&pwd=test.</a> I then do a simple string search for words like 'exception' or 'error'. That way, if I make any changes in my code I can see how they effect all the different test cases.

        We parse web pages into a DOM tree and use XPath expressions. Our test classes commonly call methods like assertXPathExists(), assertXPathEquals(), or assertXPathContains(). We check that the functional parts of web pages are there - the links are there, the forms exist, the fields exist and are populated, and submit buttons are there - but not the purely visual boilerplate, which is better checked by looking at it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Parsing the HTML is the slowest part of the unit tests - we're on the lookout for a faster parser.
