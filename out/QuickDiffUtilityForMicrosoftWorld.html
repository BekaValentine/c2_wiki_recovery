        Quick Diff Utility For Microsoft World
      </h1>
      <p>
        Looking for code to implement <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> in programs that are compliant with the <a href="MicrosoftWay.html">MicrosoftWay</a>. Probably works as a subroutinee, similar (to enduser) presentation to whats here at <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> (or <a href="UseMod.html">UseMod</a>).
      </p>

        <em>Looking for a practical, simple and maintenable solution with above constraints.</em>

        <li>
           I have seen a few that I would not use even if they were free. At a discussion I have been told the "good algorithms" came out in mid 70s, but even now lots of "average" tools lie about.

        Unfortunately <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> has not got functions I can call like Unix. I tried looking on the net but cannot locate freeware addons nor code to do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for help.

        P.S. Our resident algorithm guru (DM) caution me that lots of implementations on the market (including the Gnu C code) are not very good. Personally I can survive if the only problem is bloated code, but I cannot bear with <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>  that does poor matchup, as I am spoiled by what I have seen on wikis.

        David, I hope I'm not telling you something you know already and have discounted as unfeasible. Have you looked into the <a href="GnuTools.html">GnuTools</a> diffutils package? It has full source code in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> for some diffing <a href="CommandLine.html">CommandLine</a> programs. Or if you want them already compiled, try the GnuWin32 port at <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>. I bet you could pipe the diff results to a little <a href="PythonScript.html">PythonScript</a> that outputs the diff as nice HTML, assuming that's what you're after. Does this help? -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>

           Elizabeth thanks. It does help a lot as I do not have <a href="UnixCulturalAssumption.html">UnixCulturalAssumption</a>. I will wait a bit as I cannot see why advances in a useful algorithm has not gone out to the non-unix world already. I have added DM comments to the <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> page. I will however try to see whether anyone is willing to do it free (nonUnix related, at least non <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>) as a contribution to the community. -- dl

        I'm glad it helps. I'm not a Unix expert myself, being a long-time Mac-head. But when I'm stuck on a Windows PC, I throw in some of those GnuWin32 command-line utilities just so I can get some work accomplished! I have found the coreutils, diffutils, findutils, and grep to be very handy. If you download these and use them from time to time, the Unix culture will not be so foreign. -- Eliz

        <strong>News flash:</strong> The <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> difflib module does diffs (<a href="http://docs.python.org/lib/module-difflib.html).">http://docs.python.org/lib/module-difflib.html).</a> Results can be output as HTML using the HtmlDiff class (in Python 2.4 or later). There's a diff.py script in Python's Tools/scripts directory (2.3 or later) all set to run. I haven't tried any of this; I just discovered it. -- Eliz

        There is a <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> sample program called WinDiff that comes with <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a>.  Perhaps you could adapt that.

        Consider COM/ActiveX/VBX/OCX components for the task.
        Consider "OLE Automation" of GUI-driven tools.

        Doing a Google, pointed me to this tool, and there may be others:

        As if you didn't already have enough suggestions, I've had great success with WinMerge, an Open Source diff/merge tool (<a href="http://winmerge.org/).">http://winmerge.org/).</a> I don't know how it compares algorithmically with the others, as I haven't read the source yet, but from an <a href="EndUser.html">EndUser</a> point of view it's significantly faster and more accurate than WinDiff. The only thing it lacks from my point of view is ThreeWayMerge. --<a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>
