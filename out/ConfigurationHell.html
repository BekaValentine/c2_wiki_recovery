        Configuration Hell
      </h1>
      <p>
        A dialog between two <a href="CowOrker.html">CowOrker</a>s. In Hell:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: What's this error message mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: What's it say?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: The Morgothrond can't deploy its thumpwhistle. The dialog window just says "can't undeploy". Then it says to read the log file.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: Can't you read the log file?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: I can't turn the log file on. When I changed my ~/.thumpwhistle/vars file the Morgothrond wouldn't even launch, so I changed it back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: You have to put a matching line in the log.props file, with the relative path to that vars file.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: Why didn't the Help mention that? Nevermind. I'l deploy again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: Okay. It just says "undeploy invalid ModuleTargetID passed". It doesn't even say what value the ModuleTargetID contains, or where it read the ID.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: Oh wait, I remember this one. I put the answer on our Wiki. Let's see... you have to delete a folder with a name like  ~/.thumpwhistle/4.1/config/Y2K/TargetModules/thumpwhistle_home_bun_bun_2518152_ho-0957/<a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>/AmphetamineReptile
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: Okay. Just any file with a name <em>like</em> that, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: Yeah.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: Back it up with your recycler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: Gotcha... now restart the thumpwhistle?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: Just try to launch <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> again. Oh, wait. Also delete the <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>.XML file from your conf/Argentina/localhost/temp#2 folder. <em>Now</em> launch again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: It's asking for a name and password now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: It's not supposed to do that. Read the user's configuration file and type in the name and password. It's just clear-text.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: The global user's file?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: No, the local one. Open it. Okay, you also have to take that line out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: Why is it there?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: Because you have to move it into the global configuration file, and then add any user-name after it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: My username?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: It can't be the name of any user in the system. Call it "supersonic_enemy_of_evil" or something.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: Check. Okay, now I saved both files.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: Oh, yeah, the local file needs a modification time greater than the global file, or you will trigger a refresh.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: Touch.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: When you restart, make sure that copies of the binary files are also in the project-specific folder, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A</em>: How long have I been trying to install this Thumpwhistle? Is this lucrative?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>B</em>: My certification tutors said it was...

        Someone once sent me an e-mail to report what happened when he read one of my (unrelated) posts, and got to the tag line.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was taking classes to learn to configure <a href="OracleDatabase.html">OracleDatabase</a>. I wrote, "Whip me. Beat me. Make me install Oracle."
      </p>
      <p>
        He fell off his chair laughing. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
