        Cpp Unit Lite
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a simple C++ <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> developed by Michael Feathers, who wrote the original <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>. Unlike some other frameworks, this one is a barebones framework intended to be extended by its users to support their particular needs.

      <p>
        The motivations for the rewrite:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           More easily write individual tests (one TEST macro which registers the test automatically; instead of method source, header and registration in three different files)
        </li>
        <li>
           Follow the <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> model less strictly, avoiding use of <a href="LateCeePlusPlus.html">LateCeePlusPlus</a> features such as RTTI, exceptions, and templates, thus increasing portability.
          <ul>
            <li>
               I'm looking for the <strong>opposite</strong> myself; I want <a href="LateCeePlusPlus.html">LateCeePlusPlus</a> features, anything else feels like C...

        I notice that the download only has Visual Studio projects.  How portable is this framework compared to <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>?

        What License is <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a> Distributed under? The downloaded zip file has no license information.

      <p>
        There are only the code and a simple example in the package. Are there any documents on how to use <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a>? Or one have to figure it out by herself from the code?

        <a href="AndyGlew.html">AndyGlew</a>: (these are notes as I am looking to upgrade my test infrastructure; I haven't actually used <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a> at the time I write this, although I have read all of the code):
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, it looks like <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a> uses mild macro trickery, so that TEST(testName,testgroup)
        creates a test class, but also creates an object that registers itself with a singleton registry,
        which can then run all the tests. I expect that it reduces some of the drudgery of
        writing tests in C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not clear to me that <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a> eliminates all of the drudgery,
        or whether it is still necessary to have some external Perl scripting.
        For example, here is a standard test for a C++ header file: in file
        header_test_foo.cpp:
      </p>
      <code>
        #include <foo.hpp><br/>
        #include <foo.hpp><br/>
        main() {}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I.e. this is a completely standalone test executable, that tests that the header file
        foo.hpp (a) includes everything it depends on, and (b) is appropriately guarded
        so that it can be included twice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many C++ folk automatically generate something like this test using Perl scripts or the like.
        I don't think that <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a> eliminates the need.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a> looks like it will test all classes that are linked into an executable.
        This probably means that you still have to have something in your build tool that
        produces the executable, something like
      </p>
      <code>
        TESTS=*.cpp<br/>
        test: $(TESTS)<br/>
        gcc -o test test-main.cpp $(TESTS) <br/>
        ./test<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That's pretty trivial; fancier stuff will still need Perl scripts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: if you need Perl scripts anyway, maybe the Perl scripts should avoid the need
        for the macro trickery of <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a>?

        We have successfully ported Cpp Unit Lite to a number of embedded systems within the Analog Devices processor family including single core Blackfin BF533, multi-core Blackfin BF561 and multi-processor systems TigerSHARC 201. The main advantage of CPP Unit Lite over running perl scripts is that talking to embedded system under test using a JTAG interface to transmit the (perl-based) tests takes 10's of milli-seconds while you can run CPPUnitLite directly within the core of the embedded system without penalizing processor performance. We even were able to make use of a background telemetry channel (BTC) as an alternative I/O path to optimize the reporting of the extremely rare errors ( :-) ) we introduce into our code.
      </p>
      <p>
        More recently we have gone over to using <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>++ which uses essentially the same syntax as <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a> but is much richer in features. This move has been a success for embedded systems with a large enough external memory to store the code. <a href="CppUnitLite.html">CppUnitLite</a> Tests (and library) used to fit nicely into the internal memory of the Blackfin. We have had <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> Lite and <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>++ running on Analog Devices Blackfin and TigerSHARC processors, T.I. C64XX processors and MIPS -- with the TI and Analog Devices variant having a lot of hardware assisted extensions appropriate for the new embedded environment

        How does this line of code work:
      </p>
      <p>
        testGroup##testName##Instance; 
      </p>
      <p>
        I see testGroup and testName are passed in as parameters and are "token-pasted" or "merged".
        Where does Instance come from?  What does it do?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's a little difficult to know for certain, since you've left out some important information.  But, assumming that the code looks something like this</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        #define MAKE_TEST(testGroup, testName) testGroup##testName##Instance
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Then the following would create the token </em>FooBarInstance<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        MAKE_TEST(Foo, Bar)
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks. Makes sense now. :)
