        I've been working in and around the technology sector since 1989, mostly in infrastructure. I used to be a musician, but no longer have time to really pursue music. I do find software development a mostly adequate creative outlet, though. Having managed projects at various levels throughout the years, I have become very interested in software methodologies, including XP and other related agile methodologies.
