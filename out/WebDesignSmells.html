        Suggestions of web interface or technology techniques to avoid:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Using "high-end" media where something simpler will do. For example, using <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> when plain HTML would do the job nearly as well, or flash animation when an animated GIF could do the just about the same thing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Avoid media vendor dependency. Provide sound and video in at least two diverse formats. Getting media files to play can be a pain as different or bad codecs can make them unplayable. Include at least two diverse format choices for active media. For example, include both a <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> and a MPEG version of a movie.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Actually, the better answer now seems to be to use Flash, since that has a better chance of being viewable on any given computer than either <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> or MPEG.  I have yet to use any machine that had trouble using the Flash-based player on <a href="YouTube.html">YouTube</a>, for instance.
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="WhatsWrongWithFlash.html">WhatsWrongWithFlash</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Assume the user is using massive screen resolution such that the page is nearly unusable on smaller-resolution monitors.
          <ul>
