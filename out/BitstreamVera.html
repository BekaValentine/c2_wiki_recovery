        Bitstream Vera
      </h1>
      <p>
        A free (as in both speech and beer) family of ten fonts, released as the result of an agreement between the Bitstream font foundry and the <a href="GnomeDesktopEnvironment.html">GnomeDesktopEnvironment</a> team, based largely upon Bitstream's commercially available Prima font family. Bundled with <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> and most Linux distributions, but also available as a separate download from <a href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/.">http://www.gnome.org/fonts/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are already derivative works in progress to extend the fonts to languages not supported by the original character set and to create other typestyles; these include:

          <ul>
            <li>
               adds accented characters for Welsh, Czech and Polish, as well as Cyrillic characters and macrons

               narrower, condensed version
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Arev [<a href="http://tavmjong.free.fr/FONTS/]">http://tavmjong.free.fr/FONTS/]</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               adds Greek, Cyrillic, extended Latin, and symbol characters; currently only available in Sans
            </li>
          </ul>

      </ul>
      <p>
        The sans face looks somewhat like a cross between Frutiger and Verdana.  Quite readable, even if there are some characters that are ambiguous (capital 'eye' and lowercase 'ell' are not distinctive, as in Verdana and Trebuchet)... I actually prefer the way some of the characters look in Vera than in Verdana.
      </p>

        Perhaps the best part of the Vera font family, in my opinion, would be Vera Sans Mono.  <em>Excellent</em> font for coding; it clearly distinguishes all of the characters that could possibly be ambiguous.  And it looks so much prettier than ugly old Courier...

        I use Vera Sans Mono and love it as my terminal/coding font on Linux and decided to install it on Windows. Ick. I don't know why, but the hinting and kerning and anti-aliasing just look terrible. The strokes are all of inconsistent width, too thin with font smoothing on and too thick with it off. It's distracting and nasty. --ChrisMellon

        <em>I mostly agree that Vera Sans Mono looks bad on Windows, but I would make an exception of Vera Sans Mono Regular at 7pt. That works. Works well, too.</em>

           Summary: if you need macrons, use DejaVu instead.
