        Why Does My User Name Disappear
      </h1>
      <p>
        I (<a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>) have repeatedly (over the last few years) signed up for and received a username that works when I first sign up, and that stops working soon thereafter. Yes, of course my IP address changes from time to time, but Wiki uses a cookie mechanism so that that shouldn't matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this something funky on my side, or is there a problem lurking here somewhere?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you sometimes disable cookies? If so, that could account for the effect you describe.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope, I switch from browser to browser (Explorer, Netscape, Mozilla) but that should have no effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, if you set the </em><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie in browser A, and then later edit a page from browser B, browser B probably won't be aware of the cookie (but some browsers will copy cookies from other browsers on installation).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you 'lose' your username from each browser independently, having set it up in each browser at about the same time?
      </p>
      <p>
        I set up the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> in Netscape (v4.76) and everything works fine. I use Explorer and Mozilla (although I don't think I visit Wiki with them, but I'm not sure of that). I come back, later, to Wiki in Netscape again -- and my <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> has stopped working.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've noticed that Mozilla 1.0/1.1 and Netscape 7.0 walk on each other's profiles. They "share" (meaning each writes over the other)</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        //WINDOWS/Application Data/Mozilla/Profiles/<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Unfortunately, this apparently includes cookies.txt, kept in a subdir of Profiles/default/. It would also appear that different profiles collect different cookies, leading to further opportunities for confusion - especially since Mozilla and Netscape argue (at browser launch) over which owns "default". A note above indicates that the </em><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> mechanism doesn't work under Mozilla. Is it possible that it not only doesn't work, but that it also breaks subsequent Netscape <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> accesses? -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>
