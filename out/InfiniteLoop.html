        An infinite loop is a software loop that has no termination conditions, or whose termination conditions will never occur. Such loops are useful for programs that run "forever" or until the machine is turned off. Such loops are not useful if they are created unintentionally: this causes programs to "hang" until terminated by some external process. The term is, of course, a misuse of the English language.

        Note that an exception can cause termination of an "infinite loop" if it is not caught. See <a href="SafeLoop.html">SafeLoop</a>.
