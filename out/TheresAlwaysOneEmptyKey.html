        <a href="TheresAlwaysOneEmptyKey.html">TheresAlwaysOneEmptyKey</a> is my refrain today. I have been attempting to tidy up some computers running <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> in various flavours. These have something called the registry which has to be tidied up when programs have been deleted and left their loose ends lying around. I have a tool for doing this, which fixes most of the errors but there is always one left which it won't fix. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
