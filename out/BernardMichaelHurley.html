        Hi there folks!  Here's my FAQ (FAQ = frequently asked questions = questions no one would ever think of asking had they not read the FAQ in the first place)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>FAQ:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1) Why the "Michael"?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many years ago I was subscribed to a mailing list which also included another Bernard Hurley.  I got fed up with being flamed for his (? I assume) posts so I started adding my middle name and it sort of became a habit.  I still got flamed!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2) Are you a vegetarian?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, let's put it like this:  I read somewhere that you can live for more or less ever (and that's a long time) if you stick to a diet of fresh fruit and Cabernet Sauvingon.  I'm already half way there.

      <p>
        <strong>3) What got you interested in XP?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I first thought it was some sort of deodorant.  Seriously though I've been programming like this for years,  if you ignore the testing stuff and the pair programming and the......
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4) Have you anything sensible to say?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been teaching <a href="ComputerStudies.html">ComputerStudies</a> at West Herts College for 11 years (and that's even longer than for ever), but I will soon be getting a proper job.  My favorite activities are Java, Perl, PHP, C++, Linux and now XP (recent convert).  I do have a life too, but that's not for general publication.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5) Any links?</strong>
