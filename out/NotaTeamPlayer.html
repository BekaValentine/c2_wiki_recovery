        "You're <a href="NotaTeamPlayer.html">NotaTeamPlayer</a>" often means "You don't do what I want you to do."

        The phrase is mostly used by bosses to describe an employee who does not fit the mold they are expected to.  I personally have never heard it being used seriously when the target is really a bad employee, but rather when the target does not knuckle under the boss's power.
