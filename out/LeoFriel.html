        I'm about to lead our team into the valley of death that is eXtreme Programming - which led us inevitably to <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>.

        In the past, I've worked for some massive corporations who would, quite frankly, pooh their pants at the thought of XP, but I think it looks like it just might be a goer for us. For a start, I'm impressed by the frankness and honesty expressed in Beck and Fowler's books. Ah well, wish us luck, <strong>here we go, here we go, here we go........!</strong>
