        The company that makes Frontier, essentially a scriptable object database.  Currently known for <a href="EditThisPage.html">EditThisPage</a>, which is an application called Manila running under Frontier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Frontier also gets known as <a href="UserlandFrontier.html">UserlandFrontier</a>, and is the brainchild of <a href="DaveWiner.html">DaveWiner</a> and his cohorts.

        Frontier really is an amazing piece of work. Calling it <em>essentially a scriptable object database</em> doesn't quite do it justice.

      <p>
        I'm interested in hearing why - please elaborate if possible.

        These guys are right behind <a href="XmlRpc.html">XmlRpc</a> in a big way

        Well my expertise and familiarity with Frontier doesn't match my respect for what has been achieved.

        A good elaboration would go into quite a lot of its history, from dave's background with More, one of the best outliners ever, through his history with <a href="AppleEvents.html">AppleEvents</a> and the interapplication communication toolkit at Apple, and then through the way Frontier grew from Aretha into what it is today.
      </p>
      <p>
        One really good reference, which is now online, is the O'Rielly book about frontier by Matt Neuberg. This book was written a while back, before version 5 and version 6. So it focuses more on the fundamentals that enable it to do the web content management that it is good at now.
      </p>
      <p>
        The things that make it more than a scriptable object database are the integrated outliner, the large number of builtin system verbs, and the inter-application communication features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually this stuff can get refactored into a WhatsCoolAboutFrontier page
      </p>
      <p>
        This page <a href="http://frontier.userland.com/,">http://frontier.userland.com/,</a> has a lot of marketing stuff, but the Key Features sidebar lists eleven key points about what its good for.
      </p>

        While it could be argued that it is <em>essentially a scriptable object database</em>, all the extras add up to making it a much bigger animal. It really is quite a beast to get to know.
