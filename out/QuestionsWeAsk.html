        The idea behind this page is good: a collection of important questions and (if known) their answers. Unfortunately, much of what is below appears to consist of any text with a question mark at the end of it -- whether it makes sense out of context or not (and it's usually not) -- frequently followed by an equally meaningless or non-sequitur answer. I can count the actual useful Q&As on one hand.

        Therefore, the question I ask is this: Does this page really need to exist? The process described below indicates this page is maintained manually (I'd rather hoped it was automated, in which case it would make sense for it to not make much sense) which sounds like a lot of work for not much value. Surely that effort could be productively redirected to something more valuable?

        The point made by the now deleted portions of this page is now made evident: Some of the <a href="QuestionsWeAsk.html">QuestionsWeAsk</a> within this wiki (particularly those on extremely long pages) are to quote from above, merely <em>text with a question mark at the end of it -- whether it makes sense out of context or not (and it's usually not) -- frequently followed by an equally meaningless or non-sequitur answer</em>
