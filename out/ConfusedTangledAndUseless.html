        We ordinarily do not like messes. While they may included UsefulArtifacts, when they are included in a collection or pile of unorderly, misplaced and confusing stuff, we are tempted to just throw the whole mess in a trash can to be forgotten and to be done with. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But sometimes, it is worth the effort to extract value from messes. A good feeling comes from rescuing from the discard pile, something <a href="GenuinelyUseful.html">GenuinelyUseful</a>. It is like getting something free.
      </p>
      <p>
        The rescue effort does not end it, left to do is the cleaning and polishing, and then the finding of a place to put it. (If in a SharedSpace, a place agreed upon)
      </p>
      <p>
        Such is often the situation in PlacesOfChaos. Wiki can have and usually includes such piles of stuff. This is why it was made editable, and being a SharedSpace, has been furnished with agreeable processes to BringSomeOrderToItsStuff. That is what the edit page and save buttons are used for. Remembering the <a href="WikiPolitenessLevel.html">WikiPolitenessLevel</a>, one may bring about CollaborationsWithGoodEffect and a Sense of Order.
