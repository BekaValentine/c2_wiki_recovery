        The Valley's got its hustlers<br/>
        Wall Street's got its rich<br/>
        RedmondWashington's got William Gates III<br/>
        He's a code-slinging sonofabitch<br/>
        Yeah he's meek and nerdy as a geek can be<br/>
        But he's richer than an oil emir<br/>
        And when the CEOs all get together at night<br/>
        You know they all call Big Bill "sir"<br/>

        You don't laugh at Donald Trumps's hair<br/>
        You don't piss up a hill<br/>
        You don't give a wedgie to Jesse Ventura<br/>
        And you don't mess around with Bill.<br/>

        Well outa Scandanavia came a college boy<br/>
        Said I think Windows really sucks<br/>
        My momma named me Linus, (and that's because I'm Finnish)<br/>
        But my friends all call me Tux<br/>
        Yeah I'm looking for the king of Tech America<br/>
        Drives a custom-built Ferrari<br/>
        And it may sound funny, but his shit cost too much money<br/>
        And I think software should be free....<br/>

        And everbody say, Jack, don't you know that...<br/>
        You don't laugh at Donald Trumps's hair<br/>
        You don't piss up a hill<br/>
        You don't give a wedgie to Jesse Ventura<br/>

        Well a hush fell over the boardroom<br/>
        When Bill came in and took his seat<br/>
        And when the hackin' was done, and the lawyers had their fun<br/>
        There was blood on the balance sheet<br/>
        Yeah sales were down twenty percentage points<br/>
        And the stock price even more<br/>
        And you better believe that the trade rags changed their story<br/>
        When Bill's jaw hit the floor<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Now they say<br/>
        You don't laugh at Donald Trump's hair<br/>
        You don't stand under ducks<br/>
        You don't give a wedgie to Ahnold Schwarzenegger<br/>
        And you don't mess around with Tux<br/>
        You don't laugh at Donald Trump's hair<br/>
        You don't stand under ducks<br/>

        And you don't mess around with Tux<br/>
