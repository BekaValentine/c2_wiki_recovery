        Why hello!
      </p>
      <p>
        I am 23, just got out of the UnitedStatesMarineCorps and have started my Computer Science degree this year (8/2011)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have dabbled a bit in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> so far. I must say, I really enjoy C and outside of school, I spend the majority of my time playing with it.

        AndroidOS, anyone!?!? Tinkering with AndroidOS is what got interested in computers to begin with, so it holds a special place in my heart.

        Looking forward to learning as much as I can from this wiki :)
