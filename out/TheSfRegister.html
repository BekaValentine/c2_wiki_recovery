        The Sf Register

        <strong>The SFR</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Bozo Bit (see <a href="SetTheBozoBit.html">SetTheBozoBit</a>) is a crude indicator that doesn't take into account the mind numbing variety of idiots one may encounter in nature. Thus, we propose updating this anti-pattern from a single bit value to a larger structure called the SFR.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the current standard, the SFR is 32-bits, thereby allowing nearly 4.3 billion types of idiot to be distinguished. It is not lost on this author that even this measure is potentially inadequate with global population near 6 billion, and that presently unindexable forms of idiocy may thus already exist in nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        To avoid such gaps as well as unwelcome collisions, we propose extending the SFR to 128-bits, which should be amply expressive for any plausible future growth in either aggregate population or idiot density.

        Why not just the BozoRegister?
