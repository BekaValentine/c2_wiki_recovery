      <p>
        I am an American programmer for a software company called Blackbaud, who uses Visual Studio (mostly VB.NET these days) and SQL Server.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a former life I worked for Nucor Steel, where I used Delphi to write client-server Win32 apps that ran on an Oracle back-end.

        I also took some pictures which are mildly interesting near the place I used to live:  <a href="http://www.panoramio.com/user/3219965">http://www.panoramio.com/user/3219965</a>

        Nice to meet you, too.  Some more about myself, in the hopes of generating some conversation here:
        I still have a lot to learn as a programmer (graduated college in 2001), but so far my main interest- and maybe this is mostly an aesthetic thing- is in making software as user-friendly and feature-filled as possible without introducing visual clutter.  For this reason, Firefox has become one of my favorite programs.  I especially like features that are invisible but still intuitive (who doesn't, right?).  As a trivial example, the use of the Backspace key to go back in a browser, or F5 to refresh a screen.  <a href="MouseGestures.html">MouseGestures</a> are great, IMO.

        What type of work do you do in your company?
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically we have a large in-house suite of software that serves the non-profit industry.  I write customizations to that software.
