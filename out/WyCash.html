        Wy Cash

      <p>
        <a href="WyCash.html">WyCash</a> is a fixed-income portfolio management system.  It is the first commercial software developed and maintained using all <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> principles and is therefore a noteworthy first instance of <a href="ExtremeProgrammingProjects.html">ExtremeProgrammingProjects</a>. <a href="WyCash.html">WyCash</a> is in use today generating revenue for vendor and customer alike a decade after its introduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WyCash.html">WyCash</a> started as an ordinary <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> project, with a prototype that evolved into a product. The <a href="WyCash.html">WyCash</a> team stayed with the product through many many releases. By continuously evolving their own practices the team created most of those of today's XP. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WyCash.html">WyCash</a> methods differed from XP in two subtle and probably unimportant ways ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tasks were posted to a <a href="WorkQueue.html">WorkQueue</a> as needed rather than at fixed intervals of XP. In common was the notion that management could reorder work, but not interfere with the estimated durations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A single testing framework served the needs of both developers and customers rather than the separate unit and functional tests of XP. In common was the recognition that quality regression tests were mandatory for aggressive refactoring.

      <hr/>
      <p>
        According to an outdated link, "This product is no longer available". Are you sure it's still generating revenue for the vendor?
      </p>
      <p>
        The product has changed hands several times. It now goes by the less Wyatt specific name MaPS. = [<a href="http://www.invessys.com/">http://www.invessys.com/</a>  ]
