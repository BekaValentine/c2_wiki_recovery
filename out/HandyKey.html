        Manufacturers of the twiddler, a small one-hand combination keyboard/mouse replacement.  The twiddler can be used as an auxiliary keyboard/mouse.  ( I wonder if this would be a good tool for <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> ).  The twiddler plugs into your keyboard and serial ports, you can plug your keyboard into the twiddler's keyboard cable ( hence the whole auxiliary thing ).  <a href="HandyKey.html">HandyKey</a> suggests that it is possible to type up to 30 WPM, but I have heard rumors of MIT having some folks who can get up to 60.  The twiddler has been a darling of the <a href="WearableCommunity.html">WearableCommunity</a> for a few years now.

        Looks good - but does it matter if you're left handed?

        <em>Nope - it is programmable, and you can download a new keymap to reverse the</em>

        If you are a right-handed writer using an English keyboard you have little problems. If you use a different keyboard and/or need special characters (e.g. for programming, foreign characters, alt-bsp, ...) you will have to reprogram it. This is not easy, because documentation is currently bad. But the support is friendly.

        I would share experiences, reprogramming know how and keymaps in case someone is interested. My interest grew when I suffered from <a href="CarpalTunnelSyndrome.html">CarpalTunnelSyndrome</a> last year (this even started before I stumbled over this wiki).

        What is the best way to get up-to-speed on this Twiddler2 device?  In other words, how can a person get as profficient with the Twiddler2 as with a standard keyboard style he has been using for 20 years?
