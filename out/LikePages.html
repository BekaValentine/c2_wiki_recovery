        Here is a power tool for surfing wiki. Starting from any wiki page, the <em>like</em> script finds similarly named pages based on the first and last word of the page's title. Try these to get the idea...

        There is a <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a> link at the bottom of every page which will do this search for the page you are reading.
      </p>

        This works for proper names too.

        These <em>power names</em> score big here because they are at the core of what we talk about.

        Navigating the result set results in another like-search. If you'd actually like to look at a page, as opposed to just marveling at the diversity of wiki, click its name when it appears in the explanatory text.

        <em>Why not make the number displayed to the left of the page name be a link to the page itself?</em>

      <p>
        Pages created just today won't be visible to this search until tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The search tries to be smart about the article "The" and plurals made with "s".

        Want to really take the tour? Try selecting names from alternate columns. See how far you can go without repeating or getting stuck.

        <a href="JeroenMostert.html">JeroenMostert</a> first made the name structure observation and suggested it as a means of hierarchically organizing pages. He built a trial implementation which was pretty cool.

        I really like the approach you have taken, with an excerpt and the two columns (first + last). My trial implementation tries to combine the two columns into a single tree and also shows more levels at once. This somewhat complicates things (especially my code) and I'm not yet sure what (if any) advantages it has. For some of the <em>power names</em> my trial returns a more specific set of names, mostly because it uses not just the first or last word but the whole name. My trail script sometimes also returns names not returned by <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For an example, see <a href="http://ch.twi.tudelft.nl/~mostert/striki/namestruct.pl?MetaModel.">http://ch.twi.tudelft.nl/~mostert/striki/namestruct.pl?MetaModel.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DataModelPatterns.html">DataModelPatterns</a> (coming from <a href="DataModel.html">DataModel</a> from Model) is returned which does not have the search word as first or last.

        Why are the excerpts not formatted? This would especially be useful for those see xxx pages. -- <a href="JeroenMostert.html">JeroenMostert</a>

        That story got bumped to the next iteration. Currently, I open a copy of the db optimized for search, not formatting. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Simple feature request: could you link the <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a> on the bottom of the <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a> form for otherwise non-existent pages?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm thinking of the link I just made to <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>. Maybe it doesn't exist because the topic is called RedBlackTrees or <a href="BalancedTree.html">BalancedTree</a>? (I'm not an algorithm expert, so forgive me if I've conflated the two. They serve to illustrate my point here and under <a href="EditingPieMenus.html">EditingPieMenus</a>, at least.)
