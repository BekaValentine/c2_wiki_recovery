        Questions About Xp Stories And Tasks
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have some questions about the relationship between stories and tasks (as they occur in Xp). Hopefully, these can be collected here and someone will answer them.

        <dd><strong>Q</strong>: Are there any "rule of thumb" cardinalities or can a single <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a> be derived from one <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> or one <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> provoke one or more <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s. Or is it somehow important to have a one to many relationship between a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> and <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s?</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A story the way I write them seems to provoke between three and six tasks. Many of my clients write much smaller stories than I do, though. --<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        <dd><strong>Q</strong>: What is the difference between a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> <em>as a scheduling unit</em> and an <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a> <em>as a scheduling unit</em>? At first I thought that stories describe requirements, are then broken into tasks, and then the tasks become the unit of scheduling. Now I've read some text that refers to using the story as the scheduling unit. Could someone elaborate on this relationship a little?</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The story is the customer's boss' scheduling unit. The task is the team's scheduling unit. Task progress is visible to the customer (so much so that <a href="RetailAspect.html">RetailAspect</a> insists that only customers can check off tasks as completed).

        <dd><strong>Q</strong>: Can a simple <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> be its own Task or should a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> always be broken into one or more <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s?</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        It can be its own story.

        <em>I'm not sure I understand this. My guess is that a </em><a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> can never also be a Task. Instead, you can simply create a single Task whose wording very much resembles the Story.<em></em>

        <dd><strong>Q</strong>: Can one create an <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a> that doesn't have a <em>direct</em> correlation to any <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>? Say you are writing an EDF Scheduler that will be used at such a low level that it does not belong to any *one* specific <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>. Maybe even a better example is an <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a> to set up the VCS or other CM tasks you want to schedule explicitly in an iteration?</dd>

        <em>I'm going to preface this with the warning that I'm still the new guy on the block.  Engineering tasks seem (to me) to be statements of what needs to be achieved so the story can be written.  There is no need for correlation beyond the notion of "this is what needs to happen for this story".  However, if you can not directly tie a task to a story, then it'd be easy to say </em><a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.<em> </em>

        <dd><strong>Q</strong>: If you do like to DesignWithPictures, should you be designing the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, or are you rationalizing the <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s that come from that Story. I can see a progression something like the following:</dd>
      </dl>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Select a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Model the story with one or more <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>s, Class Diagrams, StateChart Diagrams or whatever design medium you prefer
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Now</em> break up the <em>design</em> into <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s
        </li>
      </ol>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>I suppose this seems interesting to me only because it makes upfront design work an optional step that you can neatly wedge between Story and Task so that the <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s end up falling out of the DesignArtifacts rather than the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>. However, I've heard other prefer to say that (when and if they do any upfront modeling) they prefer these to model the Tasks rather than the Story the tasks come from. Let me insert here that I know development is fuzzy, and you can do it either way or both ways. I'm just curious to know, psychologically (or even aesthetically), how Xp would view the <em>archetypical</em> series of (iterative) steps.</dd>

      <p>
        I see lots of design work happening during task breakdown- "Okay, we need to send both email and fax, so we'll have to make the Transport into an object (task), make the FaxTransport (task), add a GUI for the fax number (task), and put it into preferences (task)." Was this planning or design? Both.

        This is all I can think of right now. Do not feel restricted to answering these questions. This is Wiki, so feel free to add new questions. I'll also try to add more as they come up. While some may have obvious answers, it is sometimes helpful to point out the obvious.
