        Objective Advantages Of Lisp
      </h1>
      <p>
        The LispLanguageFamily is often asserted to be better than most (or all) other languages, especially <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and its relatives. However, partisans of these languages often argue that the claims of Lisp partisans lack objective support. This page is set up so that Lisp partisans can assert any <em>objective</em> and preferably quantitative reasons why Lisp is superior, either in a specific problem domain or in general, as well as for any counterarguments by Lisp detractors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ummm... wouldn't that have to be </em>ObjectiveAdvantagesOfLispVersusLanguageX? Although Lisp has a few unique features, most of its features have been emulated by other languages over the years -- it's just that there aren't any languages that have all of them.<em> - So write that. [He just did!]</em>

        See <a href="WhyWeLoveLisp.html">WhyWeLoveLisp</a>. Subtract the section headed "Beauty". <em>No kidding. This page is aggressive, talking about superiority, partisans, detractors and kicking ass. Unless it's rephrased, it's just another trap, since the only serious issue on this wiki is peoples' feelings of inferiority, which suggests to any lisper paying attention that this is the last page to contribute to, as it stands. Mu.</em> Huh? Did you read the same page I did? What's aggressive about it?

        I have yet to see a procedural language that has all my favorite features (OOP popularity has frozen procedural language progress IMO), but if you are itching for an existing language to compare, maybe try LISP.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Huh?  LISP is a </em><a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>, not a procedural one.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> for example is a <a href="MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage.html">MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage</a>, with extremely good support for functional, imperative, and OO programming (I think imperative programming is what is meant above by 'procedural' programming).  Lisp did invent functional programming, but it hasn't stood still since the 50's. <em>Lisp did not invent functional programming.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It was quite a while before Lisp had useful first-class functions.  Dynamically-scoped lambdas are just about useless; until <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> (and later <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>) brought <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a> into Lisp, many of the tricks that <a href="FunctionalWeenie.html">FunctionalWeenie</a>s take for granted were unavailable to the SmugLisp variety of weenie. :)
