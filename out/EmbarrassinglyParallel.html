        Embarrassingly Parallel
      </h1>
      <p>
        ``Embarassingly Parallel<em> means that it is easy to get</em>
        arbitrarily large <a href="SpeedUp.html">SpeedUp</a> by suitable <a href="ParTition.html">ParTition</a> strategy
        or by making the problem sufficiently large.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if your goal is achieving high performance and large
        <a href="SpeedUp.html">SpeedUp</a>, you -want- your problem to be embarrassingly
        parallel.  If it is not embarassingly parallel, you would
        be well-advised to put some effort into transforming it
        into a related problem that is embarrassingly parallel,
        or approximating the original difficult problem by an
        embarrassingly parallel surrogate.  Or perhaps you can
        subdivide the original problem into an embarrassingly
        parallel common case and a difficult (read ``slow<em>)</em>
        less-common fallback.
      </p>
      <p>
        This latter approach often allows <a href="ParTition.html">ParTition</a> to be used
        to good effect.
