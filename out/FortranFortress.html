        A bastion of dusty decks of <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> code older than the current programmers.

        There was a time around 1970 when my Fortran programs only existed on the deck of cards - there was no computer storage of the actual program. The decks were very precious. That changed as computer systems improved. The next problem was keeping track of program changes. I remember getting two listings and putting them side by side on a table to compare them. I could have done with the <em>diff</em> programs of today which can do it very neatly. Now the dusty decks have been used to build well tested numerical codes which are the foundation layer of many numerical packages.
