        Algebraix Data
      </h1>
      <p>
        A (Successful?) commercial implementation of <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a>: "the A2DB advanced analytic database. A2DB employs patented Algebraix database technology based on advanced set-processing mathematics. By enabling real-time data access, eliminating manual performance tuning and running on affordable commodity hardware, Algebraix database technology promises to be disruptive to the entire business-intelligence (BI) complex."

        The patent they talk about is: "U.S. Patent No. 7,613,734, for its systems and methods for providing data sets using a store of algebraic relations."

        Can they really patent <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a>? Is it too much "math based" to be patentable?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It appears they haven't patented </em><a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> itself, but have patented a particular application of it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So... now they are the only ones that can implement a database with it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No.  The patent does not claim to have invented </em><a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> even if it could patent a mathematical technique (which is attributed to D L Childs anyway), nor does it appear (having only glanced over it, not read it in detail) to patent applying <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> to databases in general.  It appears to patent a specific strategy for implementing of <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> for analytical databases.  You would only potentially run afoul of the patent if you implemented your <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> database system the same way as described in the patent.  This is quite distinct from, say, the <a href="TransRelationalModel.html">TransRelationalModel</a>, in which the fundamental technique is the substance of the related patents.  I'm not aware of any way to implement the <a href="TransRelationalModel.html">TransRelationalModel</a> without running afoul of the patent, even though the <a href="TransRelationalModel.html">TransRelationalModel</a> might be an unintentional (or even intentional, but not stated as such) application of a particular sequence of <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> operators.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's notable that most of the techniques described in the patent obviously have prior art, so even if you implemented an </em><a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> database system the same way described in the patent, it's questionable as to whether it would be upheld in court.<em></em>
