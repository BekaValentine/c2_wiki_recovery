        A time tested optimization pattern.

      <ul>
        <li>
           First, make the code do what it is supposed to do.  Do not try to optimize for size or speed yet.  <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Second, reduce redundancy.  Refactoring common code to a common location is easier once the code works, harder after it has been optimized for performance.  <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Third, optimize execution time.  <a href="ProfileBeforeOptimizing.html">ProfileBeforeOptimizing</a>.

      </ul>
