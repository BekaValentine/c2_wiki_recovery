        George Brower has found that participating on this wiki is not a good use of his time.

           Sorry to see that change of attitude so soon. Although you find a fair number of people with <a href="ObsessiveCompulsiveDisorder.html">ObsessiveCompulsiveDisorder</a> here, once you learn how to manage your own responses there are good stuff here, not necessarily in the statistics field. Also there are quite a few mathematicians lounge around here (I am not).

           Your <a href="ManagementRoadMap.html">ManagementRoadMap</a> is still much valued.
        </li>

           You may also want to look into <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, if you do not already know, as an example of the success of the Wiki concept (heard it did go through lots of painful moments too).

        <em>Not so much my own experience, but seeing the amount of hand-wringing about behavior and a few cases of ambush (snotty comments and deletes on pages I visited marked only by IP addresses in the logs). There's good stuff here, but it is like many potentially good but uncontrolled on-line resources - there are way too many externalities (that's economist speak for behaviors whose cost is born by people not directly involved in a transaction - like air and water pollution). There's enough of that stuff that's unavoidable to stick around it voluntarily - a little like wandering barefoot in a chemical dump.</em>

        <em>Thanks for your kind words, though.</em>
