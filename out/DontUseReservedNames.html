        Dont Use Reserved Names
      </h1>
      <p>
        In C and C++, there is a long list of names (and some name-patterns) which are reserved by the C/C++ standards for compiler implementors and standard libraries implementors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some names may be implemented as normal functions, #define macros, or recognized in special ways by the compiler... for example, <em>strlen</em> could be all three. A C compiler might in-line special code for <em>strlen</em> when optimization is turned on, but when optimization is turned off, <em>strlen</em> might be a macro that conditionally calls <em>__cstrlen</em>. If used without #including the correct header, then <em>strlen</em> would be a function call to a function named <em>strlen</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since #define does not respect scope, and since any reserved name could be implemented using a #define, you can't easily use reserved names as identifiers in your code -- this means local variable names, method names, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
        Since remembering all the reserved names and naming patterns is difficult, use mixed case names when you are programming in C and C++, or <strong>trailing</strong> underscores. One or two underscores in the beginning of a name constitutes two of the reserved naming patterns.
      </p>

      <p>
        I once had a weird problem, where a C++ method named <em>abort</em> would not compile in one of two compilers. Turned out that <em>abort</em> is reserved -- it is a function prototyped in stdlib.h for one compiler, and #defined in the header for the other compiler.
