        If <a href="ObjectsAreDictionaries.html">ObjectsAreDictionaries</a>, then why not apply similar patterns to relational tables instead of dictionaries. Dictionaries can be viewed as "crippled tables", limited to 2 columns and one key. If languages made it easier to embed and call code in tables, then we would essentially have a super-set of OO, but better tied to the (allegedly) cleaner rules of relational.
