        There seems to be an axis between two types of management strategies: one based on projects, the other on products.

        What occurs to me is that both of these approaches tend to abstract away, in search of a generic view, anything that can be specific in a situation. This abstraction is however not based upon knowledge, but a priori. It allows a treatment by analogy, as well as favors a class of professional managers, who don't need to know anything from the domain of activity.

        This strikes me as specially dangerous in the context of software, or of any hi-tech domain. --<a href="MarcGirod.html">MarcGirod</a>
