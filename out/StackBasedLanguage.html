        Stack Based Language

        A stack-based language is one in which a stack, implicitly accessed by most operations, is a fundamental part of the programming model.  Examples include <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, <a href="FactorLanguage.html">FactorLanguage</a>, <a href="JoyLanguage.html">JoyLanguage</a>, <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>, and the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> (which, since one can write in assembly for it, should be considered a language albeit a low-level one).
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages which maintain a program stack ("<a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a>") for storing of <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s and/or parameter passing as an implementation detail, but keep the programmer from manipulating <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a> directly, don't count.  This includes most imperative programming languages (<a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>)--in each of these, the program stack could be replaced with an alternative data structure (for example, heap-allocated activation records, like <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> has).
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, providing a stack data structure in the library also doesn't count.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Actually, the <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> uses two separate stacks: the data stack for parameter and result passing and the return stack for storing activation records. This separation makes it easy and natural for a Forth word to return multiple values. (It is possible and sometimes useful to temporarily push data on to the return stack to reduce stack juggling.)

        Another common feature of stack-based languages is <a href="PostfixNotation.html">PostfixNotation</a>, also called <a href="ReversePolishNotation.html">ReversePolishNotation</a>.  Rather than writing an expression such as 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           + 4
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        in many StackBasedLanguages you write
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           4 +
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A bit unusual, until you get used to it.  Postfix notation has the nice property that it doesn't require parentheses for associativity.  The following expression is ambiguous:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           + 4 * 5
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Is it (3+4) * 5 = 35, or 3+(4*5) = 23?  The rules of mathematics and most programming languages say the latter; <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> says the former.  To override these defaults, parentheses must be added.  In postfix notation, that's not necessary--you would write either
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           4 + 5 *
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        if you mean the first, or
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           4 5 * +
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        if you mean the second.
      </p>
      <p>
        One drawback with postfix notation is that operators must either be unary or binary, not both.  If you want negation, you cannot overload - to be a unary operator; you either have to provide a new operator (say neg) or use subtraction from zero.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           5 - +
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        is an error.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           5 neg +
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           0 5 - +
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        both produce -2.
      </p>

        I generally consider stack-based languages to be better suited for IntermediateForms or <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>s (the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> is a fine example) then they are for source languages.  Elimination of variables/LetBindings is theoretically interesting, and certainly elimination of variables which are only used as temporaries is nice; however, stack-based languages can increase the chance of programmer error.  Stack-based languages frequently require the programmer to keep track of bookkeeping details that a compiler should handle instead ("Where on the stack is the result of evaluating the foo function?").  Variable names are also a key part of a program's documentation (well-chosen ones, anyway); eliminating them tends to obfuscate code.  In my opinion, at least.
      </p>

        A program stack (visible to the programmer, rather than just a convenient way to deal with <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s) can be a useful thing; especially when it augments rather than replaces other things.

        I agree; <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> novices are apt to make many stack-balancing errors when programming in their accustomed style (big functions, lots of conditionals, lots of intermediate values on the stack).  The lesson learned is to <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> and <a href="SimplifyVigorously.html">SimplifyVigorously</a>.  The ideal Forth word definition is seven words long.  Easy to understand, easy to <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> interactively and exhaustively.  Proverb: "Refactor until there is no place left for the bug to hide."
      </p>
      <p>
        The more words you factor your code into, the more the words themselves become the built-in documentation.  In the few cases where persistent stack intermediates are unavoidable, one can insert a stack comment: ( foo bar -- ), or use a local variable language extension to define symbolic names for those intermediates.
      </p>
      <p>
        As with <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> programming, you can get around the lack of a safety net in Forth (which has been described as a macro assembler for a virtual stack machine) by using good programming practices.

        If you are asking <em>Where on the stack is the result of evaluating the foo function?</em>, you probably need to refactor in simpler terms. Unavoidably, that happens all the time.

        The built-in language in HP 48 series graphic calculators (and other HP RPN calculators) is also stack-oriented.
