        Nomads And Farmers

        [from <a href="TribalDevelopment.html">TribalDevelopment</a>:] Ah, at last I have found a phrase to describe my programming career: <em></em><a href="NomadicProgrammer.html">NomadicProgrammer</a><em>.</em>
        Thank you. It always takes a while to explain to potential employers why I keep moving from job to job (my longest gig ever lasted 2.5 years).  
        I <strong>never</strong> leave a project unfinished, but once it is done (and delivered to customer/employer satisfaction) I start looking (internally first) for the next conquest. -- <a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a>

        Hey, wait a minute, I've been at the same place for 7 years!  Does this mean that I've become a <a href="PastoralProgrammer.html">PastoralProgrammer</a> ?  On the other hand, maybe it just means that I'm taking my shaman role seriously in looking for patterns all of the time.

        The Homestead Act of 1862 [<a href="http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/wpages/wpgs650/homestd.htm]">http://www.pbs.org/weta/thewest/wpages/wpgs650/homestd.htm]</a> provided that the land is yours free if
        you live on it and cultivate it for <em>five</em> years.  That
        seems like a good threshold.
        Sorry Kyle, I guess
        you're a SodBuster like me (unless you've taken
        up arms against the US Gvt.).

        I think there <em>is</em> a difference in attitude between the people who
        know they are going to move on, and people who plan to be around
        for a while.  A lot of my ideas about reuse resulted from the 
        fact that if I left the code in sorry shape (planting robber crops)
        I'd be the one to have to clean up after it.  On the other
        hand, if I found a way to factor things so that I didn't 
        have to do them over and over again, I was the one who benefited.

        There is a difference between this approach and that taken by
        some of these migrant workers/hunter-gatherers. I guess the problem
        these days is how can you keep 'em down on the farm.  (Or
        will the big combines render the field hands obsolete?)

        <em>Um, sorry Brian, that's not quite the way it works. If you want to be a </em><a href="NomadicProgrammer.html">NomadicProgrammer</a>, you can't afford to leave *any* messes behind. You live by your references, and usually you're only as good as your last one. If you don't leave people with full bellies and smiling faces, you're never going to work again.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've found this myth of nomadic irresponsibility regrettably common among </em><a href="PastoralProgrammer.html">PastoralProgrammer</a>(s), who often seem a little insecure when confronted with nomads. Nomads are familiar with the pejorative "scumtractor". The best way for the nomad, of course, is not to confront that attitude, but just to do a good job and let 'em smile while they curse. I think this is the real difference in outlook: a <a href="PastoralProgrammer.html">PastoralProgrammer</a> owns the land and does with it as he likes; a <a href="NomadicProgrammer.html">NomadicProgrammer</a> respects the land and does what he can justify to the landlord. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Both nomads and farmers can do good work, of course, and there are rotten apples in both barrels too, no doubt. The best indicator is the quality of their work, whether they have ever left a mess behind or left someone in the lurch. Take them on their merits, not their lifestyle. --</em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a><em></em>

        Sorry if that struck a nerve.  Such was not my intent.
        I guess we need a category to distinguish the slash-and-burn
        types from the concientious.  My observation was intended more
        as a reflection on where my attitudes about reuse came
        from than as a knock on nomads. I've done enough
        consulting to know that your job is to leave
        things in such good shape that they don't need you anymore.
        Otherwise, you should stop consulting and
        apply for a permanent position with your client. --<a href="BrianFoote.html">BrianFoote</a>

        <em>Yes, and apologies for my force. As for re-use, I wonder whether it matters so much in this day of patterns, generics and standards. If all we're really doing is fitting and joining these things, what value are we adding that should be re-used? We may capture the odd domain-specific appliance, but is that really worth much? --</em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a><em></em>

        Another metaphor, particularly suitable to Research and
        consulting endeavors, borrowed from the Texas cattle industry,
        is <a href="SuitcaseFarmer.html">SuitcaseFarmer</a>. -- <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>
