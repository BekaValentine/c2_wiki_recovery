        Recommended usage ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To someone writing overly detailed specifications, "you think that's code you're writing?" Meaning: stop writing text and help me write that in code.
        </li>
        <li>
           To someone carelessly writing code, "you think that's code you're writing?" Meaning: give some thought to those who will have to read this, our most definitive document.
        </li>
        <li>
           To someone writing code, "you think that's code you're writing?" Meaning: You are controlling a nuclear reactor, entertaining a five-year old, flying a 500-seater aircraft, keeping people in gaol (jail) , dispensing drugs, talking to a human being.
        </li>
        <li>
           To a grammarian who insists on correct semi-colon usage. Meaning: The pedantry is only valuable to a point. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Among friends.
        </li>
        <li>
           To someone marking up an HTML document but thinks it's programming, "you think that's code you're writing?" (rather than markup).  Meaning:  Those are hints, not instructions, and the browser is entitled to render the content however it damn well likes, so quit trying to force it.
        </li>
        <li>
           If preceded with: Do you think my coding faster, or better... has anything to do with my IDEs in this place?
        </li>
        <li>
           To a UML addict ...
        </li>

        It is kinda like <a href="BoldlyGoWhereSomeoneHasGoneBefore.html">BoldlyGoWhereSomeoneHasGoneBefore</a>. Not the same meaning of course, but a quotation reworked to indicate something else. -- <a href="AndreSlabber.html">AndreSlabber</a>.

        What strikes me as the amusing part: Yes, code is code, even if the hardware it's running on is simulated by <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a>. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>
