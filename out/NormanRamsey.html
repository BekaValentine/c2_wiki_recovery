      <p>
        Norman Ramsey has been fascinated with programming languages and program design ever since his first teacher told him his variables should <em>not</em> be named A, B, C, etc. <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a>s got him hooked on thinking about programming, which he currently teaches. He uses Wiki heavily in course work. He is a huge fan of <a href="GraphViz.html">GraphViz</a>.
