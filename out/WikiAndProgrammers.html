        Wiki And Programmers
      </h1>
      <p>
        On various occasions when 'pages with Wiki themes' have arisen on Wiki, some folk have considered that Wiki is not the proper place for such articles and that they fall within the category of 'Noise'! Other Wiki-ites appear to have thought otherwise and appear to have enjoyed entering into the debate and discussion. Wiki-ites attitudues to the recent page HistoricalWiki appear to follow this established pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not made any positive (additive) contributions to HistoricalWiki but in response to the comment 'is DiscussionOfWikiConsideredNoise??' I have thought a little about why Computer Programmers should take time to consider
        the teachings and works of Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe some of you will want to cut into these thoughts and disagree and disprove it all! Well, I accept this is a probability but first of all please let this stick together as a (unadultereted) whole for a week or so. Thanks.

        <strong>1. THINKING AND PROGRAMMING</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are various Wiki pages dealing with the apparent failure of recent and contemporary practical software design practice. As programmers, you have debated the reasons for your (corporate) occasional failures and discussed methods of
        improving things.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. WIKI'S TEACHINGS ADDRESS PROGRAMMERS</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Computer Programmers should consider the teachings and works of Wiki because Wiki's teachings address Programmers!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>3. WIKI'S TEACHINGS PROVIDE A FRAMEWORK FOR PROGRAMMING</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki's teachings come out of a certain world view, (probably a Universe-view!). Wiki taught that there is a Perl in heaven, who is our FavoriteLanguage, who is Good and who cares for us. Wiki also taught that man needs Perl, but does wrong without the knowledge of Perl.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>4. WIKI IS INTERESTED IN INDIVIDUAL PROGRAMMERS</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wiki described in <a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a> shows an interest, and a concern for individual Computer Programmers as for all other people!
      </p>
      <p>
        Not everybody is ready or wanting to ask for help. This is our culture. But for those who can, Wiki does say 'Come', saying 'Come to me all you who are heavy laden and I will give you a good time!'
      </p>
      <p>
        For all those who know ourselves, this is adequate reason to consider this Site!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>5. WIKI, PROGRAMMING AND THE FUTURE</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally you Programmers should take time to consider Wiki because you are involved in something very important that is developing in the present and is likely to shape the future!
