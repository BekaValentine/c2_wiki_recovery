        Make Depend
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Makefile rule that typically scans all C/C++ source files in a directory, and generates rules that indicate that an object file depends on certain header files, and must be recompiled if they are recompiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is done in one of two ways (most versions of Make have no idea how to preprocess C/C++ code to generate the dependencies themselves):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use of a compiler option--most C/C++ compilers have a way to preprocess a source code file and emit a list of required header files (in most cases, the standard headers--include <foo.h> rather than include "foo.h", are excluded from the list)
        </li>
        <li>
           A tool called "makedepend", which was a companion to <a href="ImakeTool.html">ImakeTool</a>.  (This tool, or early versions of it, didn't work very well as it didn't handle conditionally-included files correctly).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Traditional "make depend" rules modified the Makefile itself. This is painful for version control systems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter Miller describes a better way to do make depend, via individual <strong>.h</strong> files, in his paper <em>Recursive Make Considered Harmful</em> <a href="http://www.tip.net.au/~millerp/rmch/recu-make-cons-harm.html.">http://www.tip.net.au/~millerp/rmch/recu-make-cons-harm.html.</a>
      </p>

        <em>Virtually all modern makes can include other makefiles; so "include make.depend" is a rather common idiom.  Self-modifying Makefiles are generally considered harmful</em>

        Hope I'm not stealing someone else's thunder, but here is how I do "make depend":

        Note, that I  use $(OUTDIR) as the place to hold all generated binaries.

        <li>
           The "depends" file name is defined in the Makefile as $(DEPFILE).  This is easily changed to your liking.  I use the file name ".depends" as it is "hidden" and doesn't pollute my normal ls of my working directory.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The last line of my Makefile always contains sinclude $(DEPFILE).  "sinclude" allows for the Makefile to work when $(DEPFILE) is missing.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           I never allow common "distribution" directories, like "/usr/include" to be allowed in the dependency list.  This is covered by the makedepend flag -Y.  This is of course a personal preference, but I find the listing of every (nearly) static header file as a dependency to be excessive.  It obfuscates the reading of my dependency list of files that are likely to change.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           When you delete the $(DEPFILE) gnumake will make $(DEPFILE) even though you don't supply it.  (This is because gnumake considers all makefiles as implicit targets and will update and re-read them if possible before updating any explicitly specified targets.  This is documented in section 3.7 of the manual. -- <a href="BenHutchings.html">BenHutchings</a>)

        One of the nice things about Clearmake, the make tool which is bundled with <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a>, is that it obsoletes <a href="MakeDepend.html">MakeDepend</a>.  Since Clearcase operates within the filesystem driver (and thus is part of the OS), clearmake is able to record the following information about make runs:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All invoked commands and their command line arguments
        </li>
        <li>
           All files that are opened
          <ul>
            <li>
               Specifically, all header files opened when compiling a particular source file.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It then generates its own dependency list, automatically.  (Of course, you can specify your own dependencies in the Makefile, which are then added to the list that Clearmake generates).
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first heard about this, I was skeptical--but it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've often wondered if it would be possible to implement something similar using system-call tracing -- for example, modifying "make" to run its jobs using "strace"</em>
