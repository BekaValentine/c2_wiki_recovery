        Test Ordering
      </h1>
      <p>
        Two aspects of test ordering:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>1. - Run Likely to Break Tests Earlier in the Test List</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, run the most recently modified files first.  Just a speed optimization (though, speed in testing can be very important - it shortens the feedback cycle). See <a href="TestSpeed.html">TestSpeed</a>/<a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>2. - Order Specific Tests</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some tests work when run in one order, and fail when run in another order.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a bad thing, a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>. It usually indicates implicit dependencies in the test framework or the code under test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Isolating tests by placing them in their own objects, or in their own processes reduces the opportunity for such <a href="TestOrdering.html">TestOrdering</a> problems.  But it's really sweeping things under the rug.
