        The opposite of <a href="SuperOverGeneralized.html">SuperOverGeneralized</a>. Hard wired, no configuration parameters, numeric literals scattered throughout the code. Difficult to specify (in excruciating detail), too much (and probably ill-understood) problem domain knowledge built in, expensive to develop, hopelessly difficult to evolve, unlikely to meet original specifications before the real world changes ahead of it. --<a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>

        Rather than defining extremes, I think we should recognize that software programs contain both over- and under-generalization.  This is sort of the basis of refactoring, the recognition that we will never have the correct balance, but we can continually adjust the software as we see fit.
