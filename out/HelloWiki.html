        Hello Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a simple spin-off from the <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> and <a href="AddingNewPages.html">AddingNewPages</a> page. When I first arrived at <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a>, I was excited by the ability to write directly onto a web page that is not owned by me. That is really cool and I am amazed by the wonderful things that go on here!  
      </p>
      <p>
        Back to the <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> thingy. To create a <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> equivalent of <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>, simply write the text MyNewPageTitle using capitalized words without spaces on any page. After saving the changes and reloading the same page, you will see MyNewPageTitle followed by a ? (question mark) which is also a hyperlink. Click on the question mark and Wiki will pop up a page for you to define the contents of MyNewPageTitle.
      </p>
      <p>
        To wrap things up, if you put a capitalized multi-word without spaces that is also a <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> page name, for example <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>, you have added a link to the page titled <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hope all this helps :) & comments are always welcomed.

        On a slightly different note, I've noticed a tendency amongst, er, ok a tendency of mine to want to write a Wiki server in new tools/languages that I come across. I think of this as "<a href="HelloWiki.html">HelloWiki</a>". For example, I'm doing a mini Wiki in an EJB environment right now. Overkill, I know - but it's just for the purposes of learning the tool/language, just like <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> exists as a first, most basic step.
      </p>
      <p>
        In most tools or languages, a simple Wiki server is likely to expose you to some sort of disk or database storage, a bit of networking maybe, some string mangling, and generally give you a helpful first wander around the libraries and whathaveyou. And a simple Wiki is a nice bite-sized chunk of work that won't take you too long, and that you can safely throw away afterwards (or give to others) once you've found your feet.

        I'm beginning to <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>. It used to be that the first program I wrote in any given language was a program to identify radars (basically a radar database). Since identifying radars isn't a problem I have now, I haven't done that for a few years. But I'm about to implement a Wiki as my first servlet project. I think having a problem to solve helps direct learning (and make it more enjoyable). <em>-- </em><a href="JonStrayer.html">JonStrayer</a><em></em>
