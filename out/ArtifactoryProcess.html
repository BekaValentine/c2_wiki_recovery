        In the process of collecting artifacts, it is noted that there are occasions when a process which extends their usefulness might be employed. One such process is call <a href="WikiBatics.html">WikiBatics</a>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        It originated in a desire to collect time sampled collections (snapshots) of a number of related pages as data, first within a collection of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> pages separated as a collection per day. This includes a single days worth (daily list) of pages as found in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> (collection list) as well as the individual pages as of that day within a portable format document (pdf).

        We need examples, one wikizen said to me several years ago
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           so here it can be found: <a href="WikiBatics.html">WikiBatics</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It is but one possible use of an <a href="ArtifactoryProcess.html">ArtifactoryProcess</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Others (let your imagination roam) exist which operate in other ways on collections. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           this processing leaves the original to reflect subsequent changes and to develop independently of the time sampled collection
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One might use the wooden-language word "<a href="ArtifactoryProcess.html">ArtifactoryProcess</a>" to classify <a href="WikiBatics.html">WikiBatics</a>
