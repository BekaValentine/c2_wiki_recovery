        A compiler's view of code resembles a big map seen thru a soda straw. The 
        compiler can, for example, track a river and ensure that roads do indeed

        Because we have this ability, far beyond the compiler's ken, we want to

        bridges are not found, the compiler can just add them and keep going.
