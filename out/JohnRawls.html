        We lost Mr. Rawls a short time ago.  He's best known perhaps for his concept of the <a href="VeilOfIgnorance.html">VeilOfIgnorance</a>.  Simply put, imagine a committee formed to make the world a better governed place.  They could tinker with what's already up and running . . . but what if they could re-imagine the whole world and "start from scratch" -- acting as if they are ignorant of the way things are being done now?  What ideas might they come up with if there were no die-hard ideas or complacency?

        I'm sure I've oversimplified the above, but "the way things are done now" thinking just isn't going to improve the world.  --Prof Taylor
