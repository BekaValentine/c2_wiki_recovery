        I would agree; at least the best that I have ever owned.  A true UnixBox in a laptop, due to the sheer joy that is <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>.  -- <a href="ChadThompson.html">ChadThompson</a>

        I would also agree.  It's wide-screen resolution is incredible, but its speed and Unix roots are what make the difference for me.  I think I can safely say that I will be <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>-free for the rest of my days.  --<a href="DaveHoover.html">DaveHoover</a>

        <dd>I find that is almost true.

        Agree virtually. My experience with <a href="WinTel.html">WinTel</a> laptops has been pretty miserable. My little 700Mhz G3 iBook is a pleasure to use, if I could afford a <a href="PowerBook.html">PowerBook</a> I would not hesitate to upgrade. --<a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        I love my 12" machine's size so much that I'm not sure I'll ever be able to upgrade to an Intel machine
