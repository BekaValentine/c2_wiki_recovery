        No Strings
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have a fundamental distaste for passing Strings around as the main interface to a OO system. For example: for SQL in java, you are essentially creating glorified strings. This is why people make object relational mapping tools. But you still have to drop to string type objects to query the mapped objects. (I'm intentionally disregarding writing an algorithm to do the equivalent queries... it's not really a database at this point, just fancy serialization)
      </p>
      <p>
        In general, how one deals with databases is by passing strings. You make an SQL command. And put it in a string. You might even encapsulate that type of string in a class... But you're still dealing with glorified strings. Ditto for the object database querying schemes I've seen so far. You make a String, or an object with string like properties to encapsulate your query. But the query doesn't <em>really</em> know what it's talking about, there's no way the compiler could infer that this query here is related to the method on this object over there.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why we seem to have a divide between SQL like query languages, and the (anti-)pattern of having accessors for any query the object should support. SQL people like theirs because it allows arbitrary queries of sets and relationships. OO guys like theirs because it gives them type safety, and the ability to transparently query their objects. Below is what I hope to be the middle ground: the type safety and defined interfaces of query methods, with the arbitrary selection and joins of relational.
      </p>
      <p>
        The background code to support this is not shown below... I'm of the opinion that it shouldn't matter to the app anymore than the implementation of any other database. Not that it's trivial, or impossible, simply that it's an implementation that is subject to change. (I have written a working spike which would support the below, and joins between arbitrary lists, all possible thanks to proxies + runtime reflection)

        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The reason why I'm not liking strings seems to be the only area not addressed by SodaQuery: Referring to the contents of an object by a hardcoded string. Looking through their examples, I see references such as query.select("salary"), referring to an instance member 'salary' in an employee. If you change the name of that member, the compiler will miss the implicit reference of (String) "salary", causing a run-time error as opposed to a compile-time error.</dd>

           It isn't just runtime errors I don't like. I use <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. They find these errors, but I get to go in and fix them all by hand, where as actual method calls can be updated automatically.

        <em>Why are method calls easier to modify than strings? What do you mean by "updated automatically"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An editor, processer, compiler, anything which knows java syntax will understand that a method call is indeed a method call. A String gives them no such advantage. I rather enjoy letting an algorithm do my repetitive work for me. Strings complicate this unnecessarily. They have their uses, but I like to avoid them when possible.

        <em>How does that make method calls easier to modify than strings? IDEs and compilers can check the syntax of statically typed languages, so they will complain about typos on method names, but they won't automatically update your code.

      </p>

        Ides can changes all references to a method name when I change the first. They can't do that with a string representing the same method.

        Now, I point my editor at 'public String toString()' and change it to 'public String returnLocalizedMessage()'. Does the compiler have much chance of getting this right?

Now I just test anything that can break and I don't need all that language enforcement. If you test anything that can break, accidental changes to strings will be detected by them. Life is easier that way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think I'm still not quite coming across... it's not that I don't test these things, I use Strings all the time for some things. I don't like how I can't talk about java's first class elements without using a String though, because then I can't be lazy about changing a name - you can no longer write a generalize algorithm to do a generic boring task.

      <p>
        This is bad. Really bad. "toString()" doesn't have any semantic meaning to the compiler. I want to write this instead:
      </p>
      <code>
        { <br/>
        AnObject anObject = ...;<br/>
        AList aResult = ((Proxy) ((AnObject) DataBase.query(anObject)).toString()).$getList();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A little bit longer, true, but now the compiler/runtime knows what I'm doing. We can refactor using language aware tools without fear that they don't understand the quoting of methods. And it isn't all bad... consider parameters:
      </p>
      <code>
        {<br/>
        AnObject aParameter = ...;<br/>
        AnObject anotherParameter = ...;<br/>
        AnObject anObject = ...;<br/>
        AList aResult = DataBase.query(anObject, "toString()", new Object[]{aParameter, anotherParameter});<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Consider the possibilities: runtime class cast exceptions cannot be ruled out by the compiler!
      </p>
      <code>
        { <br/>
        AnObject aParameter = ...;<br/>
        AnObject anotherParameter = ...;<br/>
        AnObject anObject = ...;<br/>
        AList aResult = ((Proxy) ((AnObject) DataBase.query(anObject)).toString(aParameter, anotherParameter)).$getList();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Still a bit longer, but we get compile time checking for most parameters now.
      </p>
      <p>
        We start gaining ground once we have more complex queries though... because all calls to a Proxy will return an appropriately typed Proxy... we only have to convert back to a list when we want the results. And we can cache the Proxies and reuse them... the setup is a one time thing for the most part.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: I have nothing against language which allow you to directly talk about their parts. I wish java <em>did</em> understand during compile/runtime that "toString()" will be referencing that particular method. But it doesn't.

        I find having an operation such as 'rename' with the only aim being avoiding collisions somewhat sketchy.

The only case in relational theory where it's actually necessary is when we're referring to a product of a table against itself. The only difference between the two tables in this case is the route in which they got there, hence a rename operation to describe that route, hence a navigational aspect which <em>necessary</em> for the relational model to work. -- <a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a> (relational object algebra orientated weenie)

        Isn't using a string in this way somewhat analogous to working in a dynamically-typed language?
      </p>
      <p>
        To use a brutally simple example of a getter in Java:
      </p>
      <code>
        public MyType getMyType( String theNameOfTheThingToGet );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Let's say for there are (currently) four possible String's values to pass in: "Foo", "Bar", "Fubar", and "Snafu"
        This give us four "effective method names":
      </p>
      <code>
        public MyType getMyType-Foo();<br/>
        public MyType getMyType-Bar();<br/>
        public MyType getMyType-Fubar();<br/>
        public MyType getMyType-Snafu();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That could be implemented as four separate "real" methods:
      </p>
      <code>
        public MyType getFoo();<br/>
        public MyType getBar();<br/>
        public MyType getFubar();<br/>
        public MyType getSnafu();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If fact, the latter would even allow different return types for each method.
        At this time, the code-struture in Java and something dynamically-typed like Smalltalk or Python would look pretty much the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if we now need to add a new "name-of-something" - say, "Ugh"?
        In a statically-typed language, we need to expand the interface and add a new method:
      </p>
      <code>
        public MyType getUgh();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then we need to go and implement it in all implementor classes. But how do we handle the case where one of those classes doesn't give a hoot about "Ugh"? Not pretty (ex. use a base class that implements every method in the interface in some "default" way, and derive every concrete class from that).
      </p>
      <p>
        In a dynamically-typed environment we just implement an additional method on the concrete class(es) that care, and don't worry about it in any place where doesn't (and, of course, unit-test all our modified classes to make sure they respond correctly to the new method).
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, in our original interface (remember, the one with a String parameter?), we could do exactly the same thing in Java as our dynamic friends; have the classes (or even the instances! ust like adding a method to an instance in Python) that care respond to the new "effective method name": getMyType-Ugh()
      </p>
      <p>
        Granted, there are perhaps better types to use for the "theNameOfTheThingToGet" (for example, a TypeSafeEnum instead of a String), but I think the basic analogy is fair - or not?

        There is a simple trick that can sometimes be used to address some of the problems of using strings in lieu of identifiers known to the language. It will probably work in many languages; I've used it in C++, exactly for the sort of problems mentioned on this page.
      </p>
      <p>
        In your database API (you do have a <a href="DatabaseAbstractionLayer.html">DatabaseAbstractionLayer</a>, don't you?) you simply avoid using unadorned strings as arguments to identify things like attribute (field) names or relation (table) names. Instead, you use small classes to wrap around the strings. Thus, query.select("salary") becomes for instance query.select(attr("salary")), where "attr" is such a wrapper class. Now any competent editor can search for a regular expression "\battr\s*\(\s*"salary"\s*\)" (expressed as a Perl-style regexp here), and even replace the name for you. The mechanism can easily be subverted, of course, by using temporary string variables and such, but if programmers can be trained to "keep it simple" and pass only literal string constants to attr(), this can be fairly effective. -- DM
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't buy it. I think cwillu has some very good points, and that the way to go is to use e.g. query.select.salary (or some similar but more workable syntax), avoiding strings altogether. Anything that uses strings will not get checked by the compiler, yet compiler checks are very useful. Clever tests, editors, refactoring tools, self-discipline, etc etc etc are all good things, but are orthogonal to compiler checks. -- dm
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that some of us prefer dynamic (interpreted) languages, so compile-time checking is not something we go out of our way for.

        <em>That's a nitpick; the rest of the page is phrased in terms of a Java or C++ kind of language.

This is true regardless of the language, without getting us bogged down in an unnecessary tangential discussion of just how early that is in various different languages.</em>

        Amen. Having written this kind of database crap in C++, I'll tell you what I did to avoid strings.

        Don't <strong>ever</strong> pass a string literal to identify a table, column, or record. Use a symbol instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        schema.h:
      </p>
      <code>
        const char *kSalary = "salary";<br/>
        // etc.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Later:
      </p>
      <code>
        int salary = record.getMonetaryField(kSalary);<br/>
      </code>

        Also, database abstractions like <a href="HiberNate.html">HiberNate</a> have alternate ways to specify queries. <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> for instance. Also by composing query criteria objects. Seems a lot less error prone than concatenating a gnarly SQL query string.

        <em>I haven't had many problems with frameworks that don't completely hide the SQL. I find it gives me the best of both worlds: automating the repetitous parts of SQL, but still allowing one to use a somewhat natural form of </em><a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> instead of the verbose, hard-to-read "new-dot-new" pattern described in <a href="ExpressionApiComplaints.html">ExpressionApiComplaints</a>. Plus, the frameworks/utils don't have to completely cover everything SQL syntax does (if even possible) because they are not trying to be a total wrapper, but merely helpers. This probably reduces their size by a small fraction of a pure wrapper. Plus, I often test direct SQL anyhow. If I had to use new-dot-new, I'd have to rewrite it. And, tools like HyberNate have their own learning curves and gotcha's.<em></em>

        One problem with strings is that they turn applications into silos which are hard to integrate. One advantage with strings is that they are more human-natural for those with low <a href="InductiveReasoningAptitude.html">InductiveReasoningAptitude</a> (me) -- <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
