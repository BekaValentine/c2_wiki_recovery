        Karel The Robot
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="KarelTheRobot.html">KarelTheRobot</a> was a tool I encountered during my freshman year of college (1986). It was a little programming environment where you controlled a robot's motion through a maze of walls and beepers. The robot was nothing more than a ">" symbol that could be oriented north, east, south, or west. The language to control Karel was a very scaled-down procedural programming language, which had the unique feature of having no variables. The only way you could really keep track of stuff was by putting beepers into Karel's beeper bag.

        The program was wildly popular among my classmates, in part due to our teacher's talent in emulating the robot on-stage. (Teacher's name was <a href="OwenAstrachan.html">OwenAstrachan</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Karel could do pretty sophisticated stuff, like navigate mazes and detect palindromic beeper layouts. You built up his ability to roam his little beeper world by writing little procedures that he'd faithfully memorize and execute.

        Karel rules! I learned to program using Karel too. It was great way to learn how to program. Fun. Lots of feedback. Just enough complexity.

        A little bit of etymology: Karel is the first name of Karel Capek, the author of <em>R.U.R.: (Rossum's Universal Robots)</em> [[ISBN 0887347991]], which invented the term "robot". In <em>R.U.R.</em>, there are android slaves called "robots", which comes from the Czech word <em>robota</em> = compulsory labor.

        I've just finished using <a href="KarelTheRobot.html">KarelTheRobot</a> in my Computing class at school and I have to say it has really helped me with laterally thinking about programming. I'm now using <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> but the foundations I have developed from <a href="KarelTheRobot.html">KarelTheRobot</a> have been essential in my studies.

        I have no exposure to  <a href="KarelTheRobot.html">KarelTheRobot</a> or <a href="RoboCode.html">RoboCode</a>, is there any comparison that can be made with <a href="LogoLanguage.html">LogoLanguage</a>?
