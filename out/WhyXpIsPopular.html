        Why Xp Is Popular
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the popularity stakes, <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> causes a range of reactions. One extreme is being explored in <a href="WhenXpIsUnpopular.html">WhenXpIsUnpopular</a>, this page is exploring the opposite end of the spectrum, as suggested by the <a href="GoldilocksSolution.html">GoldilocksSolution</a>.  -- <a href="PeteMcBreen.html">PeteMcBreen</a>

           Many of XP's principles match well how many good programmers write and think about programs. The rest offer the promise of improved performance in a way consistent with what they already do and think. -- <a href="EugeneWallingford.html">EugeneWallingford</a>

           XP feels somewhat like Alcoholics Anonymous. You <strong>know</strong> you've had a problem with software development for years (such as never shipping on time, or a succession of less than satisfactory jobs) but it's truly hard to come out and admit you do, indeed, have a problem. XP tells you not only that it's OK, it wasn't entirely your fault, but that you can probably find a way out.

           <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is a great way to learn how to program. Learning how to program in an environment where we have rapidly tangible results is not only more fun, but allows us to learn faster. -- <a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a>

           The EconomicArgumentsOfExtremeProgramming are compelling. If changes MUST occur then you need some methodology that anticipates change and makes change as cheap as possible. Extreme Programming amortizes virtually nothing over the life of a project. You pay almost no penalty for early mistakes. -- <a href="JoeBergin.html">JoeBergin</a>

           Customers like XP -- because it gives them the things they want, such as control over costs and scope, ways to track progress, a system running at all times, and high flexibility thanks to high quality -- <a href="ArieVanDeursen.html">ArieVanDeursen</a>

           The alternatives are dishonest - Who can predict the future? Who actually makes accurate estimates six months out? Who knows what the business will need six months from know? Who can actually articulate all of the requirements for a hunk of software before a line of code is written? -- <a href="KurtChristensen.html">KurtChristensen</a>
