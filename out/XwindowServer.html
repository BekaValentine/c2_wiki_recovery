        Xwindow Server
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a> is the program which mediates <a href="XwindowProtocol.html">XwindowProtocol</a> requests from X client applications and translates them into graphics on the local display hardware.  This separation of <a href="PolicyAndMechanism.html">PolicyAndMechanism</a> allows for wide hardware support and X's unique ability to run the server and clients on separate machines connected over a network.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a>s exist for all platforms, from high-end Unix workstations down to <a href="HandHeld.html">HandHeld</a>s like the iPaq, and are the standard means for providing a graphical user interface for Unix systems.  The standard reference implementation used to be XFree86, but this group disbanded after a licensing dispute.  The latest reference implementation comes from X.Org (<a href="http://www.x.org/).">http://www.x.org/).</a>  New development is supported by <a href="http://freedesktop.org/.">http://freedesktop.org/.</a>  <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> ships with an Apple designed X server.

        <em>Isn't the server doing what the client usually does?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A server receives requests from clients and performs some action(s) in response to those requests.  An <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a> receives drawing requests from clients and performs some drawing action(s) in response to those requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>To make it painfully clear...</em></strong>
        The <strong></strong><a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a><strong> controls one or more displays each having one or more screens that display information in response to requests from the</strong>
        <strong>X Client,</strong> the computer running the program.  When you specify something like "export DISPLAY=foo:0.0", you are specifying "hostname:displaynumber.screennumber". This kind of flexibility is often misunderstood by people who's only exposure has been to PC's and other small single user machines.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This confuses people because you normally think that the big computer in the back room is the server and the little box on your desk is the client.  X-Windows is still client-server, in the traditional sense; it's just that the boxes have the opposite roles than what you may be accustomed to.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's only confusing to people who don't understand what client/server actually means.
