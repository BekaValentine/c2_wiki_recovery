      <p>
        I currently work for IBM Global Services in the UK.  Since joining I have worked on the Smalltalk project described further under <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> and a conventional large Smalltalk/CICs/Cobol utilities project. I also do C++ when needs must. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Previous Smalltalk experiences were in the telecommunications industries (transmission not billing!). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Current professional interests are Squeak[1], Self[2] and organisational / team dynamics - how can people who think very differently work together?
      </p>
      <p>
        Personal interests include the philosophy of mind (Owen Barfield, Rudolph Steiner etc), fine art (pictures!) and getting stock options in some whizzy high-tech start-up!
