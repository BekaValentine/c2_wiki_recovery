        <strong>Patient:</strong> I am really ANGRY! Someone (and I think I know who) deleted some really important stuff from a page that I originated!!!!!!!!!!

        They should not do that. They don't have the right.

        <em>I thought everyone has the right to delete whatever they see fit to delete.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But it was insensitive. It was malicious. It was intended to hurt me.

      <p>
        <em>And it did hurt you, didn't it?</em>

        (sobbing quietly) yes...

      <p>
        <em>Did you tell anyone?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You bet! I ranted and raved. I gave those no-good, insensitive, dirty, rotten, filthy, foul, corrupt, indecent, inhuman, bilge water, finks a piece of my mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Did it help?</em>

      <p>
        (very quietly) They deleted it.

        No.

        But <a href="DrWiki.html">DrWiki</a>, They're probably deleting this as we speak!

        <strong>John:</strong> Yes doctor, that's fine, but I'd prefer it if you called me by name.  I spend a lot of time deleting posts on Wiki.  I don't seem to be able to help myself.  Do you think you can help me?

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>John:</strong> Why, to keep it tidy, of course.  I only delete posts that don't agree with my viewpoint, but that's been taking a lot of my time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="DrWiki.html">DrWiki</a>:<strong> Do you think it's wrong to delete posts you don't agree with?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>John:</strong> No, of course not.  Why, it would be wrong to leave them there.  The wiki must be kept clean so people who happen by don't see anything I don't agree with.

        <strong></strong><a href="DrWiki.html">DrWiki</a><strong> What do other members of the wiki think of all this activity of yours?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>John:</strong> They don't know I'm doing it.  I must remain humble in my quest to protect them from ideas that don't agree with mine.  I remain anonymous if I can, and go to great lengths to protect myself from exposure to the unclean o...   .. um, I mean, the ones I don't agree with.

        <strong></strong><a href="DrWiki.html">DrWiki</a>:<strong> So... You've spent a lot of time helping others not to see posts that don't agree with your views.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>John:</strong> Yes, a <em>lot</em> of time. Sometimes it's a very thankless job. I'm not sure doctor, but it may have become an obsession.  I don't sleep, I don't eat.  I fret about it all the time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="DrWiki.html">DrWiki</a>:<strong> Why would simply deleting the opinions you don't agree with take so much of your time?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>John:</strong> It can't just be deleted you know?  It has to be as if the unclean... um, I mean, the offending point of view... never actually existed.  For that you have to clear the offending viewpoint from the page and then go in and edit the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> pages so that the name of the page doesn't show up there.  You have to be vigilant, watching minute by minute for the <em>bad</em> names to show on the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page so you can delete them.  You also have to delete ref...

        <strong>John:</strong> Do you think it's because I'm from a small backwards country with a huge inferiority complex?

      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>John:</strong> Do you think it's because wiki permits me to exercise power anonymously that I could never express with my mother?

        <strong></strong><a href="DrWiki.html">DrWiki</a>:<strong> So you signed a post.  Tell me, was this post... relevant?</strong>

        <strong>Mary:</strong> Yes, I felt it was really important that it be said, or I wouldn't have posted it three times.  I feel so weak.
