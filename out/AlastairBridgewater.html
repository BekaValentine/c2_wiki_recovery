        Found computers in 1986 (or thereabouts), never looked back. Is the sort of person who, when he comes up with a name or description that he likes, will save it until he finds or makes something he can use it on.

        If you want to "play around" with the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, you could try <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>.

        <em>True, but I'd much rather "play around" with the </em><a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>. And since Squeak already has a working one, that's nowhere near as much fun.<em></em>

        Hello Alastair, I only just realized you were you, if you see what I mean: It seems out paths have crossed before! Though I only noticed it when having a look at your own wiki after looking at your <a href="NetBsd.html">NetBsd</a> booters and putting two and two together...
