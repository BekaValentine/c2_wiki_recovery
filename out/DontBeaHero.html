        Resist the temptation to ride in on a white charger and slay the
        dragons.  If you find yourself beset by dragons, change habitat --
        either yours or theirs.

        Working in crisis-driven mode can be lots of fun.
        You get to be a hero, you get the adrenaline rush of skirting the
        edge of disaster, you <em>know</em> you're indispensable.
        However, it's probably not the best thing for the business.
        In the aftermath of a crisis, you should probably ask process 
        and strategy questions
        to figure out where you made the mistake that eventually led to the crisis.

        If you ask the questions and find that the problems are insoluble, and that
        there nothing you can do that has a reasonable chance of reducing the
        probability of crisis (<em>changing the dragon's habitat</em>), consider moving on
        (<em>changing your own habitat</em>).

        Slay the dragons.  Clear the fields.
        Invite the farmers to return, and then leave -- to find and slay other dragons.
