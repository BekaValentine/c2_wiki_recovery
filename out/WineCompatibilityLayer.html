        Wine Compatibility Layer
      </h1>
      <p>
        WINE is not an emulator. It is an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> compatibility layer that aims to host <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> applications without the MS supplied operating system, on a IX host OS such as <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a> that executes on the Intel x86 platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        WINE is not a mechanism to get windows device drivers to work on x86 based <a href="UnixOs.html">UnixOs</a>, doing so would have required previledged access to the processor not made available under WINE.
