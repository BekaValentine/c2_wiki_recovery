           Douglas C. Engelbart in December 1985 (for his lecture on "The Augmented Knowledge Workshop" at the ACM Conference "The History of Personal Workstations") when he is describing the Genesis of his "Framework" quotes himself from 1957.

        Umm, why is this failed fantasy program relevant and <a href="GreatLeapForward.html">GreatLeapForward</a> not? CautionaryTale value of the latter exceeds the values of this program that failed.

          <em>It's not failed. Right now you're using several aspects of it that succeeded quite a while ago, that are </em>'directly<em>' attributable to Engelbart's program. Other aspects of it are still pending due to being beyond what is achievable with the state of the art, which is not the same as "failed". Failed would mean it didn't pan out, not that we're still trying.</em>

        Should a Matrix-Like implant become available, one would hope the general public would have the option to opt in. Forced Borg implants a no-no, it should be obvious.

        <em>One would hope, in fact, that compliance would be universal and enforced.  Notions of democracy, freedom, and human rights are adequate starting points for individual and cultural growth, but it must be remembered that we are </em>'not<strong> individuals, we are a Species.  "Individual" and "culture" are archaic notions.  Just as a swarm of bees is defined by the Hive, rather than individual bees, true growth of Humanity must deprecate individual rights in favour of betterment of the whole. Fear of Borg assimilation is a naive trait, one that will limit human achievement.  Instead, we should embrace it, with ourselves as the Collective.  </strong>
