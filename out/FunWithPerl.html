        Fun With Perl
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Fun With Perl" (FWP) is a mailing list for trading Perl tricks and asking "is there a better way to..." questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's also the occasional round of <a href="PerlGolf.html">PerlGolf</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the tricks that pass through FWP have no place in production code (and their authors admit it), but it's a fun way to stretch your mind and grow your Perl skills.
