        A "weenie", in Wiki, is (or seems to be at least) a tireless advocate of a particular technology, in particular one which is not in the mainstream.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think the proper term is </em>'zealot<strong>.  Weenie means wimpy person.  Maybe "weenie" captures some seldom used geek slang, but that would just make use </strong>WeenieWeenies by pressing the terminology on everyone else, wouldn't it.<em></em>
      </p>

        <li>
           m-w.com: "3 : NERD <computer weenies>" Their definition is clearly incomplete, but their example helps.
        </li>
      </ul>

        [Weenie is funny - let it be. Doesn't anyone sense humor any more?]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Humor tends to feel better directed at <em>other</em> people rather than ourselves, for some reason.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (<a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s seem to be an exception; though OO seems to be all the rage today and that seems to have started a <a href="ParadigmPissingMatch.html">ParadigmPissingMatch</a>).  The weenie engages in spirited and passionate debate over the merits of their preferred technology (and it's more-dominant competition), which occasionally (and unfortunately) includes over-the-top statements which dismiss the dominant technology as meritless garbage (and practitioners of said dominant technology as luddites or morons).
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is unfortunate, as frequently (if not usually) the weenie has a point.  (Especially the subcategory of SmugWeenie, who had to watch in horror as a technology which was markedly better than the competition at many things nonetheless got squashed in the marketplace.  <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to spot a weenie: a problem which is not easy to model in their language/methodology is considered not worth solving.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is it that only cool things have Weenies? Please show me that I'm wrong. Where are the VbClassicWeenies  and the CobolWeenies? (<a href="AurelianoCalvo.html">AurelianoCalvo</a>)

           It's better to directly manipulate the value stack than to use variables (even local variables).

           All problems can be factored into just the right set of "words" (functions) that then almost trivially solve the problem.

        <li>
           Any problem can be solved in Forth 10x faster using 10x less code than <insert other language>.  (cf. <a href="http://www.ultratechnology.com/)">http://www.ultratechnology.com/)</a>

           Categorizing all information into little boxes is really neat.  It lets me ignore the complexity of the real world and stick to my own stereotypes. <em>(That's a weenie of categories, not a category of weenies.)</em>

        Note that "all things are" or "all things can be" is generally an exaggeration for simplication purposes. Most proponents will "learn towards" rather than actively propose that "all" be done a given way.
