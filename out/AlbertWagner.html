        I'm just an old burned out Smalltalk programmer that got downsized one too many times.  I am now what they call a "non-traditional" student: age 56 working on my first bachelors degree. (English...NOT computer science).  Just curious what you guys are all up too.  I thought smalltalk had died. Glad to see it didn't.  (Feb 1999)
