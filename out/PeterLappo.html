        I'm an independent IT consultant specializing in Java, C++, SQL and of course XP with 18 years of experience. I can provide training courses in XP and other server side Java technology and follow the training through with mentoring.

      <p>
        I'm actively encouraging the use of XP within Sussex with the formation of the <a href="SussexXpUsersGroup.html">SussexXpUsersGroup</a>.

        I live in Brighton, UK with my wife, two daughters and two very noisy Burmese cats.

        Lovely cats, doubtless. In my opinion, cats can understand and even speak English. The only word easily distinguishable is "No", since that's an easy variant of "Miaow". Maybe you've identified others.

        Our cats do "speak". They make different noises to say hello, I've just caught a mouse, where is my food, and why haven't they picked me up yet.
