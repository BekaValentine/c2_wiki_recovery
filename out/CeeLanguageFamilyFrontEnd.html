        Clang ( <a href="http://clang.llvm.org/">http://clang.llvm.org/</a> ) is a front end for a compiler of <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. It is a part of the LLVM (<a href="LowLevelVirtualMachine.html">LowLevelVirtualMachine</a>) project.

        This <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> article gives an introduction to the Clang and why it exists: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clang</a>

        As well as providing an alternative tool chain to the <a href="GnuCompilerCollection.html">GnuCompilerCollection</a> it also provides <a href="StaticCodeAnalysis.html">StaticCodeAnalysis</a> tools.

        There is an experimental version of Clang called <a href="ConceptClang.html">ConceptClang</a> which is working on implementing <a href="CppAndConcepts.html">CppAndConcepts</a> replacing <a href="ConceptGcc.html">ConceptGcc</a>.

        See <a href="TooFewTemplateParameterLists.html">TooFewTemplateParameterLists</a> for an example of the improved error messages compared to <a href="GnuCpp.html">GnuCpp</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The error messages have really helped me on several occasions. I have been able to sort out a couple of bugs which had been in some code for a long time. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        I have just found a really useful article on <a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a> in <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a> and how Clang deals with the issues. See <a href="WhatEveryCeeProgrammerShouldKnow.html">WhatEveryCeeProgrammerShouldKnow</a> -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        The underlying activity in Clang is to turn the input source code into an <a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a> (AST) representation. There is a tutorial on this at <a href="http://amnoid.de/tmp/clangtut/tut.html">http://amnoid.de/tmp/clangtut/tut.html</a> (somewhat dated and referring to an earlier stage of the Clang work). -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        I thought that having a good compiler such as Clang was going to be a great benefit. So it is most of the time. I have been using it on some old code and found some old errors which is very good. Now as I am working through some more of the errors I have found something which had been below my radar and is a consequence of the new standard for <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> (see <a href="CeePlusPlusEleven.html">CeePlusPlusEleven</a>) and it breaks some of my code in a way I cannot see an easy way to fix. I suppose I should be grateful to Clang and the authors. My code is broken. See <a href="ImplicitlyDeletedCopyConstructor.html">ImplicitlyDeletedCopyConstructor</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The above was how it felt to me a couple of days ago. What I have found out since is very interesting and worthwhile to put here to guide others.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The main reason I had a problem was because my version of the library (libstdc++) which comes with gcc (4.4) was out of date. I am stuck with this unless I upgrade my whole version of Linux (Ubuntu 10.4) or install an extra compiler.
        </li>
        <li>
           The alternative is to install the Clang version of the standard library (libc++). This is not straightforward as the instructions given are for the Mac and not for Linux, although they can be found on the message list. I managed to make this work.
        </li>
        <li>
           Installing the library libc++ got rid of the original error messages but gave me some different ones.
        </li>
        <li>
           The new error messages turn out to be an interaction with something in the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a>, but updating to the latest version of those (1.49.0) has made those disappear too.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One lesson seems to be that it is important to keep everything uptodate, including myself. I have decided to learn more about the features in <a href="CeePlusPlusEleven.html">CeePlusPlusEleven</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another lesson is only to report bugs when I am sure what they are and where they are.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The eventual solution to these problems has been to update my </em><a href="UbuntuLinux.html">UbuntuLinux</a> from 10.04 to 12.04, another long term support version. This gives me gcc 4.6 which has libraries which will also work with Clang 3.2 even with C++11. This is helpful as I have a number of libraries which I have never managed to get working with Clang.<em></em>
