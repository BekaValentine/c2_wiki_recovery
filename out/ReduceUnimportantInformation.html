        While an obvious result of <a href="EmphasizeImportantInformation.html">EmphasizeImportantInformation</a> is to move unimportant information off to the side, if information is truly irrelevant, delete it. This also follows from <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.

        I am frequently interrupted by testers asking me to <strong>just quickly check</strong> something to see if it is a bug or not. Obviously I want them to find bugs, but 95% of the time the things they ask me to check, even if they did uncover a bug, are very unimportant. It seems that since the severity rating only gets recorded when the bug is found, all bugs are equal until they are recorded. <a href="AllBugsAreNotEqual.html">AllBugsAreNotEqual</a>!
