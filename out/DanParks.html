        <a href="DanParks.html">DanParks</a> lists himself as <em>Daniel J. Parks</em> on his resume. He was a graduate student at Miami University (<a href="http://www.muohio.edu)">http://www.muohio.edu)</a> in the Department of Systems Analysis (<a href="http://www.eas.muohio.edu).">http://www.eas.muohio.edu).</a> In a former life he studied music (classical string bass performance, orchestral stuff), but went back to school to study computer science. After that he began working as a programmer/analyst for a medium-large auto insurance company, then moved on to a smaller auto insurance company owned by a larger auto/home/life insurance company.
