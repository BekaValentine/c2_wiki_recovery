        Reluctant Geek
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="ReluctantGeek.html">ReluctantGeek</a> is someone who deep down knows they are a geek but have a hard time acknowledging it.  They may or may not have had a proper <a href="ComingOut.html">ComingOut</a> and prefer not to attract too much attention to their geekiness.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The reverse version is also possible. Deep down one might know one is not a geek, but have sufficient knowledge and capability with technology that others often assume they are.</em>
