        Taste The Soup
      </h1>
      <p>
        An old man calls the waiter over to his table.
      </p>
      <p>
        "What would you like, sir?" asks the waiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Taste the soup," he says.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is the soup too cold?" asks the waiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Taste the soup," says the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is it too salty?" asks the waiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Taste the soup!" says the old man.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is there a fly in it?" asks the waiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Taste the soup!"</em> the old man insists.
      </p>
      <p>
        The waiter looks down: "There's no spoon!"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Aha!" exclaims the old man.
      </p>

        <em>It is a joke, but there's a good point about engineering in it, too. See: </em><a href="DogFood.html">DogFood</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why didn't the old man just say "Please bring me a spoon?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He was trying to demonstrate how something you made can look complete until you try it yourself.</em> See: <a href="ZenSlap.html">ZenSlap</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or because he knew the waiter would have asked, "Is your spoon dirty?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or because he was a complete asswipe. You can't make excuses for some behavior.</em>

        For fun, now imagine the above scenario, but have the waiter exclaim <a href="ThereIsNoSpoon.html">ThereIsNoSpoon</a>. Now what would <em>that</em> mean?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>See, I think I'm eating this nice, tasty soup -- even though I know it's not real! I don't want to remember any of this.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Too literal and derivative. Try - "You don't need to use a spoon to eat soup. It is only your belief in a specific reality that requires such a construct".
      </p>
      <p>
        or maybe - "we have no spoons, as <a href="UriGeller.html">UriGeller</a> was in early and they are all bent"
