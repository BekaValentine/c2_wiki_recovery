        <strong>Brief description :</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unnecessary and redundant navigation paths in the course of development, highly transient associations of a particular class with another one, presence of stateless classes, occurrence of temporary and short duration objects/classes or classes that exist only to invoke other classes through temporary associations are the true symptoms of the presence of 'Poltergeist Antipattern'.

        <strong>How to avoid them :</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        "...the project managers should implement strict procedures to get the <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> architectures reviewed by expert architects in this field and also avoid deploying developers who do not have sufficient knowledge and experience in object-oriented design in a software development project."
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           '... also avoid deploying developers [who can't cut it]' seems a bit unnecessary to list.  Obviously, if they aren't sufficiently skilled, then they won't produce good code.  From a different angle, I suppose listing that is similar to including a caution in a VCR manual that if the VCR isn't plugged it, then it won't turn on.  Some people really don't think of the obvious.

      </ul>
      <p>
        They may also be avoided by converting that little bit to procedural code. --<a href="BottomMind.html">BottomMind</a>
