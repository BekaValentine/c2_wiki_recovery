        Anything Is Not Possible

      <p>
        In contrast to <a href="AnythingIsPossible.html">AnythingIsPossible</a>, not everything is possible. It's not possible for a human to run 100 meters in 0.0001 second.

        Sorry sir. Pigs cannot fly. That's a fact.

        A <a href="DevilsAdvocate.html">DevilsAdvocate</a> would argue that you could make a pig fly by genetically modifying it (adding massive wings and making the bones hollow for weight savings). This is likely true; however you would develop a new animal that is no longer a pig, it would be a bird like animal with some pig qualities.

        Of course pigs can fly, they can get through airport security pretty easily, too.  Now if you meant flying under their own power...

        <em>This is another example of </em>TwistingWords... they can fly on airplanes first class and order peanuts and other snacks... but they can't fly themselves like a bird can..<em></em>
