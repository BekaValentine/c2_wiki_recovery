        Officially known as Log4J, but that's not a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>.  One of the Apache Organization open-source projects.  Information at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html">http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j/docs/index.html</a>

        From the site:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>With log4j it is possible to enable logging at runtime without modifying the application binary. The log4j package is designed so that these statements can remain in shipped code without incurring a heavy performance cost. Logging behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file, without touching the application binary.</dd>

        There's also a new book about it, but Amazon doesn't seem to have it at ISBN:2970036908

        The need to incorporate logging code in a webserver in the twenty-first century is, in my opinion, eloquent testimony to how bad our development tools are and to how empty our industry's claims of objectivity are. Tomcat ran inside <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> nearly five years ago (in 1999), with full breakpoint and incremental source development capability. Our industry ignored it, adopting hacks like Log4j instead. I call it <a href="JobSecurityForProgrammers.html">JobSecurityForProgrammers</a>.

        I agree, Tom, that at development time there are more powerful debugging alternatives than trace logging - even in Java! (with <a href="IntellijIdea.html">IntellijIdea</a> we're finally back to a level of capability close to what we had in <a href="SmalltalkImplementations.html">SmalltalkImplementations</a> two decades ago).  But I'm using <a href="LogForJava.html">LogForJava</a> at production operations time, to write performance statistics, audit logs, and the like.  I'm finding it helpful for that purpose.

        Production time logging via <a href="LogForJava.html">LogForJava</a> is more output that could be checked with <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. I can think of three ways to intercept and check the <a href="LogForJava.html">LogForJava</a> output:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Substitute a mock logger that expects specified messages to be logged. This wouldn't test the logger setup code.
        </li>
        <li>
           Develop and configure a new appender for unit testing. The appender needs to know what messages to expect and must be able to force unit tests to fail.
        </li>
        <li>
           Configure <a href="LogForJava.html">LogForJava</a> to write to a file and examine that file.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Now that Java 1.4 has its own Logging capability, is there any advantages/disadvantages using Log4J over Java's own logging?

        <em>It works with java 1.3 - we aren't upgrading yet.</em>
