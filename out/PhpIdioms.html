        <strong>Error Handling</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>or die()</strong> on failure
      </p>
      <p>
        Many resource-based functions in <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>, (such as fopen, or mysql_connect, where you will see this idiom the most) will return a boolean, or a resource, which means that the following code is perfectly valid:
      </p>
      <code>
        mysql_connect('myserv','myuser','mypass') or die("It's barsted!");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The above is evaluated to an expression, and the way the Zend engine works, if the first part of the expression is true (mysql_connect, or fopen, or whatever), then the entire expression must be true, so it doesn't evaluate the second half.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<strong>or die()</strong> on failure is a Perl idiom which found its way into PHP.]
      </p>
      <p>
        This is more of an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> than anything else.  Any script that is more then just the barest minimum has some cleaning up to do, if nothing else to close any open <a href="HyperTextMarkupLanguage.html">HyperTextMarkupLanguage</a> tags. <em>Just output a '>' in your die() then. </em><a href="NetscapeNavigator.html">NetscapeNavigator</a> used to do the same thing in its '> Connection interrupted' messages<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        At the very least, you could wrap the function in an if-else block...
      </p>
      <code>
        if (!mysql_connect('myserv','myuser','mypass'))<br/>
        {<br/>
        handleDatabaseError();  // User defined function to handle the database <br/>
        }				// error by emailing it, or printing it<br/>
        else<br/>
        {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        While this solution is better, and allows for proper cleanup, you will probably run into the <a href="ArrowAntiPattern.html">ArrowAntiPattern</a> quickly.
      </p>
      <p>
        A better solution would then be to write an abstraction library, either procedural or OO (whichever you are comfortable with), and use that instead.
      </p>
      <code>
        if ($result = getDbInfo())<br/>
        {<br/>
        ... display the db info here, using templating of course! ;)<br/>
        }<br/>
        else<br/>
        {<br/>
        ... print an I'm sorry message here ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        function getDbInfo()<br/>
        {<br/>
        mysql_connect('serv','user','pass') or return false; // or wrap in an if block<br/>
        mysql_select_db('mydb') or return false;<br/>
        $r = mysql_query("Select Lots,Of,Stuff from myTable where complexQuery='foo'");<br/>
        if (!$r)<br/>
        {<br/>
        return false;<br/>
        }<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This example of course is a little contrived.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the advent of PHP5, this will become less of an issue, because you can throw and catch exceptions. This, of course will probably mean that there will be PHP versions of most of the Exception Based <a href="JavaIdioms.html">JavaIdioms</a>.

        <em>I generally make my own database functions similar to: </em>
      </p>
      <code>
        $connection = dbConnect($connectInfoEtc, handleFail=True, failMessage="Error doing foo");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>This (optionally) tells it to handle the failure on its own and display the given message (or default message if not given). Actually, handleFail=True may be the default if that's what works best for the app. If handleFail=False, then the error is tossed back to the caller (depending on the language). </em>'The problem is that Php doesn't have direct named parameters<em>'. In most cases, there is no need to clutter up database work with error handling. I like to keep the main logic only doing mostly domain stuff, not nitty gritty mechanics of error handling.</em>

        <strong>Constant Value as First operand in Conditional</strong> (this could stand a rename.) <em>aka </em><a href="CompareConstantsFromTheLeft.html">CompareConstantsFromTheLeft</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The assignment operator (=) is easily confused with the equality (==) conditional.  Thus, one can find code like:
      </p>
      <code>
        if ($myFoo = 23)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        instead of:
      </p>
      <code>
        if ($myFoo == 23)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Therefore, switch the order of your operands in the conditional expression, so your constant value (23) comes first.  That way when the interpreter hits (23 = $myFoo), it will complain that it cannot assign to a constant value.  This works equally as well with functions.  if (myDecomposedConditional($args) == $myFoo)

        <strong>Test for null as default value in function</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Default values in function parameters can't be the result of a function in PHP. You can't do:
      </p>
      <code>
        function my_func($param=other_func()) {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        What you can do is:
      </p>
      <code>
        function my_func($param=NULL) {<br/>
        if (NULL == $param) {<br/>
        $param = other_func();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
