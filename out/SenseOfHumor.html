        Sense Of Humor

        The thing that makes me think that your lot in life is funny.

        A corollary to this is DontTakeYourselfTooSeriously. The Canadians seem to do a better job of this than a lot of U.S. Americans. Lots more TongueInCheek.

        To bring it back to <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>, teams are made of people, and for people to form bonds and get along, a healthy <a href="SenseOfHumor.html">SenseOfHumor</a> is definitely required.

        Which is true for a wiki of course, especially one dealing with controversial subject matter. That's why we said <a href="AlmostNeverDeleteHumor.html">AlmostNeverDeleteHumor</a> on Wiki so long ago. Or at least I did, and others picked it up. That's why LetTheDrivelShrivel was such a great phrase from <a href="WaldenMathews.html">WaldenMathews</a>, as he advised me not to engage with those producing drivel and trying to do me down.

        Combining the two pieces of advice has proved more difficult.

        The end of ConspiracyTheories yesterday I managed a humorous response to a "what kind of wierdo are you?" question, one that I was most pleased with. I hope some people remember that one. If not, see <a href="WikiRewritesHistory.html">WikiRewritesHistory</a>, the first five or six entries. One of the great benefits of the traumas on <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a> has been the deep need to find a funny side. When you do find the right words in an unfamiliar and trying context it's a wonderful thing. "I'm a fundamentalist Christian and I'm here to learn." That was one of my very best, playing the LearningFundamentalist at <a href="StrangeAttractor.html">StrangeAttractor</a>. They laughed a lot, <a href="JonRonson.html">JonRonson</a> and all. And like all the best humor, it had a most serious point to it. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
