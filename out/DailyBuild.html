        Daily Build
      </h1>
      <p>
        Run the compiler and linker to build the executables on a daily basis.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is often known as a <a href="NightlyBuild.html">NightlyBuild</a>, because it is automatically performed in the wee hours, followed by automatic running of all the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s.  People use a <a href="SmokeTest.html">SmokeTest</a> on the build when they arrive every morning to verify that it isn't broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        One goal is to always leave the source so that the daily build never breaks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is often a rule (maybe unspoken) that if the build breaks, everyone on the team has to cease new development until it is fixed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The book <a href="RapidDevelopment.html">RapidDevelopment</a> by <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a> has a chapter devoted to this technique.

        In a workshop entitled "Daily Builds Are For Wimps", MichaelTwo of <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a> advocates <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>. One way to put this into practice that has been successful is with <a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a> and <a href="ApacheAnt.html">ApacheAnt</a>.  Another way is with <a href="MozillaTinderbox.html">MozillaTinderbox</a>. See <a href="ContinuousIntegrationPatterns.html">ContinuousIntegrationPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a>s are not enough, but they can still be useful in conjunction with <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> to ensure that the whole system is rebuilt from scratch at least once a day, and to establish checkpoints.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One important difference between <a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a>s and <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> is that many <a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a> scenarios rely on a <a href="BuildMeister.html">BuildMeister</a> to ensure the clean status of a build. In a <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> scenario, every developer is responsible for making sure his own check-ins don't break the build (either via email notifications, a status web page, or other method).  If he did break it, he is supposed to stop anything he is currently doing and fix the build right away.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please be aware that in 2004, for 98% of the development projects, <a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a>s would be a great advance from the <a href="IntegrationHell.html">IntegrationHell</a> in which they choose to live.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At one job, I was specifically told to never do a full rebuild from bare source (i.e., recompile everything). Add my changes and run the makefile. And yes, the code was just as bad as you would expect in that situation.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Is it necessary that <a href="DailyBuild.html">DailyBuild</a> be automated? Lights-out? From bare known configured state? Independent of an IDE?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All of those are highly desirable.</em>
