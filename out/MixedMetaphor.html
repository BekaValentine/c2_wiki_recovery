        Mixed Metaphor

        I doubt the <a href="MixedMetaphor.html">MixedMetaphor</a> needs any introduction, but examples can be fun.

        Someone I work with, in a meeting the other day talked about being "down to the last wire".  A German fellow in the meeting asked what she had said, so she repeated it in all earnestness "down to the last wire" (not putting her down, you understand - I've been guilty of worse).

        My wife is famous for mixed metaphors which she never knows she's saying and only recognizes later.  We've laughed about some of them for years - especially "That was the last needle on the haystack."  If you think about it, that's actually mixing 3 metaphors.  Also - "It was the worst craw in my side."

           We should probably not open that bag of worms.
