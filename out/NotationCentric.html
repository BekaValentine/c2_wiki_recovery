        Notation Centric
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some corporations equate Object Oriented Design with a specific design notation (i.e. <a href="BoochMethod.html">BoochMethod</a>, Object Model Notation, Coad Method, etc).  Any failure of these  methodologies and their associated notations indicate (falsely) a failure of Object Oriented Design.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the unification of <a href="BoochMethod.html">BoochMethod</a> and Rumbaugh's Object Model Notation we may see one emergent standard notation for major object oriented projects.  The ramifications of this possibility is scary.  Remember <a href="TopDownDesign.html">TopDownDesign</a> and all of its restrictions?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, none of these notations and techniques are inherently bad. Each represent years of research and case studies of huge software development efforts.  But, they (and the <a href="CaseTool.html">CaseTool</a>s that implement them) are taken as rigid guidelines for successful software development by many project managers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps we need some <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s to remind us not to
        place too much faith in any particular notation or 
        methodology.

        So, true, and so sad. I wonder if <a href="CargoCult.html">CargoCult</a> should be 
        adapted to reflect this phenomenon: the representation of
        something is mistaken for the thing itself. As with
        organizational charts, so with elaborate design documents
        which, however detailed, elegantly wrought, and gorgeously
        bound, do not necessarily lead to functioning software
        systems. Of course, CASE tool manufacturers have been 
        making a ton o' money selling just such a notion, but the
        fact remains: if you can't run it, it ain't done yet. And
        in my experience, CASE tools are great for only one thing:
        recording a design that is as easily captured on a few
        cocktail napkins and a pocketful of patterns. -- <a href="DonOlson.html">DonOlson</a>

        I have introduced into my speaking and writing the ScannerChallenge.  A CASE tool is slower on entry, but should eventually pay for itself on changes.  The question is, how many times can you (a) redraw, (b) scan in, (c) paste into a Lotus note, the design, before the CASE tool catches up.  I currently estimate it at 8 changes per sheet. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>
