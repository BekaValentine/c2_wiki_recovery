        Share and Learn -- Group Purpose -- The UDIC group is aimed at fostering the spirit of research and inquiry in the area of <a href="DistributedComputing.html">DistributedComputing</a> and <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a>. The group gives opportunities for research-oriented discussion and activities to undergraduate and graduate students from the SCE Computer Science department and related studies (such as <a href="SoftwareArchitecture.html">SoftwareArchitecture</a>, Bioinformatics, and ComputerNetworking).
      </p>
      <p>
        Core foundations for the UDIC group are sharing and learning, thereby encouraging students at UMKC-SCE to become leading players in their respective research community. Participating in such activities makes one aware of the state-of-art in the current fields and stay abreast in the ever-changing field of computer science. The motive is to share and nurture ideas in young minds, thereby exposing the hidden talent and leading them to their full potential.
