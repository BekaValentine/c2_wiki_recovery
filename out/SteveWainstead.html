As of this writing I work at Fortunecity.com.

          Oct 21, 1999: I work at New York Times Digital. We've started using <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> for internal documentation; first on a project to build a new content management system and now to document the company systems as a whole. So far people seem pretty enthusiastic about it.

          Nov 26,1999: At this stage we want to merge the two Wikis. The problem is some people are creating new pages in the wrong Wiki; pages that document the project I'm working on are winding up in the company Wiki. The product managers really love the ease of use of the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, but they are growing unhappy with the simplified markup. I was slightly disappointed with the use of the Wikis as mere document-writing tools, but adoption of any sort was preferable to no documentation!

        <dd>I wrote a Perl script to try to read both DBM files into two serparate hashes, and then write them out into a new DBM file with collisions fixed and so on. However the script keeps getting an error when it tries to write to the new DBM file; it gets a -1 returned, errno 2. It complains about a particular key but I can save the page in the new Wiki through the browser; I quit in frustration a few days ago, and will have to try it again soon.</dd>

        <dd>I have to give a presentation on collaborative document editing next week; I've been reading John Udell's <em>Practical Internet Groupware</em> (from O'Reilly) and studying up on WebDaV, Zope, and Amaya/Jigsaw. </dd>

           Dec 4, 1999: I have made good progress on a PHP-based Wiki, called imaginatively enough <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a>. See the page for info.
