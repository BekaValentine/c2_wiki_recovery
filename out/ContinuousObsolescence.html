        Continuous Obsolescence

      <p>
        Continuous Obsolescence:  This is the hardest Anti-Pattern to overcome.  Corporations have their pet system that they mutate every time a new computer language and/or buzz-word builder comes down the pike to the developers.  As soon as the pet system is migrated into the new language and/or method it becomes obsolete and thereby cancels any possibility of developers receiving a bonus for bringing the design in on time.  It is also used to justify corporate heads existence by moving the blame for a poorly designed system to a new language and/or method of construction.
