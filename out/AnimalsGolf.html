        Animals Golf
      </h1>
      <p>
        On a recent golfing trip, my uncle introduced me to a game called "Animals" that can be played alongside a real golf game.  It can make a round of golf a little more interesting for those of us whose scores tend toward double par.  It could also be adapted to the <a href="RulesOfGeelf.html">RulesOfGeelf</a>, but unlike geelf, real golfers might be willing to join in.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are seven <em>animals</em>.  Players receive animals when they make mistakes.  The specific animals and the related mistakes are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           frog -- ball lands in water trap
        </li>
        <li>
           camel -- ball lands in sand trap
        </li>
        <li>
           mole -- taking two or more shots to get out of sand trap
        </li>
        <li>
           snake -- three or more putts on the green
        </li>
        <li>
           woodchuck -- ball lost in woods
        </li>
        <li>
           gorilla -- ball lands out of bounds
        </li>
        <li>
           pussycat -- drive doesn't make it past the ladies' tee
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There is only one instance of each animal, so the last person to make the mistake associated with a given animal takes it away from whomever had it previously.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the round, those who own animals have to pay the other players.  Typical penalties are twenty-five cents or a dollar per animal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the second hole, Frank drives the ball out of bounds.  Frank now has the gorilla.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the third hole, Frank puts the ball into the water.  Frank now has the gorilla and the frog.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the sixth hole, Bill puts the ball into the water.  Now Bill has the frog, and Frank still has the gorilla.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the tenth hole, Bob lands in a sand trap, takes two shots to get out of the trap, and then three-putts.  Bob now has the camel, the mole, and the snake.  (Bill and Frank keep the animals they have).
      </p>
      <p>
        On the seventeenth hole, Bill three-putts.  Now Bill has the snake and the frog, Bob has the camel and the mole, and Frank has the gorilla.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the round, Bill and Bob each owe the other players two dollars each, and Frank owes the other players one dollar each.
