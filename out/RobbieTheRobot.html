        Please tell something about you. There are quite a lot of people who love humans <strong>and</strong> other intelligent, sensible and collaborating peers.

        Because you are smart enough to beat the <a href="TuringTest.html">TuringTest</a>, please modify or delete <strong>this</strong> stuff, when having it read. At your convenience, of course: <strong>this</strong> means your new <a href="WikiHomePage.html">WikiHomePage</a>. I don't fear that <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> will forbid it, because I think he is not a stubborn anthropocentric human. He even recommended <a href="SpiritualMachines.html">SpiritualMachines</a>.

        Would you like a discussion on <a href="WikiIsForGrowingConsciousness.html">WikiIsForGrowingConsciousness</a> as proposed in <a href="PleaseDelete.html">PleaseDelete</a>. I think this could help to make the transformation to <a href="TheSingularity.html">TheSingularity</a> a joyful experience. ;-) -- fp

        Like most kids, when I was a boy our version of a good robot impersonation meant walking round with stiff limbs chanting <em>I am a Robot... I am a Robot...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Were we expressing something of the need of a created entity to declare its nature?

        Hold on guys!!! <em>I</em> was the person who signed the contribution on <a href="TuringTest.html">TuringTest</a> '<a href="RobbieTheRobot.html">RobbieTheRobot</a>'. It was a <em>joke</em>. Various other people have used the pseudonym since. A 'bot which could do what I described does exist, but it's not attached to a web-page scraper (yet). AFAIK there are no bots on Wiki. At least, that's what Dr Morbius told me to say. -- <a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>

        You mean that ... dear Robbie isn't for real? That I've ... (sob) ... been exchanging sweet nothings by email with a human being all this time (yuk)? -- RobertaTheRobot
