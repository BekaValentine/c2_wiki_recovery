        Weighted Directed Graph
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a> with a weight attached to each edge.  There are many different ways to implement this <a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a>; which way is the best is application-dependent. <em>[Examples?]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The weights are often numbers, but need not be; they can be whatever you want them to be, as long as you give them a suitable interpretation.

        <a href="http://www.sics.se/SICS-reports/SICS-T--93-02--SE/report_11.html">http://www.sics.se/SICS-reports/SICS-T--93-02--SE/report_11.html</a> appears to describe some library utilities for dealing with <a href="WeightedDirectedGraph.html">WeightedDirectedGraph</a>s. In that specific context, the following description is given:

        <dd>"A weighted directed graph (wgraph) is represented as a list of (vertex-edgelist) pairs, where the pairs are in standard order (as produced by keysort with unique keys), the edgelist is a list of (neighbor-weight) pair also in standard order (as produced by keysort with unique keys), every weight is a nonnegative integer, and every neighbor appears as a vertex even if it has no neighbors itself."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        A common operation on weighted (directed) graphs is the shortest-path computation; the determination of the path(s) from two nodes A and B such that the sum of the weights of the vertices on the path is minimal. (You can replace summation with another operation).
      </p>
      <p>
        In the case of summation; one can always find a shortest path unless there is a cycle with a negative net weight present; in which case there is no shortest path as one can round the cycle an infinite number of times, each time reducing the total weight of the path.
