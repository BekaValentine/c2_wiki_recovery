        c.f. 1066 And All That (Sellars and Yeatman), which used the capitalized phrase 'A Good Thing' to describe historical events which are universally accepted in schoolbook history as having a net positive effect. So, for example, the signing of the Magna Carta was A Good Thing.

        <em>Unless you were the King. Then you would think the Magna Carta and its resulting loss of power and position was a </em><a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>.<em></em>

        No, it was "universally accepted" as a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>. That for one not concerned with the well-being of that "universe of acceptance" it was not preservation of the way things were, does not therefore make it a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>. "Universally accepted", however, should not be inferred from that a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> is "popular", for there are times, populations, and places where <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>s are not popular and <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>s are popular.
