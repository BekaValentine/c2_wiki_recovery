        Default Stance Is Unknown
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is common confusion about what the default position is on many topics if the other side has yet to provide icon-clad evidence. <strong>Logically, the default is "unknown" or "null".</strong> Each side is obligated to provide sufficient evidence to shift it away from "unknown". 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, it's common in ID circles to say that evidence against evolution, such as the relatively sudden Cambrian Explosion, is evidence of ID because evolution still has gaps or holes. However, that excludes the possibility of 3 or more possibilities (such as robots created all or time recursion did it). Thus, gaps in evolution are not by themselves strong evidence for ID. It's quite possible for two or more theories to be weak or have gaps.
      </p>
      <p>
        (It is strong evidence if one can prove that there are only two possible theories, and one has evidence against one of the two.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please note the point of ID is that natural evolution never passed any realistic test of evidence in accordance with the rules that those who now back it would say would have to be met by any that would replace it. From a historical perspective, ID is the null hypothesis. Nobody knows what happens from </em><a href="DefaultStanceIsUnknown.html">DefaultStanceIsUnknown</a> because nobody's willing to play on a level playing field.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not about "passing", it's about which theory (model) has the most evidence going for it. (Evolution has the "problem" that we cannot fully observe it happen and repeat it, due to the limited human life-span. But nobody's filmed God snapping rabbits into existence either.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Essentially true for humans and other long-lived species, but evolution can be fully observed over time in relatively short-lived subjects like fruit flies and bacteria, where we can easily observe significant evolutionary changes over generations.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's what ID proponents sometimes refer to as "micro-evolution" when in fact what is sought is <em>direct</em> observation of "macro-evolution".

        Nor is the "most popular" stance the default (<a href="ArgumentFromPopularity.html">ArgumentFromPopularity</a>). One may argue it's a relatively <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> if choices must be made, but it's weak evidence on the <a href="EvidenceTotemPole.html">EvidenceTotemPole</a> and should be given minimal weight at best. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        [The stance which is commonly accepted in fact <em>actually is</em> the default, but it's not an <a href="ArgumentFromPopularity.html">ArgumentFromPopularity</a>, because it's not an argument. One presumes that others believe that which is commonly accepted as a starting point to convince them of whatever it is one wishes to convince them of; this doesn't at any point involve an argument or even an assumption that that which is commonly accepted is <em>true</em>, so no <a href="ArgumentFromPopularity.html">ArgumentFromPopularity</a> arises (in fact, from the arguer's perspective, that which is commonly accepted must naturally be <em>false</em>, otherwise one would have no reason to change others' minds!). When one makes an exceptional claim{[1]}---meaning one that is distinct from that which is commonly accepted---one then has a <a href="BurdenOfProof.html">BurdenOfProof</a> to demonstrate one's claim and hopefully convince others to change their opinions and views. It's fallacious (<a href="ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof.html">ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof</a>) instead to demand evidence that others prove that that which is commonly accepted is true. This is how argument and debate work; it's not me or anyone else inventing fictional debate rules, and it's not contrary to rational logic in the slightest. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        How is that not <a href="ArgumentFromPopularity.html">ArgumentFromPopularity</a>? I'm still not clear on how you recon that. It is an "assumption". Formal debate rejects <a href="ArgumentFromPopularity.html">ArgumentFromPopularity</a> and <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>. The "real world" is more nebulous on that; but in the real world its also "reasonable" to ask, "why do most people say that?" and <em>expect evidence</em>. Myths and "wives tales" are common and commonly wrong and it's acceptable to ask for verification before relying on them, at least in the "educated" world. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        [It's not <a href="ArgumentFromPopularity.html">ArgumentFromPopularity</a> because <em>it's not an argument</em>. One is merely presuming that others currently believe that which is commonly accepted. That isn't an argument that that which is commonly accepted is true; indeed, you're trying to prove that that which is commonly accepted is false, so it'd be foolish to start out by arguing that that which is commonly accepted is true. You'd do better to argue that whatever you're trying to prove is true, preferably with supporting evidence. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Presuming is bad form. Yes, and "do better to" may indeed be better, but is not necessary. It would be orgasmically nice to have an <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> to defend ones position, but just because it's not available does not automatically make the other candidate position(s) the default "truth".
      </p>
      <p>
        [Correct. It doesn't. The other candidate's position is that which is commonly accepted, however, which leaves the <a href="BurdenOfProof.html">BurdenOfProof</a> on you, <em>regardless of which position is true</em>. Truth is in fact irrelevant. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, you have not justified that clearly. Popularity does not get you off the hook from defending your (popular) opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        [We don't assume that that which is commonly accepted is true---that would be fallacious---but we do require evidence to shift our stance from that which is commonly accepted, because demanding the opposite would also be fallacious. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Same thing. You are trying to repackage it, and I will not buy it. Truth should be determined by evidence, not votes. Votes are only a consolation prize because decisions must be made even if the current body of evidence is weak (for all theories). "Shifting" means that something sets the "current" position, but the rule of how it got there is so far quite vague.
        </li>
        <li>
           [Truth is determined by evidence, not votes. The fact that the default stance is that which is commonly accepted <em>does not imply</em> that that which is commonly accepted is true. -DavidMcLean]

           I didn't claim it was.

        No. Commonly-held beliefs are expected to be justified/verified also. Most agree that the MythBusters are doing a valuable service for the world (except they explode stuff too often).  <em>Some would say not often enough</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Urban myths often aren't that which is commonly accepted. Regardless, what the MythBusters do is exactly as I just said: They gather evidence to shift the viewers' beliefs from the myth to reality. Notice that they don't demand that others give them proof? - DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, but you are not doing that.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Neither are you. You're demanding that I provide proof of that which is commonly accepted, rather than providing proof of your own perspective, one that is not. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        I am only obligated if there are only two possibilities. For example, if you claim that one should "always group code by X", I am NOT obligated to provide evidence that it should be grouped by Y or any other letter. The "X is better" claim is your claim and your obligation. (If you give me a specific example, I'd be happy to suggest other possibilities to measure and compare.)

      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'm going to disagree (to some extent) with both the above participants. What the default stance is (or even if it exists) will depend on circumstances. If one is trying to change someones mind about an issue, then the default stance is clearly what that person already believes. In some forms of formal debate, there simply isn't a default stance. If you don't support your argument, your argument is invalid. In science, the situation is usually closer to the former. Most of the time, there is some incumbent theory that is considered correct. It's up to competing theories to offer some sort of advantage over the incumbent.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Absolutely. In the context we're working from, though, there does happen to be an incumbent theory in place, so alternative theories will need support and evidence. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In the context we are working from, there is no hard survey data (and I suspect the answer will depend on how the survey is written such as "always" versus "usually" versus "often"). But anyhow, </em>'EVERY position needs to defend itself<strong>. There is no "king of the kill" except that theory with the most evidence, NOT the most votes. In science, the "incumbent theory" is usually that one with the most evidence backing it. If new evidence comes along that overwhelms the former, then it becomes the leading horse. But </strong>the leading horse is not the same as the standing champ<em>', the race continues. True, in science it often takes a while for the new theory to bounce around in the establishment before the strength is collectively realized, but that's a property of people, not of truth itself.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Sure, but the incumbent theory isn't invalidated simply because someone offers another theory. That other theory must in fact come with evidence that does indeed overwhelm that presented by the incumbent theory, and your presented theories are lacking in evidence. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Or there is some other way in which it is considered superior. Evidence isn't the only way to change incumbents. If someone were to come up with a theory that explains everything that quantum mechanics does, and no more, but is significantly simpler, that also would allow it to become the incumbent. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [I'd view the demonstration that that new theory does indeed explain everything quantum mechanics does to be supporting evidence. One obviously can't just claim "this theory explains everything quantum mechanics does but is simpler" without such a demonstration, after all, and it's only with that evidence that the new theory can become the incumbent. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You would need the evidence that it's at least as good, which that demonstration would provide. But keep in mind that this hypothetical theory isn't any better either. The decision as to which to use can't be made on just the evidence, since the evidence is equivalent for both.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>0 > 0 ? I find it absurd to let the "incumbent" have a </em>'get-out-of-evidence-for-free card<em>'. This is supposed to be the age of science. -t</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There are costs to change. Therefore, if you wish to convince people to change, you need something better than "it's just as good." This applies just as much in science as it does anywhere else. The primary difference is that in science, the incumbent gets to be the incumbent because someone has already provided the evidence and had that evidence accepted.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, but sticking with something because change is expensive and sticking with it because it has the most evidence for it are two different thing. And the "incumbent" often has very little evidence for it. If it had a lot of evidence for it, then we probably would not be having this discussion because it would then be about which has the strongest evidence rather than what's the default if evidence lacks.</em>
