      <p>
        Web developer from Varna, Bulgaria.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working mainly with PHP, MySQL, Javascript, Ajax, Smarty, XML, etc...
        These are the usual technologies every web developer uses, but what I am really interested in is Javascript.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am here to search for a good information during my way of creating javascript framework (which will be used to ease my work and as I hope good Master Thesis).
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway my second goal is to eventually help and contribute :)
