        Patterns Document The Obvious
      </h1>
      <p>
        While writing a pattern language on user interfaces, I found that I was censoring myself.  I tossed out a few patterns because I felt that they documented the obvious!
      </p>
      <p>
        One of my patterns suggested to use graphics and well designed layouts to <em>Communicate Visually</em>. How obvious!  What a waste of writing!  Well, maybe not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even some of Alexander's Patterns seem obvious or <em>un-profound</em>.  
        The best provoke the AhaPrinciple, but some left me going: <em>yeah, yeah, any idiot knows that</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It took me a while to realize that if just one person doesn't feel that the pattern is <em>obvious</em>, then that pattern is an integral part of the language.  Without it, gaps in a persons knowledge or experience will cause application of the pattern language to fail.  A pattern language must be complete to be useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good pattern writer can make the mundane and obvious readable and tolerable.

        A great pattern writer can make the mundane and obvious seem profound.

        The "obvious" patterns provide grounding in familiar, well-understood principles that we all need in order to absorb the less obvious. Also, patterns that are obvious to one are often new and exciting to another.

        I don't think it's so much the "obvious" that patterns document as it is the "familiar". If you haven't seen it
        before, it's not obvious. However, there are some conclusions I can draw that might be obvious, even though I haven't seen them time and time again. The "obvious" part comes into play when I recognize it from something within my own internal repertoire (my personal "bag of tricks" ;-). It doesn't become obviously recognizable until I have used/seen it often enough that I have "internalized" it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So rather than say "Patterns Document the Obvious", I would prefer to say:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Patterns document best practices that are "old hat" to seasoned professionals in the particular domain.</dd>
      </dl>
