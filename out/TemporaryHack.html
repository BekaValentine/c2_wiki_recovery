        Temporary Hack

      <p>
        <a href="TemporaryHack.html">TemporaryHack</a>s are fixes that you only intend to be used for a short period of time. The intention is to replace the <a href="TemporaryHack.html">TemporaryHack</a> with a more standard solution at a future time. A Temporary Hack is usually unconventional and rarely fully tested. It will often work if certain assumptions are true but may fail if other parts of the system or data change. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many <a href="TemporaryHack.html">TemporaryHack</a>s end up being PermanentHacks as once a system is working again (with the <a href="TemporaryHack.html">TemporaryHack</a>) the motivation to change it is offset by the risk of disrupting the system.
