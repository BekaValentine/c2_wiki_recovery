        One of the reasons given for not <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>.  Here are some arguments against this.

        In response to this statement from my team, I offered them a compromise.  They would be permitted to fly solo on what they considered to be simple changes as long as they agreed to support their code 24/7.

This didn't seem to be very appealing for some reason.  -  <a href="KenReigle.html">KenReigle</a>
