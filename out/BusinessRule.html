        Business Rule

      <p>
        A <a href="BusinessRule.html">BusinessRule</a> (in a programming context) is knowledge that gets applied to a set of data to create new value.  Or it may be a rule about how to create, modify, or remove data.  Or perhaps it is a rule that specifies when certain processes occur.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, we have a rule about email addresses -- when the Driver Name field on our object identifier changes, we erase the email address.  When we receive a new email address, we make sure that it contains an "@" sign and a valid domain not on our blacklist.
