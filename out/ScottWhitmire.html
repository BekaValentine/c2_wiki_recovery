        I have been doing software since 1980, working slowly and consistently towards OO that entire time. My specialty is architecture and design, although I sometimes like to keep my hands dirty. I am trying to raise the level of discipline in this business, mostly through the use of measurement as a means to make design decision.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently did some work in OO design measurement that led to the creation of a theory of objects built upon category theory. It's a theory only in the sense that it formally describes the structure of objects and classes, the relationships between them, and ways to manipulate that structure. I guess you could say I approach software from the inside out.

        I am currently the lead designer on a large project (~$25M) that used to be OO. It is still use-case-driven and pattern-based, and the design is definitely OO, but the tool we are using to construct it can't really qualify. Works, though, and as good engineers, we use whatever works, right?

        Scott, do you mean <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> as in the branch of mathematics that explored similarities and deep relationships between seemingly independent branches of math such as Algebra and Topology? -- <a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        Scott, I was wondering what you meant when you said the project "used to be OO."  Are you using a non-OO language or a code generation tool? -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        Scott is the lead designer on the project that I used to be the OO Methodologist on. We did a lot of work with Use Cases and C++ development of infrastructure elements before deciding to convert the implementation to a non-OO tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the project "used to be OO" in the sense that we were driving to a well-factored system that used lots of base classes and polymorphic behavior, but we are now implementing in a non-OO way. 
      </p>

        Scott is keeping the good "OO thinking" alive in the currently evolving architecture, though...  --<a href="DanRawsthorne.html">DanRawsthorne</a>
