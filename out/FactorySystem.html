        Factory System
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="FactorySystem.html">FactorySystem</a> is a term often used to describe the new pattern of manufacturing that grew up in the <a href="IndustrialRevolution.html">IndustrialRevolution</a> in Britain during the 18th Century.
      </p>
      <p>
        The manufacturing of cloth and particularly lace are prime examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously, material had been produced on a small scale, CottageIndustry basis by individuals or small groups of people, working either at home or in small local establishments, and using traditional spinning (wheel, frame) technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="FactorySystem.html">FactorySystem</a> changed all that. Pioneered by <a href="RichardArkwright.html">RichardArkwright</a>, large new factory buildings near Nottingham and elsewhere, housing large manufacturing machines powered by water or steam energy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using water power, the new factories were initially located near to rivers in generally rural locations. However, once steam power was exploited on a larger scale, the factories moved to the cities, dragging their workers with them, and leading to rapid urban expansion, overcrowding and all the horrors of the Victorian slums.
