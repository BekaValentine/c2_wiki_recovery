        Lisp Injection
      </h1>
      <p>
        Theoretically <a href="LispInjection.html">LispInjection</a> could be to lisp-driven applications what <a href="SqlInjection.html">SqlInjection</a> is to databases-- a common programming error that results in security holes. <a href="LispInjection.html">LispInjection</a> could happen if the application allows a user to enter values (such as via a form) that the application concatenates into a string containing a Lisp statement that is later "run as code", after all an important part of Lisp philosophy is that "code is data and data is code".
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this possible? Does it actually happen in real production systems? Are there practices and recommendations to avoid this theoretical security risk?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'd guess that quoting is such an ingrained routine for a </em>LispHacker that incorrect handling of external data is seldom observed in practice.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it? or is it just that the number of <a href="LispInjection.html">LispInjection</a> attacks is very little because Lisp is not as popular as SQL
      </p>

        <em>Even more interesting would be techniques for avoiding this, such as parsing libraries to take input text and verify its safety.  Does anything like </em>PerlTaintMode exist in any versions of Lisp? -- <a href="RobertField.html">RobertField</a><em></em>
