        <a href="EiffelUnit.html">EiffelUnit</a> is a regression testing framework loosely based on JUnit (A.k.a. <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>).  Just as <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a> says about <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>, <a href="EiffelUnit.html">EiffelUnit</a> is just like JUnit, only different.
      </p>
      <p>
        The major difference concerns the fact that JUnit makes heavy use of Java's reflection capabilities to ease the pain of writing tests.  Since Eiffel doesn't have reflection, <a href="EiffelUnit.html">EiffelUnit</a> uses automatic code generation to fill that gap.  You write the tests, and the <strong>eunit</strong> program will generate the glue that binds your tests into a single framework, compile and run the program, and report the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've used <a href="EiffelUnit.html">EiffelUnit</a> for some time now, so I'm very interested in feedback. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently <a href="EiffelUnit.html">EiffelUnit</a> works with the GNU <a href="SmallEiffel.html">SmallEiffel</a> compiler.  There has been a small bit if effort put into making it portable to other compilers.  If someone would like to port it to a different Eiffel system, please contact me.

        <strong>Note:</strong> <a href="EiffelUnit.html">EiffelUnit</a> was formerly known as ETest (<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>: <a href="EiffelTest.html">EiffelTest</a>).  The name was changed for several reasons: (1) The new name is more Wiki friendly, (2) it clearly identifies the package as an <em>Eiffel</em> package, (3) it is more in-line with the rest of the XUnit packages, and (4) ISE just released a testing package named Eiffel Test.

        <em>Do you think if </em><a href="BertrandMeyer.html">BertrandMeyer</a> had written <a href="EiffelUnit.html">EiffelUnit</a>, he would have used machine-generated glue code to fake introspection? Assuming (without proof) that he is the greatest Eiffel programmer in the world, how would he have done it? -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest release of <a href="EiffelUnit.html">EiffelUnit</a> uses an program written in Eiffel to generate the glue code formerly generated by the perl script.  The perl script is still available for those who would prefer to use it.  -- <a href="JimWeirich.html">JimWeirich</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I reworded the question to emphasis that I'm interested in the faking introspection part, not the specific language used. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        <em>My understanding is that yes, he would have used "faked" introspection.  Eiffel's syntax is deliberately kept clean to make it easier to parse and generate Eiffel code.  Metalingual features such as introspection can be implemented as language processors that are invoked as part of the built process.</em> --<a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, my understanding is that the latest version of Eiffel from ISE (Meyer's company) does offer some form of introspection/reflection.  Reflection is not (yet) standardized in the language and other Eiffel vendors have not yet followed ISE's lead in this area.  -- <a href="JimWeirich.html">JimWeirich</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        ISE Eiffel has attribute features introspection but no routine features introspection... I do not know about other compilers. -- <a href="GodefroidChapelle.html">GodefroidChapelle</a>
