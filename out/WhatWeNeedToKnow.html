        What We Need To Know
      </h1>
      <p>
        To add to our excuses for not knowing everything, one might also say that the edge of our knowledge extends only when YouActuallyAreGonnaNeedIt (YAAGNI). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Need is perhaps the strongest catalyst for innovation and exploration of possibilities. What you already know is what you have thus far supposed that you will need to know. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This changes the approach to that of "YouCantLearnSomethingUntilYouAlreadyAlmostNeedIt".

           I'm not sure I would say that it extends "only" when you need it. I enjoy learning about certain subjects and do so just out of pleasure. I also have a relative who retains everything he reads, whether he needs it or not, whether he's even interested or not. Now, maybe there's a difference between information retained (photographic memory) and information that is <em>known</em> at an operational level. -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>
