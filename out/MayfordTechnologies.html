        "Mayford Technologies is now Westboro Systems Ltd., an Ottawa-based Agile Software Development Coaching and Training services company!" <em>Umm...this seems to fly in the face of the listing on the </em><a href="CompaniesDoingXp.html">CompaniesDoingXp</a> page, where the firms listed are actually <em>developing product</em> using XP.
