        Category Interaction Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        This category is on a developing discipline which is interested in the way and means by which <em>things</em> interact. These things need not be humans and/or machines. The interactions involved include Technical, Practical and Social concerns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because someone has created a well designed program or system does not necessarily mean that the program or system will be used as its originators had envisioned. This is because humans use a natural language and natural reasoning process as opposed to the technical and modelled processes present in computer implementations. As a result this category can be fruitful in establishing how design can take into account the Interactions and UsagePotential of a program or system.

        It has been evident through simple observation that technically conceived processes on the internet have been utilized in ways not intended. This is why <a href="InteractionDesign.html">InteractionDesign</a> is such an important field.

        <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: Could somebody please describe how this topic is sufficiently different from <a href="CategoryUserInterface.html">CategoryUserInterface</a> to deserve its own topic? Thanks.
      </p>

        <em>User Interfaces are about what an interface is, Interaction Design is about why interfaces work or work not. Interaction is about how a human works; Interface is about how the computer works. This is enough of a distinction so as to provide both categories.</em>
