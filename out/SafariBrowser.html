        The browser was released as beta software in January 2003 and version 1.0 was released in June 2003. Features included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Integrated <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> toolbar.
        </li>
        <li>
           Fastest browser on the Mac.
        </li>
        <li>
           Redesigned bookmark interface.
        </li>
        <li>
           Snap-back feature: Visit <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, mark it, surf merrily away, snapback to <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TabbedBrowsing.html">TabbedBrowsing</a>: Visit <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, never need to close it!
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="FaviconDotIco.html">FaviconDotIco</a>'s appear in bookmark lists. (see Ward's glasses in all their miniscule glory).
        </li>
        <li>
           Integrated "Bug reporting" feature (which includes options to send a screenshot and source code of buggy pages - but no way to receive feedback from the developers on whether the bug is known or being fixed; this may frustrate the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> crowd used to public <a href="BugDatabase.html">BugDatabase</a>s, but unlike <a href="BugZilla.html">BugZilla</a> it's simple enough to avoid scaring off the MomAndPop users).
        </li>
        <li>
           Option to block all pop-up windows
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And, less spectacularly:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           fancy brushed metal look.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But best of all: It doesn't get <a href="InMyWay.html">InMyWay</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I find the downloading interface gets very much </em><a href="InMyWay.html">InMyWay</a>. It seems to be all-or-nothing: open files in the wrong application without my asking it to, or save them to some directory and require hitting a tiny button in a tiny download manager window which is hidden under all my other windows to turn them up in Finder. Aside from that and the bugs, though, I love it! ;)<em></em>

        It would be nice if they provided an option to disable multi-frame (animated) GIF images. I sent in a "bug report" about it and suggest others do likewise. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        <em>Mozilla has this (at least in the latest beta) as a global setting: display, display once, or never display.</em>

        I agree. I just started looking at Safari and it seems nice but I was shocked to see so many distracting animated gifs that I had never seen in IE5, since I had turned them off. A must have feature. - MJS

        There is a small patch for Safari called PithHelmet... it kills ads, and also has an animated GIF switch. Try it! - a1f

        How does one export the bookmarks?
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a .mac account, or in principle any account on a system that supports <a href="WebDav.html">WebDav</a>, firing up iSync will coordinate bookmarks from Safari for you across machines. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternately, you can process the bookmark file located in ~/Library/Safari/Bookmarks.plist. It's XML. -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Has anyone written an <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> to do this processing into an HTML file in standard form for importing into Netscape and IE? I can see how to do it; I'd just as soon not reinvent the wheel. -- Dan Shafer
