        Grandfather Clause
      </h1>
      <p>
        A clause in a rule or law which exempts existing persons/things/etc. from the effects of the rule.  Derives from clauses in various voting acts passed in the post-CivilWar American South, intended to prevent African-Americans from voting (in defiance of the 15th Amendment, which gave blacks the right to vote).  The laws erected difficult-to-overcome barriers to voting which were purportedly color-neutral; but contained the exemption that if your <em>grandfather</em> was eligible to vote, then so could you.  As the grandfathers of most blacks were slaves, blacks didn't qualify for this exemption, but most whites did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eventually, most such laws were thrown out as unconstitutional, but not until significant damage was done.
