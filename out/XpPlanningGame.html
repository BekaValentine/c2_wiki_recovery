        Xp Planning Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        In our first meeting I tried to cover a little bit about everything.
        In this meeting I will focus on planning and managing a project using XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is different in XP? Everything. XP is about direct communication, rapid feedback and aligning roles.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the area that makes the largest demands on the Customer. 
        I will talk about what a Customer must do in addition to what the Developers must do to succeed at XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the first meeting I presented the "bill of rights", this will be a look at the techniques used to achieve those "rights".
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope that you will bring lots of questions to this session. I plan to make these as interactive as you want.
