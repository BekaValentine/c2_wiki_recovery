        Brickified Pencil

        From Ted Nelson, <em>Computer Lib/Dream Machines</em>, (Mindful Press, 1974) [note: some phrases have been converted to <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s]:

        <dd>"[...] before people could write things down, men could only learn what they experienced or were told by others in person; writing changed all that. Within the computer-screen fraternity, the next step is obvious; screens can double and redouble our intellectual capacities. But this is not obvious to everybody. <a href="DougEngelbart.html">DougEngelbart</a>, patiently instructing those outside [Stanford Research Institute], came up with a beautiful example. To show what he meant by the AugmentationOfIntellect, <a href="DougEngelbart.html">DougEngelbart</a> tied a pencil to a brick. Then he actually made someone write with it. The result, which was of course dreadful, <a href="DougEngelbart.html">DougEngelbart</a> solemnly put into a published report. Not yet being able to demonstrate the AugmentationOfIntellect, since he had as yet no system to show off, he had masterfully demonstrated the DisaugmentationOfIntellect: what happens if you make man's tools for working out his thoughts worse instead of better. As this poor guy was with his brickified pencil, explained <a href="DougEngelbart.html">DougEngelbart</a>, so are we all among our bothersome, inflexible systems of paper."</dd>

        The sheer irony of this story is that one of the criticisms of the mouse as an input device is that it's "like drawing with a brick", which is why graphics tablets are so popular amongst artists, and also draftsmen using CADD applications. -- <a href="JeffRead.html">JeffRead</a>

        There's nothing ironic about it; Englebart discovered that brickified pencils dis-augmented human intellect, analyzed that, found that the form factor was good but the weight was bad, and proceeded to invent the lightweight brick for drawing: the mouse. :-) -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
