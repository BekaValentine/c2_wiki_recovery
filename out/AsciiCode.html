        ASCII - American Standard Code for Information Interchange
      </p>
      <p>
        Completely different from IBM's EBCDIC Extended Binary Coded Decimal Interchange Code encoding.
      </p>
      <p>
        This 7-bit encoding is the defacto-standard encoding for Roman text and most <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>s. It was developed in the 60s and standardized in its current form in 1967.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many 8-bit "high ASCII" encodings were derived from ASCII, mostly to represent letters with diacritical marks used in European languages. Latin-1 (ISO 8859-1) is the most common example seen on the web, as shown on <a href="AsciiValuesForUmlauts.html">AsciiValuesForUmlauts</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Modern encodings, such as <a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a>, subsume ASCII. For <a href="BackwardsCompatibility.html">BackwardsCompatibility</a>, <a href="UtfEight.html">UtfEight</a> represents the code points of ASCII using one byte.
