        Previously described <a href="InfoPosts.html">InfoPosts</a> were put forth as a means of NeighborhoodFriendlyComputingEnvironments not very long ago. This was something which was to come in the NearFuture, allowing for LoFiNetworks which in turn may be used to pass DataTokens into TheInternet through a gateway which has been configured to be a listener for such networks.

      <p>
        A new proposal is presented in this page which provides for <a href="NotSoFarOutComputing.html">NotSoFarOutComputing</a> depending on citizen or governmental communication hubs which are located close enough to one another as to provide a SolarPowered, AutonomousWirelessNetwork of enough capacity as to handle at least 100 voice and 200 text channels (higher than this if possible, lower if not - this is merely a proposal). If constructed along an interstate highway or other thoroughfare, spacing might be 600 to 1200 feet between LocalAutonomousUnits, with an accompanying WiFiUnit every 10 to 20 spacings, and a HubUnit every 10 or so WiFiUnit spacings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea has been developed from hints and notions suggested in the SeattleWirelessNetwork.

        The MessagePassingMechnism could at first be implemented with application in a SmartDevice, similar to a smart-phone, later on perhaps included in the communication hardware of such devices

      <p>
        This is a proposal <a href="NotBuiltInOneDay.html">NotBuiltInOneDay</a> .... SketchesForthcoming .... implementation on a DemonstrationScale suggested for MidToLateNextYear. (20140531-20141215).
