        Macro And Micro Rigor
      </h1>
      <p>
        There needs to be a distinction between "macro" and "micro" rigor when it comes to "evidence of superiority" debates. Macro-rigor is required to show that a tool has a <strong>net</strong> advantage in a rigorous way. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Micro-rigor can be used to prove just about <em>any</em> tool has some potential benefit in some <em>narrow</em> area. Most will probably agree with this. However, it cannot be used as a substitute for macro-rigor claims for anything non-trivial. For example, <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a> may score well in grammatical language simplicity metrics. Language simplicity is a good thing, all else being equal. But its the "all else" that ends up being the domain the macro territory (See <a href="IncompatibleGoals.html">IncompatibleGoals</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        So far, macro-rigor for just about any tool remains illusive. Measuring the total sum of bunches of micro-rigors and assigning weights to them is so far too complex and perhaps too subjective to qualify as "rigor".

        I don't get it.  What is "micro rigor" and what is "macro rigor"?  I am familiar with mathematical rigour, intellectual rigour, experimental rigour, research rigour and so forth, but the above seems to refer to none of these. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Micro rigor is specific advantages in specific areas. Macro rigor is amounting enough rigorous evidence to be able to claim with some confidence there is a "net advantage" to a tool or technology.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you define "net advantage"?
      </p>
      <p>
        [An example would be proving that hammers are better no matter what you're doing, such as polishing your television.  <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> uses this hand-waving "macro"-rigor as an excuse to feel more comfortable with allowing his mind to stagnate because nobody can prove he could be doing things better no matter how many pieces of rigorous 'micro' evidence they give him... and no matter how directly applicable this evidence is to whatever 'micro' activity he is performing at the moment, be it polishing televisions or putting nails into drywall.]
      </p>
      <p>
        If one likes Klingon decor, then the hammer-on-TV finish just may do the trick. But seriously, that's not my problem because I am not claiming rigor. If you want a working target, then focus on "blocks make programmers more productive than goto's". And as far as "doing things better", one approach is to pay attention to human psychology. --top

           There's plenty of rigour -- experimental, research, intellectual, and even mathematical -- in the area of computing that focuses on issues where <a href="PsychologyMatters.html">PsychologyMatters</a>.  It's generally called <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a>, and <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> and <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> pour significant funds into it.  While it's usually viewed as dealing with graphical interfaces, input/output devices and the like, it also encompasses programming language usability issues.  Top, I've never seen you mention it.  Why?

           <em>I have not seen anything from that which contradicts my stated views so far, I would note. You are welcome to site it as a source. --top</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        [<a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> doesn't claim rigor.  He just floats ideas like '<a href="PsychologyMatters.html">PsychologyMatters</a>' without any rigorous support at all, then complains when other people do the same.  As far as working targets go, how about "direct expression boolean values makes programmers more productive than encouraging them to construct unique <a href="RubeGoldberg.html">RubeGoldberg</a> devices in code to compute every boolean constant at runtime."]
      </p>
      <p>
        And you don't have any proof that psychology doesn't matter. That's not the default either. Welcome to the boat.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You do like <a href="ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof.html">ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof</a>, don't you?  Nobody has any responsibility for proving the opposite of your 'positive' claim.  If I said that "The Great Invisible Spaghetti Monster Matters", I'd need to prove it.  You said "<a href="PsychologyMatters.html">PsychologyMatters</a>".  YOU need to prove it.  If I said "you don't have any proof that the Great Invisible Spaghetti Monster doesn't matter" as though it is a valid counterpoint, I'd be a hand-waving fraud... or just stupid.  Since you do say "you don't have any proof that psychology doesn't matter" as though it's a valid counterpoint, that makes YOU a hand-waving fraud... or just stupid.  <a href="BurdenOfProof.html">BurdenOfProof</a> is a duty that belongs to the person making the positive claim.  Attempting to shirk that duty makes you a hand-waving fraud.  Being ignorant of that duty just makes you stupid.  Your choice: shall I assume malice or stupidity?]
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that's off the main point because I was addressing a side comment about me allegedly not wanting to improve the state of the art. There's no need to thread-mess this over the pscyho issue yet. The bigger point is that micro-rigor can probably back just about ANY position. Thus, micro-rigor will not settle anything of material.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'm of the impression that "macro"-rigor is just a bunch of your normal hand-wavy hullabaloo. Can you provide examples of "rigorous <strong>net</strong> advantage" provided by individual product components in any hard science?  If not, how can you expect anyone to accept your claims that this 'macro'-rigor is actually a valid or relevant concern for 'product components' in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> (such as languages and language features)?  Please, start providing examples.  I'll play devil's advocate.  I believe the following that only 'micro'-rigor matters at the component level, and that there is no such thing as 'macro'-rigor or 'net advantage' from specific components or language features.  I suspect that your talking about it is just nonsense you're attempting to use to justify other of your nonsense.]

        The rocket analogy that's often used provides a pretty good example because multiple factors are weighed from a wide range of perspectives such that almost anything anyone could "gripe about" is addressed. It may not be perfect rigor, but it provides a decent attempt at thoroughness, something we have not even kind-of approached with software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The rocket example you provide isn't about components, and thus makes a very poor analogy to the situations you've been raising this elsewhere because 'gotos' and 'types' and 'closures' et. al. are about 'components' of software and language design.  I asked that you provide examples of "rigorous <strong>net</strong> advantage" <strong><em>provided by individual product components</em></strong> in hard science (because if none such exists then you have no such examples to point to when you wave your hands and attempt to explain why this 'macro' rigor should exist for components in computer science).  Please pay attention to such critical modifiers, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>.]

(c) none of them properties is shown as being <strong><em>provided by individual product components</em></strong>, making invalid any attempt at analogy to the request for macro-rigor from language features and components.]

        <em>Huh?  The corresponding issues in Computing are frequently studied, with considerable rigour, in </em><a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> and <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a> research.  Your lack of knowledge of these (which surprises me -- given your views, I'd expect you to be frequently citing studies) is not a point in your favour.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Indeed they are studied, albeit <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> focuses more on methodologies and <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a> more on user interface, and as such neither really studies language features or the underlying 'product' design and so these also aren't particularly applicable to issues such as advantages of closures and other language features and product components.]  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Studying the properties of language features in terms of </em><a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> or <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a> raises fundamental research methodology issues, i.e., <strong>how</strong> do you rigorously evaluate these?  It's not for lack of desire that they're not frequently studied, but how feasible is: "Given two identical language implementations, one with closures and one without, obtain a sample population of programmers of equal ability and knowledge ..."?  Not very.  It's not impossible, of course, but the poor cost-benefit ratio of implementing such studies generally propels researchers in other directions.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [But I note that <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> would just wave his hands and call all of these proposed "'macro'-rigor" emergent rocket properties just 'apples and oranges' should they be presented <em>against</em> him in an argument: How do you measure Accuracy vs. Speed vs. Safety?  He'd also scoff and demand the "rigorous" studies that prove them better than arbitrary other rocket designs he waves his hands and invents on the fly.  It's really hard to argue 'reasonably' with someone who has different rules for himself than for others.]

      <p>
        As far as the weights, I say let the <strong>user/customer plug in the weights</strong> they want for each metric. For example, shipping water to the moon does not require as much reliability as shipping astronauts to the moon, so they may lower their weighting of that factor to save some money. The "worth" of an astronaut's life is a political/social question, not directly a scientific one. This will almost always be the case for tools. We cannot tell the customer what they should want or do with the tool, we can only tell them the nature of the trade-offs available at best. A macro-rigor model would be a framework to test and weigh the known tradeoffs as best as possible, not answer base political questions. --top

      <p>
        [If you're saying that 'macro-"rigor"' reduces to making design decisions based on predicted tradeoffs of guesstimated weights between emergent properties, then <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> already has plenty of it.]

        However, almost all <a href="HobbyHorse.html">HobbyHorse</a>/<a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> claimers conveniently <strong>avoid</strong> most of them and argue for their hammer via round-a-about and indirect reasoning.

        Further, the list lacks metrics for a key component: code/system <strong>grokkability</strong>. 
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        [I'll agree that <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> claimers avoid them.  I do not.  As a <a href="LanguageDesigner.html">LanguageDesigner</a> and someone interested in building some <a href="NewOsFeatures.html">NewOsFeatures</a>, the above list (and more) interests me greatly.  I just happen to find that some things (like <em>types</em>) are absolutely necessary to achieve most of them.  They even help with 'grokkability' when it comes to communication between services in an operating system (as they avoid the <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> associated with adding parsers and serializers to every service and other gross violations of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>).]
      </p>
      <p>
        [As far as the list lacking 'grokkability': this list lacks a great number of metrics for components that may or may not be 'key' based on how one chooses to 'weight' them.  Those listed above are just what I could think of off the top of my head, reorganized from a list provided to you months ago in <a href="AbsolutismHasGreaterBurdenOfProof.html">AbsolutismHasGreaterBurdenOfProof</a> (which has gone ignored).  It doesn't even touch on privacy, secrecy, freedom (open source), modularity (coupling/cohesion; ability to isolate changes for new features and maintenance issues to a small volume of code); other resources than time/space (laptops and robots benefit from software optimized against <em>power consumption</em>, for example), migration (ability for software to move), mobility (ability for host of software to move), etc.]  
      </p>
      <p>
        We can generally use the customer's weights as a guide to which metrics are important. If we cover most of the customer's concern, then we have a relatively high macro-rigor score.  But it is again <strong>dependant on the customer</strong>. For example, if a customer insists on a green rocket because the country's flag is green, but your technology can only produce white rockets due to frost from the cooling system, then the other factors are not the driving concerns to that customer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        [True.  Unless the customer 'insists on' a green rocket but isn't willing to pay more for it or sacrifice reliability.  Some people just want a pony.]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To simplify the debate, let's focus on a "typical" customer for now. If we wanted to put a little bit of rigor into it, we could survey the customers and get the average or median weighting of the above factors.
        </li>
        <li>
           [Typical customers want that pony.  They just know they cant get it.]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Similarly, grokkability is important to most software developers. If the customer ranks that factor as important and your metrics don't cover it, from the developer's perspective you are <em>not</em> approaching macro-rigor. (I am assuming a capitalistic system where the customer's needs make a difference rather than the kind of system were a selected group of elites dictates the tools based on their calculations or decisions.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        [You say that as if software developers were generally the customers of software.  From a <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> perspective, the only reason to support grokkability is if doing so helps keep the <strong>Cost & Time to Market</strong> down.  Often it does.  But when applied in an indirect means, it isn't a customer metric... it's more of an 'internal' metric, like 'elegance'.]
      </p>
      <p>
        That's almost like saying that house buyers should decide which tools the carpenters use.  I agree that developers often don't make the entire choice of tools. In essence, there are "layers" of customers for most tools. But either way, all layers want tools that make developers the most productive (including output volume and quality).
      </p>
      <p>
        Just to clarify, are you saying that grokkability shouldn't be listed because its too hard to measure, or because its not important?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Essentially, by arguing for 'grokkability' as a criterion, you're going back on points you've made earlier (and that I agree with) about dividing internal vs. external evidence.  Or perhaps you're just making a category error by assuming that code 'grokkability' is directly relevant to typical customers of software products.  Whether the code can be understood by a customer is only directly relevant to a customer who is expecting to directly interact with that code.  If not, then 'grokkability' is something inside a black-box application that is not important to customers, who care more about things like <strong>cost and time to market</strong> and <strong>release bugs</strong> and <strong>feature addition/ bug killing throughput</strong>.  Software engineers may care about <strong>grokkability</strong> and <strong>simplicity</strong> and <strong></strong><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a><strong> and </strong>type safety<strong> and </strong>elegance<strong> and </strong>purity<strong> insofar as they have proven useful in achieving these things.  But these are indirect.  YOU, by presenting 'grokkability' as a criterion, are the person who is arguing that house buyers should decide which tools the carpenters use.]</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would argue that syntactic grokkability, regardless of its measurability (it's usually intuitive, obvious, or of insufficient distinction between one tool and another to be worthy of debate), is important.  For example, assembly language is far less syntactically grokkable than an equivalent C program, as the intent of the program must be laboriously divined from individual assembly statements.  Therefore, for a given arbitrary project that does not explicitly require assembly language, it makes sense to choose C (or whatever) over assembly, all other considerations being equal.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        [For <a href="LanguageDesigner.html">LanguageDesigner</a>s, whose customers are programmers, grokkability is really important.  For Software Engineers who are representing customers that are not expected to interact with the code, it is not so important... except indirectly, insofar as this syntactic grokkability impacts the introduction of bugs and errors or time to market.  They might choose C over assembly for portability, because it is easier to write, because it supports limited type-safety, or for any number of other reasons.  For Human Resource people, all that matters is that people with the right skills exist to understand the code... independently of how easy it is to learn the language; their customer is the Program Manager.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Conceptual grokkability, however, is a different case.  Among skilled and educated developers, understanding of abstract high-level conceptual mechanisms like lambdas, closures, object orientation, etc., is generally a given and can be disregarded.  Programmers who cannot grasp these are generally reflective of a lack of appropriate skills or ability to appreciate abstractions, rather than an inherent grokkability issue.  Programmers lacking the requisite skills and ability are a problem no matter what -- even when the project doesn't necessarily warrant such skills.</em>

        Perhaps being productive with the existing pool of talent should also be considered. But in my opinion the proponents of closures etc. have made a poor case for them as significant improvers and they are often dismissed as <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>. Lack of realistic examples is probably the biggest problem. They often use very indirect reasoning or toy lab examples to illustrate their alleged power. That won't work. Practitioners will reject those. Maybe us practitioners are just "too dumb to get it" and will have to live with our Neanderthal techniques. But my opinion is that they are just bullshitting; trying to justify their research grants. If it was real, then they'd be able to produce quality examples and scenarios instead of excuses. Real-world-like scenarios and examples are a powerful tool against bullshitters. True, its not a perfect tool, but one of the better ones for such a job. --top

        <em>I use closures only as an example, not a case.  However, I think you unfairly deprecate the ability of most practitioners to appreciate the value of high-level mechanisms.

        I think your statement that CRUD-based applications are inherently "simple" is false. But if you are claiming that certain techniques embed certain features into base tools such that application-level developers don't really need to use those features to gain a significant advantages, then we are perhaps in agreement. "Certain techniques help certain niches more than others". I don't have to implement B-trees because Oracle did it for me and packaged it behind a query language, for example.

        <em>I didn't mean to imply that all CRUD-based applications are inherently "simple".  They aren't, as we both know.

I only meant that those CRUD-based applications which happen to be simple may not benefit from certain high-level programming facilities.  However, given your agreement, I'm curious:  Why do you debate against OO, closures, and whatever else at all?  If it's clear that you're not talking about systems programming, and you don't do systems programming, then why are you arguing against the choices of those who are clearly doing systems programming?  It strikes me, therefore, that you're arguing against experts from a position of ignorance.</em>

        I should note that in the future, this may change somewhat. For example, if I was going to implement a web browser, I might be tempted to use a database in place of DOM. The main reason such is not done now is for performance-related issues. But maybe 20 years from now the hardware will be up to snuff such that one could get away with it and produce a very nice browser. C is often used where assembler would have been used in the past for systems software and embedded systems. Thus, we already see a form of this.

      <p>
        I don't believe in <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>s, but <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a>s have existed aplenty in the past and I believe more will exist in the future (the author of <a href="NoSilverBullet.html">NoSilverBullet</a> claims that most <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> has been taken care of by existing language features.  I don't believe the guy.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider <strong>grokkability.</strong>  Measuring that isn't particularly easy.  A few possible pseudometrics:  At the software level, examining <strong></strong><a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a><strong> vs. </strong><a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a><strong> code volume ratios might be a start (including, for example, all parsing and translation just to interface with other software as 'accidental complexity' of communication).  At the language level, one can also examine </strong>syntactic noise<strong> (syntax with no meaning), </strong>semantic noise<strong> (semantics that don't directly represent programmer intention), and even use of </strong>context<strong> (degree to which code fragments can or cannot be understood in isolation; global variables, coupling into other components or modules (</strong><a href="CouplingAndCohesion.html">CouplingAndCohesion</a>), and of course context sensitive grammars can all affect ability to understand (and therefore construct or maintain) a piece of code in isolation).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SimplySimplistic.html">SimplySimplistic</a> things may increase perceived simplicity when they are examined in isolation, but tend to increase <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> in everything that uses them.   Based on past conversations, I feel you focus too much on the 'simplicity' of one format in isolation (e.g. <a href="FlirtDataTextFormat.html">FlirtDataTextFormat</a>) that you forget to examine how it fits in and inflicts costs upon the rest of the system.  After concluding the thing is 'simple', you make accolades for it about the value of grokkability and forget to ever examine whether it actually made things easier on you.  When you come along later and start saying complex tree-types ought to be broken down <em>in order to make them easier to represent in </em><a href="FlirtDataTextFormat.html">FlirtDataTextFormat</a><em>, I say you've got everything backwards: you're inflicting massive extra complexities in both the Database and on the Application just to maintain a simpler communications format.  I can't offer statistics, but I can say that a significant chunk of all </em><a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> in programs today has to do with parsing, translating, and serializing communications (be it from a GUI or a relational database).
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe <a href="StrongTyping.html">StrongTyping</a> (even if it is <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>, though I favor <a href="SoftTyping.html">SoftTyping</a>) is a much better decision than 'type-free' or 'type-light' for reducing <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> and thereby improving <strong>system</strong> grokkability (making a tradeoff of communications data-format simplicity).  <a href="StrongTyping.html">StrongTyping</a> for communications between services immediately avoids the need to perform complex parsing and serializing efforts, leaving only translation.  Much of the time even translation can be made easy via defining conversions between types as a <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> effort (and this can be done <em>implicitly</em> with <a href="SoftTyping.html">SoftTyping</a> or <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>, avoiding language clutter or coupling).  Even easier is defining automated conversions between values of the same 'type' with differing representations, since one can simply use a high-level defined encodec/decodec that can be passed made accessible via a URI.
      </p>
      <p>
        It just so happens that <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a> (defined not so much in terms of types as a guarantee that no 'undefined' operations occur) is also critical for security (in the sense that you cannot analyze security if your system does undefined things).  And it happens to be extremely useful for performance optimizations (thus reducing the <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> of performing many powerful optimizations).
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, individual services can be cut down to performing just <em>essential</em> communications and calculations.  However, such things as optimizations and concurrency and modularity and communications management still introduce yet more <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> that better language design can fix.  Use of types takes care of one big chunk, but there are plenty of others left.  There are plenty of <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a>s for those who look... not all of them apply to all situations, but many of them apply to reasonably large domains desiring a variety of common features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Examples with specific </em><a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a>s and/or domains would be helpful to illustrate your points. I disagree with most of the claims about strong typing. However, this may not be the appropriate topic to get into such details. May I suggest ExamplesOfStrongTypingImprovingDeveloperProductivity.<em></em>

        Such examples have been offered to you many times before (e.g. in <a href="CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing.html">CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing</a>).  It has never stuck before, and I doubt it would stick if I tried again.  Part of the problem, I think, is that whenever it comes to a subject you have a strong opinion on (like types), you fail to keep non-functional but still important requirements in your head due to all the rage you feel.  Real productivity must be measured in terms of getting the features correct while <em>also</em> maintaining or improving performance characteristics, reliability, and various other NFR properties.  E.g. you make it clear that you're willing to sacrifice performance, sacrifice ease of writing comparisons between matrices or tree-values (or even dates) in relational, sacrifice <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> and grokkability of the code the <em>customers</em> write, and on and on... just to be rid of extra complexities <em>inside</em> the DBMS and ODBC libraries in the form of supporting or sharing datatypes or complex values.  Examples of this can be found in <a href="DoesRelationalRequireTypes.html">DoesRelationalRequireTypes</a> and <a href="CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing.html">CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing</a>.

It don't dispute dynamic techniques makes comparisons a little more verbose, but I'm weighing the whole shebang, and dynamism wins net. Comparisons need a lot of local tuning anyhow, such as case conversion and space trimming. If we provide abstractions to simplify those, we can put base-type issues into it also with little loss in total net verbosity. Plus, different databases are often inconsistent in their typing anyhow such that we have to translate as needed. We cannot control the world, but can deal with it locally for local needs. Note that many others favor dynamic languages also. You cannot claim I am a loner on that one. Your implication is that us dynamers are dumb or naive.

           [I'm sure the tree example can be trivially extrapolated to a number of practical scenarios, but one that comes immediately to mind is storing pre-existing HTML documents, with the facility to easily extract relevant document components (e.g., document header, title, document body, meta-tags, etc.), while being able to detect duplicates -- as one often needs to do when the same documents are referenced by multiple URLs (hence, the URL itself is not suitable as a primary key).  Another example might be storing static source-code snippets, whilst being able to trivially query for relevant elements of the code and (again) detect duplicates. However, I would argue that even simple, well-known, commonly-used examples like complex numbers, times, dates, geometric shapes (often used to represent product dimensions, e.g., windows, doors, storage tanks, roof supports, etc.), and geographical locations are sufficient justification for proper user-defined type support in DBMSes and application languages.  It's been amply shown on <a href="CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing.html">CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing</a> (and, no doubt, elsewhere) that support for user-defined types results in simpler, clearer, and less-duplicated code than the equivalent without it.]

        <em>I suppose you could argue that if a rocket is tested on every planet except Uranus, then one is safe to extrapolate it to Uranus because Uranus is not different enough from the other planets to assume there would be sufficient unknown or untested factors or conditions. But there are two problems with this. First, you haven't presented any evidence that you've tested a wide enough variety of domains to be equivalent to 7 planets. Second, they are probably different enough that the analogy does not apply. For example, CBA is one of the heaviest users of databases, which are an integral part of (good) CBA, but much less so in other domains. (I suppose you could argue that databases are not needed, but for at least the medium term, businesses will continue to store most of their data on them even if you proved your magic bullet can replace them.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A large part of CBA being the heavy database user is, I am certain, because businesses have a lot of money and a lot of forms and thus drive the databases to meet their needs (which largely means strings and dates and counts and currency).  But there is no small part of it because current RDBMS's <em>suck</em> for systems and science domains, driving them to other solutions.  They will, likely, continue to do so until they effectively (without sacrificing too many important NFRs) support a wider variety of types and features.  If you wish to avoid <a href="LanguageIdiomClutter.html">LanguageIdiomClutter</a>, the right solution to this is a generic one: to find a feature that can be used to effectively produce the necessary domain features.  Also, if you wish to promote sharing or common solutions across RDBMSs, you'll need to embed this in a standard DML itself rather than rely too heavily on embedding procedures and triggers and modules written in some other language.  One known generic solution to these problems is support for types and complex values.

        That is not a trick or excuse.

I simply operate under the premises that CBA is pretty well covered under existing RDBMSs (because CBA is where the majority of the money came from to develop existing systems) and that to enable data-driven design in other fields the RDBMS shouldn't be domain-specific (are you arguing this point?).  These logically lead to the conclusion that my tool doesn't <em>need</em> to prove <em>better than</em> existing systems for CBA; it only needs to be no worse for CBA and better for other fields... such as <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a>. <em>If</em> the solution would somehow provide a tangible benefit for CBA as well, that's just icing on the cake.

           <em>"Shouldn't be" and "is" are too different things. Existing RDBMS generally don't allow user-defined types and functions. Thus, they tend to be shunned by other niches meaning that stuff done in the DB is instead hand-programmed in such niches.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           True.  What should be and what is are two different things, maybe even "too different" as say you.  That said, progress is measured in slow plodding steps from "is" to "should be".  Other 'niches' shun the DBMS because it doesn't do what they require of it.  That should be changed.

        [Indeed.  Having extensively developed both systems software and custom business applications, I cannot envision any situation where an added advantage to one would be a disadvantage to the other.  I suspect that most improvements applicable to either could be a benefit to both; in fact, I see no reason to treat custom business applications and systems software as distinct, except to add clarity to the viewpoints and priorities that operate in some of these debates.  Ultimately, software development is software development, regardless of the domain.  The same issues apply to all programming, though some may be weighted more highly in one domain than another.  However, if you don't like (for example), user-defined type support in your DBMS, or object-oriented programming, or closures, then feel free not to use them.  That doesn't mean they're inherently bad, especially for those working in other domains (or even the same one) who clearly think they're good.]
