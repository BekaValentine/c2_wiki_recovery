        Having read the referenced articles, I agree with the comments that another name needs to be chosen, one that will give the <strong></strong><a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a><strong> some pride in the title.  A </strong><a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a>-esque attempt is <strong></strong>NoneShallPass<strong>, along the lines of the Horatius suggestion, but with more humor to the sometimes arbitrary nature of the demands.  I like the metaphor of holding back the chaos so that others can progress, so I'd suggest other names from the history of war - like the stand at Thermopylae. --</strong><a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        A good classical name would be <strong>Protesilaus</strong>, one of the warriors at Troy.  It was fated the first off the ships would be the first to die, but he led the charge anyways.
