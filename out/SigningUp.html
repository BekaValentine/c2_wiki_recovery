        Signing Up
      </h1>
      <p>
        As described in <a href="TheSoulOfaNewMachine.html">TheSoulOfaNewMachine</a>, the act of a member of a team making an informal but significant commitment to the successful completion of a major project. 
      </p>
      <p>
        From the book:  <em>By signing up for the project you agreed to do whatever was necessary for success.  You agreed to forsake, if necessary, family, hobbies, and friends - if you had any of these left (and you might not if you had signed up too many times before).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps an extreme form of "owning" a task.
