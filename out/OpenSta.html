        OpenSTA (Open System Testing Architecture)
      </p>
      <p>
        A distributed software testing architecture based on CORBA. OpenSTA is designed to be used by Performance Testing Consultants or other technically proficient individuals. Using OpenSTA a user can generate realistic heavy loads simulating the activity of hundreds to thousands of virtual users. This capability is fully realized through OpenSTA's distributed testing architecture.
        ABC..
        OpenSTA graphs both virtual user response times and resource utilization information from all Web Servers, Application Servers, Database Servers and Operating Platforms under test, so that precise performance measurements can be gathered during load tests and analysis on these measurements can be performed.

        Has anyone used this? I'm going to "pair evaluate" it on Monday. It looks a lot more complicated than <a href="HttpUnit.html">HttpUnit</a>. On the other hand, it works along with Internet Explore to record tests. It also does load testing and makes graphs.

        Used it for some performance testing once. Never again. It only works on Windows. There's no central console so that you can centrally trigger tests that are going to happen from various clients. The most aggravating 'feature' was the instability when you run it with more than about 30 virtual users. The damn thing would crash. So we couldn't simulate large numbers of users or run tests overnight since if it crashed halfway then our results would be worthless. Then there's the lack of an easy way to actually get hold of the raw test results.

        But it's not all bad. The GUI is clear and easy to understand/learn. However it's far too crude, unstable and limited a testing tool despite the provision of a VB style programming language for creating your tests.

        I'd recommend something like <a href="TheGrinder.html">TheGrinder</a> or the apache group's <a href="JavaMeter.html">JavaMeter</a> for anyone who is serious about performance testing.--<a href="AdewaleOshineye.html">AdewaleOshineye</a>

        We used it with no such problems, with 100 virtual users. It performed reliably and we were able to repeat the tests numerous times as we tuned the web site back-end to get improving results. I don't think our tests lasted more than 3 hours, though, and we found its capabilities to disperse the user actions in time somewhat limited. However it did a great job. --<a href="NikolaToshev.html">NikolaToshev</a>

        I used OpenSTA on a recent project.  Version 1.4.1 is very stable.  I was impressed by the feature set and scalability of the tool.  I was able to simulate 1600 users per machine (650 MHz, 256 meg ram, 100 megabit ethernet) with no problems.  Contrary to the previous posts, OpenSTA uses a CORBA based method to run distributed tests using several machines as load injeccting agents, with one acting as a central console.  And as for comparisons with JMeter and Grinder, OpenSTA blows both away hands down in every way (except for the fact that OpenSTA is not portable to other OS's).  It also has very nice reporting and graphing features built in.  It uses a scripting language named SCL.  While pretty limited in features, its very easy to learn and does enough to get pretty complex stuff done.  I would highly reccomend this tool to anyone serious about performance and load testing of web applications and web services.

        I'd like to point out that I used <a href="OpenSta.html">OpenSta</a> over a year ago (in 2002) and it may have improved significantly since then. Based on the reports above by Nikola and Corey I'm willing to try it out again at some point in the future. If so I'll provide a write-up.--<a href="AdewaleOshineye.html">AdewaleOshineye</a>

        How does this tool compair to something like LoadRunner 7.51?

        Scott Barber, a respected expert in performance testing, recently recommended OpenSTA as the best Open Source tool for load testing web applications.

        He made this statement in an interview with whatistesting.com <a href="http://www.whatistesting.com/interviews/sbarber.htm">http://www.whatistesting.com/interviews/sbarber.htm</a>
      </p>

        I have been an active user and contributor (like Corey above) and have used it to load test high-value bespoke web-applications... There are a few kinks to iron out in OpenSTA but the only way to do this is by contributing to the project.
