        Absence Of Forces
      </h1>
      <p>
        What causes it . . . . Lack of form? Content neglect? Incompetence? Absence of progress? Lack of proactivity?

        Is it lack of form or a different form?  In <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a> we've been using a form very close to the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> form. It doesn't lend itself well to a straight discussion of the forces. The forces end up being spread throughout the pattern - you bring up some in the motivation section, and you often discuss some in the applicability and consequences sections. Is this a problem, or just a different way of doing things? Are there any rules in the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> form for making sure that forces are addressed? Anyone care to comment? -- <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>

        I think it is a problem. I heard one of the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> (John, I think, but I may be wrong) say that absence of explicit forces was a boo boo and would be the main thing to change in the book if they could do it again. If you are copying their form, I vote that you add forces explicitly. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Perhaps <a href="AbsenceOfForces.html">AbsenceOfForces</a> is an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. Either way, in <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a>, I'm game for rebelling against conforming to one format and adding forces as we come up with them.  If they're redundant, that's fine for now. I personally like forces and think it is a problem if not being explicit about them makes it more difficult for the PatternReader to understand it. -- <a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a>
