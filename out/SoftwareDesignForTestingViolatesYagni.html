        Isn't this a violation of <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>? How do I know I are gonna need testing but I aren't gonna need features? <a href="HaHaOnlySerious.html">HaHaOnlySerious</a> --<a href="JohnFarrell.html">JohnFarrell</a>

        That would be the case if your designed your software in anticipation of <em>adding tests later</em>. <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> (because you aren't gonna do it). Better write the test in anticipation of having to write production code later - that's one thing you know for sure you'll be doing.
