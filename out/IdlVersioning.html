        Idl Versioning
      </h1>
      <p>
        In some companies, services are provided via CORBA (<a href="CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture.html">CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture</a>). They are specified as IDL interfaces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now these services evolve, sometimes even in a way that breaks backward compatibility. In a big comany you don't always know all clients of a service, so you don't want those clients to break just because you've changed the service. What do you do?

        In 1993, Sun published a research paper on that subject (<a href="http://research.sun.com/techrep/1993/smli_tr-93-21.pdf).">http://research.sun.com/techrep/1993/smli_tr-93-21.pdf).</a> I work in a company that follows the recommendations in this paper, and I'm having some problems with that scheme. Particularly, the "minor version" concept is awkward and useless, I believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I wonder: What are current solutions to that problem? Surely, somebody must have come up with something usable in the past nine years? What about <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> etc.?
