        Ward Cunningham, the originator of the <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a>, has been interviewed and is mentioned along with his book in an article in <em>PC Magazine</em>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Article: "What's a Wiki?" By Sebaastian Rupley in the May 9th issue, 2003.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1071705,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,4149,1071705,00.asp</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

           Ward mentions an important feature of wikis: Fragility
          <ul>
            <li>
               "articles added to a wiki are at the editorial mercy of the wiki's other participants"
            </li>
            <li>
               The article says: "The positive spin on the fragility of a wiki though, is that any flames or spam can be immediately removed so that wikis imbue good participants with a kind of survival-of-the-fittest power. "You need to generate real content," says one wiki source on the Web. "Anything else will be removed. So anyone can play, but only good players last."
