        You need to persist some data, so you need <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a>, so you need a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>, so you need a server to run it on, so you need to install an appropriate <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> on that server, so you need to back up the data on it, so you need to run down to the store to buy media, so you need to put gas in the car, so you need to find your wallet, so if you're lucky you'll be able to save that format flag sometime next week.
