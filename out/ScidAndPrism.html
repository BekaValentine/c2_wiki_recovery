        Scid And Prism
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SourceCodeInDatabase.html">SourceCodeInDatabase</a> and the <a href="PrismProject.html">PrismProject</a> are projects which seem to be similar to Mozart and Xroma to some extent. At first glance, Prism seems to be very low-level and formal (defining even bits and bytes), while SCID seems to focus mostly on the UI aspects. Neither have moved into implementation at this time.
