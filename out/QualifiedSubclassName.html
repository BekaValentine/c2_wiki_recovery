        Qualified Subclass Name
      </h1>
      <p>
        Subclasses are somehow different from their superclasses.  Use adjective prefixes to a <a href="SimpleSuperclassName.html">SimpleSuperclassName</a> to reveal differentiation.  Compound noun phrases can be used as well.  This leads the reader to an understanding of the purpose of the class.  For instance, Task is a good name for a superclass.  Connectable_Task is a phrase name which can be used for a subclass.  The name provides context information, e.g,  it is Connectable, it is a Task.  However, this can become unwieldy in deep hierarchies.  On the positive side, it can give you some feedback about the depth of your hierarchies.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are about to subclass with a <a href="QualifiedSubclassName.html">QualifiedSubclassName</a> it is probably also a good time to consider whether you should be subclassing or just adding that new capability to the superclass.

        You don't have to name a subclass after its immediate superclass. You want to communicate two things with a subclass name- what it's like and how it's different. Therefore, if I am inheriting for implementation purposes down in the Task hierarchy, I don't mind just calling it ConnectableTask.
