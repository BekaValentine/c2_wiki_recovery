        Database Domains For Numbers
      </h1>
      <p>
        Numbers may be used to represent data in very different contexts. If those contexts are not clarified their use may become confusing (the same way that None, Null and Zero can be confused). Examples:
      </p>
      <p>
        Numbers for OrdinalScaleData: 
        In this scale type, the numbers assigned to objects or events represent the rank order (1st, 2nd, 3rd etc.) of the entities assessed. An example of ordinal measurement is the <em>results of a horse race</em>, which say only which horses arrived <em>first</em>, <em>second</em>, <em>third</em>, etc., if we use a number field in a database to represent this, when a horse gets injured at the middle of the race and never reaches the end: What <strong>number</strong> do we use for that? Note that using Zero may lead to inconsistencies:does Zero mean that it arrived before the first? (if we sort by that column that might well be the answer) or does it mean that it did not arrive?. Also note that <strong></strong><a href="SqlNull.html">SqlNull</a><strong> (Unknown) would </strong>not<strong> be accurate: we do </strong>know<strong> that the horse did not end the race, so we are </strong>not<strong> dealing with </strong>unknowns<strong> here, what we want to represent is the </strong>known fact<strong> that the horse did </strong>not<strong> end the race. So maybe "</strong>None<strong>" is a better match? Or maybe an special "</strong>OrdinalZero"? or "OrdinalNone"?
      </p>
      <p>
        Numbers for IntervalScaleData
        An interval scale is a scale of measurement where the distance between any two adjacent units of measurement (or 'intervals') is the same but the zero point is arbitrary. Scores on an interval scale can be added and subtracted but can not be meaningfully multiplied or divided. The formal mathematical term is an AffineSpace (in this case an AffineLine). Variables measured at the interval level are called "interval variables" or sometimes "scaled variables" as they have units of measurement. A highly familiar example of interval scale measurement is temperature with the Celsius scale. In this particular scale, the unit of measurement is 1/100 of the difference between the melting temperature and the boiling temperature of water at atmospheric pressure. It makes no sense to multiply 2°C * 8°C. Another example is Gregorian calendar years. (And it also makes no sense to multiply them: year 1999 * year 2000 = ¿what does the answer mean? ). But we generally see this implemented as plain "Integers" in typical PseudoRelationalDatabase<strong>'s. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Numbers for RatioScaleData:Most measurement in the physical sciences and engineering is done on ratio scales. Mass, length, time, plane angle, energy and electric charge are examples of physical measures that are ratio scales.Informally, the distinguishing feature of a ratio scale is the possession of a non-arbitrary zero value. For example, the Kelvin  temperature scale.

        <strong>No need here for new inventions</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the horse race example, the most practical approach would be to use null for non-finishers, but have a separate "status" column that would indicate the status of a given horse for a given race such as: "finished", "injured not-finished", "injured finished", "disqualified", "jockey didn't show", "other, see booth", etc. There's no need to invent custom nulls or custom types. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on display room, it may be a dedicated column or a footnote letter on the result card or reports. But notice that it's the status of the race, not <strong>just</strong> the rank. Thus, associating it with just the rank value is perhaps a poor association approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, with a "status" column, it's easier to make/reuse a CRUD editor so that administrators etc. can add or change status information (perhaps in a <a href="ConstantTable.html">ConstantTable</a> if we don't need other attributes). Custom complex types would generally require a programmer visit to make changes to the status info if it's part of a "type". It may be good job security for you, but customers don't like that. Your "type" is morphing into a mini database, but without out-of-box database abilities and tools (<a href="GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as the year multiplication example, I have multiplied date elements in the past to create a hash for security or file re-distribution. If we create a custom type that forbids certain operations, then such uses may be made more difficult. I'd instead suggest a "warning system" rather than hard rejection of suspect uses if you want to go the "protection" route.  We've learned from elements such as Java's "final" indicator that original authors are often not very good at anticipating future uses.

        <em>"Further, with a 'status' column, it's easier to make/reuse a CRUD editor so that administrators etc. can add or change status information ..."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Interesting you mention that, because something I've been experimenting with in the </em><a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> is the ability for clients to automatically download type definitions from the database and automatically generate client-side user interfaces (UIs) to edit type values.  This is possible because every user-defined type definition -- no matter how complex -- describes a directed graph of types where nodes of outdegree = 0 are primitive, built-in types.  Thus, it appears to be possible to automatically create a client-side UI editor to manipulate values of any type.  To test the basic idea, some time ago I successfully created a <a href="NakedObjects.html">NakedObjects</a>-like environment for Java, which used Java reflection to allow a user to instantiate arbitrary Java class instances and manipulate the instances with appropriate textboxes, etc., automatically displayed for every primitive property.  I employed it in an experimental general-purpose <a href="GraphicalProgrammingLanguage.html">GraphicalProgrammingLanguage</a> called Tomato.  See <a href="http://tomatoide.sourceforge.net/''">http://tomatoide.sourceforge.net/''</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thus, support for complex types permits a considerably higher degree of automated UI generation than is possible in an environment having only discrete primitive types, because a type inherently defines a grouping of primitive attributes.  Only having discrete primitive types means the developer is forced to describe such groups every UI "form" or dialogue box where they are used.  For example, you would need to explicitly code the fact that your 'Status' attribute is related to your 'HorseRaceResult' attribute every time the two are used in a UI form.  With a single type definition that includes both attributes, their relationship is implicit in the type definition and automatically can apply to every UI element that references it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As you probably expect, I'm going to call <a href="GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a> on that one. One can use a database to group and manage base/primitive types also. It may be more flexible because it's less subject to encapsulation rules typical of types. For example, the original design above tightly couples the placement (race rank) with the "status". If later we want to decouple it and make it associated with the general horse-per-race row rather than just placement, it's merely a matter of foreign keys (and possibly constraints) if done the DB-centric way, and possibly no schema change at all. As I've said before, RDB's generally make better "relativity engines" than types and object because of the "soft" nesting, or rather, <strong>reference-based associations</strong> instead of encapsulation. If this trades in protection for flexibility, so be it. In domains where I hang out, flexibility is more important. (I'm not sure it does trade, but am preparing for that claim.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The domains where you hang out are ERP related, are they not?  Working on ERP systems can lead you to believe the entire IT world needs only INTEGER and CHAR, and to a lesser degree DATE, TIME, REAL, MONEY and BOOLEAN types.  Outside of ERP -- such as numerical computing, geography, games, simulations, engineering, financial management, and medical informatics, to name just a few -- those canonical types are still popular, but the need for rich user-defined type support becomes significant.  Yes, you can define COMPLEX, POLYNOMAL, TEMPERATURE, BINARY_TREE, GEOGRAPHICAL_COORDINATE, INFINITE_PRECISION_REAL, DNA_STRAND, MEDICATION_FREQUENCY, and innumerable user-defined types via database schemas and user-defined procedures tied to specific schemas, but the work this requires is laborious, tedious and error-prone compared to using user-defined types.  The reason for this is simple:  A complex type defined via a database schema requires either that (a) type operations be repeated in every query, or (b) they must be defined in procedure definitions tied specifically to a given schema or schema structure.  With proper support for complex types, type definitions do not depend on any database schema, operators are specified </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> in the type definition, and values of complex types can be manipulated as easily as primitive canonical types like INTEGER and CHAR.  Support for providing multiple views of a given value is explicitly available in certain type systems.  For example, <a href="DateAndDarwensTypeSystem.html">DateAndDarwensTypeSystem</a> provides POSSREPs; i.e., multiple possible representations for a given type.<em></em>

           I didn't come here to get yet another sales pitch for Rel. Let me ask this, why should race status be tied to rank (finish placement) in the first place? It's a conceptual modifier of the horse_at_race entity, not rank.

I presumed you were referring to Rel or some component thereof, such as </em><a href="DateAndDarwensTypeSystem.html">DateAndDarwensTypeSystem</a>, that in fact does exist.  Race status should be tied to rank because they are inseparable aspects of a horse race result, i.e., we must always consider race status along with rank when examining the result of a race.<em></em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't want to get into an argument about what it should be called. From a practical perspective, it belongs with the entity, not rank, for both future-proofing and to avoid duplication.  Otherwise, you may have to repeat the "status" list for say finish_time also. And it's not unexpected that one may query by race status. Why should one have to chop open rank to find that? And conceptually it is the status of the race for that horse, NOT just rank. It is a fact about the race, not about (just) the rank. That they may be interrelated, sure, but that's life. <a href="LifeIsaBigMessyGraph.html">LifeIsaBigMessyGraph</a>. It's true that rank and finish_time "types" may reference a status, but the status is still on the row, and that's arguably an overly-complicated schema/type design.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Fine.  Feel free not to implement it as a type.  Feel free to implement an INTEGER as eight individual boolean 'bit' columns, too. :-)  By the way, you do not have to "chop open rank" to query on the rank component of a HORSE_RACE_RESULT, and I presume the example was intended only to be illustrative of a particular flavour of type, rather than be a real-world example of best practice in creating gambling applications.  As such, a single HORSE_RACE_RESULT type is probably not the best justification for user-defined types in databases.  On the other hand, it's not a bad example for illustration purposes, but a far stronger justification comes from types like COMPLEX, GEOGRAPHICAL_COORDINATE, TIME, DATE, MONEY, TEMPERATURE, VELOCITY, POLYNOMIAL, and so on.  Oh, and INTEGER, CHAR, REAL, and so on.  The canonical built-in types are also an argument for types in databases.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The most important part of that is "Admittedly, a HORSE_RACE_RESULT type is not the strongest justification for user-defined types in databases". So at least in this case, the current "Null" approach is a sufficient approach. It may not make everybody happy, but is arguably one of the top candidates for design choice and a decent reason to have a standard "Null" (at least if we use a "wide" table design). -t

           <em>Absolutely not.  Use of NULLs is unconditionally dire.  Do </em>'not<strong> misinterpret what I wrote.

           No. You still haven't demonstrated it's net better than a dedicated status column for the horsey scenario. You haven't demonstrated a real need for a complex type here. For one, using schemas instead of complex types makes it easier to share info among existing tools because I don't have to write adapter accesors, as discussed already. Second, status-ness and race rank are two mostly different conceptual ideas, as already described above. You over-coupled them. -t

           Let's work on specifics first if possible; for macro-rigor is a big project. Could you provide a few scenarios under which the type-centric approach would shine compared to a schema-centric one for the horse-race example? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Further, while automatic CRUD form generation is a nice idea, in practice one tends to need different groupings and representations for different situations. The <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a> reigns supreme in CRUD design. Thus, "soft" groupings are the better route in my experience. Type- and OO-centric groupings tend to be inappropriately "hard" (overly-coupled). --top

        <em>That may be true for schemas; it is not true for types.  An INTEGER will always be edited as an INTEGER.  If it should not be edited as an INTEGER, it is a different type (or at least an INTEGER with multiple POSSREPs; see above).  This applies analogously to complex types.</em>

        I’m bothered by the idea that the needs of one specific user out of many may dictate a total change in design. But, the devil’s in the details, and I will only comment on a case-by-case basis.

        Let me see if I can flesh this out a bit.  Suppose a system uses an integer ID (key). The system is a bit old and unfortunately uses domain info embedded in the ID, such as the first 3 digits representing the originating office location. If there is a mess-up in the location, then one may have to edit the key in a string-like way. Thus, "An INTEGER will always be edited as an INTEGER" may not always hold.

        From a Statistics perspective we an see that not all the statistic operations can be applied to all of them.

        I can appreciate that concern, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. I'd really like to out-of-box support for "types" as a mini-databases. For example: relations as <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> column values, useful for describing complex graph values. <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a> seems to aim in this direction, and has repeatedly been a topic of interest to the author of <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>.

        <em>When you talk about "mini-databases", then it begins to sound like hard-nesting (database inside a database).

      <p>
        Using "thin" entities as custom types can lead to almost the same thing; it’s just a matter of perspective and syntactic conveniences. However, either you have encapsulation or don’t have encapsulation. I don’t see any middle ground. If I can query the sub-elements with the same language/system that I query traditional entities, then it’s not a true ADT. This conflict has never been resolved.

           You confuse (or perhaps conflate) Encapsulation with <a href="InformationHiding.html">InformationHiding</a>. In an OOP context, the two are often conflated, so the error is understandable.

        [The internal representation of a type can be anything.  There may well be particular type values that benefit from being represented in relations, sets, arrays, and so forth.  However, that is not relevant.  The important thing is a type's operations.  A type is defined in terms of its operations, not its internal representation.  The internal representation is for the convenience of the implementor and to achieve certain performance minima vis a vis the operations; it is of no consequence to the type user.]
      </p>
      <p>
        But you are risking paralysis-via-label here. We may initially call it a "type" and define it by behavior, but later decide we need to do database operations on the "data" aspects of types and start treating some of them like an entity. Usage and needs change over time, at least in my domain. To <strong>keep info flexible</strong>, it should be easy to make it accessible to the regular query system if and when such a need comes along. Even if we don't end up with a domain need, query-ability makes a handy debugging tool. A behavior-centric view of info inherently conflicts with a value-centric view. Your type approach is creating a behavior-value-impedance-mismatch, such as conversion <a href="DiscontinuitySpike.html">DiscontinuitySpike</a>s when we decide we want to x-ray or change the guts of "types". And I haven't seen that the value-centric view inherently creates <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> violations, as you appeared to claim. Just store the "operation" info at one spot and reference it instead of copy.

        [As I asked before, your domain is essentially ERP, isn't it?  The specific set of canonical database types we're used to owe much to the traditional prevalance of database systems and the data type values they needed to capture in the ERP domain.  Thus, the push for invariant, complex, user-defined types is probably weaker there than in any other domain.  The canonical set appear to be sufficient for the vast majority of ERP purposes because, in fact, they were intended to be sufficient for all ERP purposes.]

      <p>
        [As for <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> violations, we've shown elsewhere that even for a simple "complex" type like a GEOGRAPHICAL_COORDINATE, without appropriate user-defined type support, you're forced either to create procedures that make assumptions about schema structure, or you must repeat GEOGRAPHICAL_COORDINATE operations in <em>every</em> query that manipulates GEOGRAPHICAL_COORDINATEs.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Making assumptions about the schema is an <strong>acceptable trade-off</strong> in my opinion to obtain typish-to-DBish swappable viewpoints. As usual, I'll place flexibility over "protection", at least in my domain. I know this rubs against your compiler-centric approach to everything. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        [If you feel a need for "typeish-to-DBish swappable viewpoints" -- which I take to mean support for multiple user-view presentations of a value's internal representation, something that is already supported in some type systems -- there is nothing that precludes providing POSSREPs, on a type-by-type basis, to support them.  However, I'd like to see a case that justifies representing, say, a GEOGRAPHICAL_COORDINATE as a table.  I suppose a character string type could represent a string as an ordered table of characters, but outside of being a technical curiosity and (perhaps) an interesting academic exercise, I don't see any practical benefit to providing such a view, nor can I see how using relational operators on such a representation would be superior to the canonical string manipulation operators.]

        Geographical info can get quite complex. For example, the "state plane" system is generally considered more accurate than lat/long, partly because it's semi-independent from tectonic drift. However, it requires more info to encode, such as the "plane ID". But this is kind of getting away from the point. Functions or operators can "wrap" the guts of data implementation regardless whether it's multiple columns, encoded strings, or sets of tables. The trick is integrating this with the database engine, query language, and app languages. Custom types are generally more difficult to share across such boundaries that base types. The Rel "solution" appears to be a <a href="GodLanguage.html">GodLanguage</a> to reduce the need to share, at the expense of tool mix-and-match.
      </p>
      <p>

        Only if the recipient can digest it. If you stick with the "base" types, then it's easier to transfer.

      <p>
        [At the expense of increased complexity everywhere else...  Remember that so-called "base" types are only easier to transfer because they're so ubiquitous.  They're ubiquitous because of their popularity in the ERP domain, which is still the primary and (almost exclusive, relatively-speaking) domain where relational DBMSes are used.  Spatial types are now becoming increasingly common due to their use in other domains.  It's only a matter of time before more types, from other domains, become equally common along with mechanisms to transparently transfer complex user-defined types.  The need to use and transfer complex types in a variety of non-ERP domains -- without any undue rigamarole to represent them in databases and applications -- will inevitably drive this.]

        <em>What about a work-able way without a complete Armageddon language and tool overhaul. Any new database is going to have to work well with existing apps, databases, and transfer conventions to be more than a narrow niche.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many strategies to successful long-term adoption that do not require <em>"complete Armageddon and tool overhaul"</em>. A new database or language platform will only need to work competitively well for new apps or services - those that are developed to leverage it. Whether one must work 'well' with <em>"existing apps, databases, and transfer conventions"</em> should not be taken as a granted assumption. Sabotaging the quality of certain aspects of adaptor elements is a not uncommon business strategy to encourage <a href="VendorLockIn.html">VendorLockIn</a>, or to tweak those benchmarks relative to the competing transfer conventions... which is to say, working well with <em>"existing apps, databases, and transfer conventions"</em> may actually turn out to be counter-productive to one's long term evolutionary success. Where necessary, an adaptor element (intermediate service, protocol, or plugin) of generally questionable quality will be <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>.

        <em>If you are in a domain where there's a lot of sharing, then writing translators/adapters can become the bottleneck.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not seeing how that's a problem in practice. It is the standardization that is hard. If you are creating a new entry in a domain with a lot of sharing, then one should assume a few standards for sharing already exist. By nature, these standards will necessarily support a 'lowest common denominator' of the previous technologies. It is not difficult to adapt to a 'lowest common denominator' for a few common standards, and it doesn't pay to spend much more effort than that. Perhaps you should think about the perspective of the platform developer: <strong>adaptation-layer standards are often your enemy</strong>. They, by nature, turn your platform into a 'commodity' (something easily replaced). You must <em>support</em> standards in order to get people to start using your competing product. But there is such a thing as supporting them <em>too well</em>, such that nobody bothers to leverage the features and qualities by which you intended to market your platform. If you wish to compete for 'best implementation of a standard' (e.g. fastest correct <a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a>), then go ahead and give it a best shot. But if your goal is to advance a <em>new</em> standard, to get people to try something new, then high-quality adaptor layers may prove counter-productive to your goals. In that case, it is easier - and wiser - to support a subset of the competing standard. If you want people to integrate your system's features and tie themselves to your platform, then perhaps extend the standard a bit.

Perhaps the difference is that I want a <strong>collection-handling</strong> query language and you want a relational-only query language. Features that you call "formatting", such as sorting and leaving out key columns, could be considered typical collection-handling activities. To me, "formatting" is such activities as converting to CSV or putting pretty boxes around cells.

               [I remember when the pundits didn't put much stock in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, even if it was the "right" way forward, because they thought the world wasn't ready for it.  The same went for "structured programming".  Note that COBOL and FORTRAN have been quite successful in terms of usage, and arguably were much more ubiquitous than SQL back in their day.]

               <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> wasn't a leap forward in terms of new concepts. It was just a tight, efficient, and practical packaging of existing concepts.

               [So?  SQL is notable in being a language almost universally disliked, even by members of the ANSI SQL Standards Committee.  Its "success" has been entirely driven by corporate behaviour and accidental happenstance, not developer desire.  Its end is inevitable and nigh.]

               I did not say it didn't have flaws. I'd happily replace it with <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> if I could. But it had enough good points to satisfy a need. And I disagree that it's pure happenstance. It was "good enough" to satisfy a gap in standards-ville. One could argue that it's a case of a one-eyed man among the blind. And if it is replaced, it will probably be by something that can "plug in" to existing RDBMS. Your approach doesn't appear well-suited for that because it wishes to introduce restrictions for "purity" reasons. Our goals are pretty different.

        Classes are not required for OOP. Clone-based OO languages follow a biology-like approach and clone to "inherit". Another approach is to "point" to the parent object to "inherit". Classes as we know them are mostly an artifact of compiler-centric or static languages. -t

        {Sure, we can reify object classes and table schema and such. (Ruby, Smalltalk, Newspeak, SQL's DML or <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a>, etc. all give credence to that.) How is that relevant?}
