        I'm interested in releasing some of my work under an open source license. 
        The problem is that I want a UK-based software license. All the license agreements
        I've seen are written for the US legal system. Does anybody know of English law-based
        licenses? I don't think agreements founded on US law are going to be of much use, but
        on the other hand I don't want to be hung upside down and shaken by a lawyer ;-(
        -- (who rather worries that giving it away might actually cost him a lot)

        I am not a lawyer, but I am not aware that <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> licenses are particularly problematic for use in countries other than the US. (There isn't much case law applicable even in the US anyway.) The relevant laws, copyright laws, have a background of international agreements. For details you might want to contact UK-based or European associations promoting <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> :
