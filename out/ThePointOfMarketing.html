        The Point Of Marketing

        <em>To most people, the company with the best marketing campaign look more like experts than the real experts do. (That is </em><a href="ThePointOfMarketing.html">ThePointOfMarketing</a>.) This strongly assists the latest vendor selling snake-oil that obviously won't actually get the job done.<em></em>

        No, that's not the point of marketing. It's not even the point of marketing promotion (which is what you seem to be referring to here).
      </p>
      <p>
        The American Marketing Association puts it like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Marketing is the process of planning and executing the conception, pricing, promotion, and distribution of ideas, goods, and services to create exchanges that satisfy individual and organizational objectives."
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, clearly this can be done with varying degrees of cynicism, but it annoys me when there's a knee jerk assumption that all marketing must be manipulative or deceitful.
      </p>

        More later, maybe.

        It is useful to think of marketing as an <em>interface</em>. It is the part of a company that interfaces with customers. Like any interface, it is imperfect and does not always allow all desired information to pass through it.
      </p>
      <p>
        At its best, marketing serves these purposes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Determining customer needs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Influencing company activities to meet customers' needs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Informing customers of goods/services that meet their needs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Exchange of goods/services for money.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When marketing works this way, it is good for everyone: the customers get stuff they want, the company's employees get paid, and the company's owners make profits.
      </p>
      <p>
        The DarkSide of marketing is when it tricks customers into believing that the company's goods/services are more valuable to them than they really are. We can probably all agree that fraud is wrong.
