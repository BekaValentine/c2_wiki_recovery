      <p>
        I am currently working as a Senior Software Engineer and Head of Development with LoewenfelsPartner, Switzerland. 
        We are developing software for social scecurity agencies.
        After I have attended the first ScrumGathering in Vienna in 2004 I have become a <a href="CertifiedScrumMaster.html">CertifiedScrumMaster</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I was not able to do in my previous job, I try now: to implement an agile software development process.
        We are basing our development activities on the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a> and we try to scale it across multiple teams,
        in an offshoring situation and for MultiProjectManagement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Never giving up to fight the uphill battle!  ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously I was trying to transition to <a href="XpAtUdNeueMedien.html">XpAtUdNeueMedien</a>, but we failed miserably. We were 3 developers all not doing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> anymore. Instead we all hacked away as LonesomeCowboyCoders at whatever requirements management threw at us.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           There was no <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a> (only a feeble shadow of a <a href="CustomerProxy.html">CustomerProxy</a> that formulates imaginary user requirements)
        </li>
        <li>
           There was no <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> (only lists of tasks entered once in <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a> and then forgotten or seldom updated, but management says: "Hey, we have a plan...")
        </li>
        <li>
           There was no <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and merely no <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a> (We are so good at coding and the framework does it all for us - emm, but also has no unit tests)
        </li>
        <li>
           There was no <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> (not even a sitting together for more than a few minutes, as we all work independently and so make more money)
        </li>
        <li>
           Oh yes, we were DOING <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> (we have release cycles from implementation to production of minutes - sometimes we even edit HTML code or make database modifications directly in the production database...anybody knows a shorter release cycle?)
        </li>
        <li>
           Well, we have <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a>, kind of (but there are your colleagues, that tell you: "I'll do that, I know the UI code better than you!")
        </li>
        <li>
           Ahh, refactoring. Ok, we wanted to refactor (but who knows a <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> for HTML-code? ;-) )
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        So you would like to fail in implementing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>? Well, then call me up, I can give you some useful hints...
