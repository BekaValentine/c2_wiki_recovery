        Reduce Coupling
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you are faced with a <a href="MonolithicDesign.html">MonolithicDesign</a>, what can you do to <a href="ReduceCoupling.html">ReduceCoupling</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        First I would suggest that you must define the <a href="BusinessRules.html">BusinessRules</a>.  Often a <a href="MonolithicDesign.html">MonolithicDesign</a> is the result of having people with a strong <a href="DomainKnowledge.html">DomainKnowledge</a> add more <a href="BusinessRules.html">BusinessRules</a> (and hence more files or processes) to an existing codebase.  <a href="BusinessRules.html">BusinessRules</a> end up getting implemented in a split fashion between different programs (leading to SoftwareFragility).
      </p>
      <p>
        To assist in the process of reducing coupling, it helps to know what are the causes of increased coupling:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Number of files or tables used
        </li>
        <li>
           Number of software language platforms or implementations used
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another way to grok this concept is to imagine assigning a number to the coupling of a process, 1 being the lowest possibly coupling.  A program with a coupling of 1 would read in a single flat file or database table, apply logic to implement a single <a href="BusinessRule.html">BusinessRule</a>, and write out (or update) a single flat file or database table.
      </p>

      <p>
        The advantage of reducing coupling is that it allows for easier refactoring.
