        Relational Oo Impedance Mismatch Is Caused By Classes
      </h1>
      <p>
        OO systems are good at managing transient state; relational systems are good at managing persistence, especially persistent facts and deriving new facts from these. There is no impedance mismatch, except OO environments that support dynamic class and/or object definitions may provide a convenient syntax for handling data retrieved from relational systems external to the OO environment, whereas this may be awkward in OO environments that only support static class definitions. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        Both tables and classes can be thought to be "containers" of objects if we think that <a href="ObjectsAreDictionaries.html">ObjectsAreDictionaries</a>. The problem is that they don't contain the same objects. That's why they mismatch. This mismatch is specially hard on strongly typed language (contemplate both Rails' <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> and ObjectGraph (AKA: og) in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        IMO, Rows from the database (resulting from a query) are classless objects (or at least, they have a dynamic class with accessors for each column). Rails' <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> (for instance) use the <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> dynamism to generate the classes for the tables on the fly, avoiding the extra and useless work of retyping the class definition for the tables. .Net implementation of the <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> pattern (Castle <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a>) can't do that and the code is significantly more verbose in C# than in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> because of this.

      <p>
        Well, it's just a thought. What do you think? (<a href="AurelianoCalvo.html">AurelianoCalvo</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think it's not quite accurate, though the essential idea is valid.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Classes should not be thought of "containers" of objects. They are (typically) only syntactic mechanisms for generating objects. They do not contain objects. Container classes permit generation of container objects, but it is the generated objects and not their classes that contain other objects. I am not aware of any language that allows you to iterate all objects that belong to, or were generated by, a given class.</em>

           In any Smalltalk environment, look at the results of evaluating "SomeClass allInstances". While you may be pedantically correct, in that this is a behavior of the environment rather than the language, I believe that distinction is not germane to this discussion. In <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, everything is an object, each object has a class, and each class has a unique name. Thus, the #allInstances method is implemented (virtually, if not actually) by traversing the set of all objects and collecting those whose class has the same name as the receiver of the original expression. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Interesting. I'm not a Smalltalker, so I wasn't aware of '#allInstances'. It appears that Smalltalk is a language (or more accurately, environment) that treats a 'class' as both an instance factory and an instance container. That said, I have also seen cases (and built them) in C++ and Java where a factory is specifically designed to maintain a container of all instances it generates. But to get back to my original point, this is not an implicit feature of the language itself, and I was attempting (perhaps awkwardly) to focus on the conceptual distinction between class, instance, and container rather than specific implementations (like Smalltalk, as I now see) that intentionally blur these. I still hold that a (pure) class, at a conceptual level, should not be considered a container but a generator. This is especially important when relating classes, containers and instances to database tables. A class is not equivalent to a table. A container instance is equivalent to a table. A class may either be roughly equivalent to a table header (i.e., a table's definition or schema) or a column domain. Following on from this, an instance may either be a row or a row's column value. However, there are some - e.g., C J Date and Hugh Darwen - who compellingly argue that class and table header equivalence is incorrect, and maintain that a class is strictly equivalent to a column domain or type, hence an instance is strictly equivalent to a row's column value. In this view, a row is a classless container of column instances. See <a href="DomainsNotRecordsOrTablesAreObjects.html">DomainsNotRecordsOrTablesAreObjects</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ultimately, I suppose this comes down to the definition of "class." At a conceptual level, is a class an instance factory, or is a class an abstract notion of those instances that share some meaningful characteristic(s)? -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>The essence of this category of impedance mismatch, as you have essentially stated above, is that certain languages only support static, compile-time class definitions. In such languages (e.g., C#, C++, Java), there is no mechanism to conveniently generate a new class at run-time, hence there is no mechanism to conveniently produce a class from a dynamic query's result set at run-time, and thus there is no way to generate (at run-time) row objects that conveniently use object syntax to reference member elements. Languages that permit run-time, dynamic class and/or object definitions do not suffer from this problem.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In Smalltalk, the very concept of "compile-time" isn't meaningful. In Smalltalk, every class has a dictionary of methods that pertain to the instances of that class. Those methods have compiled byte-code implementations. In that context, "compile time" means "the time when the source of a method is saved." I suggest that the problems you describe have less to do with static typing and more to do with whether or not the environment is "pure" -- all objects, all the way down. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hence, Smalltalk is a language that supports run-time, dynamic class and/or object definitions, yes? -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Furthermore, it is probably not accurate to say that this is especially hard on strongly typed languages, because it is possible to have a strongly typed language that permits run-time, dynamic class definitions. It just so happens that certain popular languages which happen to be strongly typed also only support static, compile-time-only class definitions.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yes, I think you're now saying the same thing I observed above. I suggest that the difference lies in whether the environment is or is not "pure object oriented", more than whether or not it provides strong and/or static typing. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
        </li>

        <em>In short, this type of OR impedance mismatch is only caused by static class definitions, and resolved by dynamic class and/or object definitions.</em> -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think it's more accurate to say that this type of OR impedance mismatch is caused by attempting to mix object and non-object entities, and is resolved by making the language and environment purely object-oriented, all the way down. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think we're in violent agreement here. That is effectively what I was trying to say, using slightly different terminology. Dynamic class and/or object definitions may imply a purely object-oriented language. However, it also implies non-OO languages (using "object", above, in a broad sense) that permit dynamic definition of structures or whatever, as long as it uses a convenient syntax to access result sets. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      <p>
        So, in the end you agree that the <a href="ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch.html">ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch</a> is mainly caused by the static class definitions? Is there any <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> that generates classes for the tables at compile time for Java, C#, C++, etc. (using the data base schema as a source)?

        <em>My first bullet point, above, deserves some expansion. I believe the notion of constructing application-side classes, e.g., Customer, Employee, Invoice, Payment, InventoryItem etc. to represent real-world entities, which then use the database as a persistence engine, is a naive and flawed approach. The application side should implement mechanisms to facilitate presentation of the database -- perhaps starting with base classes like Form, Report, Menu, Query, DatabaseConnection etc. -- and let the database management system deal with entities, or, more accurately, facts. This approach treats the database management system as an equal partner in implementing application functionality, rather than deprecating it to a mere storage device for client-side objects, and it reduces degree of impedance mismatch because you're generally not having to maintain client-side classes in sync with server-side tables.</em>

           I beg to disagree with Dave here. My experience has been that the effect of this is to surface the relational model to the ultimate user, so that the user interface most often becomes a glorified and pretty-fied SQL query builder. The reason for this is that, in my experience, the things I model have <strong>behavior</strong>, and the behavior is important. The relational model explicit blocks this. A point of agreement might, however, be in Dave's phrase "which then use the database as a persistence layer." The key is to include the <strong>behavior</strong> of whatever is modelled in the persistent store along with the state. I think this does, in fact, evolve into Dave's suggestion that the persistent store be treated "as an equal partner in implementing application functionality." Dave may also be alluding to a more imperative style of modeling, along the lines of RDF and the semantic web. While I think this is also promising, it breaks the relational model just as thoroughly as it breaks the (classical) OO model. This doesn't mean we shouldn't do it, but I think it does mean that it lies outside the scope of a discussion about the claimed OR impedance mismatch. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's important to note that a relational database is much more than just a persistent store. A relational database management system is a fact processor. It allows one to expressively manipulate existing facts and derive new facts via the composability of the relational algebra. The fact (!) that such systems are persistent is almost a mere bonus - one that is all too often elevated to its only purpose. If all you need is object persistence - perfectly appropriate for some applications - a relational database is not necessary.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           However, I think this comes down to a point you made below, that "[t]he fundamental mismatch has more to do with the problem space than any tools used to solve it." With this, I agree. My background is mainly in developing enterprise data management systems, where not only is the user interface a glorified and pretty-ified SQL query builder, that is <em>precisely the goal.</em> Such systems are conceptually intended to capture and permanently record changes to real-world facts, more than maintain a singular current entity state. Modelling "behaviour," as such, is often implemented by recording new rows (i.e., storing time-dependent business facts) rather than (say) updating existing rows to reflect a change in state. While this is a valid and required approach for enterprise data management systems, it might be inappropriate for (say) a CAD system that maintains changes to objects as the user edits her diagrams. Though, arguably, even a CAD system might benefit from this approach (performance and implementation issues aside), as it would permit an infinite history of all changes, thus supporting unlimited "undo" facilities, implicit versioning, etc. But that's beside the point. What I'm getting at is that there may be fundamental differences in approach between systems designed for shared data management, and those designed to preserve application state.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I disagree, however, that this breaks the relational model. How does it break it? True relational systems do not preclude or deprecate behaviour, they're just picky about where the behaviour lies -- either in user-defined functions or operators, active constraints, or (in the degenerate, pseudo-relational/procedural case of SQL) in triggers and stored procedures. In relational systems, data updates may result in behaviour (which may result in data updates, and so on.) In OO systems, behaviour may result in data updates. The end result is the same. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      </ul>
      <p>
        Having flexible/dynamic objects/classes may allow your objects to dynamically mirror table schemas, but that does not really solve the root of the problem: OO and relational are governed by different rules and philosophies. Sure, you can better fit relational by making objects mirror or imitate relational, but then it is not OO, but emulation of another paradigm. It is not so much a technical problem as a philosophical one. Perhaps you could argue that static classes add a technical barrier <em>on top</em> of a philosophical barrier. -- top

        Well, if you want you can model tables as objects. What I see is that the tools currently in use to match rows in the database with objects force the developers to repeat information if they want to use objects to encapsulate them. The Rails implementation of the <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> pattern is a step to not force that. I believe that <a href="ObjectRelationalMappingCostsTimeAndMoney.html">ObjectRelationalMappingCostsTimeAndMoney</a> and I would like to spend as little as possible solving this accidental complexity. Because data bases are great tools for some things and it's possible to model them in objects (just model them, it's not necesary to reimplement them), I'm just looking for the better way to use them when they are appropiate. I really don't see a philosophical barrier between objects and the relational model. What I see is that you erect a psicological barrier between them for yourself. I'm really happy to use both tecniques in my professional life every day. My practical concern is that I'm not able to apply the DryPrinciple (Don't repeat yourself ;) ). If the classes representing the data base were autogenerated, I would not need to rewrite the data base schema as classes. If the schema were autogenerated, I would not need to rewrite the classes as the data base schema. The first approach is the one in Rails' <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> and the second one is the approach in ObjectGraph (og). No philosophical barrier, no fuss, no problems. Just a little metaprogramming. -- <a href="AurelianoCalvo.html">AurelianoCalvo</a>.

        <em>I'd to suggest that there is a simpler mismatch that underlies all this: a tradeoff between row-major and column-major modeling. When we pull back to look more at the forests and less at the trees, I think that "object oriented" modeling begins with a fundamentally row-major viewpoint: when I add an element to a schematic in a CAD system, I mostly care about collecting the various things in that element, and my drawing is mostly a container of those elements. Conversely, when I seek those elements whose price changed by more than a certain amount in the last year, I care mostly about a specific property across all the objects. The first is row-major, the second is column-major. It seems to me that we can then make several observations:</em>

        I agree with this. It is in part why I am interested in languages like <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> that specifically seek to address these issues. Intuitively, I think there is a fundamental region of conceptual commonality or reconciliation (or <em>rapproachement</em>, to use C J Date's preferred term) between object oriented, relational, functional, etc., systems that we have not yet discovered. The same holds for the divide between application functionality and environments vs. database functionality and environments. Alternatively, perhaps the paradigms are not reconcilable, but no single paradigm has been evolved to the extent that it can definitively trump the others. The fact that we can successfully build working systems using any or all of these types of machinery, yet simultaneously complain about impedance mismatches where they meet, suggests that either of these may be true. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        <em>A more fundamental distinction between the </em>'concepts<strong> of "table" and "class" is that a class provides both behavior and state, whereas a table provides only state.

        Well, tables have behaviour. But its behaviour is more "hardcoded". One can add records, delete records, update records and query them. The queries are special beasts because they can join multiple tables, but they have the same essence. I see clear behaviour there. My bet at modelling relational in a object oriented way is to provide this primitives and, if necesary, add new one. But repeating this for every class is a pain in the ass. That's why I say that <a href="RelationalOoImpedanceMismatchIsCausedByClasses.html">RelationalOoImpedanceMismatchIsCausedByClasses</a>. I mean that if one has to write all the code in the class, and can't generate it at runtime, there is a problem because usually the data base is the place were the data is based. If I need more behaviour from the tables than what they provide, I would do the usual tricks: inheritance, façade, adapter and decorator patterns come to my mind. Think of the data base as a framework (and/or library) you use but can't change, and everything works like the rest of the frameworks. Having to retype the framework is a pain, using it and extending it when needed don't seems such a big deal. -- <a href="AurelianoCalvo.html">AurelianoCalvo</a>.

           I've experimented with the idea of putting code in tables, but the problem is that data and actions tend not to map one-to-one to each other. For example, something like a table-oriented <a href="StrategyPattern.html">StrategyPattern</a> looks like a good idea on paper, but usually doesn't work out so well in practice because having one function or function pointer per record is not a realistic mapping of data to behavior. Thus, the tight integration of data and behavior proved not very useful. It is true that a database may make a better code repository than tree-folders when the tools catch up, but treatment of the data and behavior as relatively independent things is simply modeling their actual relationship to each other. I would also welcome DBA-extendable query languages (and app-level mini-DB's that can do the same). But this would require simplifying the query language syntax, which SQL and Tutorial-D both fail at IMO, and thus <a href="TopsQueryLanguage.html">TopsQueryLanguage</a>. -- top

        Go one step beyond thinking of the database as a framework. Think of the database as an external device and the "impedance mismatch" disappears entirely. We don't worry about the printer-OO impedance mismatch because printers are missing some OO feature. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Building on the above comment from </em><a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>, I view the database as the second tier of a three-tier storage model: primary, secondary, and tertiary. Primary storage is dynamic, loads and stores are (relatively) fast, and volume is (somewhat) limited. Think "memory". Secondary storage has longer latency times but high bandwidth once the transfer begins, and volume is nearly unlimited. Think file system and database. Tertiary storage has very long latency times and sometimes very low bandwidth, but essentially unlimited volume. Think magnetic tapes, DVD, and similar bulk storage. ALL behavior is provided by a processor running methods, including the internals of a database implementation. The purpose of a database is persistence. Period. Persistence of everything -- including methods, metastructure, processes, stack frames -- <strong>EVERYTHING</strong>. Certain services are often best provided by a database running SQL. I fully support using a database running SQL as a provider of those services. On the other hand, when I have to provide behavior -- even simple behavior, like computing a current balance -- then the database is very nearly the <strong>worst</strong> place to attempt to provide that behavior, because it is so highly specialized and optimized for its primary function (which it should be). Now, having said all that, it is certainly true that there are shifts in abstraction level, and one could imagine all sorts of innovative architectures where the virtual computing engine sits in some sort of abstract hyperspace with some of the computing engine's behavior provided by stored procedures. That's all well and good, but that virtual computing engine is a virtual computing engine, NOT a database. A database is for providing secondary storage. Period. Persistence. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe it is a narrow view to treat a (relational) database purely as a persistence engine. Equally limited would be, say, using an OO language but never taking advantage of inheritance and polymorphism. If you're using a SQL DBMS purely as a persistence engine - and by that I assume you implicitly mean you are <em>not</em> using it as a fact processor, i.e., a tool for deriving facts (e.g., summaries, joins, calculated columns, views, restrictions, etc.) from other facts (tables) - then why not use a persistence engine such as Prevayler or the Berkeley DB? Either of these would probably be more suited to preserving application state (which is what I assume you mean by persistence of methods, metatstructure, processes, stack frames, and everything) than translating objects into SQL.

        Again, I pose that persistence and data management are different things. As evidence of this, imagine that future machine architectures all have primary storage that is high volume, low latency, and non-volatile. This is certainly well within the realm of possibility. Would that make relational databases redundant, now that persistence is implicit? I say "no". A relational database still provides powerful means for expressing and deriving facts in a manner that is concise, composable, dynamically optimisable, and easily proven - and all this is independent of persistence.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, compare the conciseness of an ad-hoc natural join in a typical relational DBMS vs. the equivalent OO operations. In <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, this is simply A JOIN B - where A and B are tables with column names and domains in common - and it's not much more verbose in SQL. In a non-relational language, this requires that you write some mechanism involving iteration and maybe keyed lookups, or perhaps maintaining object associations at all times, and possibly incorporating mechanisms to dynamically choose a mix of these if you wish to implement the optimisation that relational DBMSes provide. Of course, there's nothing to stop you from building OO facilities that employ a terse syntax to use your home-made join, but you're simply reinventing something that a relational DBMS already provides <em>and</em> optimises for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, by the way, that I wrote "<strong>ad-hoc</strong> natural join" above. Predefined static relationships or associations between objects, in an OO environment, are of course trivially navigable. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        I think there's some heat caused by different uses of the term "persistence". I think a relational DB should be used for persistent information. I don't think a relational DB is "purely a persistence engine". RDBMSs offer much more than persistence, but they shouldn't be used for transient information. There are other tools better suited for that. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        <em>We seem to be slicing our terms pretty thin here. When I say "persistence", I include finding and retrieving information. A relational database is ideal for finding three specific items out of three million. I think further discussion of "facts" belongs on a different page. Meanwhile, "summaries, joins, calculated columns, views, restrictions, etc." are all useful in storing and retrieving data that changes infrequently in comparison to the timeframe of a specific process. I think this is another way of stating Eric's observation that they shouldn't be used for transient information. The sorts of systems that Dave describes are all very interesting, and I think have very little to do with relational databases. Yes, it's true that I can use an automobile to run a generator to run a pump to empty a pond. That doesn't change the fact that the primary service provided by an automobile is transportation. A relational database is for PERSISTENCE. -- </em><a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that a discussion of "facts" probably belongs on a different page - like <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a> - which elegantly (though perhaps incompletely) supports the "fact based" view of relational databases. I'd be happy to move this thread there, if the other parties in this discussion agree to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I do not agree that the systems I describe have little to do with relational databases. Actually, they are <em>precisely</em> what relational databases do well, and precisely where they are often used. For example, I worked extensively on enterprise bookkeeping/accounting, payroll, inventory, and billing systems (i.e., what are now typically unified into ERP systems - see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning),">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_resource_planning),</a> for which relational databases are ideal. In such systems, we often need to record the fact that a change occurred, not just the result of the change. For example, rather than represent an account <em>in silico</em> as a virtual real-world account - which might only maintain a current balance - we typically represent an account as a collection of business facts about sales, credit/debit memos, charges, etc., that result in a derived, rather than stored, account balance. In short, we are more concerned with recording information about business activities than we are with simulating the behaviour of business entities. Relational databases are good at the former. OO environments are good at the latter.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I am skeptical of the "simulating behavior" claim (surprise). Do you have an example? Perhaps if you simulate it as little people doing the process manually, then OOP would be the way to go, but if you factor/design the schema right, often there are relational shortcuts that are more declarative in nature. Sometimes it seems OO is more concerned about copying physical activities when the best solution may be to transcend the shackles of the physical world. OOP may indeed better model the real (physical) world, but the real world sucks. -- top

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Furthermore, I agree that persistence is a <em>foundation</em> of databases (though, interestingly, it is categorically <strong>not</strong> the foundation of the relational model), but having established that foundation, we treat it as given. By applying the relational model to facts (persistent yes, but that's a convenience and a benefit, not a necessity), we derive all manner of interesting goodness. Date's seminal <a href="AnIntroductionToDatabaseSystems.html">AnIntroductionToDatabaseSystems</a> text briefly discusses persistence on page 11 (of the 8th edition), and indeed uses it in the definition of database - "A database is a collection of persistent data that is used by the application systems of some given enterprise." However, once stated, persistence is only mentioned on <em>two</em> other pages - both related to the notion of "persistence orthogonal to type" in a section on object oriented databases. So what are the other 980 pages about? Primarily, they are about the use of databases (relational in particular) to represent, process, and derive facts! So, using a relational database as a facts processor is hardly a marginal application of relational databases, it is <em>the</em> purpose of relational databases, with emphasis on "relational" over and above "databases." It is the relational model, independent of persistence, that gives a relational database its power. Otherwise, why bother with the relational model at all? We could simply use an object persistence mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to look at this debate is to <em>ignore</em> the issue of persistence entirely, and simply view the relational model as a set of tools for manipulating data. If you're not familiar with <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a>, try developing a set of classes to implement it. Then experiment with it, as you would any other class library. I did this, back when I too viewed a relational database as little more than a persistence engine, and it was an eye-opener. (My experiments eventually evolved into the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>.) Relational algebra and relations are powerful tools for manipulating data, period. I wish every OO language incorporated the relational model, persistence aside, because it simply allows you to manipulate data in an expressive, concise, composable, provable, optimisable way that is much more awkward without it.
      </p>
      <p>
        OO proponents sometimes seem to have philosphical objections to the relational model and relational databases, and an equal number of relational proponents have objections to OO programming. Both views are limited. OO and the relational model are both powerful and complementary, and I would no more reject one above the other than I would reject the screwdrivers in my toolbox in favour of the wrenches, or vice versa. I'm also lazy - if there's something a relational database will give me for free, I'll take it, and save the effort of reinventing it in the application environment.

        When I used to use nimble table environments, I used tables for "transient" stuff also. For example, one might take a result set from an ODBC query (or the equiv. in those days), which could be a local or "transient" table, and further massage it for something local or task-specific. The problem is that most development environments don't support nimble local or virtual tables because they fell out of style. Your statement is only true from a current vendor/implementation standpoint, but not an absolute comment on the paradigms/techniques being compared. It is a <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a>-only DBMS viewpoint. Nimble tables entirely changed the way I viewed programming; and when I got hooked, I had to be dragged away from it kicking and screaming (sometimes called "trolling" here :-). -- top

        <em>In an OO environment, you can implement Relation and Tuple classes with associated relational algebra operator methods. A Relation is a container of TupleS, and a Tuple is a container of objects. If you like, you can go one step further and implement relational Expression and Operator classes, where an Expression instance is a container of Operator invocation instances that represent an expression in the relational algebra. This allows you to implement dynamic, automated optimisation of relational expressions, though it's really only of benefit if you're dealing with large volumes of tuples. A lightweight implementation of the relational model (call it "nimble tables," if you like) in an OO context leverages the power of both paradigms. Where it's warranted, I've found it to be of considerable value, and it makes a nice addition to standard or built-in collection/container libraries. If all you need is a transient container, however, standard container classes do the job just fine. But, I digress. My real point in all this: OO systems make it easy to create lightweight implementations of the relational model. Therefore, my claim that "OO systems are good at managing transient state" still holds, even if the transient state is maintained in a lightweight implementation the relational model! I might add, however, that (in agreement with the above) in this case the relational model is good at managing transient state, too.</em> -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

It is precisely the opposite of overkill. Furthermore, no expression parser is needed if the expressions are constructed from Operator instances that reference each other, i.e., manually build the syntax tree.

A typical example I've encountered (and which recently came up at work again) is when the end-user can select individual items from a potentially large set, and further processing requires correlating this set with shared data. The most robust way to do this is, and the fastest when large quantities of data are involved, is to have the selected items in a temporary table, and join against related data.
