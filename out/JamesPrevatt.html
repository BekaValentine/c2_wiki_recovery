        Welcome to my little corner of this great wiki resource. I am finding much to learn and apply to my life and job, even though my vocation is not directly related to the primary topics being discussed here. However, my avocations do very much include software development (on my own, for now). My favorite programming language, to date, has been <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>. I have tinkered about with several others, but I have found that I can be the most efficient in Python.

        A little about myself: I am an accountant by vocation, with a bookkeeping business on the side. I am also an amateur musician and the organist at a local Baptist church. I also play piano and synthesizer and am proficient on several wind instruments as well. I am currently serving a three-year term as a deacon for my church, which began in October 2007.
