        HMEs are worse than <a href="PrimaDonna.html">PrimaDonna</a>s. The latter are both annoying and not worth the trouble. Seat them near the doors, so the next strong wind will blow them out.

      <p>
        HMEs are simultaneously so valuable and so annoying that you must add their minor, chronic felonies to your <a href="RiskManagement.html">RiskManagement</a> insurance system. Their weekly 5 minutes of unearthly brilliance are worth more than an entire team of engineers, and in the end they cost less.

        <em>Thus make them consultants, so they must carry their own liability insurance?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        it's not _that_kind_ of "insurance"!
