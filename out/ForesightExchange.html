        Foresight Exchange
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Foresight Exchange is an ideas futures market: <a href="http://www.ideosphere.com">http://www.ideosphere.com</a> which is basically a game because it uses play money. Players in the game achieve a high score through their ability to predict the future--claims about future events are traded on a market, and those who predict correctly see their investments rise in value. 
      </p>

        For example, on claim on the market is TheFutureOfITJobs (<a href="http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=ITJOBS)">http://www.ideosphere.com/fx-bin/Claim?claim=ITJOBS)</a> which claims that there will be 35% more IT Jobs in America in 2012 than there were in 2002, despite OffshoreOutsourcing and the like.
