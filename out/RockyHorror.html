        Rocky Horror
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Rocky Horror</strong> is a campy movie about a couple that is drawn into a web of mystery and intrigue when, on the night of their engagement, they find themselves stranded at a strange mansion. Forced into the mansion by first car trouble and then driving rain, the protagonists Janet and Brad are confronted by a strange cross-dressing mad-scientist, Dr. Frank N. Furter. Once he shows them his creation, Rocky, a muscular, blond man with a tan, things get weirder. Amid dance numbers, a cameo by Meatloaf, and a double-crossing by Frank's assistants from the planet Transsexual Transylvaniaaaaa, Frank is killed, Meatloaf is killed, even Rocky is killed, and everyone has a good time including the audience (who spends most of the movie throwing things, cursing, and applying sexual innuendoes quite liberally).

        One of the worst night's entertainment of my life was when I was dragged to see it and sat next to a bricky from Barnsley, who wore a basque and must have shouted 'Knob' every 2 mins throughout the show.

        <em>Reminds me of a Jethro Tull concert I went to, where some big doped-up hulk screamed "Tuuuuull!" in my ear every minute or so -- including throughout a low-volume acoustic set.</em>

        Good lord. What a strange movie.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, I have quite a few good, hazy memories of throwing toast at a movie screen while this movie was playing, when I was in college. Quite a unique movie. I can't explain it.

        It sucked.  It does do a good job of portraying what is wrong with a certain sector of society, though.

        <em>Um, help me out here, which sector would that be, and what exactly is wrong with it?</em>
      </p>

        Perhaps it is a matter of personal tastes and morality.  There were parts of the film that I did enjoy, but overall my impression that I was left with was one of dislike.  Not long after the movie came out, many people whom I knew and even a very close individual to my family that I had gone to the movie with, turned to sexual lives that ended up destroying their lives.  Several contracted HIV that lead to slow and painful deaths.  The (departed) individual that I referred to above was one of the unfortunate, and so was his (departed) partner a few years later.  Perhaps I am biased (being heterosexual) but the movie seemed to have fueled dislike in me, and it seemed to (for some) fuel and condone a certain seedy lifestyle.

        <em>The movie seems to point out some of the pitfalls of such choices, too, nes-c'est-pas?  Brad and Janet suffer the consequences of their moments of weakness, do they not?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is true, but I noticed the affect that it had on some individuals, and they became so obsessed with the movie that they would even go so far as to first act it out privately in their homes, then later act it out words and actions for real.  It is amazing how that people seem to ignore those warnings about "pitfalls" when they do not wish to see or hear them.  It seemed(s) to be used, pervertedly perhaps, for the purpose (by a certain sector) as "condonement".
