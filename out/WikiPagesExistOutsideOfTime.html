        Wiki Pages Exist Outside Of Time

        <em>(I don't know where to write about this issue, or where to link it to, so I'll create it and see if any other </em><a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> can suggest related pages and/or link it appropriately.  Or, of course, this may be discussed elsewhere; if so, please provide links so that this page can be appropriately deleted or merged.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s can be changed at any time, and their exact authorship can change (particularly during a <a href="ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode.html">ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode</a> operation, where comments by multiple authors are refactored into a cogent document). As such, <strong></strong><a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s exist outside of regular time as we know it.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that, when one is referring to a Wiki page from a static source (see <a href="HowToCiteWiki.html">HowToCiteWiki</a>), for example when one writes an article about a Wiki page, one cannot reliably refer the reader to any content on that Wiki page, because the content may be refactored at any time.
      </p>
      <p>
        This goes beyond problems that arise with malicious <a href="DisagreeByDeleting.html">DisagreeByDeleting</a> behavior. A provocative comment may be <em>rightly</em> merged with the rest of the document as part of appropriate <a href="RefactoringWikiPages.html">RefactoringWikiPages</a> (see <a href="RefactorByCondensingConversation.html">RefactorByCondensingConversation</a>). This can completely obsolete an external reference to that comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, <strong>how should one refer to Wiki pages from a static source?</strong> Should all Wiki referrals be accompanied by a disclaimer that the Wiki content may change at any time? Should the referrer take the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> into account and simply avoid referring to specific Wiki text? This latter suggests that a Wiki should only be externally referenced at a page level rather than a textual level.
      </p>
      <p>
        No - no disclaimer or special type of referral required.
