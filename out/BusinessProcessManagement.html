        Business Process Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a>, BPM for short, is concerned with the integration of work processes that have evolved separately to serve functional needs in the enterprise. At times, the lesser used term <a href="BusinessProcessIntegration.html">BusinessProcessIntegration</a> (BPI) is employed to stress the importance of "integration".
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach focuses on needs of the company to constantly evolve its processes to respond to changes in the business environment (regulatory and legislative requirements, competitive forces, partnering opportunities, etc). See <a href="http://www.bcs.org/BCS/Products/Publications/Books/BySeries/Other/BusinessProcessManagement/">http://www.bcs.org/BCS/Products/Publications/Books/BySeries/Other/BusinessProcessManagement/</a> for a new book from British Computing Society.

        Another related term is BusinessProcessImprovement. A classic (1991) book on this is ISBN: 0070267685.

        <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> is not really new, according to <a href="http://bpm-today.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=24304.">http://bpm-today.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=24304.</a> It cited <a href="EnterpriseResourcePlanning.html">EnterpriseResourcePlanning</a> as an example of software that already incorporated process management, before the term has been adopted widely. And in business the concept of <a href="SupplyChainManagement.html">SupplyChainManagement</a> has been around for a while.

        <a href="BusinessProcessReengineering.html">BusinessProcessReengineering</a> can be one approach used to addressing the needs of <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a>. In these instances, the project scope will invariably be crossing existing organization boundaries. OTOH, some felt <a href="BusinessProcessReengineering.html">BusinessProcessReengineering</a> is not <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a>, see <a href="http://www.darwinmag.com/read/030103/wavehistory.html.">http://www.darwinmag.com/read/030103/wavehistory.html.</a>

        The authors of <a href="ComponentBasedBusiness.html">ComponentBasedBusiness</a> provide a conceptual framework to building an organization that is inherently agile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standards organizations have already made progress in defining building blocks for IT solutions. An example of this being the <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> based BPEL (<a href="BusinessProcessExecutionLanguage.html">BusinessProcessExecutionLanguage</a>).

        One vendor consortium is BPMI, which has produced several specifications. See <a href="http://www.bpmi.org/specifications.esp.">http://www.bpmi.org/specifications.esp.</a>

           BPMI has merged with <a href="ObjectManagementGroup.html">ObjectManagementGroup</a>. Waiting to see whether <a href="BusinessProcessModelingNotation.html">BusinessProcessModelingNotation</a> is indeed going to be used widely over other alternatives for <a href="ProcessModeling.html">ProcessModeling</a>, including the good old flowchart (over 50 years old).

        Nick Carr, author of <a href="DoesItMatter.html">DoesItMatter</a>, said in his May03 article at <a href="http://www.dataframeworks.com/pdfs/R0305B.pdf">http://www.dataframeworks.com/pdfs/R0305B.pdf</a> titled "IT Doesn't Matter", that former Strategic investments could and would turn to becoming a strategic liability. He suggested American Hospital Supply innovative use of IT in the 70s locked out competitors, but that system was viewed as a "millstone around their necks" by senior management in the 90s.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is therefore within the mandate of <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> to examine whether process improvement efforts will create a longterm liability that may exceed the benefits that can be realized within the planning horizon.

      <p>
        Peter Fingar said "General System Thinking" is a required <a href="DomainKnowledge.html">DomainKnowledge</a> for BPM practioners, because BPM is about the business of managing complexity. See Sep05 article in BPTrends.
      </p>
      <p>
        He said this as a description of <a href="SystemsThinking.html">SystemsThinking</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Systems thinking is a discipline for seeing wholes. It is a framework for seeing interrelationships rather than things, for seeing patterns of change rather than static snapshots.
