      <p>
        Would this be the same as <a href="DeleteWhenCooked.html">DeleteWhenCooked</a>? I don't quite get that page; it's not very clear. (DeleteIfNecessary)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't think so. </em><a href="DeleteWhenCooked.html">DeleteWhenCooked</a> implies that some action is required ("cooking") above and beyond simply receiving the message.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ok, so this would be something like :
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>  </dt>
        <dd>  "A message to the <em>intended reader</em> to remove the comment once it has been read. Often indicating that <a href="ChatMode.html">ChatMode</a> of the page was intended as temporary and not meant as a permanent contribution to <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. Mostly found in <a href="WikiMailBox.html">WikiMailBox</a>es, on <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>s and wiki discussion pages"</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I use this when I have a temporary message, responding to a post by a specific individual - hoping my post would only be deleted by the targeted person after reading.
        </li>
      </ul>
