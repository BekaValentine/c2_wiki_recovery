        Strange phrases that mysteriously catch fire and spread with a speed only exceeded by that which they die out at have been around forever. Why? It is probably as simple as <a href="BillKelly.html">BillKelly</a> says on <a href="AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs.html">AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs</a>: <em>"I found it twisted and hilarious in a way that made me feel good"</em>.  What other reason is needed but that?

        Simple phrase memes, like the Whassup! craze.  No detriment to the infected, small benefit of increased 'hipness' and social approval. -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        <em>There'd be a detriment to the infected if only the government would pass some "fair cause for violence" laws...</em>

        I'm curious; Does the book address the topic of crowd psychology as a political force?  The difference between a small collection of individuals and a roaring mass of fanatics, a charismatic leader stirring up followers at massive rallies, that sort of thing? -- <a href="ScottCooper.html">ScottCooper</a>
