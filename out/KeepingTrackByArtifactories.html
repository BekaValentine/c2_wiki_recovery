        Keeping Track By Artifactories

        Warning - this abstraction is incompletely developed, so to help me develop it more fully, ask questions at the bottom of the page (if you have interest in the topic).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        When Artifactories (structures, materials, and methods for creating or discovering, maintaining and making reachable the thing I call the HyperArtifacts) are carefully and properly utilized, one creates both tracking and reaching capabilities as by-products. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This wiki can be used to illustrate this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When you make a <a href="NewPage.html">NewPage</a>, or edit any page, you do some things as a result of the way Wiki handles and manipulates it that are automatic:
          <ul>
            <li>
               It becomes an entry in the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> for that day
            </li>
            <li>
               If the page edit contains http urls, they become <em>reachable</em> by the hyperlink the engine creates in the page
            </li>
            <li>
               If the page edit contains WikiWords, they become <em>reachable</em> or are included as one of the <a href="WantedPages.html">WantedPages</a> in a special collection, which displays the list related to the current page which allows an individual selection by which you can choose to relate it either as a page you want to edit, or allow the entry of a external reachable link which will make it into a <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Because of the nature and process of the Artifactory (wiki) the page becomes traceable from the page to which it links via the <a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a> mechanism.
            </li>
            <li>
               The Artifactory also makes the changed page a historical artifact by making (on occasion) periodic history archives of the page for reference and recreation purposes.
            </li>
            <li>
               The page is also through the Mirrors mechanism, made available via other servers, via a mechanism created to do so.
            </li>
            <li>
               The change is also made known via <a href="RssFeeds.html">RssFeeds</a> to certain users who have enabled their machines to receive them.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The list above, given as an example, serves to provide the value of Artifactories in the creation and maintenance of HyperArtifacts. Other Artifactories can be created to do other things with the pages another Artifactory handles. There are several examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example 1. Bots and Agents
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           SearchEngines routinely scan collections of pages and information on sites found on TheInternet, and then make them "reachable" when a user types some text in their query text box or dialog, and then they <em>Engage</em> the Engine by pressing a button or pressing enter, whatever works. This is also true for this wiki at the present time (but has not always been so).
        </li>
        <li>
           Bots have been created at various times to allow manipulation and editing of pages by non-human means of pages which appear in the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Signups and Notification for a certain group of pages which have been recently edited was tried for a period of time and then abandoned.
            </li>
            <li>
               Reversals of edits by the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>, and those seeming to be, are presently being accomplished via a bot called the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>. From time to time its author will reverse or modify the edits made automatically by editing the suspect page manually.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Example 2.  Personally Constructed Systems and Programs for collection and archiving of <em>all</em> selected WebPages
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           External Monitoring and Archiving of a page, or group of pages, by the interested party on their own machine. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="AutomaticExternalCategorization.html">AutomaticExternalCategorization</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Archiving of pages via programs which maintain search mechanisms within and through the program. I use some of them:
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a>, <a href="EverNote.html">EverNote</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AdobeAcrobat.html">AdobeAcrobat</a> (currently part of the <a href="WikiBatics.html">WikiBatics</a> Artifact production and referencing notion) see: <a href="PdfWiki.html">PdfWiki</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PaperPort.html">PaperPort</a> (can produce jpg and pdf pages from scans and can ocr and index information for searching)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> (maintains history of pages access by site, by date, so you can re-visit or re-collect information you may have at the time passed over as being at that time thought to have future value 1RlFv1) You can at that time use the programs listed above to make locally recoverable the information contained. Or !TempFile! a construct which may become useful as a Document used in <a href="WikiBatics.html">WikiBatics</a> as a !RootDocument!.
        </li>
      </ul>
