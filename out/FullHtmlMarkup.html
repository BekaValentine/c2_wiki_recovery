        A <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> that allows users to use the richness of HTML markup, instead of a metalanguage <em>(Isn't 'pidgin' more appropriate?)</em>.

        I think that this is the <a href="SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> for many people, because I find it difficult to remember the syntax of each wiki that I come across.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it would be a good idea to have a simple form of <a href="MarkUp.html">MarkUp</a> for beginners or users in a hurry though - something as minimal as adding paragraph and line breaks. In fact, this is the next feature that I'll implement in my wiki.

        Is there anything other than phpBB that uses BBcode ?

      <p>
        BBcode looks like a small subset of HTML, with square brackets [] instead of angle brackets <>.

        Some <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> (such as <a href="InterFlow.html">InterFlow</a>) do allow full HTML markup.
        There are also some <a href="AlternativeTextFormattingRules.html">AlternativeTextFormattingRules</a>.
        But see
