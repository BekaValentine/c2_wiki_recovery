        I used to call myself an extreme architect (I predicted I may change what I call myself and indeed I have).  I am now <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I quit my corporate job December 15th 2003 and have been woking for my Self since.  I hooked up with some Jungian folks and built some typology software which was a great learning experince ( <a href="http://www.thesoulpurpose.com/insights">http://www.thesoulpurpose.com/insights</a> )
      </p>
      <p>
        I now know there are many simple and valuable software solutions and I am allowing them to manifest through my coding.
        ---
        some pages my architect persona (who called himself Cas) created:
      </p>
      <p>
        Cas is an extreme architect - I may change what I call myself tomorrow.
      </p>
      <p>
        I create (well discover really) structure to manage complexity of building distributed, organic, collaborative systems with a nameless quality.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep things as simple as possible, communication is key to success.  
      </p>
      <p>
        My methodology is extreme - and hard to describe in text, but here goes.
        Consider 3 communities: Business, Management and Technical.
        Imagine 3 balls of different colours - representing each community.  I juggle.  We take a journey, honest about what we know, humble about what we can do, courageous enough to embrace change, courageous enough to be successful.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for modeling - I do it my way.  See <a href="CasMl.html">CasMl</a>, <a href="AnimatedArchitecture.html">AnimatedArchitecture</a> and <a href="ArchitecturePictures.html">ArchitecturePictures</a>.  I even code - see <a href="XmlLite.html">XmlLite</a>.
