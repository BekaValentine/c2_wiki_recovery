        The bestselling guide to assembly language-now updated and expanded to include coverage of Linux
      </p>
      <p>
        This new edition of the bestselling guide to assembly programming now covers DOS and Linux! The Second Edition begins with a highly accessible overview of the internal operations of the Intel-based PC and systematically covers all the steps involved in writing, testing, and debugging assembly programs.
