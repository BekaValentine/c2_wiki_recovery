        Morpheus: Initially a Christian "Father" (God) figure, later becomes a JohnTheBaptist figure of Christian belief.  Gives Neo the RedPill which makes Neo Born Again in a form of Baptism.  Morpheus was the god of dreams.

        Cypher Eating Steak: "I know it's not real, but it tastes like steak". The last supper of Jesus with Judas - "This is my flesh"

        SimulationsAndSimulacra by Bouillard: Neo takes a copy of SimulacraAndSimulations
        from a shelf.  This work by JeanBaudrillard is a deep philosophical treatise on the meaning of reality, and how people are already living in the fourth level of a redirected and simulated world. In the film, the book is not really a book (geddit?) because it is a concealed hiding place for a computer disk containing a virtual world, desired greatly by the druggie type characters he deals with.  The film book's chapter on Reality is not is the same place as in the real book.
