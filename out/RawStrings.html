        Raw Strings
      </h1>
      <p>
        A feature of <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>. A rawstring is a string literal (prefixed with an r) in which the normal escaping rules have been suspended so that everything is a literal.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        print r"//*/*//**" actually prints "//*/*//**"
      </p>
      <p>
        This is incredibly useful for writing readable regular expressions or any string literals that will be processed by other escaping systems such as SQL parsers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Everything? Even the quote character?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No. The end of the string literal is determined as for a non-raw string literal. So \" does not end the literal, but produces two characters. It's not possible for a r" ... " string to contain a " not preceded by a \, and a raw string cannot end with an odd number of \s.
      </p>

        Ditto <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        string s = @"C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>How do I display the string "C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly"; (with the semi-colon)? I assume that </em>some<em> escaping rules still apply? Ditto for Python, how would I show the new line in the String? (If the answer is "you can't, so go back to using normal strings", that's okay)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A semi-colon inside a string (literal or not) doesn't need escaping.  The only character that is parsed within a regular string is the backslash, which must be followed by an escapable character (n, r, t etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What about the quote character?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, to print the string (including the quote character)
      </p>
      <code>
        C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        in C, Java, and related languages, one must say something like
      </p>
      <code>
        string s = "C:\\Wiki\\Suffers\\Fools\\Gladly\"";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In C#, you may still use the @ token to remove the need for all escaping between the quotes.  However, to include a quote character in a string, you must double-quote it:
      </p>
      <code>
        string s = @"C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly"""; // C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly"<br/>
      </code>

        <em>How do I display the string "C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly"; (with the semi-colon)?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, create a "single-quoted" string with a pair of delimiters that don't appear in the string:
      </p>
      <code>
        %q["C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly";]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There I used square brackets, but probably any punctuation but backslashes will do:
      </p>
      <code>
        %q*"C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly";*<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It's a piece of cake in <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> 77, where all strings are raw anyway:
      </p>
      <code>
        '"C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly";'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Strings are delimited by single quotes. To put a single quote within a string, just insert two single quotes:
      </p>
      <code>
        'It''s a piece of cake.'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Well, okay, so maybe I had to "escape" that single quote, but at least Fortrash doesn't worry about backslashes and double quotes.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In <a href="CeePlusPlusEleven.html">CeePlusPlusEleven</a>, raw strings begin R"( and end )":
      </p>
      <code>
        R"(C:\Wiki\Suffers\Fools\Gladly";)"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If your string contains a literal )" you can make the delimiters longer by adding characters between the parens and double quotes:
      </p>
      <code>
        R"blah(C++11 raw strings look like:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        const char *str = R"(foo\bar)";<br/>
        )blah"<br/>
      </code>

        All this "escaping" business makes writing a <a href="QuineProgram.html">QuineProgram</a> a bit tricky.
