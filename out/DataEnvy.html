        Data Envy
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DataEnvy.html">DataEnvy</a> is a code smell similar to <a href="FeatureEnvySmell.html">FeatureEnvySmell</a>, but focused on the Data of the other object.
        The routine that has <a href="DataEnvy.html">DataEnvy</a> typically doesn't use much or any data from its container object.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
      </p>
      <code>
        For Each car As Car In CarList<br/>
        car.Acc = car.GetCurrentAcc(car.Acc, time)<br/>
        car.Speed = car.GetCurrentSpeed(car.Speed, car.Acc, time)<br/>
        car.CurPos = car.GetCurrentposition(car.CurPos, car.Speed, time)            <br/>
        Next<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In this case, the routine is using one reference to a local member, time,
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           references to data in another object, and 3 references to routines in
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        that object.
      </p>
      <p>
        This routine clearly wants to be in the Car object.
      </p>
      <code>
        For Each car As Car In CarList<br/>
        car.CalcCurrentPosition(time)<br/>
        Next<br/>
      </code>
    </div>
