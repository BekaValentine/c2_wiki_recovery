        Acronym Vs Abbreviation
      </h1>

      <code>
        Main Entry: ac�ro�nym:	a word (as NATO, radar, or snafu) formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Main Entry: ab�bre�vi�a�tion:	a shortened form of a written word or phrase used in place of the whole <amt is an abbreviation for amount><br/>
      </code>

        Some say that the distinction between an acronym and an abbreviation is that an abbreviation becomes an acronym if it is pronounced as if it were a word. So NASA, WYSIWYG and CORBA are acronyms while IBM and HTTP are not. SCSI on the other hand is usually pronounced "scuzzy", so would be an acronym. <em>I pronounce IBM as ib-bum, and HTTP as hit-tup, must I still call them abbreviations?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The confusion is apparently caused by different uses of the word "word": is every consecutive sequence of alphabetic characters a word, or does it have to be a pronouncable sequence of syllables? 
      </p>
      <p>
        For an abbreviation to be an acronym it needs to be a) an initialism (to be made up of the heads of its component words: for example the initial letters) and b) it should be treatable as a word.
      </p>
      <p>
        SNAFU satisfies both of these criteria, and so is an acronym. 'Amt' fails to be an acronym for 'Amount' on both counts.

      <code>
        Main Entry: word:	something that is said<br/>
      </code>

        According to this definition single syllables and whole sentences count as words, and written words aren't words until they are spoken, so it has to be a pronouncable sequence.

          WRONG WRONG WRONG: the definition cited is only the first of many (1a, as in: take my <em>word</em> for it), and is not applicable in this context.

      </ul>
      <p>
        PCMCIA (Personal Computer Manufacturers Cannot Invent Acronyms) doesn't count. CORBA, which does not correspond to a word in English nor sound like one, does.
      </p>
      <p>
        According to <a href="http://www.alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxacrony.html">http://www.alt-usage-english.org/excerpts/fxacrony.html</a> an abbreviation "formed from the initial letter or letters of each of the successive parts or major parts of a compound term" is called an "acronym" if pronouncable, an "initialism" otherwise.

        If you insist on calling all abbreviations "acronyms," linguists will chuckle smugly and shake their heads at you. <em>No one else will notice, and it'll keep the linguists amused.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then again, linguists have mostly advanced (or retreated!) beyond both the strict prescriptive and strict descriptive viewpoints; at some juncture, if the usage shifts enough, the distinction will be moot. Word up!
