        Delete Angel
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a special type of <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>, one who goes around cleaning up wiki by deleting test pages, orphan pages, duplicate pages, etc. These good creatures are not malicious and are not <a href="WikiGremlin.html">WikiGremlin</a>s or WikiTrolls, and do not get involved with deletion wars and <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s. They delete purely to make <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> a better and generally neater place for all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike the <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s or <a href="WikiFaeries.html">WikiFaeries</a>, the <a href="DeleteAngel.html">DeleteAngel</a> is less concerned with <em>refactoring and editing</em> content as such and tends only to be concerned with removing unnecessary or inappropriate pages to improve the overall content of <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good <a href="DeleteAngel.html">DeleteAngel</a> adheres to the <a href="DeleteOnceRestoreOnce.html">DeleteOnceRestoreOnce</a> rule and avoids acting like a <a href="DeleteVulture.html">DeleteVulture</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually it's every <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> <em>raison d'etre</em> to improve the overall content of <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>; it is called <a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a>, however, the distinction we're making here is the difference in characteristics of those <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> who perform <a href="WikiMaintenance.html">WikiMaintenance</a> as their main contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        An aspiring <a href="DeleteAngel.html">DeleteAngel</a> might take a look at <a href="IsThisOffTopicPageOk.html">IsThisOffTopicPageOk</a>, then try to remove pages that have no defending arguments and have been listed there for two months or more.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Page deletion has been a touchy subject here on the C2 for over a decade and probby won't become any less volatile any time soon. It is perhaps a bit of a stretch to refer to anyone who deletes Wiki content as an "angel" of any stripe; nonetheless, there persists a real need to delete content that has outlived its usefulness and has no remaining value -- not even historical.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To that end there are a flock of </em><a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s floating about in cyberland trolling through Wiki's shallow waters and plucking out the dead fish found therein. No Wikizen who deletes content without doing all -- and I mean, <strong><em>all</em></strong> -- of the work surrounding a proper deletion can be called anything like an "angel." Just the fact that folk delete content without fixing all of the backlinks first is a serious breech of protocol.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Additionally, the very fact of backlinks indicates that some content should stay. Perhaps this old, moldy, worn-out content should be marked as </em><a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a> for a while before the ambitious <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> attempts to wipe it out. Don't know. Different every case, probby. Your Mileage May Vary. Void Where Prohibited By Law. Seek Professional Help. Do Not Take Internally.<em></em>
