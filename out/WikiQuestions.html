        Sometimes we see unexpected behavior, and can't tell if it reflects a bug, an opportunity for learning, or is just something new for us. Use this page to collect such questions.

        <strong>Q:</strong> Why is the following link perfectly fine here but broken on my site (which is based on <a href="WikiInHyperPerl.html">WikiInHyperPerl</a>)? I also tried it out on my PC running <a href="ActivePerl.html">ActivePerl</a> build 626 (perl v5.6.1) on Apache 1.3.20 and the same broken link.

        I only got up to first ampersand as below.

        <strong>A:</strong> Testing showed (<a href="http://earth.prohosting.com/splina/cgi-bin/splina.cgi?WhereToStayinPerth)">http://earth.prohosting.com/splina/cgi-bin/splina.cgi?WhereToStayinPerth)</a> that the length of the url is irrelevant. So there is a bug in Ward's code (or some obscure compatibility issue between different versions of perl).

        <strong>Q:</strong> Why are IP addresses sometimes name-reversed in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, and sometimes not?

        <strong>Q:</strong> The date and time of the previous edit are shown. Is there any way to find out when the edit before that was made, i.e. the date and time of <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>? <a href="RecentPosts.html">RecentPosts</a> only works for the last <a href="CuplaDays.html">CuplaDays</a>, since it comes from the server logs. My understanding is that both versions of a page (current and <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>) are saved as complete files, not just a file and a diff, so the information should be available. Editing a page again should kick the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> into the <a href="HistoryPages.html">HistoryPages</a>, but the date displayed there seems to be the kick-date, unfortunately. Knowing the date of the <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> can be useful, I think, for instance with <a href="AbandonedHomePage.html">AbandonedHomePage</a>s on which someone did a spelling correction. -- <a href="AalbertTorsius.html">AalbertTorsius</a>
