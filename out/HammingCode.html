        Hamming Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        In short, a <strong>HammingCode</strong> of separation <strong>s</strong> and length <strong>n</strong> is a collection of <strong>n</strong> "words" from an "alphabet" chosen such that every pair of distinct words are at least <strong>s</strong> apart, according to the <a href="HammingDistance.html">HammingDistance</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In slightly more detail ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Take an alphabet <strong>A</strong> and consider the set <strong>W</strong> of all the "words" of length <strong>n</strong> that can be made from it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="HammingDistance.html">HammingDistance</a> <strong>d(,)</strong> between two "words" is the number of places in which they differ.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="HammingCode.html">HammingCode</a> of distance <strong>s</strong> is a subset of <strong>S</strong> of <strong>W</strong> such that for any two words chosen from <strong>S</strong> have a <a href="HammingDistance.html">HammingDistance</a> of at least <strong>s</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <strong>A = {0,1}</strong> and <strong>n=3</strong>, so <strong>|W|=8</strong>. Let <strong>S</strong> be <strong>{000,101,110,011}</strong>, a code obtained by prepending the parity to each of <strong>{00,01,10,11}</strong>.  <strong>S</strong> has separation 2 and single-bit errors in transmission can be detected.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let <strong>A = {0,1}</strong> and <strong>n=7</strong>, so <strong>|W|=128</strong>. It is possible to find a set S of separation 3 and size 16 in this case. Furthermore, the set <strong>S</strong> can be chosen such that the bottom four bits of the code words are the binary representation of the numbers 0 to 15. It's like the parity example, but harder, and bigger.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Motivation:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If a word is transmitted and some bits are corrupted, we would like to know and, if possible, be able to recover the original. Given a <a href="HammingCode.html">HammingCode</a> of separation 3 we can always recover from a single-bit error. Given a <a href="HammingCode.html">HammingCode</a> of separation 4 we can always recover from a single-bit error, and detect a double-bit error.

        Not a crystal clear explanation, but it can be expanded.
