        Which day of the week should <a href="GeekNight.html">GeekNight</a> be held on?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="MichaelRoyle.html">MichaelRoyle</a> - Saturday morning 8 am.  Just kidding Thursday.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ChrisTarttelin.html">ChrisTarttelin</a> reckons Thursday.  He never makes it though, so what does that count.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="DarrenHobbs.html">DarrenHobbs</a> also reckons Thursday.  He also never makes it though, so what does that count.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="MikeMason.html">MikeMason</a> has never made it since joining TW, since he drives to Hemel. But earlier in the week is probably better than later in the week, and with him not turning up until 7:30 being acceptable would be nice.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="JimArnold.html">JimArnold</a> - Wednesday.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="StevePurcell.html">StevePurcell</a> votes for Wednesday, as a shot of insanity healthily placed mid-week.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TomAyerst.html">TomAyerst</a> - Wednesday.  Not Tuesday 'cos of XTC and I do family stuff on Thursday (which is why I've never been yet).
