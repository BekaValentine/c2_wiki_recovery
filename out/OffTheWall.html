        Off The Wall
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>adjective phrase</em> meaning random, without benefit of due process. Said of a remark or utterance. The greater the apparent lack of connection between the current circumstance and a remark, the more off-the-wall is the remark. <em>Zany</em> and <em>crazy</em> are near-synonyms, but these terms carry an air of lunacy missing from "off-the-wall"; it can be difficult to distinguish an off-the-wall utterance from a serious remark based on delivery alone.
