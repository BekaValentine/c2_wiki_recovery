        Spooner is famous for spoonerisms, which are accidentally humorous transpositions of sounds. For instance, <a href="StackSmashing.html">StackSmashing</a> and <a href="SmackStashing.html">SmackStashing</a>, or <em>Would you like a hazel nut?</em> and <em>Would you like a nasal hut?</em>.

        Does that page contain him scolding a student?

        [Note: "town drain" via "down train", which goes from Oxford to London. In both Oxford and Cambridge one <em>comes up</em> to university and <em>goes down</em> from University. To be <em>sent down</em> is to be expelled. See "GOING DOWN / UP" in <a href="http://www.prosperityfg.com.html">http://www.prosperityfg.com.html</a> - ed]

        The only Spoonerism recorded (as opposed to merely attributed) occurred in 1879 at the New College Chapel when announcing the next hymn as: "Kinquering Congs their titles take."  Quoted in The New Penguin Dictionary of Quotations by J M Cohen (1992) page 403.

        There is a story that he also spoonerized <em>actions</em>: when someone accidentally spilled some salt at table, the story goes that he carefully poured a little red wine on it, to give that characteristic little pile of pink salt that adds colour to so many dinner parties :-)
