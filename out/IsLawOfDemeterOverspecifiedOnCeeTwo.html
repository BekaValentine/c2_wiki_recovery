        Is Law Of Demeter Overspecified On Cee Two
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many of the arguments on this Wiki about whether <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> might be invalid or need to be reformulated seem to me to be based on the original way the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> was described at <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>, but is that an accurate description of the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>, or is that someone's particular recipe for implementing it?
      </p>
      <p>
        I take my understanding of the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> from <a href="ThePragmaticProgrammer.html">ThePragmaticProgrammer</a> by <a href="AndrewHunt.html">AndrewHunt</a> and <a href="DavidThomas.html">DavidThomas</a>, and it says nothing more than to have the minimum number of interactions with outside code necessary to perform the task.  The implication is that -how- you accomplish that is a matter of implementation, not definition.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this light, I humbly suggest that all the discussions about problems and reformulations of the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> be refactored to be arguments about better and worse strategies for implementing the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>, and how best to define the minimum number of interactions with outside code necessary to perform a task in a reasonable way.
