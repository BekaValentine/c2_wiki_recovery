      <p>
        Messages are asynchronously added to a work queue and are removed and processed in <a href="FirstInFirstOut.html">FirstInFirstOut</a> order by a group of one or more independent processes. Typically used where there is a high degree of independence in the processing of the messages and the work necessary for each message is time consuming so the advantages of the parallelism outweigh the complexity.
