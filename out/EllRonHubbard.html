      <p>
        L. Ron Hubbard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Noted and rather prolific science fiction author, founder of the Church of Scientology.  Once remarked that the "fastest way to get rich is to start your own religion".  Many joke that he took his own advice, though apparently that theory has been discredited.

        Note that the Church of Scientology has proven its willingness to zealously pursue lawsuits against those critical of the organization. This is especially true in public forums, or anywhere their reputation could be (further) damaged.

        Putting up a page whose essential content is "someone with whom I disagree and I feel I must criticize" is kind of a waste of bandwidth.

        Some of his non-fiction, at least, is internally consistent and coherent.  It doesn't comply with many popular memes, but that's to be expected.

        L. Ron Hubbard is more controversial than, for example, Isaac Asimov, so opinions tend to be strong. Ironically, this is not due to L. Ron's writing, but to Scientology and Scientology's practices. Most non-Scientology readers find his writing adequate for <a href="SciFi.html">SciFi</a>, but are far more critical of the religion. The exception is the book "Dianetics", which many argue is simply Scientology propaganda. While Scientology's litigiousness can be worrisome, they tend to go mostly after former members and those posting copyrighted materials.  It would be nice to discuss the author without the Scientology inclusion, but that's not the reality we exist in.
