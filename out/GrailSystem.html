        Grail System
      </h1>
      <p>
        Interactive computing system developed by <a href="RandCorporation.html">RandCorporation</a> for AdvancedResearchProjectsAgency in the sixties. It's an early and very pure example of a <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a> system: all user interaction was through a graphical CathodeRayTube display and the first modern GraphicsTablet. The computer used was an <a href="IbmSystemThreeSixty.html">IbmSystemThreeSixty</a>/44. (The 360 was dedicated to supporting a single GRAIL terminal, making it an enormously expensive <a href="PersonalComputer.html">PersonalComputer</a>. Like the <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a> work that came after it, GRAIL was explicitly intended to use a lavish hardware budget to explore the possiblities of computer systems that would become affordable later.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The system provided the user with <a href="GrailLanguage.html">GrailLanguage</a>, a high-level, flowchart-based <a href="GraphicalProgrammingLanguage.html">GraphicalProgrammingLanguage</a> descended from <a href="JossLanguage.html">JossLanguage</a>. The user drew and labelled the flowchart using the stylus; the system performed incremental shape and printed-character recognition on the user's input. As with <a href="SketchPad.html">SketchPad</a> insightful <a href="InteractionDesign.html">InteractionDesign</a>, clever SystemsProgramming and then-lavish but now-miserly computer resources seem to have combined to produce a capable system with an intuitive and radically clean <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a>.

        GRAIL is one of the systems credited by <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> as an influence on <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>; see <a href="EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk.html">EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk</a>.

           The 1969 RAND reports on GRAIL:
