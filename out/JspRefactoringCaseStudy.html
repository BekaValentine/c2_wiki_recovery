        Jsp Refactoring Case Study
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>The Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The role of programmer (in this context) consists of a number of duties:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Writing JSPs and HTML
        </li>
        <li>
           Writing database insert scripts
        </li>
        <li>
           Writing XML or XSLT documents
        </li>
        <li>
           Writing Java code
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We don't practice <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, and don't have many unit or acceptance tests. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The requirements consisted initially of a few screenshots from Visio showing an example of each page in the application. The application is a Web front end to a content management and distribution server.
      </p>
      <p>
        This design did not include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the DataSource for dynamic data
        </li>
        <li>
           the <a href="ExpectedResult.html">ExpectedResult</a> (i.e. next page) of clicking on a link
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The defacto design pattern in use was <a href="StandaloneJsp.html">StandaloneJsp</a>.

        <em>The Ranting</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am, for the most part, expected to turn out code which plugs 
        straight into the existing platform. Whether it's a JSP-based report, 
        custom Java or JSP plugin, or even a number of interrelated 
        components, the standard way of testing is to add it to the platform, 
        turn it on, and see if it works. I might get to do this a few times 
        on my local machine before it gets deployed to the test server, after 
        which any problem becomes a bug report which goes straight to my 
        mailbox if I'm lucky. If it's a bad bug someone will tell me verbally 
        instead.

        I have trouble writing <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s, rather than <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. Every time I try to write an acceptance test, I get six lines in, realize how much set-up there is and give up. The test is simply too big. I wonder whether an emphasis on unit tests makes it too 
        difficult to write good acceptance tests.

        I have the same problem, but with my unit tests. I get six lines in, realise how much set-up there is and give up. [I'm working mainly with servlets and JSPs. I've tried Catcus, but I spend five minutes, realise how much setup there is and give up. Shame on me.]

      <p>
        <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s are a different story, and are perfect for <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>. An example:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Write (or preferably get a Web designer to write) a static version of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Write a Junit test to check the response and basic structure of the page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Write a test for a piece of dynamic content or expected UI action response.
        </li>
        <li>
           Add the dynamic data or action handler.
        </li>
        <li>
           Run the tests and repeat 3-5 until done.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Step 4 can (and should) lead to further refactorings, which can open up the possibility of having a reasonably defined "unit" which is capable of being tested independently. But if 5 passes then the pressure to move onto 3 (or maybe even straight to 4) for the next bit of functionality is very strong (at least in my world)...

        A couple of years ago I
        tried to refactor a large messy Java (partly J2EE) application, and it 
        was a disaster. The code ended up so full of bugs it was unusable, after 
        around 3 months of my time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reasons were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I wrote lots of unit tests, but they didn't cover the code base sufficiently to catch all the bugs I was introducing in my refactorings, let alone the bugs that were already there.
        </li>
        <li>
           I was inexperienced with unit testing and refactoring, not skillful enough to take on this size of a problem, and didn't realize it until too late.
        </li>
        <li>
           I didn't use an automated refactoring tool, and that might have prevented many refactoring mistakes.
        </li>
        <li>
           the code had a fair number of bugs in before I started.
        </li>
        <li>
           I had no acceptance (whole application) tests, manual or otherwise.
        </li>
        <li>
           I was not releasing partially refactored versions for manual testing by users - the horrible mess of bugs was only discovered at the end.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I am happy to say that I think I learnt from this experience. I am 
        currently refactoring another application, and everything is working well.
        Some things I have done differently:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           starting with acceptance tests that test the whole application end-to-end.
        </li>
        <li>
           doing manual testing until I can get tests automated.
        </li>
        <li>
           releasing to end users often (at least once a month, usually every 2 weeks) - they find the bugs my tests miss, which so far hasn't been many.
        </li>
        <li>
           I am now more skillful with unit testing and refactoring after much practice over the past couple of years.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It helped that the codebase didn't have many bugs in to start with.
