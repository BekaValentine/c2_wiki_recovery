      <p>
        You've presented paragraph after paragraph of beautifully-honed, achingly-rational arguments of scintillating potency; each phrase is a glowing nugget of pure logic that clearly illuminates your indubitable correctness.  Surely, <em>surely</em> that last paragraph <em>must</em> have convinced your opponent that you are right.  If only he weren't such a stubborn, ill-educated, ego-centric bastard and a blithering idiot, he'd admit it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas, your opponent has responded to every one of your shining gems of wisdom with ill-conceived rubbish, hasty quibbles, non-sequiturs, jaw-dropping misunderstandings, and millions of bytes of stinky <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> tripe that are clearly the written equivalent of poking fingers in his ears and shouting, "la la la la la LA LA LA I'M NOT LISTENING!!! LA la LA!"

        You've been arguing like this on Wiki for days; maybe even weeks.  It's going nowhere, the page passed into <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> long ago, old points are being recycled endlessly, and it's becoming obvious your opponent is never, ever, <em>ever</em> going to give up, give in, or pay the slightest attention to what you're writing.  You'd like to <a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a>, but there's no way you're going to give the clueless goof that much credit.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Funny thing:  Your opponent feels exactly the same way about you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe, just maybe, it's time you both agreed to a <a href="CeaseFire.html">CeaseFire</a> and moved on?
