        I think this page is fine. It's supposed to bring the person up short - this over reaction to perceived slights happens all the time, in my experience, especially on media like here or Usenet. Sometimes, you need a strong hint that <a href="ItsNotThatImportant.html">ItsNotThatImportant</a>... --<a href="PaulHudson.html">PaulHudson</a>

        In a consulting "how to" text (<em>Helping the Client</em>, John Heron) I encountered the phrase ConventionalInertia.  It refers to an unwillingness to change that is not deeply rooted in any feelings of loss or anything like that.  Just habit.  Just a stickiness to the way things are that's inherent in things.  It's easy to overcome ConventionalInertia because of its low sticky index.  All you have to do is become aware of it.

        <a href="LetItBe.html">LetItBe</a>, <a href="ItsNotThatImportant.html">ItsNotThatImportant</a> and <a href="DontSweatTheSmallStuff.html">DontSweatTheSmallStuff</a> are all variations on advice for getting past ConventionalInertia.  They don't work so well on deeply rooted (deeply felt) problems, though.
