        Dis Connectivity
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was in the train this morning working on a post for my blog. Lost in the "outercyberspace", no network at all... completely disconnected.
      </p>
      <p>
        It came to me that with all those wireless devices that are coming to life, connectivity of our applications is not really the question. Getting all those applications to work in a flow of <a href="DisConnectivity.html">DisConnectivity</a> is. How do we get software to work when connected to a network and keep working when disconnected?
      </p>

        Anybody share the same feeling with all those cellphones, PDAs and <a href="TabletPc.html">TabletPc</a>s?
