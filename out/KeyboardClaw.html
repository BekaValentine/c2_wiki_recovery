        A subset of the <a href="ShortCut.html">ShortCut</a>s, are the <a href="KeyboardClaw.html">KeyboardClaw</a>s: the odd contortions which computers sometimes require.
        If we were to engrave this page in stone, it could become the digital <a href="RosettaStone.html">RosettaStone</a> of the ThirdMillennium.

           Control-Alt-Backspace takes the X server out of the air on Linux, sometimes logging the user out. Extremely useful when Netscape has again frozen the display. If you run XDM, a new X server will be spawn immediately, so this is in general the fastest way to get out of a frozen-system situation. Much faster than rebooting with <a href="CtrlAltDelete.html">CtrlAltDelete</a>. <em>Though see the following.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               AltSysRq in Linux 2.2 can be pressed together with various keys to set the console logging level, dump system status to the screen, reset the keyboard driver when it's in raw mode, kill (presumably misbehaving) processes in various ways, and shut down or reboot the system. Much more flexible than <a href="CtrlAltDelete.html">CtrlAltDelete</a>, and less likely to cause data loss - as long as you press the right third key. <em>This is called the magic sysreq key. Always incredibly handy. It also can prevent data loss as well, because one of the functions lets you sync your disks before rebooting to escape a crash.</em>

               Ctrl-Shift-2-Rept was (?) the historical claw to get unpunched tape out of a teletype. IBM cards were often punched on a handpunch where you pushed one, two or three buttons down at one time: kerunge.

           Left Alt-Shift-Tilde (~) is supposed to return you to the US English on Windows 2000 when in a different locale. Conveniently, this default doesn't work on a (Shift-JIS?) Japanese keyboard. I remapped it to Ctrl-Shift-1. And switched keyboards. "nippon<SPACE><ENTER>" is good enough for me.

           KVM switches for PCs typically have a claw combo for switching console screens. The one I have requires this charming dance: Ctrl-Alt-Shift, then the number of the console to switch to, and then <ENTER>. It usually takes me a couple tries to activate it.

        <a href="LeoScott.html">LeoScott</a> had an opportunity to attend a demo of some software running on a minicomputer using a particularly baroque color terminal. The gentleman giving the demo had the audacity to brag that his software <em>could not be crashed.</em> Having some familiarity with the terminal and guessing that the software might not be able to handle everything the terminal could spit at it, he proceeded to use all ten of his fingers to press various keys, causing the terminal to send a rapid stream of characters to the computer. Needing to press just one more key to cause the terminal to send <em>really</em> fast, he leaned over and pressed the eleventh key with his nose. The gentleman's software promptly blew chunks. Leo calls this "rolling your nose on the keyboard." It was the ultimate <a href="KeyboardClaw.html">KeyboardClaw</a>.

           Mozart once bet Haydn a case of champagne that his older colleague could not play at sight a piece, which he had composed earlier that day. When Haydn accepted, the score was placed on the spinet rack and Haydn began to play. After the first few bars, he suddenly stopped: the composition apparently required that the hands play at opposite ends of the keyboard while a note was struck at its center. Haydn conceded momentary defeat, whereupon Mozart took his turn at the piano. Upon reaching the impossible note, he bent forward - and struck it with his nose.

        On the <a href="KinesisKeyboard.html">KinesisKeyboard</a> the Control, Alt, and Delete keys are adjacent to each other (in the left thumb area). With a bit of practice you can hit all of them with one finger. This can be satisfying sometimes. :-)

        I want a keyboard with a red button under a flip-up clear plastic cover. Flip the cover up, mash the button, reboot. I don't need it as much as when I was running WinDOS, but Netscape does tend to take the X Server down - keyboard and all - in Linux. This of course means the button can't be a key per se, but just a remote reset button such as is on the front of the case (which is quite out of reach beneath the desk). There's a human factors lesson in there somewhere.

        The <a href="AcornArchimedes.html">AcornArchimedes</a> machines had proprietary keyboards with a large (but sufficiently recessed) reset button at the back, next to where the mouse plugged in. This had a dedicated wire within the cable, so it could trigger a motherboard reset even if the keyboard wasn't being read.

        <em>The TRS-80 Model III had an orange reset button on the top right of the keyboard, recessed in its own little well. It provoked much curiosity among those unfamiliar with computers.

        Ever since my VAX days (where I had to keep track of the difference between CtrlC and CtrlY), I've wanted a VelocitySensedKeyboard - so that a moderate press of some interesting key (like Return) caused a simple line break. A harder press would cause a suspension of output (like CtrlS), and a still harder stroke would interrupt execution of the current process. Really whacking the key would, of course, force a reboot. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>

        <em>Hmmm, I tend to keyboard in a concert-piano style, and I think this is analogous to hitting the final chord and watching your piano disappear through a trapdoor. So I vote this suggestion as something evil that must be stopped. More on track, I'm always surprised how many critical systems reboot if you unplug the system-console.</em>

        I remember people always complaining about the weird keyboard claws the Apple engineers came up with for various boot-time commands. (e.g. command+option+C+D to boot from CD.) It made sense, though. They were designed so that they wouldn't happen accidentally or because of a bad keyboard. Now they've all been simplified (e.g., just hold down C to boot from CD). I wonder if they now get appreciably more support calls because of this. -- <a href="RobertFisher.html">RobertFisher</a>
