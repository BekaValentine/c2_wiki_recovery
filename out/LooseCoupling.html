      </h1>
      <p>
        The purpose of certain patterns seems to be to reduce coupling between certain things. The <a href="BridgePattern.html">BridgePattern</a> comes to mind. The advantage seems to be the ability to change one of the things without affecting the other any more than necessary.
        <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> seems focused on supporting loose coupling of large components of systems.
