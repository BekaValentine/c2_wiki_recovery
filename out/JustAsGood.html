        <a href="EarlyAdopter.html">EarlyAdopter</a>s tend to make ValueJudgements about new products.  For most other people, however, there will be considerable inertia when already using one product or technique.  This does not necessarily mean someone is a StickInTheMud.  <strong>Therefore</strong>, if people are going to move, you need to show them not that your product is <a href="JustAsGood.html">JustAsGood</a>, but ways in which it is actually <em>better</em> than the way they do things.
