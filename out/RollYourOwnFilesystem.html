        Antipattern
      </p>
      <p>
        Causes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pride
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Driving Forces:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Windows has historically had poor archiving libraries.
        </li>
        <li>
           Littering the filesystem with hundreds of tiny files is not really a good idea.
        </li>
        <li>
           ZIP imposes both structure and compression, which may not be what you want.
        </li>
        <li>
           The tried-and-true UNIX archive formats usually have odd issues on Windows and aren't seekable if compressed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Insufficient filesystem support for metadata other than a couple of dates and a few flags.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Description:
        A custom written file format for storing other files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
        Most videogames.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variants:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The renamed zip file. (docx, new fla, swc, xlsx)
          <ul>
            <li>
               This is not actually a bad idea -- document should be one file so it's not split by copying.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Sometimes happens recursively.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Avoiding the antipattern:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>
        </li>

        <em>Littering the filesystem with hundreds of tiny files is not really a good idea</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This really depends greatly on the filesystem. As noted in InterNetNews: Usenet Transport for Internet Sites, by Rich Salz, (<a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sa92/salz.pdf)">http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/sa92/salz.pdf)</a> it depends greatly on how you operate on the filesystem, and to some extent on the filesystem design. There are now many choices for filesystems that are optimized for rapid open/read/close of many tiny files.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yeah, but the OS and Applications filesystem (remember most examples are Windows) isn't that.</em>
