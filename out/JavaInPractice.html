        Review from Amazon: Presents a set of design principles that provide elegant solutions to commonly encountered Java programming problems. Nigel Warren and Phil Bishop discuss the effect of the use of Java within design and have distilled their own extensive experience into a number of rules, design principles and tips which will help you to write better and quicker Java.

        The authors have taken a novel approach by slowly introducing the forces that result in strong idioms in Java code, what one reviewer called "itertively developing examples". Starting from simple code examples they introduce the forces resulting in well founded Idioms. This gives their code examples the benefit of apparent simplicity whilst introducing some very deep and testing problems that Java developers will undoubtedly come across in their day to day work.

        By slowly adding the forces acting on a particular problem and showing how these change the example code, they walk the reader down the path of a complex argument in a simple and easy to understand way. Resulting in pattern rich code that is of professional quality whilst retaining a simple form and being highly readable. This results in a much more interesting and fulfilling learning experience than that presented by the patterns reference works, or the myriad of basic Java Language books.
