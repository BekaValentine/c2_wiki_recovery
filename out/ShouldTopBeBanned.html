        <em>Let's have this issue out once and for all since many discussions seem to return to the same theme.</em>

      <p>
        I was enthusiastic about c2 years ago. I stopped posting any of my opinions about software development years ago. I just cannot stand the idiotic flaming.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still read c2, usually through <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Sometimes I use it for reference, for which purpose it is usually good.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there is no way I would bother with any of my approaches to software development. It just aint worth it.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regard to the present discussion, I know Top has some very good ideas. I also know that the RKs of the world also have some very good ideas. The constant to-and-froing of people like these reminds me of the early days, when there was always a healthy argument between the fortranners and the cobolers. Never the twain shall meet.

        I agree that we shouldn't dismiss an opinion merely because we do not wish to embrace it. That's quite different from dismissing an opinion on the basis that there is no sound or valid justification for it. Sometimes <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> has good ideas, and I don't hesitate to acknowledge those. RK was full of interesting ideas, though he was also an emotional powder-keg with a vicious streak who left about six months before I arrived (I chatted him up, later). But <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> also likes to weigh in on subjects in which '<a href="UnconsciousIncompetence.html">UnconsciousIncompetence</a>' is a relatively positive description of his expertise (DeliberateIncompetence would often be more accurate). And if he has trouble following a counter-argument due to his incompetence, he shifts blame to everyone else - blame the 'academics' and 'ivy leagers', blame the anti-toppie conspiracy, blame <em>anything</em> but himself. Sometimes he even  claims to be speaking <em>for</em> 'the masses' and 'the practitioners' arrogantly voting himself representative. (You won't see me speaking 'for' academics.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite the fact that I acknowledge and respect some of <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s ideas (I refuse to dismiss ideas merely because they come from fools, babes, or <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>), I cannot respect <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> <strong>as a member of this society</strong>. I truly, honestly, believe he's of net negative impact and believe he should have been banned years before I joined <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>, and I suspect the only reason he wasn't banned is that he was somehow 'grandfathered' in by people unwilling to ban members of the 'old guard'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow, this present discussion isn't about whether Top has good ideas now and again. Nope. This isn't about insulting <em>ideas</em>. This is about behavior, and habit.

        <em>I know many of you want this to be an </em>'academics-only wiki, but it is not<strong>. Ward has NOT declared that scope limit.

If </strong><a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> matters, the practitioner mind can't be dismissed anyhow just to simplify your equations. Software and design issues are as much <strong>for people</strong> as they are machines. You have to design hammers with carpenters in mind, not physics teachers. This means you have to work with carpenters to test your theories. It may be uncomfortable, but necessary.

           <em>Science is the study of the natural universe.  How can anyone kill you with science if programming is not really a science? For example in order to prove to you that number types exist, what does science offer us in regards to number types? Nothing. Science doesn't study number types. Math is not really science.  How about relational theory? that's again mathematical, not a study of the natural universe.  Since programming contains math, and since many people have tried to kill you with math, why don't you listen to any of the mathematical arguments such as: "math has types, so programming must also". Since math has number types, logically programming must also have number types. That's a fact. Programming contains math within it - any time you add two numbers, you are using math in programming.  You argue that you want a programming language that is typeless or type free. You are arguing against math. Math is very old and has thousands of years of success to back it up. You are rejecting math. Your request for people to kill you with science isn't something we can always do, because programming is not as much of a science, since science studies the NATURAL universe around us. We can only kill you with logic and math. But if you don't understand math how can one kill you with it until you first understand it? There are plenty of logical arguments against Goto's like the structured programming articles, and these articles contain strong reasoning.  You argue that programming is just psychology anyway. So we have to kill you with psychology, not science or math? You keep moving the goal posts. One day you support math, the next day it's just psychology and not about math.</em>

           Re: "You argue that you want a programming language that is typeless or type free." - Actually I want a programming language that is type-tag-free. Whether that encompasses all "types" depends on the definition of "type", which nobody can define unambiguously, and some of you seemed to eventually agree with. Sure, they have patterns and tendencies, but that's not necessarily unambiguous, and not how most definitions are written. Further, complaining about vague definitions is not necessarily the same as complaining about something as a useful tool. Something can be useful without being well-defined, such as life (<a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a>). -t

           <em>For the 20 years or so that I've been using a computer, I've never once cared whether or not types are implemented using tags, flags, or  pattern matching.  I wouldn't reject a programming language just because they used structs to store type information instead of using integers. The implementation details of a type system have nothing to do with understanding what types are. Your obsession of how a type is implemented doesn't make much sense to anyone on this wiki. I don't care if it uses flags or pylons underneath - even if the type system used Goto statements at a low level for some reason, that wouldn't change </em>'what types are<strong> and it wouldn't change the </strong>understanding of types<em>'.</em>

           The "side tag" is a model, not necessarily an implementation. Ideally we want a definition, but nobody has proposed a solid one yet, so for now I'll stick with the model.

           You haven't done a decent survey and I haven't done a decent survey to see how many are "happy" with the current definitions. Thus, we have insufficient info to confirm or deny your statement. Most in the industry probably don't give a rat's ass: they just make tools and software that do useful things and move on. However, for academic and debate purposes, a more precise definition would be helpful. "I know an X when I see an X" is not the ideal state of a concept definition, and most academics and fellow IT pedantics will likely agree with me on this. -t

          <em>A child can easily understand types by looking at apples and oranges, which are different types of fruit. Does an apple or orange have a type tag in its molecular structure? Who cares? Even if it did use tags inside the molecules to ensure the apple really was an apple via its tag, that would be an implementation detail that the child need not be concerned about. The child doesn't care if apples are composed of Ions, tags, molecules, Atoms, or blood and gore. The child concerns himself with the fundamental understanding of what </em>'types of fruit<strong> are at a </strong>high level<strong>. There are different TYPES of apples, regardless of whether apples are made of molecules, ions, tags, and/or atoms. A child can </strong>easily<strong> tell an apple and orange apart from each other since they are different </strong>types<strong> of fruit. Whether or not the apple contains an apple molecule </strong>marker<strong>, flag, pylon, or </strong>tag<strong> at a microscopic level, doesn't matter when trying to </strong>understand types<em>'. He's not using a microscope to distinguish the apple from the orange, and even if he did use a microscope, there would be no apple tag sitting inside the apple at a microscopic level, it would just be a binary blob of atoms/molecules/ions. That is a low level detail whether or not something uses a tag to differentiate itself. In the universe, it just so happens there are no type "tags" or flags inside the apple or orange. And one does not need to understand tags or flags in order to distinguish between different types of fruit. The molecular composition of a fruit is what distinguishes it from another type of fruit. An apple has a different molecular composition than an orange, making it a different type of fruit - without any tags in the implementation! Who cares if the apple contained a type tag to differentiate it from the orange? Why would would someone understanding types need to understand low level tags?</em>

           We already discussed and agreed in <a href="TopsTypeDeterminatorChallenge.html">TopsTypeDeterminatorChallenge</a> that "I know a type when I see it" exists and there is a rough agreement among the population about knowing "it" when they see "it".

Why would I care if it uses tags or cee structs to store type info? It's an implementation detail; it doesn't determine whether the type system is useful or not. Does </strong><a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> use tags to differentiate between procedures and functions? Procedures and functions are different things.. functions return a value, procedures do not. Could you use tags to differentiate between proc and a func? Who CARES!  I don't really give a damn, and I wouldn't stop using Cee just because the compiler used tags rather than structs or some other storage to differentiate between include/define directives. Whether a "tag" is even a good description of what is happening underneath the hood is another question too. Whether you can actually implement a type system without some kind of storage (tag?) is another question: what are you trying to gain by avoiding types/tags/whatever you call it? Where did you even pull this tag/flag idea from - why would someone even care about whether an apple and orange at a low level are differentiated between a molecular pattern, or a tag? It's not relevant to understanding what types are. To understand what types are, all you have to do is look at different types of fruit - it's that easy. Real easy for a layman: do fruits have different tags inside them at a molecular level? Well they have different compositions of atoms/molecules, but not a tag storage in them.  Tags just aren't a relevant detail to understanding at a high level what types are. It's important to distinguish between low level implementation details versus high level human concepts, for creeps sake.<em></em>

           Re: "There are plenty of logical arguments against Goto's like the structured programming articles, and these articles contain strong reasoning." - No they don't. Their reasoning appears to assume a model of human thought, which has not been validated via experiments. I might agree that their model reflects how my particular mind works, but that's not an objective statement and can't be extrapolated to other minds with any reliability. Their "steps" are something implied to happen in a human mind, not in the computer. Thus, validating their model requires a study of <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, not machines and not pure math. Math doesn't read code, humans do (and computers don't care whether we use Goto's or blocks for a given algorithm). If I am not mistaken, the "Harmful" paper generated enough controversy about its argument approach that ACM reconsidered their focus, and shifted more toward hardware-centric issues and descriptions of novel algorithms to avoid <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>-related controversies. Thus, if the "goto" issue is your idea of "strong reasoning", we have a big problem here. Related: <a href="TopsToolObjectivityChallenge.html">TopsToolObjectivityChallenge</a> -t

           <em>(cont'd) The articles do contain reasoning about why jumping around with gotos is not good - It's called unstructured programming. I'm not talking about the "GOTO CONSIDERED HARMFUL" article, I'm talking about the whole branch of programming known as "structured programming" which came about decades ago. "Notes on structured programming" and other articles like "structured programming with gotos" by Knuth. One can write a paper that logically demolishes unstructured programming (using massive GOTOs) without running lab experiments! that's the difference between math and science. Science wastes a lot of time with experimenting, whereas math can use logic and reasoning without experimentation, saving humans a lot of time. Math proofs are done without lab experiments. You can prove someone wrong in math without doing experiments! That's the beauty of math and the problem with science; science requires tedious testing and experimentation of the mess we live in (the universe). You didn't run experiments to ensure your math was correct; if you did, you wasted lots of time! Math isn't a physical science. Neither does the relational model deal with the physical universe. Why run continuous experiments and labs to test the relational model to see if it is superior at a logical level compared to XML/trees/navigational db's? Do you think we should be running these experiments right now in labs? Likewise, why run experiments on Gotos if we already demolished unstructured programming decades ago. You still think that it just boils down to psychology or human differences. That's sad, very sad that you misunderstand logic and reasoning so much, and confuse it with psychology.

           It appears relational caught on at least in part because a bunch test sample queries were more compact and more understandable to coders than the CODYSAL query systems of the times. Thus, it was a combo of <a href="ArgumentFromPopularity.html">ArgumentFromPopularity</a> ("we like it") and an informal code-size metric (less query code). That was the recollection of one of the early enthusiasts at IBM. See <a href="HistoryOfRelational.html">HistoryOfRelational</a>. (Code size can possibly be considered an objective metric.

           How we allocate resources for human goals is a political + economic issue, i.e., <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>. Science never dictates behavior in the absolute. All it can do is find the best way to achieve a given goal if the input resources and output good-ness criteria are well-defined. Thus, science will never dictate "blow up the moon" without a stated context. But it can help find the least expensive and/or quickest approach IF your goal is to blow up the moon, and you can define your resource optimization metrics in a clear way.

        Hi!

      <p>
        I'm new here (just passing by). I think you're all a bunch of cowards for not manning up the courage to boot a constantly disruptive troll. I just wasted an entire day mezmerized by the resulting slo-mo train wreckage. It was entertaining, in a schadenfreude kind of way.
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea of this wiki is good, but any online gathering place that will not deal with trolls will eventually be killed by them. I'm guessing that's what happened here. I wouldn't want to invest anything into joining this community (if it's still alive), simply because it seems trolls have free reign here. 
      </p>
      <p>

        [I haven't seen anger against you for years.  I've seen some frustration, but that's not because you are killing anyone's "sacred cow or cash cow".  Indeed, like most technical people, I think C2 participants are sufficiently anarchical to appreciate a really good sacred cow (or cash cow) killing.  However, sacred cows are killed by weight of evidence and cutting logic, neither of which your usual arguments bring.  Your arguments are not "scrutiny" in any rigorous sense -- which would be great -- but are merely superficial (and frequently emotional) objections, i.e., they're slightly more verbose ways of saying "it sucks!"  This seems especially the case with facilities -- recently, <a href="HigherOrderFunctions.html">HigherOrderFunctions</a> or <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>; historically, OO and polymorphism -- that as software engineers and computer scientists, we know they work and would much rather focus debate on the genuinely interesting controversies in the field rather than defend useful and established facilities against your naïve, weakly justified, poorly evidenced, and blatantly reactionary criticism.]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Such arrogance and hypocrisy. And I don't know why you reference OOP and polymorphism, I was largely right about it from the beginning: it's usefulness is limited to specific situations, and the industry as a whole generally came to agree. The OO fans of the time made the same accusations against me that you are making now ("Us smart/educated/academic people get it, but you don't"). Same lame <strong>anti-scientific</strong> song and dance. And my argument against <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> was NOT that they are "bad" per se, but rather that you were relying almost entirely on <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> to condemn those who question its use (because the evidence is locked up and proprietary for non-OSS DB's).  <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> is still all you have.

That and over a decade of continuous industry use of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, and the source code for PostgreSQL and MySQL which demonstrate the same performance profile as closed-source DBMSs.  If any vendor made a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementation so flawed that it permitted SQL injection, I'm sure the industry would not have let it forget it.  Regarding OOP and polymorphism in particular, I'm was referring to your argument was in favour of "if" statements over polymorphism.  The "industry as a whole" most certainly does not agree with that.]

Your premise was that they should be sued and/or fired for not accepting the vendor's word at face value. THAT'S FUCKING RIDICULOUS. I am confident most readers will agree that was a stupid stance of yours. And machine performance wasn't the main debate issue.

           Reruns, sigh. You cannot verify how a given commercial vendor actually implements them. Further, we don't know if they'd be honest if a breach was found. I don't trust MS, Oracle, etc. to be forthright. They are known spinners. <strong>A true study would NOT rely on vendor honesty</strong>. Further, I don't know of any breach of established filter-oriented packages, such as [forgot the damned name].

It would be major IT news that a vendor couldn't possibly keep quiet.  We also know exactly how <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are implemented; they're established technology implemented in a conventional way that results in a recognised performance profile.  That profile is the same whether the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementation is <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> -- in which we can see how it's implemented -- or a commercial version.  The performance profile is a clear indicator that the vendor has used convention in implementing <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  <strong>All</strong> available evidence suggests <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are more secure than filters.  Even the makers of the filters whose name you've forgotten -- the OWASP ESAPI -- explicitly recommend against their own filters in favour of using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  Given their recognition in the industry, and given the preponderance of evidence in favour of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and against using filters, it seems clear that deliberately using your homespun filters (which they probably are, if you can't remember the OWASP ESAPI) instead of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is a deliberate rejection of a more secure mechanism in favour of a less secure mechanism.  It wouldn't even matter if <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> were only <strong>slightly</strong> more secure than filters, your choice of a less secure mechanism over a more secure one -- when all else is equal, though <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are actually simpler than <a href="DynamicSql.html">DynamicSql</a> on the client side of the DBMS because they don't need to invoke filters -- is a sackable offence.]

As far as the performance profile, that's rather indirect evidence. Plus, you didn't cite the numeric results of such performance tests. Perhaps a professional <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> expert could make a reasonable assessment of such an implementation claim, but the vast majority of custom business software development shops are NOT going to have many <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> experts.

We rely on authority all the time, because without it we would be fumbling in the dark, struggling to figure out how to do things that the authorities know how to do.  Likewise, OWASP have devoted the effort, manpower, expertise and resources that most of us lack into learning about Web security, and so we rely on then to provide reliable, useful results and advice that result in better Web security.

The pattern appears to be that fastidious academic-oriented personalities are frustrated that the industry doesn't take their pet concepts or high-abstraction programming seriously, and they take that frustration out on me because to them I represent the "typical field mentality" that rejects their high-falutin' ideas or ideals. They cannot call up random practitioners in the industry to chew them out for "doing it wrong", so instead they focus all their frustration on me: I'm the most accessible specimen of this <strong>"field mentality" they despise so much</strong>.

You tend to obsess on narrow pet factors and magnify their importance in your head for reasons that are so very unclear to the reader.

I was very successful as a practitioner in the field, developing -- among other things -- custom business software.  One of the reasons for that is that I was quite competent at balancing and weighing multitudes of factors.  However, those factors included knowledge of the aspects of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> that I suspect you consider "academic-oriented".  Those "academic-oriented" aspects exist for a reason -- they directly impact software reliability, simplicity, API usability, flexibility, provability, and performance.  All of those translate directly into meeting requirements.  My clients liked the fact that I met their requirements -- especially the often-unstated but always assumed ones like performance and reliability (which derives, to a certain degree, from provability) -- and that I could deliver them quickly, which comes from simplicity, API usability, and flexibility.  I can appreciate that you feel I ignore human factors -- what you usually call <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> and economic considerations, as I recall -- but I do not.  I simply focus on the human factors that are directly relevant -- like UI design, responsiveness, and ensuring my software makes my clients happy.

           Well, that's anecdotes that I nor the reader have any way to verify, barring hiring a private detective. Everybody on the web claims to be great, smart, and rich such that it would be prudent to take such claims with a grain of salt. Note that the difference between successful projects and unsuccessful projects that I have direct control over usually has to do with understanding what the users/customers really want. Fancy (internal) coding or speed is not where I see the most snags. In one frustrating case, we improved a tool after reading a user survey and questionnaire. Adding the features they asked for made it too confusing to use such that we went back to mostly the old way. Sometimes it takes pure luck to get the features and interface balance just right. I need a mind reader, not a HOF. Also, maintenance issues are more important than creation issues in the longer run. One can often trade long-term for short-term. Paul Graham's system was eventually rewritten in more conventional languages because they couldn't find enough people who could sufficiently grok the Lisp code.

           <em>It sounds like the projects you typically work on have complex business and business rules requirements, but simple technical requirements.  Fair enough.

The management assumption was that Lisp code would be too hard to grok and so they headed off what they believed would become a problem, not that they found a problem and had to correct it.</em>

        <li>
           I generally agree with your "business rules" assessment. We are generally "gluers": we glue together text search engines, chart/graph engines, random number generator libraries, GUI kits, etc. to build custom software. rather than make these from scratch. But we probably disagree about the frequency of each. I believe there are far more gluers than glue makers. (And I'm not sure it's just about "complex" business rules, but often about murky and/or quickly-changing business rules.)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Are you saying they didn't try? I'm pretty sure a lot of high-level people considered the huge costs of rewriting lots of existing working production code.

           <em>Apparently, they didn't.  In </em><a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a>'s own words: "A friend of mine ... went to interview [at Yahoo Stores] in about 2000. He said they told him they didn't need Lisp hackers, because they were going to port the Store Editor to C++. Why? Because they didn't think they'd be able to find Lisp hackers."  I doubt a lot of high-level people were involved.  Like most high-level executive decisions, it was probably down to the individual responsible for that division's "vision".  One can easily imagine a non-technical executive believing the stereotypes of the time: Lisp is an obscure interpreted language with funny syntax and too many brackets, and it was invented in the 1950s so it must be obsolete, but C++ is <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>, compiled, current, and everybody knows it.  Therefore, C++ is an obvious choice.<em></em>

           That anecdote is a lot of indirection: "Paul said a friend said his interviewer said that management said...". The rest of your statement seems highly speculative. More likely I suspect they realized they couldn't find enough Lisp expert with prior <em>practical</em> paid Lisp experience. Organizations highly value paid experience in the very tool they are targeting because they want a proven track record in that tool, not just general programming or IT. I agree they often over-do the specificity, but it is common that the final decision makers are not technical enough to judge the usefulness of "similar enough" claims. It is perhaps a form of <a href="QwertySyndrome.html">QwertySyndrome</a>, but Lisp has had far more shots at bat than almost every other partial failure (in terms of popularity), such that I don't feel sorry for it. You and Paul should form a FP/Lisp development shop and leverage their alleged power to kick all the other consulting shop butts even after the original founder(s) leaves. That would prove success is <strong>about the tools</strong> and not the nature of the founders or their first team and/or right-time-at-right-place luck.

        [By the way, in response to your original "prove thin tables" are better, my response was this:  How do you distinguish a "thin table" from a non-"thin table"?  The only logically interesting table degrees are 0, 1, and n.  At what 'n' do we have a thin table, and at what 'n' do we have a non-thin table?  Of course, a table that requires nulls to represent missing column values introduces potential logical inconsistencies, and in general, higher normal forms are preferable to lower normal forms as higher normal forms are less subject to update anomalies.  On the other hand, an increased number of joins may result in performance issues in performance-constrained environments, so there isn't a "prove thin tables" that means some (undefined?) degree is unconditionally better than some other (undefined?) degree, at least not without the qualifications that I've just given.]
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as "update anomalies" I see trade-offs, not solid rules. See <a href="TableQuantityVersusAppSize.html">TableQuantityVersusAppSize</a>. I agree to factor out known, clear, and stable duplication. However, there's a hell of a lot of grey area and crystal ball failures in the real world.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I don't think there's a meaningful discussion to be had here until the distinction between a "thin table" and a non-"thin table" is determined.  I agree that the appropriate level of normalisation is dependent on the requirements.  For most "conventional" business applications, 3NF is fine.  For some applications, particularly involving temporal data, only 6NF is even possible.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I mentioned that it was situational and that I didn't wish to make any concrete "always do X" rules. Anyhow, didn't we once agree that if the DB was powerful and well-designed enough, then thin-versus-thick would be a view-oriented decision rather than a either/or decision? In other words, a "table" would always be a virtual construct (or there would be no visible distinction between a view and a table). It was one of the few times we actually agreed on something. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        [Indeed, and I don't think what I wrote above contradicts that.  It is entirely reasonable to construct a schema in 6NF and use views to present what a user expects.]
      </p>
      <p>
        "Possible" and "made convenient" are not the same thing. I believe somebody else agreed that existing designs don't make virtual-ness very easy from the update side of things.
      </p>
      <p>
        [True, most DBMSs do not support update-through-views, or only support it in a limited fashion.  Whether this is a limitation or not depends on the requirements.  In many implementations it's a non-issue, because updates are only done -- by software -- on base tables.  Views are used to present a friendly schema to the people creating reports, which perform no updates.]
