        Concepts Difficult To Define
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are some concepts that just seem inherently difficult to define in a clear way, yet most humans have an "intuition" about what they mean. These include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Complexity (<a href="ComplexityMetrics.html">ComplexityMetrics</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           "Pattern"
        </li>
        <li>
           Syntax - Perhaps because it is tied to "pattern" (<a href="WhyTypeSyntax.html">WhyTypeSyntax</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Syntax, at least in </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, is <strong>not</strong> difficult to define clearly.  It is no more and no less than the rules governing the formation of sentences in a language.  This was made entirely clear on <a href="WhyTypeSyntax.html">WhyTypeSyntax</a>.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
