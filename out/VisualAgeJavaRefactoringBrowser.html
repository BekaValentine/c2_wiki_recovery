        Visual Age Java Refactoring Browser
      </h1>
      <p>
        IBM has a feature request to add some sort of refactoring capability to <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>, similar to the various refactoring tools for Java (<a href="RefactoringBrowserForJava.html">RefactoringBrowserForJava</a>) or the <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> for Smalltalk.

        Description:	There is an excellent book about java refactoring by<br/>
        <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>. It would be great if at least some of the <br/>
        refactorings can be supported by <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> for <a href="JavaIde.html">JavaIde</a>.  Ex. <br/>
        rename field, rename method, rename class, move field, move <br/>
        method, self encapsulate field, inline method, extract<br/>
        method... <br/>

        Can you help us prioritize the refactoring that we should do. It is not<br/>
        feasible to implement the entire book. ie: rename field, rename method, rename<br/>
        class, move field, move method, self encapsulate field, inline method, extract<br/>
        method... What are the five or ten most important. Thanks  <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So what are the five or ten most important refactorings when <a href="RefactoringInJava.html">RefactoringInJava</a>?

      </p>
      <p>
        Note: max of 10 votes per voter since IBM is asking for 10 most important. 
        Adding a new refactoring and voting for it only counts as one vote.

        IMHO, this may be the wrong attitude.  We say we shouldn't haggle with 
        customers, yet here we are as customers, haggling.  I suggest that either each 
        refactoring is worth defending on its own merits, or it isn't.  If you accept 
        that, then instead of haggling over a top 10, we should be raising feature 
        requests for each of the most important refactorings.  
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, perhaps there is more value in AutomatedRefactorings if there
        are lots of them, so perhaps starting with a top 10 is a good thing.  On the 
        other other hand, breaking down our request into smaller chunks may make it 
        easier for IBM to chew through it.

        I think most of these could be done, in some form, using the IDE Tools 
        facilities already provided by the environment. Perhaps some of us could get at 
        least a demo going, and then point the IBM folks at *that*. Or even offer that 
        to the <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> community as an independent offering. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>

        They make VAAssist, an IDE addon for <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> for Java.  
        One of its features is the ability to move methods via <a href="DragAndDrop.html">DragAndDrop</a>.  
        They are very responsive to feature requests.  --<a href="AveryRegier.html">AveryRegier</a>
