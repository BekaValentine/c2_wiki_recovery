        <strong>Multi-Nested Roll-Up Report Markup Language Proposal</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done enough "multi-nested" reports with totals and subtotals with both row-wise and column-wise groupings, totals, averages, etc. that it feels like there should be a tool to make building and formatting such reports easier. The banded approach is no longer sufficient. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a rough attempt to explore a potential "report markup language" for such reports.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a general example:
      </p>
      <code>
        <datasource file="myFile.csv" filetype="CSV"><br/>
        <row field="field_2" span="yes" align="center"><br/>
        ...Field 2 Title<br/>
        ...<row field="field_3"><br/>
        ......Field 3 Title<br/>
        ......<column list="2006,2007,2008" span="yes"><br/>
        .........<column field="field_4" onNull="N/A"><br/>
        .........Field 4 Title<br/>
        .........</column><br/>
        .........<sum>Sub-Total</sum><br/>
        .........<average divzero="N/A">Avg.</average><br/>
        ......</column><br/>
        ...</row><br/>
        ...<sum color="silver">Total</sum><br/>
        </row><br/>
      </code>

        <strong>Attribute and Tag Descriptions</strong>  (Not all shown in example)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>append (tag)</em> - A kind of string-equivalent of "sum" where string items are appended to form a kind of list. A space is placed after the delemiter unless "space=no". (This seems like an odd feature, but quite useful.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>calc (tag)</em> - To provide custom calculations. Can be used in conjunction with "hidden" and "name" to provide complex calculations. Example: <calc leftname="foo" rightname="bar" operator="*"> The order of "calc" and statistic tags determines calculation order (within a group).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>count (tag)</em> - Count for the group
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>delimiter</em> - Character for delimiter if a list is given or appended to. Default is comma.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>divzero</em> - Value to display if division by zero would otherwise occur. Default is "div/0".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>displayfield</em> - Optional field used for display value if calculation field is not well-suited for display. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>fillfrom</em> - List values based on all values from the specified item (as specified by "name" attribute). Otherwise, only the current context is used. This can help provide consistently-repeating sub-items and zero- or blank-filling those not present.  (Difficult to describe without an example.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>hidden</em> - To suppress display of an item. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>list</em> - A list of values as an alternative to to a database column ("field").  If both a field and a list is specified, then both are used with the list values coming first.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>onBlank</em> - value to display if cell value is blank.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>onNull</em> - Value to display if cell value is null (blank is default).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>onZero</em> - Value to display if cell value is zero.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>name</em> - Used to reference a row or column by other tags or attributes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>span</em> - Tells the value to span any inside columns if a grouped level. Otherwise, the value is repeated for each inner instance (if any).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>suffix</em> - Suffix appended to displayed value. Example "%" used indicate percent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>weightedavg (tag)</em> - Similar to "average" tag, except it is a weighted average. (Perhaps the "calc" tag is good enough to avoid the need for this.) Example: <weightedavg scalefield="empcount">
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also, the location of the titles probably need a bunch of position option tags because there are various ways they can potentially be placed. Paper-based options also need to be addressed (no-page-span, keep-with-group, etc.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Tags for statistics such as median, standard-deviation, etc. could also be included. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Field" is used to refer to input table columns to avoid confusion with report "columns".
      </p>
      <p>
        For now, the input table/sheet is assumed to be pre-sorted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, multi-nestedness is often a design smell in this day and age as click-able interactive "drill-down" web interfaces can be built rather than try to squeeze all combinations onto a single page. However, the boss/client/user sometimes wants things a certain way and it's not our job to stop them, beyond advice.

        This seems like a fine pursuit. I'm interested in developing something similar for user-configurable hovertext in an OCU. Hooking the RDL into the <a href="DataModel.html">DataModel</a> will probably require greater work, as will numeric formatting and measurement conversions (e.g. Celcius to Fahrenheit). -- <a href="GreenHat.html">GreenHat</a>

        But, <a href="ReportsSmell.html">ReportsSmell</a> -- <a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't believe so, but I'll take up my objections on that page.
