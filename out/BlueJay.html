        BlueJ is a closed source, no cost <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> <a href="JavaIde.html">JavaIde</a> specifically designed for learning. It is fundamentally visual, you see all the classes in a project, and inheritance/composition relations displayed in a visual workspace. Also, there's no need to have a wrapper class for a main() method and I/O at all -- you can instantiate any object, any time, and those instances also appear visually on a workbench, and you call their methods directly via a context menu, inspecting the results. It hardly gets more interactive than that, and you can teach/learn OOP concepts and programming fundamentals without having to digress into API / support platform calls for a single second.

        We had great fun playing around with BlueJ, but is there something like it for other languages?

           <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>'s <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> 2005 (<a href="VisualStudioWhidbey.html">VisualStudioWhidbey</a>) offers an ObjectBench just like <a href="BlueJay.html">BlueJay</a>'s -- except it's called an ObjectTestBench.

           I'm not sure that's quite accurate.  <a href="BlueJay.html">BlueJay</a> is primarily a <a href="GraphicalProgrammingLanguage.html">GraphicalProgrammingLanguage</a> for <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, built on a <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a>-flavoured "icons on strings" metaphor and intended for teaching purposes.  Is there an equivalent for <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>?

      <p>
        Can this be done on C++ without writing your own interpreter, or adding lots of metadata to the user code?
