        Value Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="ValueObjectHypotheses.html">ValueObjectHypotheses</a>, someone asks:
      </p>
      <p>
        Can anybody think of a good reason for holding a reference to a reference object within a value object?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's my example:
      </p>
      <p>
        I define an interface: MemoryAddress. This is an index into a Memory. Users of the MemoryAddress interface see objects as values.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, life isn't so simple in the implementation of the object. In my
        application, a memory address isn't simply a number. It is defined by a
        section plus an offset. A locator tool can take abstract sections and
        locate them in physical memory. The physical memory in which a section
        is located effects its performance characteristics (e.g. is the memory
        cacheable?). My application is a tool for performance analysis and
        optimization: sections and memories are definitely reference objects
        that are manipulated.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the part of my code that emulates the execution of code, and accesses
        to data only handles addresses. The MemoryAddress interface gives the
        object a <a href="ValueInterface.html">ValueInterface</a>, even though the object the implements that
        interface might be a <a href="ReferenceObject.html">ReferenceObject</a>. The fact that manipulating
        sections changes the physical address is irrelevant because
        the identity is unchanged, and the users of the interface never see
        the actual physical address. The Interface defines equivalence classes
        over the object's state.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user of the <a href="ShlaerMellorMethod.html">ShlaerMellorMethod</a>, I see the separation of the
        views in terms of different subject matter domains. In one domain,
        the address is a value; in the other it's an object.
      </p>

        "Can anybody think of a good reason for holding a reference to a reference object within a value object?"
      </p>
      <p>
        How about a <em>capability</em>.  A capability encapsulates permissions to perform actions on a <a href="ReferenceObject.html">ReferenceObject</a>, and so holds a reference to the target object and a bit-set of operations that the owner of the capability is allowed to invoke.  A capability is a <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> because the owner of a capability must not be able to change the permissions that they have been given, but may create more restrictive capabilities to be handed over to other parties.
