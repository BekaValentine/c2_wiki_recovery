        When developing with a new API, write a test that verifies your expectation of how that API will behave.

        I think the terms are distinct. I've read <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a> book now (highly recommended, I showed it to my CEO, but I don't think he got what I was getting at!) and I tend to do <a href="LearningTest.html">LearningTest</a>[s] to explore a problem domain - not necessarily as a precursor to refactoring. The example given about <a href="MikeClark.html">MikeClark</a> is something that is documenting knowledge about a system as per <a href="CharacterizationTest.html">CharacterizationTest</a>[s], but those would typically be put in place as a safety net when refactoring. With <a href="LearningTest.html">LearningTest</a>, there is no intent to refactor - just document.
