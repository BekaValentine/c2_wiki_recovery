        Bio Analogies
      </h1>
      <p>
        Borrowing from General Systems Theory, object oriented programming could be enriched with some biological metaphors. That is, software as information processing in a cell, an organ, a body, a community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some possibly useful concepts: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           compartmentalisation
        </li>
        <li>
           permeable membranes
        </li>
        <li>
           multiple parallel units
        </li>
        <li>
           more emphasis on processes than objects
        </li>
        <li>
           reacting to environmental conditions
        </li>
        <li>
           homeostasis, distributed control
        </li>
        <li>
           self-repair and adaptation
        </li>
        <li>
           autonomy
        </li>
        <li>
           affect and effect (see <a href="AffectVsEffect.html">AffectVsEffect</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           inter-object communication
        </li>
        <li>
           communication spaces (eg, local and global)
        </li>
        <li>
           "transmitters" (local communication)
        </li>
        <li>
           "hormones" (global messages, receptor targets)
        </li>
        <li>
           immune systems 
        </li>
        <li>
           metabolisms
        </li>
        <li>
           nervous systems
        </li>
        <li>
           "energy" or "currency" economies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nothing outstandingly new, but it would be good if these were built into the programming language from the ground up.

        What you are suggesting I think is a set of existing analogies which may be useful in software.  Fair enough, but only much use if you are already well steeped in these analogies....
      </p>
      <p>
        The way cells handle information is in a different league from the way we as programmers 'design'.  One of the big underlying differences is that code is fragile, whereas feedback in cells means that a disruption to the basic data is partially corrected by feedback mechanisms and becomes an opportunity for change.  Biologists are familiar with multiple interacting levels of feedback systems, in a way that programmers are not - <em>yet</em>.
