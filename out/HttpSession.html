        'Provides a way to identify a user across more than one page request or visit to a Web site and to store information about that user.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The servlet container uses this interface to create a session between an HTTP client and an HTTP server. The session persists for a specified time period, across more than one connection or page request from the user. A session usually corresponds to one user, who may visit a site many times. The server can maintain a session in many ways such as using cookies or rewriting URLs. </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This interface allows servlets to 
          <ul>
            <li>
               View and manipulate information about a session, such as the session identifier, creation time, and last accessed time 
            </li>
            <li>
               Bind objects to sessions, allowing user information to persist across multiple user connections 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>When an application stores an object in or removes an object from a session, the session checks whether the object implements </em>HttpSessionBindingListener. If it does, the servlet notifies the object that it has been bound to or unbound from the session. <em></em>
        <em>A servlet should be able to handle cases in which the client does not choose to join a session, such as when cookies are intentionally turned off. Until the client joins the session, isNew returns true. If the client chooses not to join the session, getSession will return a different session on each request, and isNew will always return true.</em> 
        <em>Session information is scoped only to the current web application (</em>ServletContext), so information stored in one context will not be directly visible in another.<em> </em>
