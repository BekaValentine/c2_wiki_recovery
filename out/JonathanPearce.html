        This horribly antiquated page is the highest ranked link about me in a Google search of 'Jonathan Pearce'. That is highly sad. In a pitiable attempt to rectify this, I have decided to edit this WikiTopic.

        My new web home is <a href="http://www.jonathan.pearce.name/.">http://www.jonathan.pearce.name/.</a> It is full of exciting and interesting information about myself, Jonathan David Pearce, also known as Dwindlehop. Much good may it do you.
