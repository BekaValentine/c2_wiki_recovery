        A lot of people I know have two or more computers.  Typically they have a computer for RealWork, which often is a mac, or a linux machine (or in one case a machine running <a href="BeOs.html">BeOs</a>).  Then they might have other computers for fun or work, like a freebsd file server, openbsd firewall, old sun or <a href="SiliconGraphics.html">SiliconGraphics</a> workstation.  And then, most of them have their <a href="GameBox.html">GameBox</a>, a machine soley for playing games and watching dvds, and maybe using it to covert that one pesky word file that most non microsoft wordprocessors choke on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Really?  When I heard </em><a href="GameBox.html">GameBox</a> I thought of Playstation or Dreamcast.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also known as a <a href="LegacyBox.html">LegacyBox</a> when it's slower and runs older OSes in an attempt to play classic games like X-Com: UFO Defense that don't run on newer systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Another name for a </em><a href="LegacyBox.html">LegacyBox</a> is a RetroPc. An alternative solution is to write a 386 CpuSimulator, and some hardware simulators and tie everything together so you can run WingCommander (the first one) in a window on your G4 iMac (assuming, that is, you have a G4 iMac, a copy of DOS, the time to put together the simulators, and a copy of WingCommander).<em></em>

        There's <a href="MsVirtualPc.html">MsVirtualPc</a>... haven't tried WingCommander yet, wonder how it'd run.
