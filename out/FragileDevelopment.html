        I came across the phrase <a href="IgnoranceDrivenDevelopment.html">IgnoranceDrivenDevelopment</a> by <em></em><a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a><em> and thought I would add another term to the </em><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> vocabulary. -- <em></em><a href="SelvakumarGanesan.html">SelvakumarGanesan</a><em></em>

        <em>A lovely phrase.  Would you care to fill in a meaning, or should it be left to the reader's imagination?</em>

        The meaning of <a href="FragileDevelopment.html">FragileDevelopment</a>. It is like biological evolution in a sense. The developmental team tries to reach the nearest peak - blindly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine a blind man trapped in an underground cave that is slowly filling with water (It is a sinister analogy. But, aren't developers quite like blind men let loose into Projects by <a href="ProjectManagement.html">ProjectManagement</a>). There are a few raised platforms inside the cave and in a corner there are stairs that lead outside. How does he find a solution? Blindly, of course. His natural endowments aren't very helpful here except for his hands and feet. He mucks around the cave and by chance hits the nearest platform and climbs over it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        That sort of explains how <a href="FragileDevelopment.html">FragileDevelopment</a> happens. Blind and without foresight.

        Building a system so complex and hideous that it can not be reliably installed, configured or maintained. In addition the entire system will collapse into a smoldering pile if you so much as look at it funny.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, let's talk about a hypothetical system *cough* that I might be working on in some bizarre alternate universe... This hypothetical web-based system might rely on 4 or 5 external network-based components. There would be the database, customer entitlement checking, calls to JSPs to work around clustering problems unique to web based systems, and a few other network-based services.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now some of those components might rely heavily on run-time based Java. For example, if some engineers were to get clever and try to work around process, they might create a system by which message processing is configured by injecting an XML message, complete with a serialized Java class, into a server. Said message would then be made persistent and accessible by the entire cluster. Clever, and highly prone to runtime errors. It's a good thing we keep those engineers on a tight leash, yep...
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore if we used a development process that was unfriendly to documentation (Say, Scrum) and rotated our engineers out every few months as was the fashion during the dot-com boom, well then we'd have a system that no one knew it its entirety, was extremely prone to run-time failures and errors in external components and which could not, in general circumstances, be kept up for more than a day or two at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm glad this is an entirely hypothetical discussion, yep...

        Honestly, I worked in a shop where this actually happened.
        Boss: "Fix this program."
        New hire me: "What is it supposed to do?"
        Boss: "Read the program."
        New hire me: "Is there any documentation?"
        Boss: "No."
        And, there were no reliable comments in the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So, you: "Where's the nearest door?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There's no such thing as a reliable comment. However, if the system had no tests demonstrating how it <em>does</em> work, and no docs demonstrating how it <em>should</em> work...! For the record, I think my response (if not "Where's the nearest door?") would have been "OK, so what do you <em>want</em> it to do?" (Probably followed by: Boss: "I don't have time to explain it." Me: "OK. Get back to me when this is enough if a priority that you're willing to think about what you want.")
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been in this situation once or twice, though I'm happy to say it hasn't occurred often.
