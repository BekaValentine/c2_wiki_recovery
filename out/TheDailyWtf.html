        From the evil demons that brought you <a href="HowToWriteUnmaintainableCode.html">HowToWriteUnmaintainableCode</a>, it's The Daily WTF, now known as <a href="WorseThanFailure.html">WorseThanFailure</a>, <a href="http://worsethanfailure.com/">http://worsethanfailure.com/</a>

        An excerpt:  "...some of you may not know what strIDWho contains.  Why, it's a comma separated list of the IDs of staff members from tblStaff.  Unless it involves the whole staff, in which there's a 0.  Or if it involves someone outside the staff, it's a -1, a comma, and then a list of the names involved. Or a -2 for the entire programming department. Or a -3 for the entire web department. So a typical value in this column is '-2, 2, 4, 5, -1, Jim and Jane Douchebag.'"
