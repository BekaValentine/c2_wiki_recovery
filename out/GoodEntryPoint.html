        Good Entry Point

      <p>
        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> consists of many thousands of pages, each almost equally important.  Even the <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a> isn't <em>that</em> special.  As a result people stumble into this site at some random point, presumably something relevant to a Web search.  These visitors don't initially have the context provided by the page's neighbors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Turning this on its head, it becomes a problem for those wishing to create a <a href="ValuablePage.html">ValuablePage</a> for a broad section of the reading population.

        Perhaps it is easier to describe the nature of a <a href="GoodEntryPoint.html">GoodEntryPoint</a> than it is to prescribe <a href="WhenToCreatePages.html">WhenToCreatePages</a>?

        <li>
           a useful set of <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s or FanOut of <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s is probably the best way to get a visitor started.

           a one-liner probably isn't so useful.

        <em>The aim was to describe the usefulness of making any and all of the pages here into </em><a href="GoodEntryPoint.html">GoodEntryPoint</a>s to the Wiki, rather than having a couple of specially designated <a href="StartingPoints.html">StartingPoints</a> <em>[see also: </em><a href="WikiFrontDoor.html">WikiFrontDoor</a>]<em> and letting the rest be incomprehensible to the new visitor.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The important distinction, I think, is that each page should be a good entry point </em>'to that particular group of pages<em>', </em>i.e.<em> the content.  Whether the page is a good entry point to a wiki in general is another question, and this is discussed on various pages.</em>

        Then again, maybe we're better off just using the Wiki instead of talking about it so much. -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>
