      <p>
        Has almost 40 years experience in software programming. Specializes in migrating existing (legacy) application programs to alternate (newer) platforms. Began with doing IBM 1401 conversions to /360. Presently, has developed a technology that allows for the migration of COBOL programs onto a Java based platform. Refer to <a href="http://www.altcode.com">http://www.altcode.com</a> for more details.

        Hmmm... non-COBOL routines assumed to be in C... how do you test the migrated code and prove it's functionality is not damaged?
      </p>

        <em>We run the COBOL code in native format. Refer to </em><a href="http://www.altcode.com">http://www.altcode.com</a> for more details<em>  </em>
