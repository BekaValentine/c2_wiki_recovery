        Science Does Not Dictate Behavior
      </h1>
      <p>
        People often suggest that "science (or logic) says we should do X". Science does not do that, at least not without qualifiers. At best it may say, "If you do X, the probability of Y happening is Z". Science dictating behavior is often used in the topics of environmental management, sexual preferences, political ideals, and others. Science predicts outcomes; it does not "say" what absolute behavior "should be". If you want to optimize happiness, then science may be able to provide models for testing and measuring happiness, but ultimately what to optimize and what metrics are used for the measurements are a subjective decision. --top
