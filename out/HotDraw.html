        "It's Hot, It's Hot." <a href="WardAndKent.html">WardAndKent</a> repeated to each other. It was the <a href="GroupSelect.html">GroupSelect</a> and drag that was hot. It was flicker-free. They had carefully CachedBitmaps, minimized their <a href="RefreshRectangles.html">RefreshRectangles</a> and <a href="DoubleBuffer.html">DoubleBuffer</a>-ed the display. The test case was an offset stack of rectangles with every other one selected. The smooth motion made the 2-1/2D jump to life. RobDuesberg took one version up to <a href="UniversityOfWashington.html">UniversityOfWashington</a> where Bjorn Freeman-Benson put it in front of a constraint system he was building for AlanBorning. Bjorn now has an editor called <a href="CoolDraw.html">CoolDraw</a>. Must be cool.

        <a href="MikeMiller.html">MikeMiller</a> made sure the labs goodie library got packaged up with the last version of TekSmalltalk ever shipped. I guess that's how <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a> made it to Europe where a lot of enhancement and conversion got done.
