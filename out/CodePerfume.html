      <p>
        If <a href="CodeDeodorant.html">CodeDeodorant</a> is a coding pattern/principle removes a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> without removing its cause, then <a href="CodePerfume.html">CodePerfume</a> is one of those <a href="CodeDeodorant.html">CodeDeodorant</a>s that introduces its own <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s even while masking others. 
      </p>
      <p>
        An example is <a href="TellDontAsk.html">TellDontAsk</a>, especially when implemented in an <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> language with <em>closed</em> class  definitions (i.e. where programmers cannot modify the methods of an object without modifying the source-code of that object's class). <a href="TellDontAsk.html">TellDontAsk</a> masks a <a href="FeatureEnvy.html">FeatureEnvy</a> smell, but introduces other smells by both violating the <a href="OneResponsibilityRule.html">OneResponsibilityRule</a> and tightly coupling the class vocabulary to the project that uses it - a serious blow to reuse and modularity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the ability to choose <em>how</em> the <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s is an advantage. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As with those sticks of underarm deodorants we can purchase in real life, it is likely that most <a href="CodeDeodorant.html">CodeDeodorant</a> is at least slightly 'perfumed' and will introduce its own <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s.
