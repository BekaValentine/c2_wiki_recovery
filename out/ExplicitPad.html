        Explicit Pad
      </h1>
      <p>
        The use of an explicit pad is to manage risk.  Often tasks are known ahead of time to be very risky. Some management refuses to accept pads which leads to <a href="MeaninglessTasks.html">MeaninglessTasks</a>, but instead the use of explicit pads is preferred. This is a practice which seems to be used at Microsoft and wisely acknowledges that some tasks are too risky not to explicitly budget time to do it again. -- <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        On <a href="ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation.html">ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation</a> we have a few tricks that relate to this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           We estimate tasks by analogy with others, using the history of the other to predict the new. This reduces the variance from "no idea" to "some idea".
        </li>
        <li>
           We estimate the number of tasks that we <em>do not</em> yet have in hand, and factor the size of the plan accordingly. This is more acceptable to management as an <a href="ExplicitPad.html">ExplicitPad</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           We use <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> early on to find out how easy or hard a risky task is. We call this <a href="WorstThingsFirst.html">WorstThingsFirst</a>.
