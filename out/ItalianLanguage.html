        Italian Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        I love the <a href="ItalianLanguage.html">ItalianLanguage</a>.  It sounds so lyrical.  And I especially love greeting people with Ciao bella (or bello if appropriate, but my American upbringing leads me to mainly only use this greeting form with women).  I wish I new more than just how to say hi.  Time to consider studying the <a href="LatinLanguage.html">LatinLanguage</a> I guess.

        Italian has a similar feel (actually, I always felt that Latin carried the grave liturgical overtones of Sanskrit), and is probably easier wrt grammar. And it's living as well. Interesting random fact: TeluguLanguage is speciously called the 'Italian of the East' because all the words end in a vowel! -- <a href="TheerasakPhotha.html">TheerasakPhotha</a>
