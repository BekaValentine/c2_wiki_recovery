        Dave, there's one thing I don't understand. When the shark zaps the GV edits - hooray - why doesn't it also edit <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> to remove its own spam? -- Pete

        Well it didn't occur to me till today either. I confess to feeling rather stupid but then ... I am rather stupid so that's really not so bad I guess. I've really enjoyed the last few days of GV-ess-ness and it would be very cool if RC was like that all the time ...

        I recommend not editing with your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie set.

        <em></em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> is <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> agnostic. <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> is not. He has, it would appear, spoofed your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> on more than one occasion to make your edit and his edit appear to be the same overall edit in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Hence, I would encourage you to not edit with your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie set, because the "<a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>" that appears in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> isn't necessarily (entirely) you.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By the way, there are obvious flaws to using this as a </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> bug report channel (quick, Anon, report <strong>every</strong> page), so I would like to ask that all further reports be sent to me via email as specified on my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>. Anonymous and/or unverifiable reports will be given a brief but courteous reply, but will otherwise be ignored. Presentations of opinion or suggestions will be duly read and considered, but quibbles and arguments will not be entertained or sustained.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, your shark should only revert an edit if it consists of <em>nothing</em> but nitpicks. Dave, I don't envy you the position you are taking on yourself: arbiter of all gnoming. -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a>

        <em></em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> is intended to revert edits by banned individuals, thus enforcing the ban. Whether a banned individual makes picayune edits or writes a solid proof that P = NP, the effect will be the same.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      <p>
        Sorry if I have missed something more important, but is spamming in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> the most significant reason you are reverting the careful work of individual by bot? To me it seems unbalanced emotional response that does not help to grow wiki. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Among the reasons listed toward the end of the </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> page, none is more significant than another, though the last one is certainly offensive. However, the reason for developing the 'bot is more fundamental: <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> is subject to a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>. Comments were made that there is no way to enforce a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>; now there is.

      <p>
        <em>It seems to me, by the way, that Wiki grows from contributions, not punctuation changes. Does changing '--' to '-', or "useable" to "usable", help grow Wiki?

        I recognize <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> as free game; if you wish to fight, do so. As You have better command of English than myself, I assume You are not against improving grammar here, but enforcing social norms. For various reasons I do not frequent wiki in last years, but too accurate grammar was never one of them. I would still suggest looking at each edit, to verify if text got better because of it. In many cases it's like that. -- <a href="GirtsKalnins.html">GirtsKalnins</a> (delete thread when read)

        <em>I am certainly not against the improvement of grammar or anything else. In this case, however, the improvement (or not) of text is not the issue. For reasons listed on the </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> page, he is <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>ned. The ban is enforced. The content, therefore, is irrelevant. Had <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> not obviously acted in an anti-community manner, he would not have been banned, and he would be free to improve Wiki. Now, the improvements will be done by others.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        Any chance of a shark-vetted spin-off of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> - either a black-list-filtered one that shows all edits that haven't been made or reversed by <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, or a white-list one that shows the edits that have been passed by <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, again omitting edits by the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> itself? If the current situation has come down to a contest of patience between Anon and the rest of Wiki, then anything that makes the wait less unpleasant for the rest of us is conducive to victory as well as comfort.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'bot is a collection of heuristics. As such, it can and sometimes does trigger a false positive, in almost precisely the same manner that virus scanners and the like sometimes trigger a false positive. I will tune the heuristics to hopefully reduce the likelihood of this occurring in the future.

        A confirmation: Yes, I, <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a> came up with the ChangesIn<Week> pages, to replace the old ChangesIn<Month> pages when the monthly pages started to get crazy big.

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have it set to auto-revert ChangesInWeekNineteen, and I don't recall using the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> to manually revert any edit to ChangesInWeekNineteen, though it's possible (but rather unlikely) that I did so in a fit of absent-mindedness. The <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> has no special access to /wiki/history, and uses precisely the same mechanisms that a human editor uses. If there's a failure in /wiki/history, it must lie elsewhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does make me wonder if anyone actually uses ChangesInWeek<xxx>. It would be relatively trivial for me to use some of the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> infrastructure to automate ChangesInWeek<xxx>, but there's not much point if ChangesInWeek<xxx> are being updated without purpose.

All of which leaves me confuddled as to what the numbers on <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> are supposed to mean, since in my moving some lines up the page and adding one word, NRC has recorded those two as "-141" and "0 del" respectively.<em></em>

        <em>The bot seems to rely on the nature of edits, and assumes that most articles will not be refactored or substantially changed very often. At times, it appears to be attempting to detect dictators by using vegetarianism, university education, and a love of the sound of their own voice as heuristics. A better solution would be to whitelist the </em>ChangesInWeek pages, which - by their nature, and as a set - change radically and frequently. If you must insist on undoing edits to those pages, at least leave them out of the detection mechanism, since on pages where grammar and presentation play little part you have <strong>no reliable means</strong> to identify the GV from those pages alone - with other pages you might get false-positives, but if you include CIW then it appears that false-positives are <strong>guaranteed</strong>, and the bot will attack anyone it doesn't "know". It's generally clear from the diffs that substituting last week's edits for those from 53 weeks ago is certainly not a StupidLittleEdit, and "<a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> edited these" as a heuristic for detecting the GV is anywhere between not-particularly-good to <a href="BrainDamage.html">BrainDamage</a>d. Locking out legitimate users is not a desirable side-effect, and the general consensus is that sacrificing good users for the sake of one annoyance is a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>, and any time now I'm sure <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> will present us with ObjectiveEvidence of such.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that locking out legitimate users is not a desirable effect, but I would argue that allowing <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> (as determined by a gaggle of heuristics, which are -- like any heuristics -- prone to false positives and negatives) <em>any</em> opportunity to edit is worse than preventing edits to ChangesInWeek<xxx>. I have offered to automate updates to ChangesInWeek<xxx>, pending some confirmation that it's actually of use to someone. I've not seen any such confirmation, and strongly suspect that ChangesInWeek<xxx> are being maintained purely because it seemed like a good idea at the time, not because the good (?) idea is actually of value to anyone. As such, I have little problem regarding ChangesInWeek<xxx> as nowt but maintenance for maintenance's sake. Therefore, inadvertently preventing legitimate users from maintaining an apparently pointless index is of considerably lower concern to me than (a) allowing <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> any edit opportunities, or (b) inadvertently locking out legitimate users from editing meaningful content.

          <em>I'm not sure that the decision of whether or not CIW is useful is yours to make on behalf of the rest of us. After all, people that do use it don't have to tell you.

I find it useful, particularly as a back-reference when I've been off-grid for any length of time. A good part of the problem is that your perception of CIW as useless may be self-fulfilling - your bot <strong>specifically</strong> breaks the most useful part, namely that around the join point, since attacking recent behaviour is by necessity. I still suggest that to be hitting legitimate users this badly all for the sake of excluding <strong>one</strong> person is overkill. The <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> may have behaved despicably, but I'm fairly sure it can't give you AIDS. You also need to think about how long the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> has been a problem - the earliest trace I can find in January 2006. The cad has been at it for <strong>two and a half years</strong> - you need to stop and consider whether GV is actually taking some perverse pleasure from all the in-fighting and that your actions are actually feeding the troll. The assertion that allowing even the slightest opportunity for GV (one user) is a worse outcome than inconveniencing dozens of real people (including some that unlike me have been here even longer than yourself), however slightly, is nothing short of crazy talk. A little less aggression is needed here - the Shark can patrol the bulk of wiki while any damage that GV does to CIW would be manageable by humans. Maybe there's even a good edit in there, and there's no sense in killing good edits just because of who's done it - otherwise you risk <a href="DemolishingTheAutobahn.html">DemolishingTheAutobahn</a>.<em></em>

        You've made some good points.

        Given a set of conditions C which may trigger a reversion R, and another set of conditions Q which may desirably -- but not necessarily -- prevent a reversion R, it is simpler to consider only C in performing R, than to consider both C and Q in performing R. In other words, <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> means the minimum code needed to trigger necessary reversions, even if that has a side-effect of very rarely generating a so-called "null edit".

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What you called "one of the edits" must have been the last edit, so reverting the previous edit as well by restoring an earlier version (which happened to be the same as the current version) cannot possibly have been a simpler choice corresponding to a simpler condition C.</em>

      <p>
        ...Except that "one of the edits" doesn't have to be the last edit. Is there some point to this, or are you just quibbling?

        <em>It did have to be the last edit in the particular circumstances, where the previous edit occurred a long time earlier and had nothing in common with a GV edit and everything in common with a newbie test edit.

The bot could not have known that its restoration would be a null edit, as discovering that needs a far from simple process. It's also absurd to suggest that pursuing the simplest course involves a dozen or so similar quirks. The simplest course is to revert (or not revert) the last edit, and that cannot result in numerous quirks capable of being noticed, only a very occasional false positive.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pursuing the simplest course of <strong>development</strong> action almost inevitably results in quirks and oddities, especially given the <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>-is-more-than-enough development process I used to construct the 'bot in the first place. Note the number of quirks and oddities in this Wiki, which was presumably developed in a similar manner. Also, what might appear to be "the simplest course" from an observer's point of view is not necessarily the simplest course from the developer's point of view. Furthermore, I happily admit the 'bot is imperfect, and that there's a list of bugs as long as your arm. However, it does the job for which it was designed and the net negative effect of the bugs (most of which no one sees but me) is minimal. This "null edit" issue, for example, I consider so negligible as to be unworthy of further consideration. If it really upsets you, then it's a feature, not a bug. -- DV

That's really stupid!

So what! What's the philosophy behind? Having content that people won't be able to find?

      </p>
      <p>
        Frankly, coming from other wikis, I must say that reverting good actions (including "small things" such as categorization notes) is the best way to have this wiki abandoned despite of its great content and to legitimate the non structuration of the content. At least, you can be sure that it is a way to prevent occasional users to dive into the wiki to discover its marvelous content. That seems totally silly to me, I can hardly believe it!

        Proposition of (smarter) solution against spam: Why don't you name official <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s (with some rights) for a while that take a commitment that they will do cleanup and categorizing in a set of pages for let's say 1 or 2 months? Guyz, with the number of people that have a page here!
      </p>
      <p>
        I think people got probably used to that stupid bot with time and so they probably limit their actions to adding content + category (when they think about it). I was caught, I understood the message.

For me, I'm done, I'm over.

        Well I guess, the priority of c2.com is the content and the priority is not finding it. But remember Borges and its Babel library: all users of c2.com don't have a lifetime to find "the" page they are looking for - or to lead some kind of investigation. Better pirate those pages and put them in another wiki where anti-spam will be less silly. I am very upset by that but well, I have to think about helping somewhere else. You killed my motivation, really. On the other hand, noone invited me here so I suppose this is all my fault for trying to help on subjects I like a lot.
