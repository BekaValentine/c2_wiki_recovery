        The Rationalistic Tradition
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TerryWinograd.html">TerryWinograd</a> and FernandoFlores, in their brilliant work <a href="UnderstandingComputersAndCognition.html">UnderstandingComputersAndCognition</a>, characterize a particular stance towards life (philosophy? problem-solving? the universe?) as the rationalistic tradition.  I cannot offer a short definition here, precisely because their book has deeply undermined my confidence in such efforts.  The words below, at best, capture only single isolated features of this worldview.
      </p>

      <p>
        One aspect of this tradition is its emphasis on this recipe for decision making:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           List all strategies.
        </li>
        <li>
           Determine consequences of each strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
           Compare the consequences and choose.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This is one piece of the rationalistic tradition that <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> relies heavily on.  If you would be <a href="UnderstandingBigDesign.html">UnderstandingBigDesign</a>, pro or con, you have to position it properly in its tradition.
