        <strong>Hierarchical database technology:</strong>:	<em>"IBM introduced the first generation of database technology, known as hierarchical, when it installed IMS (Information Management System) in its mainframe computers in the mid-1960s. This technology was upgraded in the mid-1970s to network database technology. Both hierarchical and network databases are often described by the term hierarchical database.</em><br/>

An application retrieves data by first finding the primary record and then following pointers stored in that record to other connected records."</em></dd>

        I don't think IMS is the first "database" system. There were some <a href="NetworkDatabase.html">NetworkDatabase</a>s from other company(s) in the early 1960's. Links to follow....

        IBM on IMS:

      <code>
        <a href="http://www-4.ibm.com/software/data/ims/">http://www-4.ibm.com/software/data/ims/</a> :	<em>"IMS is the fastest, most reliable database computing system in the world, plain and simple. When immediate access to mission-critical information is imperative, over 95% of the world's major corporations rely on IMS to provide a continuous link to data that is accurate, up-to-date, and quickly accessed by many end users. Customers rely on IMS systems to process billions of vital transactions a day. Any time you make an airline reservation, rent a car, get cash from an ATM, or pick up a prescription from the pharmacy, chances are you've used IMS."</em><br/>

        Here's an example customer experience with maintaining a legacy IMS system:
        <a href="http://isds.bus.lsu.edu/cvoc/learn/bpr/cprojects/fall1997/basic/basic.html">http://isds.bus.lsu.edu/cvoc/learn/bpr/cprojects/fall1997/basic/basic.html</a>
      </p>

        As I recall, accessing records in IMS was remarkably similar to card-based and tape-based sequential methods that preceded it:
        Logically, you read sequential records that each had leading "record type" codes.
        Like, you'd have a "customer master" records,
        each of which were followed by the appropriate "order header" records for that customer,
        each of which were followed by the appropriate "order line" records.
      </p>
      <p>
        IMS didn't concern itself much with the content of the records, only their type and order.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you wanted to access the records in a different hierarchical order -- different from the physical order -- you could, but it was done by having IMS maintain "pointers" between records.
        Traversing records through pointers is relatively slow.
