        Class Object
      </h1>
      <p>
        An object that provides behavior common to a set of other objects. Commonly, a <a href="ClassObject.html">ClassObject</a> defines "slots" (of varying scope), "methods" (usually in a map or dictionary), one or more "parent" classes, and similar material. A <a href="ClassObject.html">ClassObject</a> is typically returned by the "class" method of every object. Objects are typically created by sending "new", "create", or something similar to the <a href="ClassObject.html">ClassObject</a> of the desired "instance".
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, each <a href="ClassObject.html">ClassObject</a> itself has a <a href="ClassObject.html">ClassObject</a> -- an instance of Metaclass. Metaclass is distinguished in that it is the only object whose <a href="ClassObject.html">ClassObject</a> is itself. There are dragons here.
