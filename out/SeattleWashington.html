        Hey, I lived in Seattle for six months. It's also a very nice place. You must check out Pike Place Market if you're ever in town. Also, don't miss local tourist attractions such as the Ban Roll-On building which really really looks like a cylindrical can of roll-on deodorant with the roll-on ball sticking out of the top. The Space Needle is nifty, and most every geek will like Game Works, as it's one of the world's largest coin-op machines arcades.

        Last time I was there, Game Works didn't have nearly enough pinball tables, meaning it had about two of them.

        GameWorks is a chain, but the original flagship is in Seattle. There's one in Las Vegas, and the one in Tempe has classic games for 25 cents each, as God intended. But many of its other games are more expensive than their counterparts in local arcades like Castles & Coasters in Phoenix, which is built with a medieval sort of motif, and to me has more aesthetic appeal than Game Works anyway.

        Well, if you're talking about buildings <em>named</em> "The Space Needle", then yeah. However, there are several buildings of that general design which are taller - Centrepoint Tower in Sydney and the Stratosphere in Las Vegas come to mind, not to mention the CN Tower in Toronto at over 1800 feet (over 550 meters). -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        Does Seattle have its own airport? Or does it share one? <em>Boeing Field is within the Seattle city limits.  Boeing Field's traffic is mostly aircraft deliveries/repairs, cargo, and general aviation, not passengers. There is an airline that flies from Lake Union, with seaplanes. Anyway, the major airport for the area is </em>SeaTac International, which is south of Seattle proper.<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although SeaTac is short for Seattle-Tacoma, Seatac is now a city itself, which is neither part of Seattle nor Tacoma. I used to live on Angle Lake - which is about one mile from the airport. There was a brief stint where it was called Reagan Airport, but they changed it back due to confusion.
