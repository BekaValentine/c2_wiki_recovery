        Grep For Dev Null
      </h1>
      <p>
        A suggestion for <a href="UnixShellPatterns.html">UnixShellPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Motivation: You have a list of file names and want to run grep on them. You want the name of the file the match occurred in to
        appear in the output, possibly because grep's output will be used as input to another program. Grep will normally do that for
        you, except when there is only one file name in the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution: add /dev/null as one of the files to be grepped. That way, grep has two files to look through, even though it won't find
        much in /dev/null.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typical uses:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The "grep" command in GNU emacs.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           When using "xargs grep" -- there is always a threat that the last grep will get run with only one argument, even when
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        there are lots of files, so one tends to use "xargs grep -flags /dev/null".

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>. (When I've checked, it hasn't made a difference -- maybe xargs is smarter than I thought -- but it
        certainly can't hurt.) -- <a href="PaulChisholm.html">PaulChisholm</a>

      <p>
        Some xargs implementations are smart enough to not invoke the command if
        there are no args for it, eg on AIX, others aren't, eg Solaris.  Thank you for
        this pattern, I always though emacs' grep was just avoiding the perils of
        having the *grep* window hang forever because there were no inputs.
        I find this also works for certain kinds of tidyup which use xargs with rm, but
        run into trouble if there are no arguments - just so long as I don't run them
        as root, of course.  find ...gunk... | xargs rm -f /dev/null

      <p>
        I had this pattern, but I had no idea why until I read this.  A colleague taught me this pattern for doing grep on a whole directory tree:
      </p>
      <code>
        find / -type f -exec grep 'Some String I'm Looking For' {} /dev/null \;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Until today, I never knew why the /dev/null was needed.
