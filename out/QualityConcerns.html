        Quality Concerns
      </h1>
      <p>
        Quality is something perceived by the users of a product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Different types of users see different parts of a product and have different reasons for working with the product. Their differing motives for working with the product imply that they have different concerns about how they should use the product and therefore what they perceive as being a quality product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some types of users are,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Data capture user
        </li>
        <li>
           Reporting user
        </li>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Now, one axis/concern is the availability of the material listed above.
        The other concern is the quality of the material.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's pointless having a technical note that is a brief summary of ideas and jotting of notes.
        It is potentially easy to describe quality metrics for each individual artifact but quality goes further than this.
        It's about producing those artifacts for all the right users.
