        I stumbled across this book at the local book store. The authors approach web sites as software, not as art or a publication. It's a survey book, trying to cover project management, hypertext organization, testing and technology.

        Since it's a survey book, it doesn't get into much detail, but there are good citations for more information. If you read software engineering books, a lot of the names will be familiar (<a href="BarryBoehm.html">BarryBoehm</a>, <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a>), as will a lot of the advice. The technology section is a disappointment for techies, but can provide a good primer for others.

        My biggest complaint is the too-light treatment of testing.
