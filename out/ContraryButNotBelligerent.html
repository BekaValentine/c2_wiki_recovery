        Contrary But Not Belligerent

        Having a minority opinion in any community may have the effect of getting you into trouble. This is not uncommon when a community has built up inertia in a WikiPhase. Since <a href="QuestionsMakeGoodPages.html">QuestionsMakeGoodPages</a>, I ask, "How does one go about having and expressing a contrarian opinion without creating ill-will?"
      </p>
      <p>
        One way is to keep your opinion to yourself; the other is to state your opinion with backup based on reason, rationality and <a href="JustTheFacts.html">JustTheFacts</a>. If one is contrary for reasons more associated with being noticed than with being relevant, you will probably be noticed, scorned and then avoided.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if you cannot avoid stating an opinion, at least make it understandable. Only a select few seem to be able to pull this off by being first of all observant, then listening carefully, and finally discovering how to swim sideways and walk on the banks.
