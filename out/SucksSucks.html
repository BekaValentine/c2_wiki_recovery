        Up until now, this page had nothing to do with the title, so I fixed it.

        eBay <a href="PayPal.html">PayPal</a> Fees Suck
      </p>
      <p>
        eBay <a href="PayPal.html">PayPal</a> fees are a real rip-off.  They charge for any transaction that may happen within <a href="PayPal.html">PayPal</a> and on top of that, when you transfer the your bank account, it takes up to 9 days.  With millions of transactions every day, eBay makes interest on your money they hold whilst being transferred.  An extra income for them I guess...

        We know how it's supposed to work.  Somebody creates a page FooSucks as a 
        spleen venting exercise, and pours out their bile.  Other people respond
        with the opposite point of view, and when it's settled down a bit somebody 
        extracts a compilation of the opposing viewpoints (using <a href="ThereforeBut.html">ThereforeBut</a> or similar if necessary) and moves the whole thing to a more neutrally titled page ProblemsWithFoo or WhenShouldFooBeUsed.

        (According to the archeological eveidence, once upon a time people would actually try to express this in pattern form, but I think that was probably just a Golden Age to which we can't hope ever to return)

        These days we get halfway through this process, stall before refactoring, 
        and end up with a threadmode mess poorly integrated into the rest of Wiki.
        In at least one case (<a href="LispSucks.html">LispSucks</a>), the Sucks page was created 'after'
        <a href="WhyWeLoveLisp.html">WhyWeLoveLisp</a> and <a href="WhyWeHateLisp.html">WhyWeHateLisp</a>, so I can't see any reason to view its
        creation as anything other than pollution.

        Are people really this unwilling/afraid to refactor?  Or am I missing interesting content creation elsewhere on Wiki?
      </p>
      <p>
        (I think that part of the responsibility that goes with the offer of Wiki as
        a platform is that you should see the process through when people respond to what you say, and that the end of the process is something more like <a href="ThereforeBut.html">ThereforeBut</a> than like 
        the apparently <a href="IrrevocableThreadMode.html">IrrevocableThreadMode</a> that is <a href="StlSucks.html">StlSucks</a>)

        -- DanielBarlow, now part of the problem
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the problem is too many newbies given a gentle introduction to using wiki, blurting out whatever is on their mind, and never learning to refactor.  There seem to be the same number of <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s as there ever were, perhaps a few more, but vastly more writers, many of whom are clueless as to the original culture that made <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> insanely great.  The recent wars have made people more afraid of refactoring, but the problem is mostly that people don't know they're supposed to.

        <em>On that note, what is refactoring?  Can a link be posted for anyone full of ignorance?</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There is a page <a href="WikiRefactoring.html">WikiRefactoring</a> which is one starting point. There are other ways in, such as to type <em>refactor</em> into the search at the bottom of the page, which will give a list of pages with <em>refactor</em> in the title. There is also a page called <a href="CategoryRefactoring.html">CategoryRefactoring</a>.  If you go to that page and click on its header, you will get a list of all pages which contain a link to it, but don't necessarily have that word in their name. I hope this helps. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
