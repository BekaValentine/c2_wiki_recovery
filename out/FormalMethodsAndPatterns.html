        Formal Methods And Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        Although nobody has so far showed how to formalize "design patterns", many of the design motifs that patterns contain can be formalized as demonstrated here for the "gang of four" patterns: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://lepus.org.uk/ref/companion/">http://lepus.org.uk/ref/companion/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tools can be used used to specify patterns and to verify that an implementation conforms with the specification: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://ttp.essex.ac.uk/index.php?page=toolkit">http://ttp.essex.ac.uk/index.php?page=toolkit</a>
        </li>

        I think there are 3 ways in which there could be a fruitful
        interaction between ideas about patterns and about formal
        or rigorous techniques (compare <a href="FormalMethods.html">FormalMethods</a>).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="FormalTreatmentOfDesignPatterns.html">FormalTreatmentOfDesignPatterns</a>. The patterns in e.g. GOF can be seen as functions: Problem --> Solution, and each piece of design can be seen as a composition: Solution*Solution*... By analysing them this way, we could hope to improve our understanding of how to document and apply patterns, possibly how to translate them into generic designs or language features and maybe how best to catalogue and search for them.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PatternsOfModeling.html">PatternsOfModeling</a>. Patterns can be applied to abstract models as well as end designs.
        </li>
        <li>
           PatternsOfRefinement. This is a specialization of design patterns, in which you start with a formal model.
        </li>
      </ul>

        If you understand <a href="WhyPatternsAreDifferent.html">WhyPatternsAreDifferent</a>,
        you might worry that any attempt to
        formalize patterns lets people conveniently dodge
        the integrative, generative, and human
        aspects of patterns that contribute to the
        QualityWithoutAName.  That is, formal methods try to
        give a name to the QualityWithoutAName, 'nuf said...

        I'll advocate the formalization of patterns when society
        believes it is a good idea to formalize poetry beyond
        its form.

        I wholeheartedly agree with Jim that any attempt to formalize the notion of
        patterns misses the boat, but I do think that there are things that can benefit
        from formalization IN patterns.

      <p>
        Ward has noted elsewhere in <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> that some of the coding patterns that
        used to be used in assembly language coding have now been put into compilers.  That sort
        of growth from art to science over time will also take some of what's useful in certain
        patterns and move them into tools and formal methods over time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point is not to formalize the "pattern" per se.  The point is to formalize what the pattern
        is referring to.  Remember that the map is not the thing.

        Kyle -- could you give an example of what you mean?  For
        example, when I look at <a href="http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/patterns.html,">http://csg.uwaterloo.ca/patterns.html,</a>
        it doesn't strike any chords in me, and I think it is
        counter to what we want to achieve.  Alexander said:

        I was no longer willing to start looking at any pattern unless<br/>
        it presented itself to me as having the capacity to connect up<br/>
        with some part of this quality [the quality without a name].<br/>
        Unless a particular pattern actually was capable of generating<br/>
        the kind of life and spirit that we are now discussing, and that<br/>
        it had this quality itself, my tendency was to dismiss it, even<br/>
        though we explored many, many patterns.<br/>

        I agree with <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>'s statement above. Formalizing
        design patterns is too reminiscent of  <a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a>'s story under <a href="KoansMetaphorsAndParables.html">KoansMetaphorsAndParables</a>

        Don't get me wrong, I haven't got anything against the papers cited above
        but I have encountered someone who's 
        never done any OOP (let alone used a pattern) who's decided to 
        define the meaning of "Design Pattern" mathematically. I'm not 
        making this up 8-(

        --- <strong>Reliable and timely</strong>

      <p>
        <em>Dependable distributed system typically utilize a hierarchy of protocols to provide for reliable and timely services. Such protocols have both dependability and real-time attributes, and the analysis of these protocols is a problem of growing complexity. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The development of precise and accurate formal specifications of these protocols and their subsequent formal verification to gain assurance have been a great challenge. Exploiting the inherent modularity in the design of most dependable protocols, in this thesis, we present our modular approach to specification composition and verification of dependable distributed protocol. In particular, we consider redundancy management protocols that are needed to manage redundant resources used in the system for dependability purposes. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Utilizing building-block protocols inherently used in redundancy management protocols, we perform compositional specification and verification of a checkpointing and recovery protocol based on them. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The key idea is that if a library of these basic components, like the primitives and sub-protocols are being formulated, then these elements aid in systematic and hierarchical development of dependable distributed protocols.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The main contribution of this thesis to illustrate the fact that by defining a priori validated building-blocks for dependable distributed protocols, larger and more complex protocols can be easily specified and verified. For a mechanical support in formal verification process, we use formal tools such as Specware and PVS.</em>
