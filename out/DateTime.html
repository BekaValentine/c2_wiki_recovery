        Meetings have dates <strong>and</strong> times.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many date and time operations are simply trying to tell which of two came first, 
        or if this date and time falls within that interval or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple numeric comparisons, no parsing.
      </p>
      <code>
        Which came first:  simple comparison Before < After ?<br/>
        Within interval:  Before < Is it here? < After<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Computing differences is more complicated, but that's what we have computers for.

            </li>
            <li>
               What time is it now in the place the origin TimeDate was stamped?

            </li>
            <li>
               whether you mean complete 24 hour days, or include as a day the current partial day
            </li>
            <li>
               use for current day the local day or count Chronological days ( taking into account the international date line )

            <li>
               On successful arrival at Lule책Sweden, rather than SomeWhereElse  
              <ul>
                <li>
                   What the actual flight time is
