        Active Wiki Pages
      </h1>
      <p>
        Proposal and <a href="ProofOfConcept.html">ProofOfConcept</a> implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if Wiki pages could have <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> scripts buried in them that actually ran on the server? 
      </p>
      <p>
        They would execute in a safe sandbox, of course. API methods give access to make modifications to the page, read other pages, and use other pages as modules.
      </p>
      <p>
        The code escape syntax is the same as ASP, <a href="ActiveWikiPages.html">ActiveWikiPages</a>'s namesake. The instruction to read another page into a namespace of the same name is <em>sb_use('PageName');</em>. Modules have read/write access to the pages that use them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Automation of things like message boards, hit counters, image uploaders, and so forth could be created. 
        When used as a module, providing pages a means to automatically link back to any page that links to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perl scripts could <a href="InTheory.html">InTheory</a> generate graphics on the fly and add them to the page - <a href="TinyWiki.html">TinyWiki</a> handles graphics as UUENCODE'd blocks of data in the page which a support script decodes on the fly. I'm working on a minimal implementation of an image generator that creates non-compressed GIF images. One of my goals is to create diagrams on the fly - this has proven to be a requirement for the <a href="PerlPatternsRepository.html">PerlPatternsRepository</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given a limited HTTP fetch API for doing GET operations on specified domains, <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a>-like integration could be implemented in a laissez-faire fashion. Example code could be run without having to download it. The trust metric system could be reworked to provide a public API. The possibilities are endless.
      </p>
      <p>
        While such extentions may seem at odds with the concept of Tinyness, creating a sandbox is trivial in Perl, costing one line of code; undef'ing dangerous functions costs another line; the grammar rule costs a line, creating new functions to read arbitrary pages, append to the current page, and using pages as modules each cost a line, for a total of 6 lines. This facility is reused to implement active headers and footers, and enables the core to stay tiny while cool features are added in user-land.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is indeed <a href="ReflectiveWiki.html">ReflectiveWiki</a>-like, but only in proportion to how much of the functionality is implemented in user-land. In theory, the Wiki grammar, "save" logic, and so forth could all be moved into scripting in pages. The core would then bootstrap setup a sandbox including an API for Wiki to use, and then bootstrap itself from a page. A separate script to roll back the bootstrap page would be needed to un-paint yourself from a corner should things go wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as <a href="ReflectiveWiki.html">ReflectiveWiki</a> being "absurd", as its original proposer said his initial feeling was, one of my goals is to support various types of output: <a href="TinyWiki.html">TinyWiki</a> was created to allow collaborative development of a book. HTML output is useful for working on it, but ultimately it would need <a href="DocBook.html">DocBook</a> or LaTeX output. Alternate parsers could be specified by pages, so that pages could be marked up in PerlDoc or <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> instead.Far from absurd, I think <a href="ReflectiveWiki.html">ReflectiveWiki</a> is brilliant.
