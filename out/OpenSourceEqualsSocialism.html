        Open Source Equals Socialism
      </h1>
      <p>
        When people initially hear about <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software, they often have sincere concerns and views that lead to them becoming OpenSourceDetractors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open source proponents should be aware of these and be able to intelligently counter these views.
      </p>
      <p>
        On this page, both parties can express their views and concerns, make their claims, hear counter-points, and defend their position.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page could be a great resource for both parties, who can then form better-informed and more objective opinions.

        <em>There seems to be an interesting (though wrong-headed) doctrine afoot here - namely that the </em>'giving<strong> of value away (particularly </strong><a href="IntellectualProperty.html">IntellectualProperty</a>, which can be duplicated and redistributed for negligible cost) should be prevented - because it might injure those who make a living <strong>selling</strong> competing products/technology. About the only rational justification I can see for this viewpoint is the set of laws against "dumping" or "predatory pricing" - when one industrial concern, typically with lots of $$$ or access to government support, deliberately undercuts the competition with the intent of driving them out of business (and subsequently raising prices back up once the competition is eliminated). This principle doesn't really apply to software - Microsoft itself made that argument when it defended itself against charges that giving <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> away was tantamount to predatory pricing.<em> -- </em><a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

        The Open Source movement might be good from the narrow perspective of an end-use technical tweaker, whose primary interest is gaining access to the source code for broad, enterprise applications for the advancement of their personal knowledge. Tweakers want to expand their own knowledge for free without having to pay lots of money for essential ingredients like operating systems and software applications. Since they are tweakers, they risk spending money for something and then grow bored or dissatisfied with their efforts. That would be a waste of their hard-earned cash, therefore everything should be available to them for free. That way they can have intrinsic access, and ultimately the freedom to abandon it without financial risk. As a techie myself, that's a pretty cool place to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> community is very bad for the EyeTeeIndustry in the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a> for multiple reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, the Open Source DevelopmentModel leads to a strong probability of 'forking' a code base, resulting in the development of multiple incompatible versions of programs, weakened interoperability, product instability, and hindering a business' ability to strategically plan for the future. We only have to look at the net results of the UNIX experiment to see this reality. Have we not learned from this debacle?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, we have. Forking is not intrinsically bad - in fact, many believe it's a good thing. Much interesting research occurs on forks, not on the main branch. The </em><a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a> kernel has forked many times. What is bad are multiple proprietary, incompatible forks - done to achieve <a href="VendorLockIn.html">VendorLockIn</a>. This is what almost killed off UNIX; all the various UnixVendors had their own incompatible extensions. The <a href="GnuGeneralPublicLicense.html">GnuGeneralPublicLicense</a> solves this problem - you can fork all you want, but you cannot keep the results to yourself. It makes re-merging possible.<em> -- </em><a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Open Source has inherent security risks due to UnknownEntities pursuing their own agenda with the development initiative without any recourse or responsibility. Any organization takes a huge risk in implementing enterprise applications of this nature without having the resources on hand to become experts in every aspect of every line of code in the application. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The same can be said of proprietary software - but the situation there is worse. With </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, you can inspect the code if you want - you don't have to. With proprietary, you have to trust the vendor - the source code is not available to you. There are many software vendors out there - Microsoft being a prime example - who are inherently <em>un</em>trustworthy.<em> --- </em><a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Open Source is inherently more secure than </em>ProprietaryCode, especially if part of a responsible OpenSourceProject. In these projects, all code gets thoroughly examined and tested before being added to the main codebase. Not only that, but the codebase is examinable by anyone who wants to do so. Thus it is impossible to add malicious code, because it will be discovered and rejected. Additionally, even if someone DID add MaliciousCode, it's Open Source, so you can just go into the source yourself and remove it. Problem solved.<em> -- </em><a href="CarlosNsRodrigues.html">CarlosNsRodrigues</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        More importantly, Open Source directly attacks capitalism by forcing intellectual property ownership into the public domain. While Microsoft has finally agreed to let users 'see' the code that has heretofore been kept hidden, it will not let developers redistribute or alter the source-code in any way, denying open-source developers their ultimate goal. Allowing such freedoms is tantamount to giving away the company's greatest asset, its <a href="IntellectualProperty.html">IntellectualProperty</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nonsense. All developers have the choice to use open-source or not. Like with any third-party library, if you want to use it, you have to accept the authors' </em>TermsAndConditions.<em> -- </em><a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Microsoft is only starting to agree to release some of their code due to pressure from the U.S. military and the E.U., and only because they're being forced to do so.</em> -- <a href="CarlosNsRodrigues.html">CarlosNsRodrigues</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        U.S.-based, capitalist, for-profit software companies must emphatically remain committed to a model that protects the intellectual property rights in software and ensures the continued vitality of an independent software sector that generates revenue and will sustain ongoing research and development. No intellectual property means no business model, no revenue, no R&D budget, and consequently no CommercialInnovation. And without CommercialInnovation, an economy already in trouble is bound to get worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Rubbish. If there were no intellectual property, there would be a different </em><a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a> to fund all of the above. As for reliance on "commercial innovation", that's rubbish too. Commercial innovation would still continue, and even if it didn't, academic innovation would continue, which is just fine. Academic research developed the <a href="InterNet.html">InterNet</a>, <a href="FreeBsd.html">FreeBsd</a>, RsaEncryption, and much much more.

      </p>

        <em>Upwards of ninety-percent of software that is written (for which programmers are paid) is commercial enterprise application code that is not deployed outside the company that wrote it.

        Open Source is frequently touted as more than just an alternative development model. It is portrayed as the antithesis to big business monopolies. While Microsoft has come to represent the evils of capitalist development, Open Source has come to represent socialist collectivism. Thus <a href="LinusTorvalds.html">LinusTorvalds</a> describes himself as an 'accidental revolutionary'. And Open Source champion <a href="EricRaymond.html">EricRaymond</a> describes Linux as 'subversive'. Just when social alternatives in the real world have completely collapsed, socialism seems to be revitalized by computer programmers. 
        But there is nothing inherently progressive about <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>. What seems to motivate much of the Open Source movement is the idea that they might be undermining the success of big business. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If there was "nothing inherently progressive about </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>", why is ApacheServer the most popular web server? Why is Linux the most popular BusinessEnterpriseServer? Why are clusters done with *nix-based systems instead of NT? Why is Linux the most sought after OS for remote devices? Because OpenSourceDevelopment works.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Open Source development attracts a myriad of developers from across the globe, who then work on the software because they want to and because they are passionate about it, not because their managers tell them to. It also allows for more thorough testing, because enthusiasts use it and submit bug reports which are then fixed. OSS's enthusiasts trumps a company's 5-developer "testing team". Every developer knows that users are the ones who end-up finding all the bugs. Thus the "release-often, test-often" method of </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> allows for more reliable software NOW, as opposed to waiting 6 months for the next service pack or upgrade. Doesn't it irk you when you have to pay for the features that should've already been in the product when you bought it in the first place? If so, you know part of why Open Source is so attractive.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, Open Source developers like to snub their noses at big-business monopolies, especially </em><a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>. Revelling in being able to one-up the big guys, is human nature. That's the keyword though "monopolies", not "big businesses". (Monopolies=tyranny, big business=capitalism) In theory, monopolies are good for consumers, but in practice, monopolies abuse their market-dominance. That's exactly what's happening. Abusive monopolies stifle competition. Microsoft harasses OS competitors (e.g. Lindows) and obstructs non-OS competitors from having their software operate on a level-playing field (e.g. <a href="NetScape.html">NetScape</a> & <a href="RealNetworks.html">RealNetworks</a>). These aren't the practices of a capitalist, but of a tyrant. Open Source doesn't demonize Microsoft, it did it all on its own. Open Source advocates don't hate Microsoft (Hell, we're all developers. My best friend works for <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>. And, for some, <a href="MicrosoftIsaNiceMonopoly.html">MicrosoftIsaNiceMonopoly</a>), but thanks to Microsoft's business practices, it doesn't evoke much love.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Open Source is an attempt to put some of the power back into the right hands - developers' hands - instead of those of monopolies. When entrance into a market is as difficult as what it is now with software, then you need some lever to get yourself in. Open Source is that lever. It's about giving every developer the chance to contribute and to compete.</em> -- <a href="CarlosNsRodrigues.html">CarlosNsRodrigues</a>

        As software developers, we are fortunate to be gainfully employed by a for-profit software company in these trying economic times. Why in the heck would we want to support any philosophical movement which attack the very fabric of opportunity which provides the fundamental basis of our own careers?
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be grounds for immediate dismissal, as there are plenty of developers who would much rather be getting paid by an evil, for-profit company than giving away all of their efforts for free under the ideological banner of collective good while their unemployment is running out.

        <strong>Reactions to the Above Rant</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If it's not a troll, it's tosh anyway. It misstates <a href="UnixHistory.html">UnixHistory</a> (UNIX wasn't Open Source when it forked - most of the forks derive from AT&TSysV). It asserts (wrongly) that offshore development can only work with if given the (open) source - go look at what Wipro or Infosys actually do. It isn't "forcing intellectual property ownership into the public domain" any more than releasing a CD of clipart and photos into the public domain does (that "Open Source" isn't killing the market for proprietary photos and clipart, and neither will the presence of Open Source software). Most software is written for internal use and not sold and most software developers work on that kind of software, so whether it's Open Source or not does not affect their remuneration - and should you want to keep your valuable IP in closed source, no one is stopping you anyway.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I would add that <a href="UnixOs.html">UnixOs</a> was not the only <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> created circa 1970. There was UCSD and several others, some better than others, but for a reason that is elusive to me, Unix source arrived at <a href="CalBerkeley.html">CalBerkeley</a>. Then <a href="TcpIp.html">TcpIp</a> was invented at Berkeley (See BerkeleySockets) on top of Unix just because they had access to the Unix source. Some could argue that if UCSD was available at that time, <a href="TcpIp.html">TcpIp</a> would have been implemented in <a href="UcsdPascal.html">UcsdPascal</a> and history would have been so different. Instead of <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, probably <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a> would have invented ObjectAda or ObjectPascalWithOperators.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Having the source was a powerful motivator. Once history achieves something so important, it makes sure the wrong approach (<a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a>) is removed from existence. Now imagine that not all software is free, but all software needs to be <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> to succeed. Then imagine you can patent software. Now you can look at the source and sue companies that do not respect your intellectual properties.

      <p>
        I like how substantive remarks made by myself are summarily deleted because it's the one objection that <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> guys cannot overcome. The idea that <a href="IntellectualProperty.html">IntellectualProperty</a> is bad or wrong means that you have no pride of ownership of your work and creativity. Your efforts are immediately owned by society as a whole, and that has been proven to not work as a social construct. Ask <a href="StephenKing.html">StephenKing</a> how he feels about your idea that his books should be given away freely and not protected as <a href="IntellectualProperty.html">IntellectualProperty</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rebuttal:</strong>

      <p>
        <em>"I like how substantive remarks made by myself are summarily deleted"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What got deleted? The only one I saw deleted (and yes, deleting it was wrong) was a comment [that] yours was a "board room view"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"means that you have no pride of ownership of your work and creativity."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why should you be required to be proud you own it? What's wrong with being proud you created it, which doesn't required ownership?

        <em>"Your efforts are immediately owned by society as a whole, and that has been proven to not work as a social construct."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> is not compulsory. It has not been proved that this doesn't work (and if you think any real world socialist or communist state actually had all property owned by the state, you need to read up on your history. I don't think it would work, but it certainly hasn't been proved not to).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"how [</em><a href="StephenKing.html">StephenKing</a>] feels about your idea that his books should be given away freely"<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Who is saying they should be given away? You're confusing the <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> crowd (FSF etc, who do promote that all software should be free <em>but free as in </em>FreeSpeech, not as in <a href="FreeBeer.html">FreeBeer</a>) with the Open Source crowd (who argue that freely available software has advantages, but don't generally promote it as being compulsory, <em>just that releasing the source is compulsory</em>).
      </p>
      <p>
        [Just to clarify, I don't believe than anyone (important) in the <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> movement advocates forcibly freeing (say, by government fiat) software. They simply believe that <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> is inherently superior (not necessarily technically, but socially and even morally) to proprietary software. The goal is a place where closed source software is essentially non-existent, not because it's been legislated against or because it's been forcibly removed, but because (A) people understand and desire the freedom of <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> and (B) because in the presence of <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>, the incentive for people to use closed-source software is absent.]

        Free (Libre) and Open Source Software (FLOSS)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Open code is based on ease of entry, transparency, full information, and therefore functioning markets. Proprietary licensed code is based on monopoly, closed markets (no entry), limited information, limited innovation, and customer lock-in. Just because proprietary code creates a right of exclusion that does not mean that removal of some elements of that right is communism or socialism. Open code and free software create rights as well including reputation rights, integrity rights, and limits on future use. FLOSS is not public domain and it is explicitly not state-owned.
      </p>
      <p>
        Open code is capitalism. Closed code is a centralized, coordinated market that is controlled by those who manage to corner the market (by first mover advantages or leveraging other previous market advantages). Customers are not free to move from product to product, from vendor to vendor.
      </p>
      <p>
        FLOSS is no more communism than is communications in the wireless local loop with interconnection.

        For example, IBM is contributing to FLOSS in part to

           be able to more effectively compete in the services market,
        </li>
        <li>
           to prevent long term lock-out from the server market by mitigating the potential risk of the Wintel platform,
        </li>
        <li>
           and to have a chance to grab 100% of a customer IT budget rather than (100% - closed software%).
        </li>
      </ol>

        Excellent short treatments of the economics can be found in "IT Doesn't Matter" from HBS; "Linux Adoption in the Public Sector" by Varian; and "The Simple Economics of Open Source" by Lerner.

        I'll assume that's a serious question. Yes, it is. It's amazing how uninformed some people are.

        <em>In an fine example of </em><a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a>; there are some (mainly right-wingers) that seek to redefine "socialism" to include any sort of regulation on the economy and/or income redistribution program.

        I've spent some time in and around Socialism. One of the more striking attributes of this system is <strong>enforced redistribution of wealth/resources</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems to be in stark contrast with the concept of <strong>giving away</strong> something you've created, without actually giving up what you have.

        Whether this is a great <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a> isn't the point. The point is <em>involuntary</em> vs <em>voluntary</em> contribution of effort and resources.

        I think the original poster really means that <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> goes against AynRand's ObjectivismPhilosophy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It doesn't, despite what some </em>RandRoids would have you believe. I obtain an objective value by writing free software: it creates a market in which I can obtain other useful software (and ideas!) for free. AynRand never argued that a hawkish or greedy strategy yielded the best value; only that the pursuit of objective value was the only acceptable MoralImperative. In fact a <a href="TitForTat.html">TitForTat</a> strategy is often better in competitive situations.<em> -- </em>DavidKTurner

        Anyone who uses words like 'socialism', 'capitalism', 'conservative', 'radical', or 'liberal' has already abandoned reality for the fantasy world of political abstractions, and should not be taken seriously.
