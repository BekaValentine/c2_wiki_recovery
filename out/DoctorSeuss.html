        <em>Seuss ain't at all bad, and far better than anything that comes out of the mass media, but please don't let this be all you read your children. </em><a href="RudyardKipling.html">RudyardKipling</a>'s "Just So" stories, Grahame's <em>Wind in the Willows,</em> Lindsay's <em></em><a href="MagicPudding.html">MagicPudding</a><em> and of course </em><a href="AaMilne.html">AaMilne</a>'s <em></em><a href="WinnieThePooh.html">WinnieThePooh</a><em> are just as good if not better than Seuss. Older children will further appreciate Lofting's </em>Doctor Dolittle<em> series, White's </em>Charlotte's Web,<em> and Gibbs' </em>Snugglepot & Cuddlepie.<em> If you want your children to become extraordinary people, begin by reading them stories written by extraordinary people.</em>

        When my rugrat started Pre-K they gave us a sign-up sheet for books we read every night. My immediate response was "What do they think we do all day?" So it soon got full of <em></em><a href="KrazyKat.html">KrazyKat</a>,<em> </em>The Artist Materials & Supplies Handbook,<em> the screenplay to </em>Monty Python and the Holy Grail,<em> etc.</em>

        We second-generation Seussians see no bewildering transition from <em>being read to</em> to <em>reading</em> to <em>reading to</em> to <em>being read to.</em>  -- PCP
