        Smart Paper
      </h1>
      <p>
        I would love to see some <a href="SmartPaper.html">SmartPaper</a> like in <a href="TheDiamondAge.html">TheDiamondAge</a>. It would be both like paper and like a computer.
      </p>
      <p>
        First and foremost, above all else, <a href="SmartPaper.html">SmartPaper</a> would have to <em>feel</em> like hemp paper when I hold it in my hands. If I rest my ink pen on it, the ink dot should grow appropriately. If I draw on it with my pencil, lick my thumb and rub the paper, the pencil marks should smear.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should be able to wander through my data aimlessly (a'la wiki) or purposefully (a'la a filesystem). Then I should be able to edit it easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        I should be able to watch the news or a movie on it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be waterproof, foldable and unbreakable so I can bring it river rafting in case I meet a girl or have a bright idea. 
      </p>

        <em>On the contrary, one of the things that would attract me to </em><a href="SmartPaper.html">SmartPaper</a> would be if when resting my pen on it, ink dots <em>didn't</em> spread, and if rubbing it with my thumb wouldn't do anything to "pencil" marks at all. Unless, of course, you had it set to "art" mode.<em></em>

        See: <a href="http://www.gyriconmedia.com/SmartPaper.asp">http://www.gyriconmedia.com/SmartPaper.asp</a> for one example of <a href="SmartPaper.html">SmartPaper</a>.

        I am really attracted to the _true_ reusability of it and the low power consumption. It could very well be what we use for monitors in the near future!
