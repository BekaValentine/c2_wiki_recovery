        Iis Meta Base
      </h1>
      <p>
        The proprietary database format used by <a href="InternetInformationServer.html">InternetInformationServer</a> to store configuration information for web sites, ftp sites, and much more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The format is similar to the registry, but with special considerations like attribute inheritance added. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a proprietary <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a> available to manipulate the <a href="IisMetaBase.html">IisMetaBase</a>, which naturally yields the greatest performance/flexability. However, there is an ActiveDirectoryServicesInterface implementation available that allows you to manipultate almost every aspect (in IIS4.0) and all aspects (in IIS5.0) of the MetaBase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em>ApacheServer has something similar. Its database format for storing configuration data can be manipulated most efficiently with a tool called "vim", but there's also an alternative tool called "Emacs". Both tools allow you to edit <strong>any</strong> aspect of the database.<em></em>

        Do I detect some sarcasm here? ;)

        <a href="IisMetaBase.html">IisMetaBase</a> is also used by <a href="PersonalWebServer.html">PersonalWebServer</a> (aka PWS, a scaled down IIS), but
        the tools for examining it are poorly documented and obscure.
        <a href="IisMetaBase.html">IisMetaBase</a> is prone to corruption when configuring PWS for CGI scripts. Registry settings for mapping script extensions (e.g., to map .cgi to perl.exe) are cumulative in <a href="IisMetaBase.html">IisMetaBase</a>. That is, while you're experimenting with getting the poorly documented Registry incantation just right, <a href="IisMetaBase.html">IisMetaBase</a> holds on to all of your attempts, possibly leaving you in a situation where the only way to get CGIs to work is to uninstall and then reinstall the Option Pack that contains PWS. --<a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For a start on examining the <a href="IisMetaBase.html">IisMetaBase</a> (for PWS on NT, at least), try this:
      </p>
      <code>
        % cd \winnt\system32\inetsrv\adminsamples<br/>
        % cscript adsutil.vbs enum w3svc > metabase.out<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You'll get a (complete?) dump of its contents. --<a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>
