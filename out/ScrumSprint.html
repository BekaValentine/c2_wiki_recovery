      <p>
        In the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a>, the larger of two <a href="InspectAndAdapt.html">InspectAndAdapt</a> cycles are called Sprints. Sprints are 30-days* (WhyThirtyDays) in length, and <strong>must</strong> result in a potentially shippable increment of software. (Of course, when using Scrum on non-software projects this rule would become "must result in something of actual value".)

        During the sprint, the <a href="ScrumTeam.html">ScrumTeam</a> is empowered to do whatever is needed to achieve the <a href="SprintGoal.html">SprintGoal</a>.

        Another use of the word sprint has sprung up in the Python/Zope community, see <a href="PythonSprint.html">PythonSprint</a>.

        Ham Radio Morse Code operators have 'sprints' where they make as many contacts as possible, at very high speeds.
