        Put The Solution At The Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        A user interface rule: Put the solution, or at least a description of it and related links, <strong>right next to</strong> the problem itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, a given folder on a Windows server only had "Folder" listed when I right-clicked and selected "New". Normally you see a list of applications, such as <a href="NotePad.html">NotePad</a> to create a text file in the given folder. After Googling around, it turned out some oddity to do with permissions was preventing a normal list of options (even though I could paste and change new files there). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, the "New" option would have a "More Info" or "Why you don't see more options" menu item to diagnose and/or explain why no applications are listed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, greyed-out options can be a hair puller because grey-ness itself does not tell us why it's gray. Another approach should be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        One should NOT have to go somewhere else, such as to a general help utility, to get more info on an option with problems or unnatural state. There should be a link on or near the problem thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example is a message that says something like "This operation cannot be performed because X is currently open". Typically one had to go back to the document or record and close the bugger and then retry the operation.  I once encountered and app that gave me an option of closing X. They <a href="PutTheSolutionAtTheProblem.html">PutTheSolutionAtTheProblem</a>.
      </p>
      <code>
        . --------------------------------------<br/>
        . Operation cannot be performed because <br/>
        . document X is currently open.<br/>
        .<br/>
        .    [Save & Close X]     [Cancel]<br/>
        .<br/>
        . -------------------------------------- <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (Actually there are sometimes 3 options: Save and close, close X without saving, and cancel the current operation. But KISS may dictate having only two, depending on the application and usage patterns.)

        I once sat in an office chair that followed this principle. It had a slide-out card near the adjustment knobs with brief instructions for the knobs.
