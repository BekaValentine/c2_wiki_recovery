        A technique for dealing with <a href="SensitiveOffTopic.html">SensitiveOffTopic</a> pioneered by <a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a>'s <a href="GreenLightWiki.html">GreenLightWiki</a>. If someone is determined to do things to wiki that offend your sensibilities, don't delete 'em - just create a wiki for the <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> subject and ask them to do the hosting work for it. Or ask Ben to create the new wiki - he's a very hospitable chap and would be only too happy to help. Then, if you're diplomatic enough, you might just get the offender to shift. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But</strong> some offenders are not likely to budge. What they crave is the attention they get on wiki. Moving to <a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a>' <a href="GreenLightWiki.html">GreenLightWiki</a> is likely to lead to anonymity. And they want the attention they can "steal" (thanks to <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a> for this formulation) from the one and true original <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.
      </p>

        Nowadays, one can create a new wiki in less than 10 minutes, for free, at almost any <a href="WikiFarm.html">WikiFarm</a>.
