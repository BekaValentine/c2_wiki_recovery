        Sticky Shift
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sticky Shift is the phenomenon that <a href="ChrisWatson.html">ChrisWatson</a> first indentified in the year 2001 in which he found that he consistently and repeatedly capitalized incorrectly the same word over and over again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ChrisWatson.html">ChrisWatson</a> is currently going through rehab to rid himself of this phenomenon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is this related to </em><a href="WikiNameInRealLifeSyndrome.html">WikiNameInRealLifeSyndrome</a>? If so, is the rehab helping?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope, things are not improving at all. -- <a href="ChrisWatson.html">ChrisWatson</a>

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>. Sortof. Whenever I mistype words, I find I have <em>correctly</em> typed a <em>different</em> word by accident, sometimes one that I intended to type later in the sentence, but more often a consistent word-for-word replacement. My keyboard is slippy in the Freudian sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I can type about 40 words per minute, and I rarely hunt for the correct key to press. But recently I find myself, as you have, typing a total incorrect word such as 'the' instead of 'a'. Umm -- Chris Watson</em>

      <p>
        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> too, except I tend to Capitalize all Nouns. I guess it comes from five years of German in High School...
      </p>

        Me too (or perhaps ME too....). There's also the transposition of 2 letters. -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        When I was nine years old, I chose the handle "Big Ben", to be ironic and abbreviative, in that order. But I typed it "BIg Ben" so often that I made that the official capitalization. And this was in 1987, before k.d. lang and widespread Unix access made case-sensitivity "hip". -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a> <em>tell that to e.e. cummings.</em>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        I also have a quirk about spelling; utilizing capital letters inappropriately, such as TikTOK. [<em>Your quirk, or hitting Caps Lock by mistake?</em>]

        HMMM

        <em>I was looking for info on a small Japanese car with manual transmission and found this.</em>

        Were you disappointed? You should have looked for TOYota, HOnda or datSUN.
