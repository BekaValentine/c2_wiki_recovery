        The Good One
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a recipe for a sandwich called <strong> <em> The Good One </em> </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason a food recipe is found in this repository is that it has been 
        thought out using a <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>. I have coined the pattern in question as 
        the <a href="DailyValuesPattern.html">DailyValuesPattern</a>. To find out more about the USDA daily values go to
        <a href="http://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/foodlabel/dvs.html">http://www.fda.gov/fdac/special/foodlabel/dvs.html</a> and to find out more about
        how the daily values are applied to day to day life go to

      </p>
      <p>
        This is just another good example of how <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> permeates all facets of 
        human kind's daily existence.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Two table spoons of low fat cottage cheese
        </li>
        <li>
           Spinach leaves to taste
        </li>
        <li>
           Four slices of Roma tomatoes
        </li>
        <li>
           A thin slice of a purple onion
        </li>
        <li>
           Three slices of smoked turkey lunch meat
        </li>
        <li>
           One table spoon of coarse deli mustard
        </li>
        <li>
           Two slices of 100% Whole Wheat bread (toasted)
        </li>
        <li>
           Salt and pepper to taste
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Spread the cottage cheese across the bottom piece of toast in the sandwich 
        stack. Salt and pepper the cottage cheese to taste. I use a blend of garlic
        salt to give it a zing. Place the spinach leaves on top of the cottage cheese.
        Place the slices of Roma tomatoes on top of the spinach. Place the onion slices
        on top of the tomatoes. Add the slices of lunch meat on top of the stack. I use
        smoked turkey breast lunch meat, however any equally low-fat, high-protein 
        compost will do (e.g. roast beef). Spread the mustard on the top slice of bread
        and place it on top of the sandwich stack (mustard facing down). I usually 
        slice the sandwich in half before serving to ease consumption... and there you
        have it... <em>The Good One!</em>

        The meal above is a very significant source of vitamin A containing 100% of 
        one's Daily Value. It is also a significant source of Iron, Vitamin C, Folic
        Acid, and Calcium.

        So according to the <a href="DailyValuesPattern.html">DailyValuesPattern</a> you have got yourself a low-fat, high-
        fiber meal that is what the doctor ordered for those long programming hours
        and may just save you from osteoporosis... and hence the name <strong> <em> The Good One </em> </strong>

        seems kind of high in salt -- <a href="JamesKeogh.html">JamesKeogh</a>

        Maybe the sodium percentage is a misprint, or maybe it's from the "smoked" meat. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>
