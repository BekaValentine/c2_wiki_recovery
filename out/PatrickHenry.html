        Patrick Henry: American Revolutionary War Hero -- <a href="BillZimmerly.html">BillZimmerly</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is his most famous speech.
      </p>
      <p>
        (N.B.: I have looked all over <a href="BillZimmerly.html">BillZimmerly</a>'s various pages, trying in vain to find a way to post a message to him without defacing this page. I do sincerely apologize for "barging in" this way at the beginning of Patrick Henry's speech to the Virginia burgesses in St. John's church, Richmond, but I believe that there is something a bit amiss here. Perhaps I am mistaken--I am relying upon what I call (with a straight face) my "memory"--but I do seem to recall that his speech, given here, was interrupted at one  point by cries of "Treason!" from a few members, to which Mr. Henry  said, "If this be treason, then make the most of it!"  I have loved and treasured those words all my life, but perhaps I am mistaken about  their having been uttered by Mr. Henry during this particular speech. But I think I'm right about this, or I wouldn't have spent the time it has taken me to get to this point.  Again I apologize for writing this comment here, but Iam rather clumsy with computers, and this was, in the end, the only way I could figure out to say what I wanted to say. Many thanks to Mr. Zimmerly for taking the time and making the effort to post this speech. It is a great service to those who love liberty--long may it endure. -- Richard in Augusta, Georgia.)

        <dd>"<em>No man thinks more highly than I do of the patriotism, as well as abilities, of the very worthy gentlemen who have just addressed the House. But different men often see the same subject in different lights; and, therefore, I hope it will not be thought disrespectful to those gentlemen if, entertaining as I do opinions of a character very opposite to theirs, I shall speak forth my sentiments freely and without reserve.</em></dd>

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>This is no time for ceremony. The question before the House is one of awful moment to this country. For my own part, I consider it as nothing less than a question of freedom or slavery; and in proportion to the magnitude of the subject ought to be the freedom of the debate. It is only in this way that we can hope to arrive at truth, and fulfill the great responsibility which we hold to God and our country. Should I keep back my opinions at such a time, through fear of giving offense, I should consider myself as guilty of treason towards my country, and of an act of disloyalty toward the Majesty of Heaven, which I revere above all earthly kings.</em></dd>

        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Mr. President, it is natural to man to indulge in the illusions of hope. We are apt to shut our eyes against a painful truth, and listen to the song of that siren till she transforms us into beasts. Is this the part of wise men, engaged in a great and arduous struggle for liberty? Are we disposed to be of the number of those who, having eyes, see not, and, having ears, hear not, the things which so nearly concern their temporal salvation? For my part, whatever anguish of spirit it may cost, I am willing to know the whole truth; to know the worst, and to provide for it.</em></dd>

        <dd><em>I have but one lamp by which my feet are guided, and that is the lamp of experience. I know of no way of judging of the future but by the past. And judging by the past, I wish to know what there has been in the conduct of the British ministry for the last ten years to justify those hopes with which gentlemen have been pleased to solace themselves and the House. Is it that insidious smile with which our petition has been lately received?</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Trust it not, sir; it will prove a snare to your feet. Suffer not yourselves to be betrayed with a kiss. Ask yourselves how this gracious reception of our petition comports with those warlike preparations which cover our waters and darken our land.</em></dd>

        <dd><em>Are fleets and armies necessary to a work of love and reconciliation? Have we shown ourselves so unwilling to be reconciled that force must be called in to win back our love?</em></dd>

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Let us not deceive ourselves, sir. These are the implements of war and subjugation; the last arguments to which kings resort. I ask gentlemen, sir, what means this martial array, if its purpose be not to force us to submission? Can gentlemen assign any other possible motive for it? Has Great Britain any enemy, in this quarter of the world, to call for all this accumulation of navies and armies? No, sir, she has none. They are meant for us: they can be meant for no other. They are sent over to bind and rivet upon us those chains which the British ministry have been so long forging. And what have we to oppose to them? Shall we try argument? Sir, we have been trying that for the last ten years.</em></dd>

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Have we anything new to offer upon the subject? Nothing. We have held the subject up in every light of which it is capable; but it has been all in vain. Shall we resort to entreaty and humble supplication? What terms shall we find which have not been already exhausted? Let us not, I beseech you, sir, deceive ourselves.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Sir, we have done everything that could be done to avert the storm which is now coming on. We have petitioned; we have remonstrated; we have supplicated; we have prostrated ourselves before the throne, and have implored its interposition to arrest the tyrannical hands of the ministry and Parliament. Our petitions have been slighted; our remonstrances have produced additional violence and insult; our supplications have been disregarded; and we have been spurned, with contempt, from the foot of the throne!</em></dd>

        <dd><em>If we wish to be free -- if we mean to preserve inviolate those inestimable privileges for which we have been so long contending -- if we mean not basely to abandon the noble struggle in which we have been so long engaged, and which we have pledged ourselves never to abandon until the glorious object of our contest shall be obtained -- we must fight! I repeat it, sir, we must fight! An appeal to arms and to the God of hosts is all that is left us! They tell us, sir, that we are weak; unable to cope with so formidable an adversary. But when shall we be stronger? Will it be the next week, or the next year? Will it be when we are totally disarmed, and when a British guard shall be stationed in every house? Shall we gather strength but irresolution and inaction?</em></dd>

        <dd><em>Shall we acquire the means of effectual resistance by lying supinely on our backs and hugging the delusive phantom of hope, until our enemies shall have bound us hand and foot? Sir, we are not weak if we make a proper use of those means which the God of nature hath placed in our power. The millions of people, armed in the holy cause of liberty, and in such a country as that which we possess, are invincible by any force which our enemy can send against us. Besides, sir, we shall not fight our battles alone. There is a just God who presides over the destinies of nations, and who will raise up friends to fight our battles for us. The battle, sir, is not to the strong alone; it is to the vigilant, the active, the brave.</em></dd>

        <dd><em>Besides, sir, we have no election. If we were base enough to desire it, it is now too late to retire from the contest. There is no retreat but in submission and slavery! Our chains are forged! Their clanking may be heard on the plains of Boston!</em></dd>

        <dd><em>It is in vain, sir, to extenuate the matter. Gentlemen may cry, Peace, Peace -- but there is no peace. The war is actually begun! The next gale that sweeps from the north will bring to our ears the clash of resounding arms! Our brethren are already in the field! Why stand we here idle? What is it that gentlemen wish? What would they have? Is life so dear, or peace so sweet, as to be purchased at the price of chains and slavery? Forbid it, Almighty God!</em></dd>

        (Patrick Henry then took his seat. No murmur of applause was heard on March 23, 1775 when he gave this speech at a convention in Richmond assembled after Lord Dunmore suspended the Virginia Assembly. The effect was too deep. After the trance of a moment, several members started from their seats. The cry, "To arms!" seemed to quiver on every lip and gleam from every eye.)

        <em>It cannot be emphasized too strongly or too often that this great nation was founded not by religionists, but by Christians.  Not on religions, but on the gospel of Jesus Christ.  for this very reason, peoples of other faiths have been afforded assylem, prosperity, and freedom of worship here.</em>

        <em>The Bible is worth all the other books that have ever been printed.  Bad men cannot make good citizens, a vitiated state of morals, a corrupted public conscience, are incompatable with freedom.  It's when people forget God, that tyrants forge their chains.</em>
