        The primary complaint seems to be that OO is not relational. That's as valid as saying that OO design is not structured design. The reality is that the code inside an object is structured (or should be). Similarly, there is nothing standing in the way of the data in an OO design being managed in a relational database. The problems show up when you try to make the object model and the data model look alike. They shouldn't. --<a href="MarcThibault.html">MarcThibault</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OO tends to "hard-wire" relationships into the application code structure. If these relationships continue to reflect the world being modeled over time, then there is no penalty, and maybe even some performance and integration benefits. However, if the relationships change in importance or different users need vastly different perspectives, then relational will shine because it was intentionally designed to create virtual ad-hoc views without having to physically re-arrange the content and representation. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this sounds great, but how is that different from using MVC and writing new Views of the Model as needed? Furthermore, many OO patterns are precisely FOR de-coupling relationship, such as the MVC pattern, the Visitor pattern, and the Strategy pattern, etc. Base on what do you claim that "OO tends to hard-wire relationships..."?
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you tell me a programming style that does not tend to "hard-wire relationships into the code structure?" Part of programming is determining where you need flexibility and where you don't. This decision does not appear to be unique to Object Oriented Programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In database-centric styles, the </em><a href="NounModel.html">NounModel</a> is handled by the database, not in the application code. A lot of features and services that a database can handle is simply not part of the application code or greatly reduced. Things like the Visitor Pattern become mostly a query against a table or two. The application uses the result without any further worry about the structure of the source tables. It is a separation of Church and State that I find simplifies analysis and structure. One can code tasks with little or no concern about where they got their input from. OO Visitor is a fricken mess. It results in code that is shaped like a particular data structure, which I don't want. I want to abstract out the data structure issues from what is being done with the information. The shape of the source data structure is an "input detail" that I like to abstract away (or make minor), <strong>not live inside of.</strong> <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Further, in relational thinking, the data structure for a particular need is relative. The ideal structure for one use is different from that needed for another use. Relational allows one to create "virtual structures" or (result) views. If you can have virtual structures that change to fit your needs, then why have hard-wired structures like Visitor? </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        IMO, this is just playing word games. A DB view IS a "hard-wired" structure itself, it just lives inside the DB instead of inside some C++/Java code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, but the application programmer didn't have to make it from scratch. The application developer does not have to care if programmers at Oracle or </em>MySQL had to bust their butts to make the magic of relational work. It ain't their concern.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When your need changes, you still have to make a change to your system, whether it is creating a new visitor class, a new MVC view class, or a new DB view, it is still a change and you still have to test it. Perhaps you can show how creating a DB view is less error prone than creating a new visitor class. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>{The TOP approach allows multiple simultaneous viewpoints of the same structure. You don't build new structures or new indexes to get a different view for a particular usage.}</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't know about error prone, but it is less disruptive to the larger-scale code structure. In procedural/relational, you don't change your code structure to get a different view since the code is shaped like tasks instead of data structures.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Please explain what do you mean by "code structure", and why is it bad to change it. What "code structure" am I changing when I add a new MVC View? But that still doesn't explain why it is better to create a new DB view than to create a new OO class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, please elaborate how Visitor results in "code that is shaped like a particular data structure", because it seems one can equally make a claim that "TOP results in data structures that is shaped like code, which one doesn't want".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>TOP code tends to look like:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        rs = query("select * from foo where....")<br/>
        while getNext(rs) {  // for each record in result set<br/>
        do_something_with(rs) ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Changing the query statement does not change the code structure in most cases. You don't shift large blocks around. Procedural/Relational generally groups code by tasks, not data structures nor nouns nor entities. When you look at P/R code, you know that you are looking at mostly tasks and just tasks. Changes in those other things listed thus don't have large-scale structural impact on the code. P/R is generally an extension of the input-process-output mentality of the first computers. The improvement is mostly with query languages to pre-process the input in a more concise and powerful way so that the application does not have to. P/R makes better use of the power of relational, OO does not IMO, tying the shape/structure of the code too closely to the desired data structures.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, but how would do_something_with(rs) looks like when your view changes?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The view should generally only change if there is a "business reason". IOW, a new feature or factor or something.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ANYTHING in a working system, including the creation of a (e.g.) MVC View, should generally only change for business reason, so we now reach the conclusion that TOP just simply "hard-wire" the relations in the DB view instead of in C++/Java code compared to OOP?
      </p>
      <p>
        What you are doing is simply moving the complexity from the code to the query. It is like saying that if we use an interpreted language, we can always write code in the form
      </p>
      <code>
        do_this(...<interpreted code retrieved from configuration file>...)<br/>
        do_that(...<interpreted code retrieved from other configuration file>...)<br/>
        do_that_too(...<interpreted code retrieved from yet another configuration file>...)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        then we can change anything in the program "without changing code structure", even at runtime! Is this what you mean by "code structure"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The larger-level code units or "blocks".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So the above example with interpreted language accomplishes the desired effect of changing anything in the program "without change code structure". Agreed?
      </p>
      <p>
        And, I never find the need to "shift large blocks around" when I add MVC Views to my system, is there any example of where OOP leads to "shifting large blocks around"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We would probably have to explore some specific examples. How would you code up the (hypothetical) modem example at </em><a href="http://geocities.com/tablizer/prpats.htm#dispatch?''">http://geocities.com/tablizer/prpats.htm#dispatch?''</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Great, finally some concrete example. Assuming we agree that there are better ways to do multiple dispatch than any standard OOP methods, is that really an argument against OOP, or rather just simple common sense to pick the right tool for the job? I can simply encapsulate the whole DB operation for multiple dispatch within an object, OOP doesn't prevent me from using the right tool. OTOH, if there are problems best solved using OOP approaches, can TOP accommodate its use? If yes, then TOP and OOP simple compliments each other, and this whole exchange is not about "against OOP", but rather what compliments OOP.

        <em>BTW, OO Visitor has been called the "whipping boy of patterns" even by some OO enthusiasts. Why you would pick that pattern as an example of OO being "good", I don't know.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, you picked Visitor, I didn't. You claimed that Visitor results in "code that is shaped like a particular data structure", which I have yet to see an explanation of why it does that, especially since the point of Visitor is to decouple an action from the collection type (i.e. the data structure), I would like to see what kind of particular data structure will Visitor's code mimic. If Visitor is already a prime example of OOP problems, go ahead and shoot it full of holes it so deserved.

        <em>It is unnecessarily complex.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So it didn't really result in "code that is shaped like a particular data structure", but is simply too complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is complex mostly because it is shaped by a limited data structure: the dictionary (</em><a href="ObjectsAreDictionaries.html">ObjectsAreDictionaries</a>). Dictionaries don't handle multi-dispatch well.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But is that due to language constraint in Java/C++ or really a short coming of OOP? I heard that Visitor in <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> is really much cleaner, perhaps other <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> users can comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But is it the OO-ness of Smalltak that makes it smoother than stiff languages, or its meta ability? I think we'd need to see a specific example.</em>

        Wouldn't the whole argument for TOP better if it starts out from "I have done lengthly and deep research on OOP and concluded that TOP would be better because ....<insert common weakness and problems of OO programs and how TOP solves them>"? How far would OOP gone if its champions start their pitch by stating how they cannot "get" structured/procedural programming and OOP suits them more?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is often hard to tell if the problem is internal or external. They would not have pursued OO if there was not something that bothered them about what they were using.

      <p>
        None of the above are arguments <em>against</em> OOP. They all seem to boil down to some people don't get OO. The only thing that comes close is the section about OO hard-wiring relationships which has been refactored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As a non-fan of OO, I don't claim to have any good objective arguments against it. I believe that </em><a href="BenefitsAreSubjective.html">BenefitsAreSubjective</a>, but too many have <a href="PersonalChoiceElevatedToMoralImperative.html">PersonalChoiceElevatedToMoralImperative</a>. Thus, I have no objective evidence against it other than to say that there is no evidence for it, or that it has not been shown to be objectively better than alternatives. See <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> for a discussion on some reasoning behind *subjective* preferences other than OO. Perhaps this discussion should be changed too IsOoOverHyped. IOW, its promotion has exceeded its objective benefits (few or none). Shouldn't the benefits of paradigms be considered equal, unknown, or subjective until shown otherwise?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>About the best I can do on the objective front is to say that OO objects and classes are based primarily on dictionaries, and dictionaries are limited to one result row and one result column. These limitations limit the flexibility (see </em><a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>) compared to something that can return multiple match rows and multiple columns. In other words, the key structure of OO is objectively limited to returning 1 row and 1 column. One can perhaps argue that limiting the building block complexity to just dictionaries (1/1) allows certain economies of scale, but I have not seen such.<em></em>

      </p>
      <p>
        Nope. I think I've misunderstood what you meant by "OO objects and classes are based primarily on dictionaries, and dictionaries are limited to one result row and one result column." When you say "dictionary" do you mean hashmap? In what sense do you mean that objects and classes are based on dictionaries.

      <p>
        As I struggle to express higher-level concepts of more and more complex designs succinctly in code, I find that the most disturbing thing about the OO paradigm is the asymmetry of its model of polymorphism, and a resulting too-tight coupling of functions and data. By 'asymmetry', I am referring to the fact that type-based selection of algorithms is based only on the 'zeroth' argument of a method invocation, i.e. on the object whose method is being invoked. Semantically, this object is really just another argument to a function, but has a privileged role in the selection of an implementation of a method. This becomes more of a burden as you work on larger systems where different objects interact with each other in unique ways. In C++ we try to address these problems with things like the <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> and <a href="DoubleDispatch.html">DoubleDispatch</a>. <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a> also tries to address the latter concern, coupling. These solutions feel awkward, at least when applied to C++. Templates with specialization can also provide some relief, but at a high cost in coupling and build times in current systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that multi-methods, which essentially provide a more symmetrical form of polymorphic algorithm selection, will eventually become part of mainstream languages. I would go so far as to say that the OO model should be stripped down so that 'objects' are demoted to data types, with encapsulated representation and a set of tightly-bound functionality for the generation and copying of values. Jettison member functions and replace them with multi-methods; provide good packaging tools (name spaces, modules) to organize and encapsulate with more succinct flexibility than objects alone can provide. The packaging constructs are needed for organizing large-scale programs, and seem to be missing from some otherwise promising languages I've looked at. With them, you could still encapsulate data definitions (classes) together with the most basic functions that operate on them (methods) within such packages, while still leaving the system much more open to elegant expansion.
      </p>
      <p>
        To explain where I'm coming from: I have been a long-time proponent of object-oriented programming. Over the years, I've programmed extensively in PL/I, FORTRAN, LISP,  PASCAL, Modula-2, and C. I moved to C++ as soon as I could, which for me was around 1994 for on-the-job programming. In recent years, all of my programming has been in C++, and much of it has been concerned with database work. Aside from LISP, I've also played around with other languages that support a more functional style of programming, like OZ [<a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a>]. In the last few years, I've come to the opinion that OOP has been an important step in the evolution of programming paradigms, but it is not by any means the end of that journey. For the time being, I find that C++'s support for multiple paradigms and for low-level efficiency make it a very practical language for me to use on many projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of my thinking in recent years has been influenced by studying the second edition of the <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>, reading between the lines of the model presented there, and comparing it to languages that I'm familiar with. I think mainstream programming languages could benefit from the kind of rigor that <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a> have applied here, although their sketch of Tutorial D <em>(</em><a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>)<em> does not present anything like a complete general-purpose programming language.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are no doubt some languages, probably in the functional programming family, that approach what I describe here. If so, I'd love to get pointers to them.

        Many illustrations of OO's alleged power come from <strong>device-driver</strong> or device-driver-like examples. I find that these kinds of examples don't map well to custom business applications. If something is custom, then you are not going to write multiple implementations under the same interfaces.

        OO seems to have problems handling non-orthogonality that functional does not. Developers like having "one proper view" of their code - and in OO that is often a class hierarchy or class interaction diagram. Unfortunately many details get left out by that approach. OO also has a problem handling non-oop functions. Say someone wants to override malloc to call their own function - that is near impossible to show in class diagrams properly. UML helps(or hurts) a little. . .

        <strong>Discussion - Inheritance</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The real world does not form and change in a hierarchical way in some domains. Trees may be mentally "catchy", but they are too artificial to bend well with change and new details.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not certain I understand this comment. What alternative to a hierarchy is being proposed for software architecture? Every model I have seen is based on hierarchy, OO has merely formalized the hierarchy rather than leaving it ad hoc. What would be a non-hierarchical way to represent code?</em>

      <p>
        A network of nodes/modules/classes that doesn't use inheritance? <em>But does this eliminate hierarchy?</em> {see below}

        <em>Some of us criticize such as being a roll-your-own </em><a href="NetworkDatabase.html">NetworkDatabase</a>, which we feel lacks the organizational consistency of relational. Some point out that some "structures" may be too small or trivial to bother putting in a database. However, I have used <a href="NimbleDatabase.html">NimbleDatabase</a> systems that make creating and managing tables a snap. If it is really small, then most likely it is local and temporary, and thus the "protection" promised by encapsulation does not really apply. Maybe in a blue moon something might be widely used and small, but mixing paradigms for a few rare orphans is not worth it in my opinion. -- top<em></em>

        I am not sure I see the relationship between code organization and a database of any type. Could you expand upon this comment?

      <p>
        <em>When I look at OO designs and API's, I see a lot of code-based structures that seem to mirroring or "being" a data structure. To me this is best done by a database of some kind. The "shape" of things is then an adhoc query rather than the shape of the code itself. A hierarchical classification of stuff is best kept as data so that we can also view it by other ways besides just a tree (or any other given shape). Viewpoints are relative, and our tools should reflect this. If you hard-code structures in your code, then you cannot easily get such viewpoints. Thus, code should not reflect non-trivial taxonomies or classification systems. The only structure that is perhaps better as code than as data is defining algorithms, at least on a smaller scale. See </em><a href="DataCentricThinking.html">DataCentricThinking</a> and <a href="CodeAvoidance.html">CodeAvoidance</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But not all data can live in a database. And once again you're confusing the shape of the problem with the shape of the solution. Just because my house is shaped like a box doesn't mean my tools should be.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Most or even all data *does* live in a database: a hierarchical file database (which I have some complaints about). It is a matter of granularity.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No. Some data is born, lives and dies in RAM. Some data resides in files. The files may or may not be arranged in a hierarchy, but that says nothing about the structure of the data inside them. You're still missing the big objection. If it helps to structure code hierarchically, then we do so. If it doesn't, we don't. OOP doesn't force you to use inheritance, it merely provides it as a possibility. The shape of the data has as much to do with the shape of the code as the shape of my house has to do with the shape of my tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Inheritance was only an example.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [I am not certain I understand how code can "mirror" a data structure, except in cases where one can implement an operation as either an algorithm, or a table look up, or a combination of the two. I also do not see how the implementation of a particular method would be made more difficult through a hierarchy. Could you expand, because I feel I am missing the whole intent of your argument?]
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know if the implementation is the problem. The biggest problem is finding the method, groking it, and changing it. Hierarchies are an unnatural way to taxonomize most code beyond the implementation unit (function/method). Sure, if they were all simple little trees like those found in <a href="TextbookOo.html">TextbookOo</a>, then there would not be a problem. But if you have tangled trees in a <a href="BigSoupOfClasses.html">BigSoupOfClasses</a>, then managing it all can be rather difficult. -- top

        There is a Jan2004 trade article saying <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> is going away from OOP. Granted it is a bit attention grabbing, but still the increasing use of XML is not entirely pro OO. Any Comments?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you have a link? That aside, their use of XML tends to look like half baked OO object models most of the time. XML is sort of like OO for procedural programmers. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How so?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        From what I've seen, they tend to make little hierarchical models of their data in xml format. Half the time it almost looks like a serialized object model. Then they pass it around and treat the nodes like objects, feeling good about having all their data easily available, essentially DataTransferObjects in disguise. Most cases I've seen, would have been much better using objects rather than procedural code and xml. Problem is they still have to shuffle all that data around to find the methods that go with it.

        My POV (so far:) is that OOP is wrongly named, and should have been called "Model Orientated Programming". The term "Object" is too restrictive, and gives the wrong focus when trying to understand what OOP is <em>really</em> all about:
      </p>
      <p>
        An object is simply a concrete implementation of an abstract model that the programmer has in his or her mind. The methods of the object provide the ability to manipulate that model, thereby mapping that abstract model onto the implementation. Hence the "user programmer" manipulates that model (via the methods) and never has to worry about the implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea was derived after I realized that an abstraction is simply a model (in your mind) which you then map onto something real (this provides interesting insight onto the nature of perception which isn't relevant here). As such, OOP provides a very good "implementation" of abstraction itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is then clear why the ability to be able to associate 'internal' state with procedures creates the essence of OOP - without such state you cannot maintain a model (which by definition always has some state). You can of course explicitly provide a (shared) state to plain old procedures, thus creating a model, but it's a bit messy... In the case of a <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> object, such state does not <em>need</em> to be implemented using a block of memory (such as a Struct in C or Record in Pascal), but can instead be provided by global variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        From such a definition it is clear that OOP's (or should that be MOP's? :) essential characteristics does not include inheritance. You could argue that it does include encapsulation & polymorphism, but I'll leave that up to the intellectual bean-counters out there (I'm more than happy with just stating that it is model orientated and so provides a good implementation of abstraction itself). -- <a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This gets back to <a href="NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs.html">NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs</a> because "modeling" is not a significant part of the definition/nature of OO according to many OO proponents. (The wide variations are also part of the "inconsistency" criticism raised above). Further, we need to distinguish between modeling the physical world and modeling one's mental view of the world. There are existing topics/debates on both of these. [links to be inserted.] My view is that the model-centric view has not been articulated clearly enough for detailed external comparison and analysis. Discussions tend to drift into the internals of the writers' heads rather than something we can objectively compare. -- top

        Anyone trying to differentiate between "modeling the physical world" and "modeling one's mental view" is making a fundamental mistake; they are <em>one and the same</em> because <em>our only perception of the world is through models!</em> This is why the term "object" is so misleading - it implies a model of an abstract object, when it is in fact a generic model itself. -- <a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>

        I suppose that's not surprising, since it's so fundamentally against most people's world view. Dororthy Rowe has described what I said (and done so far better than what I could) in some of her books, and to go into any more detail here could get <em>extremely</em> off-topic. I could make a separate page to discuss it? BTW, she uses the term "structure (of meaning)" but this seems pretty equivalent to "model".
      </p>
      <p>
        My usage of the term "model" is very broad, as it can quite easily mean a physical scale model (as is often used in science), a mathematical model, or simply a tenuous "mental model" in someone's head. I often like to think of the latter as being rather like a simple machine which a human can easily imagine/predict in his or her mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you define abstraction as ignoring irrelevant details, then the model is the relevant details, and mapping is the process of associating the model to the thing being abstracted.
      </p>
      <p>
        The implementation of an object gives the object the behaviour described by a simple model (be it an "infinite list" or "finite table" or "2D area" or whatever). Since the methods of an object are the only way of observing & interacting with an object, the methods are effectively mapping the model (in your mind) to the implementation of the object. I think I am repeating myself, so perhaps I ought to tidy this up, at least if I have managed to get across what I was trying to explain? -- <a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I tend to approach modeling more from a "declarative" perspective I guess. One collects attributes describing the nouns. Actions then act on these attributes as needed. I mentally tend to separate the attribute model from the behavior parts of the model to better grok the system. Perhaps this may not necessarily make the model more accurate (although in the real world the association between nouns and actions is usually not one-to-one and is fluid), but it does make it easier to grok IMO  because one can apply the best attribute processing techniques (relational) to the attribute side and the best behavior processing techniques to the behavior side. <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a>. Some of you say that "OO is about behavior, not data", but <strong>it is about data as soon as you have relationships between classes/objects</strong>. Relationships are data, not behavior, and OO has no consistent rules for managing these "links". The "self handling noun" concept is nice, but it cannot apply easily to the links between the nouns. Trying to hide inter-object relationships behind behavior is not information hiding because you are not hiding the relationships. You can't really encapsulate relationships because more than one object is involved. The connection between them is naked in the code. If it was truly isolated (hidden away as an implementation detail), then you could get rid of the second object without affecting the first. OO provides no consistent guidance for managing relationships between objects/records/things. Relational does. -- top

        An aside to what I said above:
      </p>
      <p>
        (Single) inheritance is a cute way of organizing objects, so that you can <em>efficiently</em> share code & data with an incremental design strategy, but it is definitely <strong>not</strong> part of the basic requirements of OOP (MOP). You can imagine more complex (and much less efficient) sharing strategies (multiple inheritance being an unimaginative one). But (single) inheritance is a very <em>easy</em> to understand concept, which clearly doesn't conflict with using models for understanding, and indeed is commonly used in people's day-to-day understanding of the world, so that inheritance should be part of every OOP language even if it isn't actually fundamental. -- <a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, I agree with you that trees are easy to understand as a concept. However, they fail to capture the structure and change patterns of the real world as I observe it, and thus degenerate into <a href="AddingEpicycles.html">AddingEpicycles</a> to handle real stuff over time. -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        I would advocate the "use inheritance where inheritance will work". Inheritance is <strong>not</strong> a general programming solution, and all the OOP books saying so are doing OOP a great disservice. If you see OOP as MOP then inheritance is a nice bonus not a central feature. If inheritance causes problems, simply do not use it! -- <a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that OOP provides a full (if basic) way of expressing an abstraction. So future advances in computer science will be in how to describe an abstraction (object) well in terms of other abstractions (objects); single inheritance is a good start, but it is certainly not the last word. Claims that inheritance is central to OOP are holding back such advances... -- <a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>

      <p>
        What has measuring "abstractedness" got to do with what I said? If you think I am claiming OOP is more abstract, then you are not quite right. What I am claiming that non-OOP languages are lacking some of the fundamental requirements of abstraction (specifically association of state with things that perform actions), which thus means attempts at abstractions in those language will never be flexible (or even good). So I am claiming that only OOP provides a way of <em>fully implementing the process of abstraction</em>. -- <a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>

        But if we are to change topic to <a href="MeasuringAbstraction.html">MeasuringAbstraction</a>, then my short answer would be that something is more abstract if it has less details. Of course, you can only compare the "abstractedness" of two things, if both things are abstracting the same thing - i.e. it is relative. And attempts to measure abstraction as an absolute value are meaningless. -- <a href="ChrisHandley.html">ChrisHandley</a>

        The real issue is that projects that use programming languages that provide native support for object-orientation and use class-based inheritance are doomed to fail because of their inherent reliance upon the proven false AristotelianClassicalModel. In other words, no amount of mechanic monkey wrenching is going to fix a problem whose basis is rooted in the languages themselves. Class-based inheritance languages provide the wrong kind of abstractions for memory manipulation, electron shuffling and human ideas.

        No one can design and implement automobile brake systems or passenger airplanes like software systems expressed in programming languages that use class-based inheritance models. Is it acceptable for an engineer to explain to the family members of passengers of cars and planes that died travelling in vehicles that 'we didn't quite express the correct relationships between components (inheritance relationships) when we designed and implemented them, but with some revision (i.e., adding a new super-component) we'll get it right the next time."
      </p>
      <p>
        Revising software because it didn't quite capture the essence of the problem might be your acceptable definition of success, but that notion is FalseToFacts with respect to the essence of success, which is measure twice, cut once.

        I'm curious about this topic in that I've been writing software for real world business systems since FORTRAN in the mid 70's and have been able to work with many of the different languages and concepts discussed. So far, I've found OO to be far and away the best paradigm for supporting the the full spectrum of concepts and organizational requirements of the types of problems I've come across.

        OO IS NOT NECESSARILY many of the things that its detractors accuse it of being. OO in practice (and in theory, but the naysayers are selective in their j'accuse) allows one to take advantage of its features where applicable but does not impose them. With the exception that one must use classes in most OO languages.

        OO is like all the other advances in programming languages in that it IS ONLY a way to help people in organizing and managing the inherent complexity in the systems they're faced with conceiving and creating. As such it's proven to do a better job than most other approaches. Yes, proven.

        My particular dislike is for those who think that relational databases are the consummate programming medium, and who believe that the table metaphor is best suited as a foundation for programming concepts and languages. This attitude is ridiculous on its face, and should have been argued AGAINST long before it gained traction.

        Using degraded tables to hold atomic data bits is useful for a couple of things, but completely useless for expressing relationships between elements, or of describing the behavioral characteristics - individual or collective - of the parts of a system. And, in the end, it's what the system can do that matters. Even when the can do is telling one what it knows.

Ok, but as Costin said, maybe you should dust off some new DB book.<em></em>

        <em>And again: "top - According to relational theory, the only reason relational databases is in any better than other database organizing principles is that, properly normalized, there can be guarantees of the absence of data anomalies."

        OOP seems fine for relatively simple interfaces to external services or tools. However, when it grows into a big data structure or a graph monstrosity, then it looses its appeal, in my opinion. My rule of thumb is that five base classes are the upper limit. There could be more sub-types without problems. Applications that use multiple independent groups of these five-max sets are fairly easy to follow. It may have a lot of such sets, but no set has more than the five base classes. When a set grows to more than five, it is either time to split them, or abandon OOP for that utility or framework. --<a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

           Inheritance is about saving keystrokes. You gather the stuff a bunch of classes have in common and put it in a superclass. Sometimes the result is a pretty taxonomy. Inheritance is as prosaic as subroutines. There is another small benefit: it helps find type errors at compile time that otherwise would make it to runtime.

        <li>
           This problem can be solved using delegation, which is automated in many IDEs. Maybe it should be part of the language, but if it is not then that is problem of the language not OOP.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>But OO loses it's simplicity and selling. Delegation just becomes a wad of pointers (</em><a href="BigSoupOfClasses.html">BigSoupOfClasses</a>) that I would rather normalize and manage relationally. <a href="LifeIsaBigMessyGraph.html">LifeIsaBigMessyGraph</a>, but sets are the best known way to manage graphs, not the navigational pointer-like techniques of OOP.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Polymorphism is about letting the compiler build the case statements. It also preserves conceptual space. Instead of "+" would you really want "addInt", "addFloat", "addLong", "addDouble", "catAscii", "catUnicode", ...? In case anyone is wondering, that is what Assembler code looks like.

           Encapsulation is the sweet spot in OO. You call yourselves "software engineers"? Talk to a real engineer about "black box design".

           If you have spent your career building databases, a design that is a bunch of components with specified behaviour is hard to get used to. If you're an engineer who has been designing systems, it's hard to believe there's any other way.

           An artificial issue. It's easy to manufacture suitably constrained examples, but you could spend your whole career in OOD without running into it. Many-to-many is only a challenge if you try to make your OO design look like a relational data model. (There is a disease that affects some OO designers. The primary symptom is that they think associations have cardinality.)

        Let's say I have three different functions that do the same thing except in one spot.  You can factor out the inside of a loop in a regular language, but in a functional language you can factor out the outside of a loop. Let's say I want to sum a list:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (sum lst)<br/>
        (if (null? lst)<br/>
        0<br/>
        (+ (car lst) (sum (cdr lst)))))<br/>
        (define (product lst)<br/>
        (if (null? lst)<br/>
        1<br/>
        (* (car lst) (product (cdr lst)))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Instead, you can do this:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (fold fn lst val)<br/>
        (if (null? lst)<br/>
        val<br/>
        (fn (car lst) (fold (cdr lst)))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then you can do this:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (sum lst)<br/>
        (fold + lst 0))<br/>
        (define (product lst)<br/>
        (fold + lst 1))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Folding </em>is<em> pretty cool, and seldom seen in OO, but it isn't hard. I think this would be done with a </em><a href="StrategyPattern.html">StrategyPattern</a>. The strategy is a function object, with some "do it" method "A <a href="DoIt.html">DoIt</a>(B,A)", and the fold is another object (or static method). It's easy enough in a dynamically typed language or statically typed OO language with generics.<em></em>

           Better subroutine name-space management for packaged device drivers and driver-like concepts because the routines are tied to the "handle" instead of global (or wider-scope) routines that must resolve the device. Thus, building a driver does not have to rely on a set of shared routines that are in a larger name-space.
          <ul>
            <li>
               'Better' is relative, of course, but I'll agree that this is an advantage compared to Procedural. See the section in '<a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>' responding to the skepticism around use of the word "natural".

           If it is safe to model the domain via "sub-types", polymorphic dispatch can be simpler than case statements, especially if adding new sub-types is common.

            <li>
               Most experienced OO proponents think modeling the domain via 'types' is a dreadful mistake... with one exception: if your goal is to create a <em>domain simulator</em>.

                       I am among the experts in the  subject, having used OO since 1995 and come to this conclusion after tutoring undergrads and see many projects fail because domain simulation isn't among the desired tasks. I am not top. Many others on this wiki have come ultimately to the same conclusion, to the point of being 'surprised' that anyone thought differently. OOP models computation objects; if you have 'Employee' and 'User' hierarchies under 'Person', and you aren't writing a business simulator, you've done something wrong.

                           Therefore, maybe the problem lies not with the technology, but with your method of teaching?  Not a personal affront against you, but you complain about instructional materials that fail to teach using patterns.  As a professor, you have the ability to write course text books, get them published, and use them in your own classes.  Numerous of my previous instructors in various fields (electronics, literature, et. al.) have done this.

However, if I were a professor, I'd certainly favor books like SiCP, GOF, and CTM - there are plenty of good books out there if you know where to look.

                   OO is designed to model <strong>interacting agents.</strong>  Computation occurs as a side effect of objects interacting with each other.

                    <li>
                       The 'agents' in an OO system only exist as part of the greater computation model.

                    <li>
                       I'd also like to disfavor use of the word 'agent' in this context, which I feel will only introduce confusion. I tend to think of 'agent' as one service that acts concurrently with, but on behalf of, another, and this view is compatible with only some objects in a typical OO system.

                        There is no conflict. Decoupling domain data from the OO-driven computation model helps reduce coupling and improve cohesion of <em>both</em> the computation model <em>and</em> the data.

               One ends up reinventing the database in the application. usually in a way that breaks as soon as concurrency gets involved, or that will be more volatile than future projects will desire (data often outlives projects).
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Concurrency is properly handled via the use of actors or active objects.  Do not let Java's concurrency model trick you into believing that it's the end-all, be-all method of handling concurrency in an OO system. Not only is it not, but most "experienced OO proponents" were throwing a shit-fit because they knew it was <strong><em>far</em></strong> from adequate.  As far as re-inventing the database, well, any BASIC, Pascal, C, or hell, even SQL program will also re-invent the database, by sheer virtue of it having to use variables for state storage.  Look, we're tired of this old (and patently disproven) saw.  Stop it already.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       Use of local variables or local state (where the locality offers encapsulation and helps one vary behavior) is not at all the same as reinventing a database. Having objects that you can query for data rather than issue commands, however, does start down that path (and also violates the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>). Creating a 'view' of the outside world in terms of an object tree... certainly qualifies.  I've seen  <a href="ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication.html">ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication</a> occur with disturbing frequency, often to achieve optimizations like <a href="DeltaIsolation.html">DeltaIsolation</a> over an <a href="ObserverPattern.html">ObserverPattern</a>.

                           I knew you were going to say this, so allow me to say this: a variable reference implies dereferencing a pointer at some level, even if only an absolute address hardcoded into a machine language instruction.  Thus, this resorts to <em>navigational</em> behavior which the Smug<a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s are so quick to disparage.  Maybe those <em>views</em> you speak of exist because no other technology can serve the needs of the programmer with the performance, ease of use, or maintainability that they desire.  Look, if relational technology was so broadly applicable, <em>we'd be using it everywhere.</em>  Please stop trying to BibleThump.  I'm <em>really</em> getting sick of it.
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                               Those 'views' leave a lot to be desired in terms of maintainability, ease of use, and performance (in both space and time). But I agree that technology has a way to go. The ability to 'subscribe' to an arbitrary relational query (a 'view') in order to automatically receive and react to relevant and delta-isolated insert/delete/update statements would be far more optimal and incredibly useful, and would make relational technology far more broadly applicable in SystemsProgramming. Support for complex structured values and queries that can process them would also help. But RDBMSs available today don't offer these capabilities. Nonetheless, the weakness of available alternative technologies shouldn't be allowed to obscure the costs (complexity, performance, productivity, etc.) of applying mismatching technologies to the same problem.

                            <li>
                               The 'navigational' comment of yours is a bit misleading. In the above context, I made it clear I was discussing 'local variables' and 'local state'. <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s, for the most part, don't concern themselves with 'internal implementation details', be they pointers or whatnot, and not all of them believe that '<a href="AdvantagesOfExposingRunTimeEngine.html">AdvantagesOfExposingRunTimeEngine</a>' outweigh the disadvantages of doing the same. But, even if I were referring to domain data (which is generally 'global to' or 'outside of' a given process because it reflects the 'real world'), <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s don't hesitate to apply indirections to domain data that can vary independently of other data (e.g. via foreign keys) - they just don't like 'navigational' being <strong>the only</strong> view on domain data.

                       I agree that Java's concurrency model is inadequate. Actors are a step in the right direction (eliminating shared <em>memory</em>) but they don't preclude shared <em>state</em> (because each actor is stateful and can communicate with more than one other actor) and don't really solve the problem.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                           They absolutely do solve the problem; there is <em>no</em> (let me repeat this: <em>no</em>) shared state in an actor model, because the <em>only accessor</em> of <em>any</em> state at all is the object's class implementation.  <strong>PERIOD.</strong>  Since only one thread of execution can invoke a method at any given time, that eliminates the problem of unsynchronized parallel updates.  All other interactions occur through message passing between instances of objects.  This can't work?  Tell that to the folks who developed the CommodoreAmiga.  Tell that to the folks who developed Erlang, which largely supplies your cell phone provider's computational infrastructure.  Tell that to the folks who revolutionized parallel computing at InmosTransputer.  And on and on.  (Oh, but some of these are instances of <a href="CommunicatingSequentialProcesses.html">CommunicatingSequentialProcesses</a>, and not of actors, you claim.  Well, what is an actor, if not a CSP sitting in a tight getMsg/dispatchMsg/replyMsg loop? <em>(I can only imagine you mean: "what is CSP, if not an actor [...]")</em>)  Did it ever strike you as odd that subclasses in Smalltalk cannot access the private state of their superclasses?  There's a reason for that: Smalltalk objects were <em>originally</em> intended to be self-contained processes (hence all the emphasis on <em>message</em> passing!).  Granted, there are other issues (livelock, et. al.) that occur, but these problems specifically come from the inherent difficulty of <em>any</em> kind of parallelism, and has nothing at all to do with actors versus STM versus other forms of concurrency.  STM and other forms of shared-memory parallelism is the single worst so-called "innovation" to occur, dwarfing even BASIC; for they openly invite programmers to write the <em>bad code</em> that gives rise to the <em>industry</em> that surrounds addressing this utter non-problem.

                               There is a difference between <em>shared memory</em> and <em>shared state</em>. Perhaps you should review some of the motivating examples behind <a href="TransactionalActorModel.html">TransactionalActorModel</a>.

               Data from 'outside' the program can, however, usefully be packaged up into message objects or command objects or proposition objects for processing by the OO program.

                <li>
                   And <em>normal</em> objects as well.  <a href="FiclLanguage.html">FiclLanguage</a>, for example, uses an object system which permits the object's class to be dissociated from the state represented.  <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> uses TypeClasses; they claim it's no substitute for objects, but all evidence seems contrary to this.  The spineless, tagless, G-machine (the virtual machine on which Haskell programs run) represents instances of type classes using a method remarkably similar to how <a href="FiclLanguage.html">FiclLanguage</a> does, even allowing newly compiled code to extend an instance's interface <em>without</em> having to recompile all the old code.  At any rate, this whole thing is non sequitor anyway.

                       TypeClasses support generic programming, not OOP.

                        <li>
                           Then, <em>any</em> interface-based style of programming supports generic programming, and therefore OOP is a form of generic programming, because an interface is precisely what a TypeClass <em>is</em>.  OK, so Haskell normally doesn't expose object references, and so doesn't meet <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>'s definition of OO.  That doesn't invalidate my claims, and in fact, reinforces them.
                          <ul>
                            <li>
                               A TypeClass is an <strong>open function</strong> from <strong>type</strong> -> <strong>function</strong>. You can emulate them with templates (sum_class<T>::zero(), sum_class<T>::add(T a, T b)). But I agree they do bear some semblance to OOP interfaces.
                            </li>

                    <li>
                       The critical element missing is that Haskell doesn't support handles (object references or identifiers) that can be manipulated/stored independently of the object's state. You can look to O'Haskell and various related projects that monadically support OOP.

               It works very well for systems programmers (modulo <a href="CrossCuttingConcern.html">CrossCuttingConcern</a>s like concurrency, persistence, etc.).  The 'domain' of systems programmers is the programming system.
              <ul>

                   And simulation, and GUIs, and games, and music software, and productivity software, and . . .

                       <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> does include simulation <strong>platforms</strong>, GUI <strong>platforms</strong>, game <strong>engines</strong>, productivity support <strong>software</strong>, etc. Games themselves can be better generalized as interactive simulations. But it isn't <a href="SystemProgramming.html">SystemProgramming</a> if it is the 'end product' they are building.
                      <ul>
                        <li>

                               Unless I misunderstood what you said, you extended the 'domain' of systems programmers with 'simulations and GUIs and games and music software and productivity software and ...'. This is utterly <strong>untrue</strong> - unless qualified. <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> does NOT include simulations, but DOES include simulation <strong>platforms</strong> - programs that help programmers write simulatiions.

           But the belief that OOP is a 'good fit' for domains tends to lead people towards building <em>domain simulators</em> when doing so isn't their goal.
          <ul>
            <li>
               All programs are simulations.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   That's an indefensible and irrelevant assertion. Are you also going to claim that all programs are <strong>domain simulators</strong>?
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       That's an indefensible and irrelevant response to an assertion to an equally irrelevant claim made by you.  If a program solves a domain-specific problem, then that program must therefore simulate that domain to the degree necessary to solve the problem.  If you're not happy with my answer, I suggest you clarify what you mean by domain.  I'm interpreting domain in the "industry standard" definition, as in <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>.
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                           The program must also rub its belly and pat its head to the degree necessary to solve the problem, which is not at all. You're losing a LOT of respectability by resorting to vacuous claims.

           And a lot of education material on this subject was written by people who don't actually do it for a living (those who can't... teach). This has perpetuated a misunderstanding of OO, such as the one you present in this page.
          <ul>
            <li>
               That's funny; those who teach place a spectacularly heavy emphasis on <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>, not on OO.  How do you justify your claim?  I also wouldn't exactly call <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> or BjarnStroustroup someone who <em>can't.</em>  By any measure I can see, they've <em>alone</em> done far more than you and I combined.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   I've read several books that teach OO in terms of 'ducks' and 'cows' going 'quack' and 'moo' instead of teaching 'patterns' like observer, visitor, pipelines, functors and task queues, message passing, etc.  And I greatly respect <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>, but I don't believe I've ever seen him teaching people to model domain objects.
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       Then write your own, get it published, use it in your own classes, and make a difference.  There is <em>no problem</em> with modeling a domain with types.  The problem <em>must</em> lie in the methods of teaching.  You claim to be an expert in the field -- <em>leverage</em> that expertise and make your position known <em>with solutions.</em>  Don't just complain -- <em>fix</em> the damn problem you see.

                           There are <em>many</em> problems with modeling domain objects (excepting math/language/programming domains and simulations). Not the least of these problems is a severe conceptual mismatch (<a href="ObjectVsModel.html">ObjectVsModel</a>) - a 'new' Employee in OOP is intended to reflect something in the real world, not produce an object with real behaviors of its own. 'Real world' objects are technically 'views' of data, and the same data can often be simultaneously viewed/modeled as different sets of objects (e.g. waves vs. particles) or with different priorities (<a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>) - a condition that is poorly handled by <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. Any particular view of real-world data will be insufficient for most uses. The use of OOP for domain objects runs into <a href="ExpressionProblem.html">ExpressionProblem</a> (barring <em>open</em> <a href="MultiMethods.html">MultiMethods</a>, which violate the whole <a href="MessagePassing.html">MessagePassing</a> model you've described) and data management problems - data that is reflecting stuff <em>from the domain, which is outside the process</em> is being encapsulated <em>within computation objects inside the process</em>, which requires considerable communication and translation efforts at process initiation followed by continuous maintenance efforts.

      <p>
        <a href="ArgumentsAgainstOop.html">ArgumentsAgainstOop</a> claims, 'OO forces one to think too much about "persistence".' To which I say: Say what? I've been in involved in two object-oriented projects in the last year, one in Javascript and one in Python. In the latter case, we were ripping out an SQL engine in favor of something actually suitable to the task. In neither case did I "worry about persistence." I needed to worry about race conditions, and protocol interpretation, and converting data formats, and keeping track of user chanegs, and flash wear, but never did I worry about persistence. Similarly, the closest I got to worrying about persistence when working on a text editor was when writing the code to implement Put.

        Oh, <strong>come on</strong>! Are people being deliberately obtuse? Javascript means web app, which means not very persistent, since the Javascript code vanishes when the user leaves the page. Javascript is object-oriented. Google maps is a Javascript application. How much can Google maps possible worry about persistence? It has nothing to persist! (There's your specific example. Go wild!)

        For what little it's worth, we ripped out SQLite because we needed to make a schema change, and it was more humane to replace the underlying engine than to rewrite all the (rather poorly designed) tables and views.
