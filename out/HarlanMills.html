      <p>
        Harlan Mills (1919-1996) was a software engineering pioneer, who is known as the originator of cleanroom development and the chief programmer team concept. Mills encourages viewers to think broadly about software engineering issues, to be aware of major historical influences, and to realize the power of the cleanroom approach to software development. As an early advocate of teamwork, Mills motivates viewers to pursue disciplined software engineering through teamwork and encourages research in the software engineering field.

        Mills has set fundamental directions in software development. Combining mathematical rigor, incremental development, and statistical quality control, he developed the cleanroom approach to produce zero-defect software. He was a champion of integrating mathematical discipline into engineering practice to achieve error-free software. --ddjchina www.ddjchina.com
