        Quoting that web page: <em>Michael Abrash's classic Graphics Programming Black Book is a compilation of Michael's writings on </em><a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> and graphics programming (including from his "Graphics Programming" column in Dr. Dobb's Journal). Much of the focus of this book is on profiling and code testing, as well as performance optimization. It also explores much of the technology behind the Doom and Quake 3-D games, and 3-D graphics problems such as texture mapping, hidden surface removal, and the like.<em></em>
