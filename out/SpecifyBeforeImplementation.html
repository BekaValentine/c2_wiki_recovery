        Specify Before Implementation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Of course you specify what your code needs to do before you build the implementation. Don't you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some possible ways that this may be done:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Not at all. <em>[Does anyone know how to get a list to start at 0?]</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Using notation (graphical, textual, mathematical) in a document, such as UML or Z.
        </li>
        <li>
           Using lightweight declarative programming constructs, such as <a href="DesignInIdl.html">DesignInIdl</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Using heavyweight declarative programming constructs, such as an Eiffel class with contracts fully defined on all its features.
        </li>
        <li>
           Using tools to describe the behavior required by the component, such as <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
