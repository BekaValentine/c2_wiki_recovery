        <em>One particular schoolteacher I remember used to send troublesome students to another teacher for a "long stand" (and tartan paint).  They were invariably told by the second teacher to stay put for a moment, whereupon they were left with that which they came for.</em>

        a similar one to that is the <em>long weight</em>
