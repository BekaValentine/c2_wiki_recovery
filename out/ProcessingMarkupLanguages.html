      <p>
        I don't know if its related, but parsing XML and markup languages brings up an interesting question: what does the result look like? As a table-head, I'm tempted to draft the parsed result as something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        table: tag<br/>
        ----------<br/>
        tagID<br/>
        sequence   // may be superfluous with ID, depending on environment<br/>
        tagName<br/>
        parentRef  // parent tag (0 if no parent)<br/>
        isClosed   // "1" if self-closing such as <foo x=1\><br/>
        // Alternative closing tracking to better handle bad or non-trees:<br/>
        closeType  // B=beginning tag, E=ending tag, S=self-closing<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        table: attribs<br/>
        --------------<br/>
        tagRef    // f.k. to tag table<br/>
        attribName<br/>
        attribValue<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A dummy tag, such as "intertext", can perhaps be created for text between tags. What would non-table-heads choose as the output format? Iterators?
      </p>
      <p>
        {A formal Grammar (as per the <a href="ChomskyHierarchy.html">ChomskyHierarchy</a>) can be more general than any regular expression - i.e. capable of matching anything a regular expression can match, plus plus.  The basic output of matching for any grammar is very simple: a boolean indicating whether the structure is a match - is 'legal' within the grammar.  The same would be said for structural regular expressions - simply returning a boolean as to whether the structure matched.  Of course, it's also nice to know -why- a match occurs.  To do that, you essentially add variables to the regular-expression or grammar, and you also need to handle choices (where a component is X or Y or Z, you need to know which 'choice' was made).  The 'return' from a match in this case is the choice and its associated variables.  Very simple.  Things get a tad more complicated if you wish to receive recursive or list variables, but only a tad more.}
      </p>
      <p>
        {As far as parse-results in general, either a single hierarchical value-structure, or a stream of such structures (depending on the medium), is most natural for the result of a parse. Database tables are best used for data - literally, propositions held to be true - not for partial values that individually say nothing of their world or context.  Also, you need to be careful with tables: ordering is relevant in the parsing of XML and SGML.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I believe your response reflects the </em><a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> RDBMS bias. Tools like a <a href="NimbleDatabase.html">NimbleDatabase</a> and <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> can transcend the <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> stiffness of the current flavor of RDBMS. And, relational is perfectly capable of storing and using ordering-related info. --top<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Relational can store ordering if you include some sort of ordering identifier - a double or integer, for example.  That is not reflected in your above schema.}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's called "sequence" above and has been there from the beginning.
        </li>
        <li>
           {Ah.  That's what "sequence" meant, then.  It is unclear from the above spec.}
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm curious, how <em>did</em> you interpret it?
        </li>
        <li>
           {I thought it a boolean indicating that the tag starts a sequence.}
        </li>
        <li>
           Interesting interpretation. I guess that's why examples are nice because it is impossible to guess all the different ways one can interpret it differently than intended by the author. By the way, I'd use "isSequence" for a Boolean.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        {And <a href="NimbleDatabase.html">NimbleDatabase</a>s are still databases.  They ought to store meaningful data.  Structural information on the tags in the file is not particularly meaningful.  Admittedly, at least, you intend this 'table' to be extremely transitory and subject to further processing.  But I can't see it as a great deal more useful than storing structural information on anything else... e.g. on text files:}
      </p>
      <code>
        table: my-text-file<br/>
        ------------<br/>
        char  // unicode codepoint<br/>
        pos   // position in file (integer)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        {That you CAN extract and represent structure in a set of tables by introducing artificial identifiers and references doesn't make it particularly useful to do so.  You maintain the exact same information, and at least the same capability of processing it, simply by using a plain data-structure - a string for text-files, and a hierarchical structure for XML.  If you were to extract semantic information (e.g. relating books to their authors) from the XML file into a table, I'd have far fewer objections.  Unfortunately, even XML schema never specify semantics.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not following your argument. If one wants to process information from an XML/HTML document, using it in raw form can be daunting. <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> applies here. I don't want to mix parsing with processing if I don't have to. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {I'm not saying you should mix parsing with processing (at least for XML; streaming text would be a different matter).  I'm saying that a table doesn't <em>help</em>.  It provides no benefit whatsoever over a hierarchical datatype (since you NEED the structure in order to make sense of an XML document), but they're a bit harder to work with (since you'll be rebuilding the structure in order to make sense of the XML document).  Tables can be made to work, but they aren't the right tool for the job.  Everything you break down into that table will need to be built up again to make sense of it.  It's a little bit like the tables are artificially injected just to look neat... like <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> for the parsing problem.}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is only gold-plating under the <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> view of tables. Again, I honed my nimble table skills in <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, which made creating, filling, and inspecting tables a snap, and far more visual/inspectable than arrays or linked lists. That's NOT gold-plating, that's using powerful tools for programmer productivity and structure transperency/x-ray-ability. I don't think you "get" the power of tables. The same project in say Java would take roughly 5 times more code and 5 times the amount of time. In a scriptish language, the diff would be smaller, but still there. (The only signif downside in Xbase is obtaining arbitrary-lengthed columns without relying on "memo" fields, which is a tool-specific problem. <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> is possible.) --top
        </li>
        <li>
           {Whether a programming environment makes it easy to inspect arrays, linked lists, tables, and other data-structures is truly based on the environment, not so much on the data structure.  If you're asserting that tables are somehow <em>fundamentally</em> more transparent than arrays and linked lists, you're certainly wrong (trivially, one could view any array as a table).  And your claim that '<a href="YouJustDontGetIt.html">YouJustDontGetIt</a>' is also wrong; I'm quite familiar with the 'power' of tables.  What I "don't get" is your silly and entirely arbitrary insistence that any value more complex than a string is some sort of sin against the IT profession.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Plus, if its in a structure, one can go back and forth and up and down etc., while during-parse iterators (getNextTag(...)) generally cannot. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {I did not propose use of iterators.  I'd much prefer to take a hierarchical data structure of the XML, and write a <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> over it (using Haskell or OCaml-style pattern-matching) that extracts semantic information, and transform it in one step to represent the semantic information.  XML is pure structure, and its semantics are largely embedded in that structure; you'll always need such a step to capture semantics.  I'd be quite willing to drop into a nimble database the semantic information extracted from the XML.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Comparison to a raw text file is not applicable because there is <strong>no pre-digestion</strong> into tokens of some sort in a character-per-character representation. With the tag tables, one is dealing with XML statements and their related attributes, not individual characters. It goes up the abstraction ladder from mere characters. It's at the token and statement level, not at the character level. Maybe I'm not understanding what you perceive as the alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Comparison to raw text file is applicable, though perhaps a little extreme.  It actually does some pre-digestion, btw - to get unicode codepoints, you'll generally need to "pre-digest" UTF-7, UTF-8, or UTF-16.          But if use of 'tokens' are your primary objection, it wouldn't hurt my example to separate the text-file into tokens.  Either way, having just the structure of the text is quite pointless - it isn't useful data.  Neither the text format nor the XML format you propose offer real 'data' about anything except representation of 'data' in the file.}
      </p>
      <code>
        table: my-text-file-2<br/>
        -------------------<br/>
        token   text-word or other token (punctuation, formatting)<br/>
        pos     position in file (integer)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        {It might be hard to see where I'm coming from without a couple examples... e.g. an XML file for configuring a GUI, and/or an XML update format for multi-library purchases, checkins, and checkouts.}
      </p>
      <p>
        {As a note, when I'm feeling lazy about it and am uncaring about efficiency, my approach looks something like:}
      </p>
      <code>
        XML => Node (value-object) with sequence of sub-nodes (including text-nodes) and map of attributes<br/>
        Node with sequence of sub-nodes and map of attributes => function that extracts all semantic information<br/>
        Semantic information => manipulation of application (change settings, update DB, etc.)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        {Iterators might be used over the sequences and maps for languages that lack efficient pattern-matching or fold operations (e.g. C++), but would be performed over the structure, rather than directly out of the XML.  More relevantly, the function that extracts information is generally somewhat recursive and/or 'deep'... e.g. to construct recursive components.  For a GUI-description, for example, it needs to design components that set up windows with certain widgets and display hooks (gauges, lists, etc.) and operational hooks (on click) and whatnot.  I've done such when writing an OpenGL-only GUI for an in-video-game menu system.  Relevantly, if I had put all this into table, I could have made that work too... but I'd need to do all those joins just to acquire the structure back in order to build the GUI.}
      </p>
      <p>
        {Here's a question I have for you: (Other than the fact that you simply love tables and want to inject them into every operation you perform ;-) <em>Why would you break down a hierarchical structure when you'll just need to do re-work to build it again?  Especially for something as transitory and (by itself) meaningless as the XML parse result?</em>}
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't understand the question. And, XML is not necessarily hierarchical. How about you present a specific scenario. Otherwise, we'll probably keep talking past each other via generalizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        {With XML you're legally limited to exactly one tag if you wish to entirely avoid hierarchy.  More relevantly, the cases where the hierarchy is shallow are rare; there's not much point in arguing what is 'necessarily' true when actual truth is readily available.  As far as talking past one another... that isn't really possible without you doing a bit more talking.  I will use a scenario if you present one.  The above question I have for you is from the 'then what?' aspect of breaking the XML hierarchy down so you can fit it into a table.  So you broke it down... then what?  My conjecture, from both experience and analysis, is that the 'then what' is (except for some possible rare cases) to rebuild the hierarchy so you can extract meaningful data out of the XML.  Since the hierarchy provides context that gives the tags their meaning, doing so would often be necessary.  And doing so strikes me as rather pointless rework.}

      </p>
      <p>
        Well, okay, let's say we want to mine Ebay for certain products and related info. Suppose there are a bunch of TD's in the HTML that contain description and value pairs, such as the label "price" and the value of price. Example:
      </p>
      <code>
        <td color="brown" align="right">Price:</td><td>$19.95</td><br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        tagID...seq...tagName...closeType<br/>
        ----------------------------------<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          .....50....TD...........B

        <li>
          .....53....TD...........B
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
          .....VALUE.......$19.95
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        etc...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (Dots to prevent <a href="TabMunging.html">TabMunging</a>. Also note that the "intertext" convention and the "closeType" convention option is used in the example.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If we wanted to extract that, then we can search for the text contents of "price:" between TD and end-TD tags. When we find it, then just increment the sequence number by 3 to get to the adjacent TD's contents tag, and we have price (and a sanity check on tag name). <strong>We don't have to traverse trees</strong> in this case, and even if we did, its perfectly possible to iterate through trees when in tables. (And some query languages have built-in tree traversal operations.) I find that data often naturally is either not tree-shaped to begin with, or can easily be "flattened" for the purpose at hand such that dealing with viney trees in raw form is not that common of a need. Trees are over-used and over-assumed in IT in my opinion. (I may use more intermediate tables closer to the domain/project besides just the parsed markup tables shown here. Some language/tools make ad-hoc or nimble tables easy, some don't.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that I wasn't clear on how to deal with ending tags, but the process is the same regardless of which approach is taken.
      </p>
      <p>
        {If you choose, as you've done, to relegate the problem to the pattern-matching algorithm, you've simply shifted the problem... not solved it.  You'll end up relying upon a consistent pattern in the source text.  This particular problem wouldn't have been any more difficult to extract all the 'Price:' components from even if you chose to use a regular expression over raw text, which indicates that extracting first to the table is still <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a>.  And, as with regular expressions and other naive pattern-matching algorithms, your approach would ultimately fail on the exceptions.  E.g. it can fail if they choose to make a price-value bold (<td><b><strong>$19.99!</strong></b></td>) in order to indicate that it is a 'Buy it Now!' opportunity or that the auction is about to expire, and it can fail if they have some inconsistent spacing (<td>Price:&nbsp;</td><td>19.99</td>), etc.}
      </p>
      <p>

        Your sample perhaps can use some wiki-escaping. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And the same kind of processing can apply.  We can fancy it up to ignore tags between TD and "intertext" (dummy tag) without significant re-work (using original HTML example). 
      </p>
      <p>
        {That might work until you see: "<td>Price:</td><td>&nbsp;&nbsp;<b>19.99</b></td>", at which point the spaces between the tags become 'intertext' (though perhaps not in HTML - at least in XML you can't generically dismiss spacing as insignificant).  Patchwork solutions to pattern-matching problems usually give patchwork results, be they at the token level OR the raw text level.  My own observation (after working with languages) is that, beyond the Chomsky Hierarchy, it is not a meaningfully 'easier' problem to match at the character level vs. the token or structure level.  (I.e. any lex problem can be solved just as readily by yacc.)}

      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't think it is realistic to try to work around every possible future change. If they stick nbsp's or whatnot in there, then it breaks and we adjust it. (We may want to validate the items we extract to better catch any changes.) They might even go away from HTML tables, and bust it that way. It's one of those issues of how far to go with the <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> rule of thumb. I generally fall into the middle of the road with regard to <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a>.

               Note: A general-purpose xml/html markup parser could perhaps have an option to convert character espaces such as nbsp's into ascii equivalents or a substition character of our chosing, such as "?" if there is no translation.

Any reasonable database could translate/store in utf-8 if necessary.  And I'd also expect that '&nbsp;' (and family) and '&#<codepoint>;' and '&#x<hex-codepoint>;' would all be translated properly into the associated characters.  I guess I consider it a non-issue.  Spaces are part of the 'intertext', which is all that is relevant in the discussion above.}

So long as you're dealing with simplistic patterns, it will be much easier to simply write a simple <a href="RegExp.html">RegExp</a> to extract it.

      </ul>
      <p>
        In fact, in table form that is easier to do than with regular expressions. Starting out with regular expressions creates a <a href="DiscontinuitySpike.html">DiscontinuitySpike</a> because reg-ex is either not sophisticated enough, or more work than using tables when dealing with tag-per-tag context. Reg-ex deals at the character levels, not atomized tags and attributes.  That is because in tablized form, it is already a higher abstraction than what reg-ex would be looking at. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {You seem to be arguing that regular expressions are more work because they are more work in a rather circular manner.  Are you ready to establish that pattern-matching problems over raw text are meaningfully more difficult than pattern-matching problems over tokenized text that just happens to be stored in a table?}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tokenizing stuff into a structure that is representationally equivalent to the original (within reason) is generally more usable than parsing raw text. Always easier? I won't commit to that.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We get tag info, attribute info, and position info readily on hand. We can search, sort, and calculate on any of these with the ease of a query language (and basic app-language loops and IF's). Reg-ex makes a lack-luster query language. It is not powerful/concise enough on the token level. (Related: <a href="GrepVsDatabase.html">GrepVsDatabase</a>)

           Reg-ex as commonly used is very non-mnemonic. Non-cryptic replacements are going to be more verbose than using a query language. The more complex stuff you do with it, the more cryptic one's code is. And one is still dealing at the character level of abstraction instead of the token level. I'm isolating concerns.
        </li>
        <li>
           {I disagree with your assertion; if you build reg-ex's up like small grammars, they can be quite readable and memorable.  Writing one big-arse reg-ex won't be any more cryptic than writing one big-arse procedure to do all your pattern-matching.  To the contrary, grammars in general are much easier to read, write, and maintain than queries to extract patterns among tokens.  And I'm saying that, for pattern-matching at least, dealing at the character-level of abstraction is not fundamentally more difficult than the token-level.  You aren't saving much by working with the tokens.}

This difference is fundamental.  Unless your goal is to index or annotate the source, you really need to extract meaning from the file before you have anything worth querying.  Arguing that a reg-ex is a lack-luster query language is pointless before establishing the need for one.  Creating an artificial need for queries by forcing the representation of the file into a table doesn't count - doing so is a fine example of <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a>.}

More usefully, I could write a generic function that can check generic XMLData items against generic XMLSchema.  I can also write a single big function to extract semantics that are quite sensitive to such things as whether 'tagx' is found under a 'tagy' vs. a 'tagz'.}

But if your language only supports parsers over strings, that would be the way to go.  Ultimately, one extracts semantics via pattern-matching with a grammar, and the application of some function.  A <a href="RegExp.html">RegExp</a> extraction is sufficient for the simplistic eBay example you initially solved with the offset, but higher level grammars work as one adds complexity.  Either way, the parse tables are superfluous.}

           Well, your opinion is based on hate of tables. Tables are not even the whole issue. What I'm doing is separating character-level parsing from structural analysis and dealing with relationships between tokens instead of the character level relationships. I'm shifting up the abstraction level and putting it in an easy-to-navigate data structure/system. I'm setting it free. It's now random-access, query-able, and above character-level. That is a good thing.

           I don't have to get more experience if I leverage my existing knowledge of tables and queries.

It is about extracting domain-specific info from mark-up languages.

        <li>
           {I think it quite obvious that extracting domain-specific info from a mark-up <strong>language</strong> IS a <strong>language-centric</strong> issue.

        <li>
           {And so long as you're dealing with very simple problems, like looking for 'Price:' next to a number in a very fixed format, you'll probably do well enough with tables, just as a person could very easily do well enough if they "leverage existing knowledge of procedural".  (<a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a>: Why Grammars?) Where you'll encounter problems, top, is when the language itself, and the patterns involved (which contain the domain-specific info), get to be more complex.  The complexity of queries or procedural code grows differently than that of a grammar, mostly because there are more and more omissions, ambiguities, and variations that you need to handle <em>explicitly</em> in procedural code and queries that are handled via <em>implicit backtracking</em> and the various 'or' options (x | y | z, '?', '*') with grammars and regexps and such (and that's ignoring the more complex grammars, which may need guard statements and context-sensitivity). Demonstrating this growth of complexity with didactic examples is an effin' pain (partly because didactic examples are <em>supposed to be simple</em>).  Fortunately, I don't need to 'show' this for it to be true - I know it to be true from experience, and I'll quite happily allow you to run smack into the problem on your own time.}

           I gave you a chance to pick an example first. You told me to go instead, so I picked something that reflected a mark-up need I've actually seen: scraping e-commerce listings from different sites. If you don't want to take the effort to produce a sufficient example, that is NOT MY FAULT. You are chewing me out because you are lazy? Actually, I suspect if somebody had to scrap enough e-commerce screens, they'd eventually want to form a library of common scraping needs. Example:
        </li>

      <code>
        getValue(tag1, attrib1, tag2, attrib2, distance, value, compareOp, options)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This would get the N'th tag2 after tag1 (or before if negative) where attrib1 contained the given value. Tags outside of those listed are not counted in the "distance" metric. The compare-op is the comparison used (equals, contains, starts-with, etc.) Perhaps regex's could be used instead of compare-op. Or, just pass an expression to be eval'd (HOF-like in scriptland). I'd chose tabling to implement such functions, of course.

Even if your complaint is about the 'repetition' of common patterns from one problem to another (numbers, XML structure, etc.), it really isn't difficult to already have the generic lower-level patterns already available for everything from numbers to markup tags.  It wouldn't be difficult to add them by hand for something as simple as the basic XML structure, but (as you had below for your "I'm gonna skip all the stuff for getting XML into the table" comment) one doesn't need to do so.  In addition, if you use pattern-matching or parsers for both low-level and high-level patterns, then there is no massive <a href="DiscontinuitySpike.html">DiscontinuitySpike</a> between the two.  I.e. ignoring the 'B' and 'span' tags isn't more difficult than ignoring anything else - you simply describe it as an optional extra in the pattern you're looking for, or as something that can be reduced (&ignored - like a comment) within any pattern.}

           As already described, data interchange is rather trivial because it's data already prepared to be fairly easy to grab. It doesn't have all the aesthetic decorations that otherwise make the road bumpy and harsh. Effort for data interchange programming is mostly about converting data conventions from one system to that of another, such row-to-columns, columns-to-rows, single record to multiple records, etc. This is not a particularly "grammary" task either. You are looking for grammars in the clouds when they are merely clouds. (I suppose there is an <a href="EverythingIsa.html">EverythingIsa</a> way to view everything as a grammar, but this is merely the multi-paths to <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> showing its face.)
        </li>
        <li>
           {Data Interchange isn't so 'trivial' when the databases on both sides of the interchange aren't exactly identical in structure, semantics, or schema.  (E.g. consider data interchange between different libraries, each having their own database with non-standard schema.)  And it is still a pain-in-the-arse to code and a fine example of <a href="ProcessingMarkupLanguages.html">ProcessingMarkupLanguages</a>.  And it is a pattern-matching problem - one can write a grammar and semantics to extract the relevant information because grammars are equivalent to any other pattern-matching language.  Compiled grammars are the right tool for the job of pattern-matching because they simplify the main problems of variations, repetitions, omissions/options, and ambiguities.  (Admittedly if your source has NONE of those things, then it is relatively easy to process with plain-ol'-procedures or tables or whatnot, at your preference.  OTOH, it also makes for a very, very, VERY simple grammar.)}

               {No, not 'plain and simple'.  'FORMAT' is just another word for 'REPRESENTATION' and 'STRUCTURE', which is what <strong>grammars</strong> are all about.

            </li>
            <li>
              It is not significantly different than typical data conversion tasks with OR without XML once I use the XML-to-table gizmo. The kinds of transformations that are needed would not be significantly different than converting say a GIS database from one vendor to that of another's. See "Typical tasks for data conversion" below for more. You need to show that grammaring is signif better than tabling for the listed items. If the effort is the same, then I go with my personal preference. (I didn't mean to imply that data conversion is "trivial". It is often highly involved and labor-intensive; just not in a "grammar" sense.)

It will work well enough for data that is pre-structured in a simple manner that is already very close to what you need in the end (which seems to be "typical").  It certainly helps that you are already assuming free support for getting data into the tables from a vast array of data formats (a not-unreasonable assumption, but almost certainly not done with 'tables').

Anyhow, the "fuss" as you call it is that you seem to make your conclusions based on the few magic-buttons provided by your Database tool.  Consider a more generic problem, like attempting to extract the XML-structure itself from table of (index,character) representing the file, and you'll get to experience what it is like attempting to actually derive higher-level patterns from lower-level patterns, and XML itself is extremely simple to parse compared to many languages.  The same basic approach gets you to yet higher-level patterns as lower-level patterns.  But you seem to be ignoring that, pretending that a magic-button will always exist that gets you to within 10' of where you need to be, and the worst you'll experience from that point is parsing "xxx, yyy" into two different columns.  Hah.  I won't begrudge you the magic buttons that do exist, but I do think you're generalizing from a bad sample-set.}

Whether you'll need higher-level patterns depends on the difference between database semantics, and once you start dealing with patterns again you'll benefit from a grammar... e.g. where you can simply <em>declare</em> in a pattern-matching language that having a particular attribute or structure or tag-ordering means it best matches one pattern and not the other, instead of needing to explicitly code  (and maintain) a convoluted array explicit pattern-tests and checks and whatever procedural, functional, or (your choice) query languages you're choosing to use.}

           As far as things not existing, we'd have to look at the actual pattern of non-existence. We cannot anticipate up-front all possible ways that non-existence might be handled, only make a guess.

But even if you can't, it's hardly a rational argument against grammars.  Part of the reason grammars are good is that they're easier to fix, since, when you failed to anticipate something, you just make one small tweak and it propagates all the way back to the procedures that search for it.  Not so with 'explicit' pattern-matching, where you might need to change stuff}

I can only vaguely recall my own experiences with creating minor modifications to a language (even simple addition of options) that created ambiguities such that I had to entirely restructure the hand-written parser for the language to handle the ambiguity correctly.  That was before I really learned about grammars, and learned they handle ambiguities very well.}

           If the price value is 4 cells away from the cell containing "price:" (sometimes "filler" table cells are used for spacing), but on a given run the 4th cell does not exist or doesn't contain numerics, what are you gonna do? We can record a blank/missing price and log the problem and/or halt, but beyond that we cannot do much without making risky assumptions. Are you suggesting the computer start guessing how the HTML was changed, such as looking in the 3rd and 5th cell? That's utterly ridiculous. We don't want to turn a small business into an AI lab.

I'd bet money that in 50 years, your small business IT stuff will essentially be AI microfactories (at least relative to what we call 'AI' today... the word tends to be a moving goalpost, such that stuff we figure out how to do well is suddenly insufficiently advanced to decorate with the term 'AI').  Anyhow, the computer shouldn't start guessing how the HTML was changed.  But there is no reason that you should force it to be concerned about the exact number of columns difference.  Line-items in HTML tables can easily have different numbers of columns, for example, based on whether the item fulfills various conditions.}

        <li>
           I don't think the software should guess when the columns change from where expected. Many layouts are not strictly grid-based anyhow. I suppose if it is strictly grid-based, we can check the column titles as a feature.

I'm too lazy for that - I'd much rather use a tool <em>designed</em> for the purpose and that is easier to show correct, like grammars.   There is a reason, top, that people use grammars and pattern-matching languages rather than directly writing special queries or procedures or functions that handle every ambiguity and special case - the moment the language has ambiguities, options, omissions, and variations, it's pretty much necessary for complexity management.}

           And you seem obsessed with having some kind of mathematical proof behind your solution. It's possible that the HTML generated has flaws in it, I would note. For example, it may be missing end tags, be in non-nested order, etc. (<b><i>xxx</b></i>) If we over-tie to assumed regularity, typos in the HTML may cause problems in something that tries to use mathematical purity.

        <li>
           {And you can also end up with typos and such in the word 'Price' and whatnot.  You can try to handle them or not at your discretion, top.  The typos you mention will cause you just as many problems in your table form (or even getting them into table form) as they would any generic XML parser.  But I should note that grammars don't necessarily imply this "mathematical purity" you're mentioning.  Regular Expressions are simple grammars and are very easily applied without attempting to find some structure for the whole file.}

           Grammars tend to derail easier when they expect proper ordering, nesting, closing, etc. Authors may also "write to bugs" in rendering engines (Internet Explorer is the most common target). To "prove" it "right", it may have to reinvent how IE renders internally, which is probably a hack-it-up job from some 3rd-world country because they were the lowest bidder, not a math thesis. IE is the main test-bed, not math, and it is not known for its clean logic and consistency. You cannot model a specific swamp with simple math: a swamp is a swamp.

        <li>
           {That is true.  I imagine that grammars and types and various other things simply aren't worth the effort for you to learn to use correctly since you don't see much need for them in the widespread but relatively monotonous domain of IT in which you work.

But it is true that any describable structure or pattern of structures can be described with one (given a grammar-language supporting the correct level <em>or lower</em> in the <a href="ChomskyHierarchy.html">ChomskyHierarchy</a>, and the right dimensionality and primitives (e.g. 2D color images (primitive = color pixel aligned in two dimensions with other pixels) are difficult to pattern-match with a 1D text grammar (primitive = character aligned in one dimension with other characters))).  Any (pure) pattern-matching language you can come up with will ultimately be equivalent (mathematically isomorphic) to some grammar or other. {And I do expect that people will come up with a library to help find patterns they're looking for in text and capture variables out of them.  In full maturity, after considerable refactoring, I'd quite expect such a library would look distinctly like support for writing <em>a grammar</em>, possessing generic pattern-matching and analysis.  And perhaps you could use functions that compile a grammar into query statements over a table... just like they are commonly compiled into a massive set of procedures with procedural code.

        {Data often is 'flat' in a sense, but when you open an XML document, and even after you parse out the tags, you aren't working with "the data" yet.  You're working with the representation and transport medium of the data.  And, for XML at least, that representation IS 'tree-shaped' to begin with.  CSV would be better to avoid tree-shape to begin with.  Anyhow, once you get it down to {Item:X,Price:Y} tuples, THEN you'll have the "flat" data you desire.  And getting there will generally require BOTH pattern-matching (syntax) and processing (to imbue semantics).}
