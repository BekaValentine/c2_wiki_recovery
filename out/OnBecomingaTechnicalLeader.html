        The title is a deliberate play on <a href="OnBecomingaLeader.html">OnBecomingaLeader</a> by <a href="WarrenBennis.html">WarrenBennis</a>. Jerry talks a lot about how one leads from a technical position, with his usual clarity. Also a strong bias toward seeing the work situation as a system, and an emphasis on individuals.

        The book deserves mention because it's definition of leadership is as compelling as <a href="DeMarco.html">DeMarco</a>'s from <a href="PeopleWare.html">PeopleWare</a>: "A leader creates a context in which others can succeed."
