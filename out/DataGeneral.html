      <p>
        MiniComputer company founded in 1968 by former <a href="DigitalEquipmentCorporation.html">DigitalEquipmentCorporation</a> employees. Its first computer, the DataGeneralNova, came out the next year. The Nova's good low-end PricePerformance made it a hit, and for several years DG enjoyed great success as a brash competitor which squeezed the margins of DEC and other minicomputer makers. But DG was slow with a response to the DecVax, partly due to internal troubles. By 1980 it produced the EclipseMv, which did respectably in competition with the VAX. (<em></em><a href="TheSoulOfaNewMachine.html">TheSoulOfaNewMachine</a><em> records the </em>EclipseMv project and the earlier history of DG.) But by then the rise of the <a href="WorkStation.html">WorkStation</a> and <a href="PeeCee.html">PeeCee</a> was imminent. DG responded with some interesting and innovative <a href="LaptopComputer.html">LaptopComputer</a> and <a href="WorkStation.html">WorkStation</a> products but never recovered its earlier success. In 1999 it was bought up by EmcCorporation.
