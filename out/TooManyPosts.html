        Gee whiz!  Why does the second "delete" always give me this message, these days:
      </p>
      <code>
        The <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> Server Can not Process Your Request<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Too many posts from 172.56.17.131. Your changes not saved..<br/>
      </code>
      <code>

        It's tedious to confirm the deletes of <a href="SgWa.html">SgWa</a> with such restrictions!

        Certainly I've been "off and on" and "out of touch" a lot recently.  I'm a busy guy.  But have things changed that much around here?

        That is a new one on me, and I edit here quite a lot, mainly doing gnoming. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>.

        Don't think I've ever hit that one manually, but the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> occasionally experiences it. When it does, I turn down one of the parameters governing update rate, then it goes away. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        I can't seem to do more than one edit -- without giving it a delay of some unknown number of hours.   :-(

        I guess it doesn't like my IP address.
        It's my TMobile phone.

        I hate to use proxy servers to get around the issue.  :-(
