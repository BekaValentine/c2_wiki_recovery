        To keep things onTopic, <a href="LifeTime.html">LifeTime</a> of a Tech career is short and getting shorter, before <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> days business applications mostly used Cobol. Now it is a new language every three years, sometimes called the same name just to confuse people.

        And HR people are always requiring five years experience in it even if it has only been around for 6 months. And if you have used versions 1, 2, 3, through 9 in it, and then did something else and have not used version 11 of it, you do not have the correct experience for the job.
