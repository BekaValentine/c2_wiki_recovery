        Mind Fsck
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="MindFsck.html">MindFsck</a> is the process of telling someone something to fundamentally change their intent. It is most effective to tell it to them when their critical faculties are arrested, like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When they're at their parents' knee - before the age of 7 is best.
        </li>
        <li>
           When they're in an artificially induced hypnotic state, like when sleep-starved, or doing yoga, or or watching television, or
        </li>
        <li>
           When they're experiencing some kind of personal crisis - death of a loved one, fear of fate, severe depression, that sort of thing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is possible for a <a href="MindFsck.html">MindFsck</a> to be a good, healthy, loving thing, like when AA heals an Alcoholic. Usually, of course, it's covert and sordid, intended for <a href="TheManufacturingOfConsent.html">TheManufacturingOfConsent</a>. This is why <a href="MindFsck.html">MindFsck</a>s are the basis of both advertising and religion.

        The use of "fsck" as a replacement for "EffYuCeeKay" (TheFword) is a Unixism. "fsck" is a Unix program which does a filesystem consistency check and repair. When your file system is badly damaged, you are indeed fscked.

        ... and there I was thinking that a mind fsck was when you check that your internal beliefs, values and goals are consistent and corruption free. ;-) -- some guy
