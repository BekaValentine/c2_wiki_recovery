        Documentation Compliant
      </h1>
      <p>
        A methodology is <a href="DocumentationCompliant.html">DocumentationCompliant</a> when it produces the sort of documentation required by large bureaucratic clients. Some lightweight methodologies are not very <a href="DocumentationCompliant.html">DocumentationCompliant</a>, which makes it hard to use said methodology to satisfy such a client.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note that this "definition" isn't very useful. Being compliant to a requirement that a process produce documents isn't about the documents -- it's about the </em>process<em>, and </em>that<em> needs to be compliant. The resulting documents are a product, not a means.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Not impossible though. You might use your methodology to write the specified program, then write the necessary amount of design documentation required by the client, <em>from the program</em>.

        Apply this to XP and you almost (but not quite) get reverse waterfall:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Analyse
        </li>
        <li>
          Test
        </li>
        <li>
          Code
        </li>
        <li>
          Design
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>But keeping in mind that it's not a mirror image, because of the iterative / evolutionary characteristics of XP.</em>
      </p>

        <strong>Hmm.</strong> You <em>might</em> be able to get the required documents from the code, but prolly not. Many, many times in the last 38 years I have seen clients' engineers try to retrofit a document to a collection of code only to produce a mess that makes references to specific implementations of that code, often lifting variable/entity names right out of the source. What they end up with is a description of how they implemented a particular approach to a particular design, <em>not</em> a generalized description of the problem and its solution. The original term and its definition is still not useful.
