        Design Code Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        Describe <a href="DesignCodeTest.html">DesignCodeTest</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        The three things a <a href="SoftwareDeveloper.html">SoftwareDeveloper</a> must do in order to successfully write a <a href="ComputerProgram.html">ComputerProgram</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The three elements, <a href="DesignCodeTest.html">DesignCodeTest</a>, form (what I believe is) the absolute minimum steps in any <a href="SoftwareDevelopmentProcess.html">SoftwareDevelopmentProcess</a>.  However, it is clear that <a href="DesignCodeTest.html">DesignCodeTest</a> is a necessary, but not sufficient process to complete an <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>.  The binding element is (of course) analysis; the incredibly HardToDefine step which (in some sense) glues together <a href="DesignCodeTest.html">DesignCodeTest</a> and permeates the entire <a href="SoftwareDevelopmentProcess.html">SoftwareDevelopmentProcess</a>, not simply the development of a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> which may form the basis for EngineeringTasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, <a href="DesignCodeTest.html">DesignCodeTest</a> may need to be applied during the entire <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>.  For instance, consider the interface between WriteStories (a <a href="BusinessProcess.html">BusinessProcess</a>) and EstimateStories (a <a href="SoftwareDevelopmentProcess.html">SoftwareDevelopmentProcess</a>), which could be an extremely expensive bridge to cross (see <a href="ExtremeDeployment.html">ExtremeDeployment</a>) One way to connect this interface is through SoftwarePrototyping, which is most certainly a <a href="SoftwareDevelopmentProcess.html">SoftwareDevelopmentProcess</a> <a href="DesignCodeTest.html">DesignCodeTest</a> activity that is strangely absent from the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>; it is certainly "too late in the game" (pun intended :-) to do SoftwarePrototyping right before the SteeringPhase IterationPlanningGame (or whatever was meant by that <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> <a href="FlowChart.html">FlowChart</a> ;-).
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, lots of Analysis+<a href="DesignCodeTest.html">DesignCodeTest</a> steps are needed in every phase in order to <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>  -- <a href="SteveBravo.html">SteveBravo</a>

        <em>This page needs *a lot* of work</em> - and I've seen plenty of programs that obviously skipped the design and test phases.
      </p>
      <p>
        Did they work? I believe the key word is "successfully". 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The program ran. "successfully" should be defined to avoid a </em><a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> debate on this. perhaps you mean "in order to write a successful program"<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Debate avoided.
