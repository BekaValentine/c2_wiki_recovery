        I'm a bloke who backed into being a developer because he found out he liked it and turned out to be a little better at than others.  My formal education is lacking, I've got a B.F.A. in screen writing and have never really ever had a mentor.  All that means, I guess, is that I thoroughly enjoy this wiki, feel completely stupid reading it, and hope to learn something.
