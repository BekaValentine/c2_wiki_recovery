        DWIM - Do What I Mean (Not What I Say)
      </p>

      <p>
        From the <a href="JargonFile.html">JargonFile</a> (via <a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=dwim&action=Search):">http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?query=dwim&action=Search):</a>

        <dd>DWIM is often suggested in jest as a desired feature for a complex program; it is also occasionally described as the single instruction the ideal computer would have. Back when proofs of program correctness were in vogue, there were also jokes about "DWIMC" (Do What I Mean, Correctly). A related term, more often seen as a verb, is DTRT (Do The <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a>).</dd>
