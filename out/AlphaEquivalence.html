        Alpha Equivalence
      </h1>
      <p>
        Two expressions are <strong>AlphaEquivalent</strong> if one can be obtained from the other by non-clashing substitution of <a href="FreeVariable.html">FreeVariable</a> names.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>\x.\y.xyz</em> is Alpha Equivalent to <em>\a.\b.abz</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        but 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>\x.\y.xyz</em> is equivalent to neither <em>\a.\b.abc</em> nor <em>\a.\a.aaz</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Example: With the <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>, when you do an Extract Method, it determines if there is another method in the class or superclasses  that has the same structure. If there is, it offers to make a call to it rather than creating a new method. It basically uses what is known as <a href="AlphaEquivalence.html">AlphaEquivalence</a>. Meaning that <em>the two methods can have different variable names as long as they are used in the same manner</em>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Because of <a href="AlphaEquivalence.html">AlphaEquivalence</a> a CaptureAvoidingRenaming is usually assumed to be implicitly done when performing e.g. BetaReduction or substitution in <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A way to avoid the need for CaptureAvoidingRenaming is to always rename to a CanonicalLambdaForm (which means, that the names can be dropped on the lambda actually).
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>\x.\y.xyz</em> becomes <em>\a.\b.abz</em> which can be shortened to <em>\\abz</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>\n.\a.\q.xqza</em> becomes <em>\a.\b.\c.xczb</em> which can be shortened to <em>\\\xczb</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (The 'canonical' order abcdefg... is assumed).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is usually less readable, but better suited for automatical processing.
