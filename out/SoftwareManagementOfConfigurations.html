        Software Management Of Configurations
      </h1>
      <p>
        SCM is management assisted with software tools. Is this a restriction? It is a
        self-fulfilling prophecy to answer no. The level of management attainable
        through SCM should be unreachable in any other way, inescapable. The reasoning
        is that what is allowed by SCM is collaborative management, i.e. management of
        complexities beyond the reach of any individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        The tools do bring restrictions: those related to their idiosyncrasy. E.g.
        <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> applies only to files (and directories). Files are the atom on which
        is built <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> genericity. This is a restriction when it comes to
        managing a database (or an image, as in typical Smalltalk development
        environments).
      </p>
      <p>
        There is here a paradox, and a circle. Since SCM is tool aided management, its
        kind of genericity depends on something specific to the SCM tool. It doesn't
        make much sense to speak of generic SCM, abstracting the tool away. At least
        doing so would drop us back to pre-SCM management, which is unacceptably
        weaker. -- <a href="MarcGirod.html">MarcGirod</a>
