        Grammar Vandal
      </h1>
      <p>
        We need a way to talk about this guy with WikiWords. He has been known as Anon, Nomad, BlueYonder, 217.137.*.dial.ntli.net, and some other names. Anon and Nomad aren't WikiWords, and BlueYonder is specific to one ISP. <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> isn't exactly as accurate as would be PunctuationVandal, but it is easier to type and has been in use for some time now in other forums to refer to this individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's the problem with somebody taking on copy-editing grunt work?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing at all. Gnoming to genuinely improve Wiki is a noble cause. However, the individual in question rarely alters grammar, and almost never edits to enhance the content itself. He's known for an obsessive barrage of picayune and <a href="StupidLittleEdits.html">StupidLittleEdits</a> to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Punctuation -- e.g., adding periods to URLs at the end of sentences, or converting one em-dash surrogate to another;
        </li>
        <li>
           Spelling -- e.g., "useable" to "usable", both of which are correct;
        </li>
        <li>
           Whitespace -- alterations to Wiki page source which have little or no effect on the rendered page. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then he injects these into active discussions or clutters <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> with them, which obscures genuine contributions and obstructs the flow of discourse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Refuses to compromise when repeatedly asked to tone down his efforts;
        </li>
        <li>
           Frequently sustains <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s over his efforts;
        </li>
        <li>
           Employs <a href="UnethicalEditing.html">UnethicalEditing</a> including spoofing <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>s; 
        </li>
        <li>
           Uses <a href="DoubleEdit.html">DoubleEdit</a>s to enforce his position;
        </li>
        <li>
           Deletes pages -- probably in childish tantrum-like frustration -- when unable to sustain his edits, thus temporarily disadvantaging <a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a>s until the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> or a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> restores the deleted pages;
        </li>
        <li>
           Uses open Web proxies to disguise his efforts;
        </li>
        <li>
           Has been known to badger other contributors to the point that they've left Wiki; and
        </li>
        <li>
           Alters other contributors' signed edits to distort their meaning.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        His uncooperative anti-community attitude clearly outweighs the questionable value of his efforts. As a result, he has been <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>ned by the <a href="WardsWikiStewards.html">WardsWikiStewards</a>. See <a href="ZeroTolerance.html">ZeroTolerance</a> and <a href="AnonIsStillBanned.html">AnonIsStillBanned</a> for further details.

        The <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> was created to revert the edits of <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> and other <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>ned individuals.

        Sadly, calling him the "Grammar Vandal" ignores the most objectionable aspects of his editing, such as warping other people's words, spoofing UserNames, using <a href="DoubleEdit.html">DoubleEdit</a>s, and harrassing/stalking/badgering other users. Calling him a "Grammar Vandal" is like calling Al Capone a tax evader.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It has the word "vandal" in it, which is good enough. Nicknames are rarely thorough.</em>
      </p>

        I wonder, what would it require to hunt him down and sue his ass off?

        <em>Most of the </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> seem to be from <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, Doesn't this defeat the whole purpose ? Perhaps edits from the bot need to filtered from this page to highlight actual contributions.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a one-to-one correspondence between edits by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> and reversions by the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>. [<em>Not true, as admitted below.</em>] However, reversions may be delayed by an arbitrary amount, which at times will cause <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> to dominate <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Unfortunately, there is no means of hiding <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> edits from <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, but when <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> goes away the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> activity will cease. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        <em>No, it won't, since it also reverts spam and most minor changes by others.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure reversion of spam would be considered a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> by almost everyone, except perhaps the spammer. However, many of those are simply manual reversions of spam done by me via the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, because the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> user interface gives me a set of effective tools for doing rapid manual reversions. I have, however, tried automatic spam reversions on <a href="AdderallDrug.html">AdderallDrug</a> and on a few other one-off circumstances. As for reverting "most minor changes by others", that is untrue. Occasionally it reverts a non-<a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> edit (approximately 1 in over 1000 edits), but almost every reversion is of one of your edits, <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. You know it as well as I do, so don't lie. -- DV
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Volume is irrelevant, as you've inhibited such minor edits, i.e., normal gnoming.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, I haven't. Plenty of normal gnoming goes on all the time. Note recent changes to <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a>, <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a>, <a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>s, and so on. It is only <em>your</em> abnormal "gnoming" that is restricted. If you wish to see completely unrestricted gnoming resume here, I suggest you leave. I'm sure Wikipedia would appreciate your efforts. We don't. Please go away. -- DV
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Simply untrue - as </em><a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> shows. Your examples don't correct spelling, and the occasional failures you admit to prove that your software won't accept certain edits, such as this one, regardless of who does them.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, my software won't accept certain edits, such as that one (until I allowed it), because <em>you're</em> doing them, <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. Spelling fixes are fine, as long as it isn't you making them. When you go away, all edits will be accepted. Go fix Wikipedia. Leave us alone. -- DV

      <p>
        I suggest rather than let the situation continue as it is (it's destroying the wiki), we should see if a fund can be set up to hire a detective(s) to hunt him down and prosecute him for zombying (hijacking) PCs. If this is not feasible, then we simply let him make changes and live with them. If he changes the meaning of something, then volunteer Wikizens can either fix it or make a note, perhaps with some kind of marker tag, like MeaningChangeRiskFlag.

        I have tried to bring this up before, but somehow it never gets taken seriously. This <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> person, is mentally ill. His/her only pleasure in life is to torture and harass, in a very immature and childish way. I'm sorry to say, but in this day and age when the mentally ill are not locked-up, and even worse, they have access to computers, sites like this one have to change and add some good security. There is no way to reason with the mentally ill, or to get them to understand commonsense things. Their minds are like a computer that has shorted circuits, and there just isn't anyway that it is going to work correctly. Time for some security like has been mentioned many times. This individual is either so bad off that medication will not help, or they are off their meds. The person is a nut case for sure.
      </p>

        <em>I try to mentally place such people in the same category as "bad weather" so that I don't personalize the situation and get overly angry. Bad weather is something you just have to find ways to work with or around; there is no sense in "punishing" the sky. GV is indeed an annoying phenomena and hopefully this is a place that we can vent. GV is an interesting case study for computer security in general. On a larger scale it echo's the problem of martyr-centric terrorism: "my way or no way" absolutism. Comparing technology-oriented versus social-oriented (or combo) solutions is also a good brain stretcher.</em>

        GV/VK your little tantrum has not changed my conviction as to it being you. Just quit, and everyone will forget about it. Your tantrums only make it worse for you, and worse for all wiki users. So, your obsession with perfection goes nowhere, and in the end the outcome is the opposite of perfection. Wiki is a collaborative tool, with a large pool of users, so it is natural that wiki should be a compromise of perfection, not perfection. Perfection just can't be accomplished here, and it was never intended to be. Simple, you must not forget, is a form of perfection. Controlling your OCD (obsessive compulsive disorder), now that would be a step toward a useful form of perfection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's *not* "perfection", and that's part of the problem. Roughly 5% of GV's edits change the meaning (probably inadvertently), and thus damage results. It may be grammatically "better", but not content-wise. GV's moral calculation flaw is that he over-weighs the benefits of correct grammar/spelling over accurate content (content that accurately reflects the author's opinion). It's making 100 cars prettier, but 5 out of that 100 can no longer make left turns. He mentally down-plays the problem of those 5 in his personal moral calculator. Plus, it angers most authors.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [It's not perfection even if you just consider the grammar. Quite a few of the changes are made to perfectly good grammar. Adding commas in places where they are optional, changing spellings from one regional variant to another, and changing one surrogate punctuation symbol to another surrogate punctuation symbol do not qualify as grammatically better. The last example stands out especially since the one area where grammar could have been improved -- removing the spaces between the surrogate dash and the rest of the sentence -- isn't being done.]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Why don't you accentuate that 5% by identifying it or correcting at least some spellings or grammar yourself instead of just name-calling?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I didn't call anybody names. I did criticize GV's "moral weighting system" for this issue. If that is "name calling" for whatever classification system, I guess I'm guilty then. Attempts to understand GV's justification have failed so far. GV does not open up.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Also, I cannot know for sure the author's original intention even if I wanted to get involved. That's why I usually leave peoples' words as-is. If it's a big flaw, I'll leave a note and let the author fix it him/herself.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That neither identifies any of the 5% nor helps a dyslexic author.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Neither does GV's approach. Once I made a typo. It was roughly something like, "that is not elevant enough". They marked it such: "that is not elevant [relevant?] enough". They got it wrong; it was supposed to be "elevated". But I commend them for merely pointing out a problem along with a guessed suggestion. That's the </em>'proper way<em>' to address iffy text in my opinion. It leaves the original intact, yet points out a problem. It's the best compromise and one a Vulcan would select over GV's I'm sure.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, that was marked as such by the person later referred to as GV.

        GV (grammar vandal) is a seriously mentally-ill person who keeps crying out for help in this Wiki, but does not realize that through Wiki we have no way of prescribing and distributing the appropriate medication and therapy.

        <em>The above is unnecessary name-calling in my opinion. Let's just state that GV is a major pain to this wiki, but stop at the point of general personal trait speculation. It's a bad habit.

           Well, you lost me there, as I have been watching the behavior of this person for a very long time, and I see nothing that is even remotely worth defending. Also, unless pressure of all types is put upon this ill-acting person, there is no way for the individual to realize just how enormously abnormal their behavior. No, I stand my ground as I always have, having worked extensively with the mentally ill, this person is very much mentally-ill and needs help. Also, it's not name calling, it's the truth. There is no way to defend changing peoples meanings, assuming other's identity for reasons of malice, and moronically fighting against an automatic script. I have worked with people who demonstrate similar behavior, and it is easily controlled with medication and psychiatric care. It's not funny, or something that should be tolerated, but something that needs to be helped before the person becomes even more ill. With proper medication and care, the illness can be overcome, or at least its progression significantly slowed down.

           Get a grip, GV is someone in desperate need of professional mental help, period. Ignorance of mental conditions is not reason for the defense of, or the enabling of, the mentally ill.

You've probably confused <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> with <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> because I've been running the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> from a different host as of mid-December 2009.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        Perhaps. It's hard to know what is doing what these days without careful IP analysis. It's a war zone. -t

        GV, why not just mark the problems, and let the author decide whether they want to apply the suggested fix? To me this is a <strong>reasonable compromise</strong>. We can make a special topic tag to mark such problems and put the suggested fix next to the tag. If the author doesn't want to fix it or doesn't see it, then the tags stay, or perhaps have a <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> vote after X months.

        As of late May 2013, <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> appears to have become obsessed with retaining a former page entitled NovusOrdoSeclorum, the main content of which was deleted by its original author after discussion, and its other contributors either copied their content elsewhere or wish it deleted as it's no longer relevant.  Shortly thereafter, <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> restored it and has demonstrated sufficient desperation to preserve it that he (or she) has sustained <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a> over multiple page copies, and inserted its content into <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>.  One can only speculate on the pathology that makes <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> insist on attempting to retain it.  If he (or she) really wishes to retain it, he (or she) should copy it to his or her personal hard drive or -- if it must be public -- perhaps publish it on his (or her) 'blog.
