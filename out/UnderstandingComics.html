        Understanding Comics
      </h1>
      <p>
        This book is a rather <em>deep</em> look into the nature of comics: how they are created and how we read them. It covers the history of visual communication quite well.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are interested in comics, communication, or visual design, I <strong>highly</strong> recommend the book.
      </p>
      <p>
        The most ingenious feature: The book is written in comic book form so it constantly demonstrates what it is trying to teach. -- <a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a>

        Recommendation seconded. An entertaining and <em>very</em> insightful coverage of comics as visual communication, with easily-drawn parallels to user interface design. -- <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        And another recommendation. When I was once tasked to head up a Human-Computer Interface effort (and really didn't know beans about it) I learned more about human cognition from this book than any HCI text around. -- <a href="DonOlson.html">DonOlson</a>

        Ditto. (Amazon claims people who buy <a href="UnderstandingComics.html">UnderstandingComics</a> also buy <a href="EdwardTufte.html">EdwardTufte</a>'s books on how to display information. I believe it!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Having read this book, I think comics could actually be a good medium for capturing <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a>. (If you think computer-generated comics would be not only ugly but useless, check out MicrosoftChat, a.k.a. "ComicChat."[1])

        Perhaps not surprisingly, comics were one of the inspirations for the user interface and deeper structure of the <a href="PlayGround.html">PlayGround</a> language for children.

        Funny to run across this here. I saw my 13-year-old nephew reading this and peeked over his shoulder. I only saw a fragment of one page (the one about how reducing the complexity of drawing a face to circle and two eyes and a smile increases the number of people it matches). I now use that fragment to illustrate a pitfall of written methodologies. They usually think I am funny for introducing this book into the conversation. So now I'll have to track down the whole book so I can read the rest of it.

        Here's an amen from me too - this really is an excellent book. I was struck by the part Alistair mentions, and also the part about the plasticity of time and use of the white bits between frames. --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        It is a book worth owning and reading many times. The author deserves the money for what he has done here. Also for his sense of humor.

        Yet another recommendation. See <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/objects/originals/orig-uc/uc-qwk.html">http://www.scottmccloud.com/objects/originals/orig-uc/uc-qwk.html</a> for some sample pages from the book. The fragment Alistair mentions is part of a map of visual iconography - see <a href="http://www.scottmccloud.com/inventions/triangle/triangle.html">http://www.scottmccloud.com/inventions/triangle/triangle.html</a> for a short explanation.

        AndyHertzfeld recommends it, which is how I discovered it, and I strongly agree with the above comments. This is a very unusual, insightful, one-of-a-kind book about visual communication, even though it is nominally only about comics, and should be considered a must-read for anyone with a strong interest in any related topic, including user interface. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        AndyHertzfeld said: "Profoundly wise and full of humor, I also found it to be one of the most insightful books about designing graphic user interfaces ever written, even though it never discusses the subject directly. Many of the story-telling techniques discussed are straight-forwardly applicable to graphic user interface design, which after all mixes text and graphics in a similar fashion. It includes the best description of why icons work that I have ever encountered."
