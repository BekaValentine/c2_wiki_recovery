        Analysis Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        This model is part of the Objectory method created by <a href="IvarJacobson.html">IvarJacobson</a>. It is basically what the system would look like if it were a fluffy cloud constructed entirely out of idealised objects. It ignores
        non-functional constraints like language, distribution and persistence. Those are captured in the DesignModel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="AnalysisModel.html">AnalysisModel</a> really comes into its own in large scale, distributed systems. Understanding 
        how such things work is a daunting task if you have to get your head around all the design
        artefacts that have been put in to cope with things like resilience and scalability. 
        The <a href="AnalysisModel.html">AnalysisModel</a> presents a simplified view that all developers can understand.
        This is important if the integrity of the system is to be maintained; without it,
        it is too easy for developers to tinker about in the design and break functionality.
