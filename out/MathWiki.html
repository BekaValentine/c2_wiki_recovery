        Math Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        The content of this page is outdated and should be refactored. While <a href="http://www.mathcircle.org/cgi-bin/mathwiki.pl">http://www.mathcircle.org/cgi-bin/mathwiki.pl</a> was the first wiki that rendered TeX parts of a wiki page, this hadn't much impact, because this wiki was never opened to the public and the source was not published.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the meantime, it showed that it is rather simple to implement TeX support. A number of wiki clones offer this as a plugin. It's little more than calling TeX to generate a DVI file, convert this to an nice image format and glue this into the wiki. Anyone should be able to do this in less than 50 LOC. You won't be able to use it on a typical webspace, because of the size of the TeX package (>60MB) and the performance you draw from the CPU to render the images. But if you own the server you have no problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki engines supporting TeX:
      </p>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My own aspirations to implement formulas in Java were in vain. Java support in browsers didn't improve (Mozilla has problems with multiple identical applets) and it showed very soon that math people just expect TeX.

           Is there enough energy in this community to do so? <em>Yes.

           Ward's Wiki is not a repository of code with collaborative working on it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Should maths wiki be a repository of proofs with collaborative working on them? <em>No, I don't think so.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As things stand, we'd maybe help reduce namespace pollution in this Wiki, by extracting a maths wiki and using interwiki. That in itself is not enough to justify a move. So do we just stay with what we've got?

        <em>Mu. This page's creator was researching making a </em>private<em> </em><a href="MathWiki.html">MathWiki</a>.<em></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        Everything below this line should be about Mathematical Notation in a wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        I made a mockup of a <a href="MathWiki.html">MathWiki</a> once. Basically, I ended up concluding that the best approach was
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           rewrite wiki so that the parser generates latex instead of html
        </li>
        <li>
           when a page is edited, call pdflatex and cache the pdf file
        </li>
        <li>
           when someone views a page, you give them the cached file (you don't want to be generating on every view, just every edit)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The result is a PDFWiki, and actually really pretty; pdflatex is also MUCH faster than latex2html. One reason I chose this approach is that I wanted people to be able to include large quotes from existing math papers within a discussion. If you do it this way, it's pretty easy, whereas if you try to splice latex into an existing wiki markup, well... good luck. The only trouble you have speedwise is the initial startup of reader on the client side. I would have to say that on Windows this is completely successful. On Linux, you have a few issues:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Not everyone has their reader configured to work with Netscape properly. If you don't have it configured at all then you just get a request to download a file. If you have it configured wrong (I don't remember what wrong was, but their was a wrong way), it will open up a new reader window for every link. This is a massive pain. Now normally Linux on the client side isn't an issue. If you are using Linux, you should know how it works, and figure it out. However, in this instance this maxim doesn't hold. Your audience is mathematicians, many of whom are on university Unix systems and don't really know/care to configure it right. So it's an issue. However, it can be handled at the system admin level.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now I suppose you would like to see it:) However, and don't laugh - this is true, I wrote over one of the files accidentally and I have never rewritten it. But it's pretty trivial to implement the above procedure, and I'm pretty sure - at least I thought for a long time - that the above is the best way to go. -- Joe Coffey

        <em>Take two dodgy programs into the shower? Expect lots of unexplained crashes.</em>
        Reader on Linux is dodgy, but what's the second? <em>Netscape.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="TwikiClone.html">TwikiClone</a> has a plugin that allows <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> markup. On edit, it's converted to GIF and cached. This avoids the browser/Acrobat reader configuration problem.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The original reason I tried the PDF version was that I wanted to allow discussion/ editing of extended selections from math papers. Latex2html is much slower than pdflatex, and not as pretty. However, for the general wiki, it's probably fine. 
      </p>

        <strong>From Wish List: </strong><a href="WikiEnginesWanted.html">WikiEnginesWanted</a>, <a href="WikiForumsWanted.html">WikiForumsWanted</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are looking for a <a href="MathWiki.html">MathWiki</a>. We could use regular wiki authoring for the prose, but then we could transclude a math expression language:
      </p>
      <p>
        !RowBox[{"(", RowBox[{"x", "+", " ",  RowBox[{"\[Mu]", " ", "a"}]}], ")"}], "2"], " ", "+", " ",  SuperscriptBox["y", "2"]}]
      </p>
      <p>
        That would fetch to a math server (such as Mathematica or <a href="SciLab.html">SciLab</a>), and this would then pump out a GIF file that the wiki would include as an IMG tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two subsets we need to address:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Converting math like "x / (y ^ 5)" to a typeset formula like a blackboard (with that / turned into a long horizontal ------ line).
        </li>
        <li>
           Plotting a math formula and rendering the manifold it covers as a pretty picture.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In actual practice, a wiki with a GIF upload system, and with good GIF tools on all the mathematicians' desktops, beats a fully collaborative online system for in-house research.
      </p>
      <p>
        The options:
      </p>
      <ul>

        </li>
        <li>
           CernRoot - this has a GIF output mode, so I don't think a CGI wrapper for it is such a stretch either.
        </li>
        <li>
           Mathematica - poor server mode; requires MathLink and a lot of sweat before its UI will just shut up. They have recently sprung something with the promising name "webMathematica", but this <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> has not tried it yet.

        You could try Rebol/Command, available from: <a href="http://www.rebol.com.">http://www.rebol.com.</a> Your math expression language:
      </p>
      <p>
        !RowBox[{"(", RowBox[{"x", "+", " ",  RowBox[{"\[Mu]", " ", "a"}]}], ")"}], "2"], " ", "+", " ",  SuperscriptBox["y", "2"]}]

      <p>
        could be implemented as a Rebol dialect, interpreted and a .gif written back to the caller. This could all be implemented in a CGI. If necessary, Rebol/Command could call a specialized math program to provide further processing.

        <em>I use it and like it, and I'd say it's especially popular in the academic and other research communities. I'm not aware of anything else that comes closer to producing professionally-formatted mathematics. But I don't know if there are any viewers that don't just run </em>TeX and then preview the results. The algorithms behind TeX's mathematical formatting are discussed in detail in 'The TeXbook', by Donald Knuth, and of course, you can get the source code. But it gets somewhat complicated; I'd suggest reading chapters 16-19 of 'The TeXbook' just to see some of the sorts of examples people want to produce.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A wiki/Java/formula-module will never be able to produce the same typesetting quality as Knuth in his environment (where he controls every single bit) and I wouldn't try to. In the spirit of wiki, it should be enough if normal school and university mathematics is possible in medium quality. An intuitive syntax seems more important to me than complete coverage because teachers and students should be able to use it. I installed and tested a PC-Version of TeX/LateX about 10 years ago, bought a few books about it and looked at the source. I have no real experience. IIRC, it seemed so specialized and optimized to high quality and a low-ram situation that taking out a part of it, translating it to Java and refactoring would seem to be much work and little fun. But maybe I'm wrong.

        Merging the two systems could give something like this (includes final markup):

      <code>
        [[Java][Code=Formula][width=400][height=60]<br/>
        \sqrt_\pi = \lim_n\to\infty { a.n^2 n^2n e^-2n n 2^2n } / <br/>
        { a_2n 2^2n n^2n e^-2n \sqrt_2n \sqrt_n } =<br/>
        A^2 / A\sqrt_2 =  <br/>
        A / \sqrt_2<br/>
        ]<br/>

        <em>Is there enough energy in this community to do so?</em> A Math(s)Wiki could attract its own community. The question is one of resources to implement and to host it.

        Yes! Wikipedia's math section is actually getting pretty big. We need help, though, rewriting our code so that all the bells and whistles desired by mathematicians are included. We're rewriting our software and will install a CVS so that this will be possible. -- <a href="LarrySanger.html">LarrySanger</a>

        Excuse me, but if the TeX syntax is deemed acceptable, why reinvent the wheel?
        Why not simple call TeX? After all, TeX only has to be run when the page is
        edited, not on every access. If plain TeX is used, the runtime is quite acceptable for a simple function such as $x^2+x+4$ - less than 0.1s on my Pentium III 700 MHz.

        Integration means to me:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           write the formulas anywhere you like in any number (typically 10-100 per page)
        </li>
        <li>
           formulas are rendered as normal parts of the HTML/wiki page
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I don't see how to integrate TeX into a wiki.

        Well, you probably would make some special syntax to write the formula. Then, the <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> would call TeX and generate the output in some nice picture format, which would be included with a graphic. You would probably need numbers, but they would be generated by the <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a>, not with TeX. TeX would only be used to typeset the formula. I think that would be one possibility, and I don't see problems which I can't solve now (which is as always, I only see them when I start a project).

        I don't know TeX (well, I played a little with it years ago). So the question is: can TeX be called to produce a rendered formula alone without the surrounding page? -- hl

        Sergey, that it is a very nicely done development. I particularly like the ability to set the size of formula to use. Is this going to become open to public editing or will it stay as a members-only editable wiki? (I notice even the sandbox needs a log in.) -- <a href="JamesCrook.html">JamesCrook</a>

        One might also use tth <a href="http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/">http://hutchinson.belmont.ma.us/tth/</a> to do TeX to HTML conversion on the fly, it does a pretty good job using the symbol font. He also has written a TeX to MathML translator (ttm). This seems to do away with the problem of images not having the right fontsize or not aligning themselves correctly.

        Some of you guys should look at <a href="PlanetMath.html">PlanetMath</a> - <a href="http://planetmath.org.">http://planetmath.org.</a> It's more formal than a wiki, but their wiki-style <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> -> HTML seems quite advanced.

        By the zeroth law of engineering ("If it happens, it must be possible") all the above arguments about how it's impossible to merge wiki with <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> are all wrong. Should I just delete them?
