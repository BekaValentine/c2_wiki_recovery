        Hi, I'm currently working on a project for Intro to Media in Education and Training. I have an associate's degree in Marketing and Graphic Communications, and I'm going back to school for a BS in Information and Communication Technologies. My long-term plan is to continue education in technical writing, and possibly move to Syracuse, NY.
