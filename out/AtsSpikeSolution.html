        As part of <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> estimation, we identified <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>s for every story that we had questions about.  Since we're doing additional work on an existing project, many of our so-called <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>s were actually just code diving or design explorations.  Only a few actually involve creating a working solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        This definition of <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> doesn't seem to be quite the same as the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> definition that it's based on.  But we're finding it to be very useful, as we often don't need to go all the way to code; we just need discuss the various ramifications of an issue or remind ourselves how the application works.
      </p>
      <p>
        For ATS, I'm defining a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> as "any research (not development) activity that reduces risk."  As I said, that may not be the 'pure' definition, but that's the definition that works for us.  But by shortcutting the definition in this way, we may be glossing over problems that will bite us later.

        We listed our <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>s on a card.  Here's some examples:

           Explore security DB arch.
        </li>
