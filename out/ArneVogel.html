        Hi. I'm a 26 year-old software developer from Germany, and wherever I go I'm the CeePlusPlusExpert.
      </p>
      <p>
        That doesn't mean I'm only interested in C++. Languages that I frequently like to use also include <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> (esp. Hugs), <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="BourneAgainShell.html">BourneAgainShell</a> and others. I'm also a JavaProstitute and CeeSharpWhore, which means that I touch these languages for money (ok, they're not <strong>that</strong> bad anyway).
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I am trying to look for support against <a href="SoftwarePatents.html">SoftwarePatents</a> (euphemised as ComputerImplementedInvention) in the European Union, which will hurt the EU economy, threaten small businesses and <a href="OpenSourceSoftware.html">OpenSourceSoftware</a> alike, and only benefit some BigBadCorporations and PatentLawyers. Unfortunately, it seems that the EU is more of a banana republic than a true democracy(tm), so a lot of clueless and/or corrupt politicians support <a href="SoftwarePatents.html">SoftwarePatents</a>.
