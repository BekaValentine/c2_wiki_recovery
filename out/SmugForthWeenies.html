        Smug Forth Weenies

      <p>
        As a recovering <a href="SmugForthWeenie.html">SmugForthWeenie</a>, I think I'm qualified to comment.  A <a href="SmugForthWeenie.html">SmugForthWeenie</a> is someone who:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Points out that FORTH was 20 years ahead of its time when it was invented - 37 years ago.
        </li>
        <li>
           Loves assembly language programming, but doesn't think it's confusing enough.
        </li>
        <li>
           Thinks exception handling should consist of aborting with either no error message at all, or a cryptic, generic error message.
        </li>
        <li>
           Knows on an intuitive level that God created the integers, and everything else is the work of Satan.
        </li>
        <li>
           Doesn't program on a system where FORTH can't become the OS.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But, on the plus side, it has made me a better programmer; if your first indication that something is wrong with your code is your computer starts doing a convincing impersonation of a doorstop, you get to be pretty good at finding bugs.

        Actually, you are not.  Your comments clearly belie that you never <em>were</em> a serious user of <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>.  Allow me to elucidate:

               And Forth continues to be every bit as expressive and productive as ever.  Just recently, I rewrote a critical piece of Python code for our ContinuousBuild system here at work.  I pseudo-coded it in Forth during a single Scrum session.  When I coded it for real in Python, the result was a 24KiB source file, most of that being syntactic <em>noise</em>.  Lots of <strong>def</strong>s, <strong>()</strong>s, <strong>:</strong>s, etc.  Then there's the lack of <a href="HyperStaticGlobalEnvironment.html">HyperStaticGlobalEnvironment</a>, which means I had to rename many symbols, just to prevent bogus naming conflicts -- conflicts trivially resolved by a human reader, but which would utterly decimate a compiler's understanding of the program.

               With all due respect to your and the reader's sensibilities, this statement is is Pure, unsubstantiated <em>bullshit.</em>  If you want confusion in your coding, try working with <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>, particularly when things break and you need to debug.  Try working with <a href="SpringFramework.html">SpringFramework</a>, what with its 52 kilobyte long error dumps that are worthless.  Try getting Maven integrated with Eclipse seamlessly across an entire organization.  <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a> had said that the biggest problem with <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> developers is that they love to play games with the tools -- always writing new development tools, but never actually developing.  I do not agree with this; in my own experience, I've spent over 80% of my work time dealing with Maven, Ant, Eclipse, and Spring-related <em>bullshit</em> issues that have served only to impede my understanding of the project I'm trying to maintain.

               More intentional falsehood.  Error handling is handled in a context-sensitive way.  You confuse the Forth compiler <em>itself</em> with all possible Forth-written applications.  For the record, <em>my</em> Forth compilers are very explicit: upon finding a word which isn't known in the dictionary or as a number, it states this as such, in plain English.  My Forth unit testing package makes explicit when a unit test fails because of a failed expectation versus a stack imbalance bug.  And so on.  As a user of GForth as well, I can also attest to its ability to not only clearly indicate a failure, but it also gives a <em>return stack trace</em>.

               False, and obviously flamebait.

               Technically, this statement doesn't even make <em>sense.</em>  Every computer ever designed by man <em>can</em> support Forth as an operating system.  But, an overwhelming majority use a Forth system hosted under either Windows or Linux.  I code my Forth applications on Linux using GForth.
