        <strong>PopularScience</strong> is the term used to talk about science bundled for presentation to the public. There are many of these given in the UK, see <a href="http://www.simonsingh.com">http://www.simonsingh.com</a> or <a href="http://www.mathsinspiration.com">http://www.mathsinspiration.com</a> for examples. The speakers (including myself) are often subversives - their objective is to instill in an unsuspecting audience an appreciation of the methods and processes in science, but it's disguised under a veneer of street theater style entertainment.
