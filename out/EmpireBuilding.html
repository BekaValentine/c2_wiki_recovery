        This <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> can be found in all big software companies. This is a quite puzzling <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> because the reason to steal individuals from another development team to your department is often based on the kind of thinking you can find in start-ups where a particular individual could make the difference in a team. And, as this pattern is often used inside the same big IT corporation, at the end, it is not so sure that the individual will make the difference, whereas the full process is based on number and "scalability" of teams.
