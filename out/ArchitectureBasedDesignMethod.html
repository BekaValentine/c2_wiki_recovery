        Architecture Based Design Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Architecture-based development is the exploration and maturation of the role of software architecture in the life cycle given an architecture-centric approach to product lines. Areas of investigation include: how to define and represent architecture, requirements gathering/modeling and the connection to architecture, component development and connection to architecture, architecture connection to legacy assets, connection of the architecture to the production plan, and in general test tools and techniques for all the above as it relates to product lines. </em>

        <em>"Architecture-driven projects represent the most mature style of development. These projects are characterized by a focus on creating a framework that satisfies all known hard requirements, and yet is resilient enough to adapt to those requirements that are not yet known or well understood."</em>
