        Marketing Window
      </h1>
      <p>
        A deadline by which a project <em>must</em> be completed by, otherwise the project/product is not viable and might as well not be undertaken in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes legitimate, sometimes used as a negotiating ploy to get designers to reduce their estimates, with the corresponding expectation that they will work additional (unpaid) overtime to meet the reduced estimate.
      </p>

        Examples of legitimate <a href="MarketingWindow.html">MarketingWindow</a>s.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A contractual obligation to deliver by a certain date.
        </li>
        <li>
           A legal requirement with a hard deadline.
        </li>
        <li>
           Need to deliver product to meet a particular selling season (i.e. Christmas)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples of questionable <a href="MarketingWindow.html">MarketingWindow</a>s
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Marketing feels that we need it."  Ask why.
        </li>
        <li>
           "We need revenue from the project this fiscal year to meet our forecast."  That may be true; but that's not the design team's problem.  (At least, it shouldn't be).  <a href="CountingTheChickensBeforeTheyHatch.html">CountingTheChickensBeforeTheyHatch</a> is generally unsound (but all-too-common) management practice.
        </li>
        <li>
           "The competition is coming out with their project on that day".  Usually not a hard deadline.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Remember--a <a href="MarketingWindow.html">MarketingWindow</a>, to be legitimate, is a <em>hard deadline</em>.  A good test of such a deadline is to ask what happens if the project is a day late (or a week, for some suitable short time period), vs. a day/week early.  If the cost of that day is immense, far greater than the benefit of coming in a week early, you may have a hard deadline.  If the cost of the day is simply one day's worth of lost orders and additional labor expense; that isn't a hard deadline.
