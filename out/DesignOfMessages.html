        Design Of Messages
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Question</strong>:  I've got a system that responds to messages.  It represents
        messages by objects, but I've got at least 500 different kinds of messages.
        I don't want to make 500 classes.  What do I do?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Answer</strong>:
        When you want classes to be reusable, but they are instead proliferating,
        they are usually too big.  Decompose them.
      </p>
      <p>
        A message has a set of fields.  Each field holds a value (numeric,
        alphabetic) and has an offset in the original message.  
        So, there will be a Message class and a Field class.  In a statically
        typed language, you might have an IntegerField and a StringField class.
        The Fields are the objects that do the reading and writing to the
        data streams.  The Message also has a read() and write() method, but
        it just iterates over its fields and has them do the work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each message
        has a type, which is also an object.  You can use either the <a href="TypeObject.html">TypeObject</a>
        pattern to have Message Types that describe messages, or you can use the
        Prototype pattern so that a message describes itself, and a message type
        is probably just a number.
        If you use Type Object then you will create a message by asking a
        MessageType to read the input stream, while if you use Prototype then
        you'll have a prototypical message read it and create a clone of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In either case, when you get an input stream to convert into a message,
        you first have to figure out which type of message it is.  This is usually
        done by reading a type field at the start of the stream, and using it as
        an index into an array to get the Type or Prototype.

      <p>
        You can use the <a href="CompositePattern.html">CompositePattern</a> for messages that have sequences of fields, to define common groups of fields, or to define record types.
