        Quantum Wrongness
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Bispala/Coopet law of <a href="QuantumWrongness.html">QuantumWrongness</a> states that: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The more right you think you are, and the more confident you are that the lead architect will agree with you, the more incredibly wrong you are, and the more ridiculous the lead architect will find your design.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And because Bispala and Coopet were so sure that <em>they</em> were right in so far as to call this a <em>law</em>, they by extension are very, very wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ironic isn't it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any reference for this <em>law</em>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is the first publication of the law, first posited and named in 2001</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which brings to mind <a href="ThereAreNoLawsOfProgramming.html">ThereAreNoLawsOfProgramming</a>, for some reason...
