        For the things we have to learn before we can do them, we learn by doing them.

        Gee, at my kids' high school they've discarded all that "doing" stuff and now "learn" things by <em>opining</em> about them.

        Actual test question from the new History Test (no, really, you can't make this stuff up):

      <ul>
        <li>
           Who benefited from the Revolutionary War?
          <ul>
            <li>
               a) The upper classes
            </li>
            <li>
               b) The lower classes
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        The Computer Science/Cisco Networking teacher left the school after being told to dramatically reduce the hands-on methods used in his classes.

        Anybody know where one can get independent (private) funding for a learning-by-getting-dirty school?  I know a teaching team that would happily start one.
