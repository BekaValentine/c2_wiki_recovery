        And for some context, a quote where the issue comes up in a serious context, by Larry Wall, from his Perl apocalypse 3 (<a href="http://www.perl6.org/archive/doc/design/apo/A03.html):">http://www.perl6.org/archive/doc/design/apo/A03.html):</a>

           "To me, one of the most agonizing aspects of language design is coming up with a useful system of operators. To other language designers, this may seem like a silly thing to agonize over. After all, you can view all operators as mere syntactic sugar - operators are just funny looking function calls. Some languages make a feature of leveling all function calls into one syntax. As a result, the so-called functional languages tend to wear out your parenthesis keys, while OO languages tend to wear out your dot key."

        <li>
           "But while your computer really likes it when everything looks the same, most people don't think like computers. People prefer different things to look different. They also prefer to have shortcuts for common tasks. (Even the mathematicians don't go for complete orthogonality. Many of the shortcuts we typically use for operators were, in fact, invented by mathematicians in the first place.)"

      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, in PHP (I'm not sure about other languages) the foreach() syntax is foreach( $array as $key => $value ) so assuming you have used numbers as the key for $array, $key would be an index. Thus, you could refer to the current value of $array as either $array[ $key ] or as simply $value, inside the statement. Of course, you could use foreach( $array as $a_key => $this_value ) and refer to $array[ $a_key ] or $this_value. -- rd

        <strong>x += 1</strong> and <strong>x = x + 1</strong> have different semantics when <strong>x</strong> is declared volatile - to me this says they are not equivalent, one is not syntactic sugar for the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But they don't differ in expressive power.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps not, but that is a non-sequitur. To be syntactic sugar the expressions must first be identical in semantics. If the semantics of two expressions are different then <em>ipso facto</em> neither can be syntactic sugar for the other. See the discussion on <a href="ExpressivePower.html">ExpressivePower</a> for more.
      </p>
      <p>
        The original claim was that <strong>x += 1</strong> was syntactic sugar for <strong>x = x + 1</strong>. I replied that I do not believe that, because they have different semantics. To me, "syntactic" sugar requires "semantic equivalence", so since they have different semantics, neither is syntactic sugar for the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe your reference to expressive power is a non-sequitur.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- anonX
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think so, because the difference in semantics is relatively trivial; in contexts where it is a completely inessential difference, they can be regarded as equivalent. -- dm
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm writing a compiler and it's very, very far from trivial to me. It breaks some seriously good "optimizer" code, and I've had to develop some difficult code. To me, <strong>x++</strong>, <strong>x += 1</strong>, and <strong>x = x + 1</strong> are very, very different semantically. I cannot see them as syntactic sugar and would argue that they are not. When two expressions lead to different behaviour for the brakes on your car, I believe it to be dangerous to refer to them as syntactic sugar. -- anonX
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating problems for you is not necessarily the same as "very, very different semantically", that sounds like an exaggeration based on frustration. But it's been years since I worked on C++ compilers, so maybe I'm just forgetting; remind me which issues you're talking about. -- dm
      </p>
      <p>
        The compiler I was using failed to compile <strong>volatile</strong> correctly and my code thus failed to apply the brakes in a traction control sub-system. I regard that as non-trivial, and it arose from the semantics. When using <strong>volatile</strong> the results on the machine between using <strong>x += 1</strong> and <strong>x = x + 1</strong> are different, it says so in the ANSI standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's my line of reasoning:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           if two things are different semantically under some circumstances then neither can be syntactic sugar for the other
        </li>
        <li>
           Semantically identical things cannot lead to different behaviour.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>x += 1</strong> and <strong>x = x + 1</strong> have different behaviour when <strong>x</strong> is declared <strong>volatile</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>x += 1</strong> and <strong> x= x + 1</strong> are semantically different when <strong>x</strong> is declared <strong>volatile</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>x += 1</strong> and <strong>x = x + 1</strong> are semantically different under some circumstances
        </li>
        <li>
           Neither <strong>x += 1</strong> nor <strong>x = x + 1</strong> is syntactic sugar for the other.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where does this fail for you? -- anonX
      </p>
      <p>
        I am arguing that two constructs need not be absolutely semantically identical in order for one to be considered syntactic sugar for the other, just as sugar (loosely speaking) makes pastry from bread, but the bread and pastry are certainly not identical - the whole point is to create a difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead I would say that the two constructs need only be similar enough to be substitutable under <strong>some</strong> circumstances, not <strong>all</strong> circumstances. And maybe the relationship could be even looser than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PeterLandin.html">PeterLandin</a>'s original definition as filtered through ESR in the jargon file is not very precise; perhaps the real question is, which precise definition would be most useful? 
      </p>
      <p>
        -- dm
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah, so you go by the definition filtered through ESR which uses the term expressiveness, rather than the term itself which is "Syntactic Sugar". I read the term itself as implying that the semantics must remain untouched.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe this confusion is dangerous.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some people believe that <strong>x += 1</strong> and <strong>x = x + 1</strong> are semantically identical - they are not.
        </li>
        <li>
           Some people believe that <strong>for(i = 0; i < 3; i++) {stuff;}</strong> is semantically identical to <strong>i = 0; while(i < 3) {stuff; i++;}</strong> - it's not.
          <ul>
            <li>
               As mentioned below, if a continue statement exists in the loop body, the two have different behavior (the i++ is executed in case of the for loop; not in case of the while loop).
            </li>
            <li>
               However, for(; i < 3;) {stuff} and while (i < 3) {stuff} <em>are</em> equivalent.  I think.  I can't think of any case in which those two differ.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>But is it equivilent to</em> <strong>{ i = 0; while (i < 3) {stuff; i++;} }</strong> ?    ;->
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In each case I've found bugs, in some cases some potentially very serious bugs, due to these confusions, and while to some extent it can be ascribed to poor programmer training, I believe at least in part it's due to the on-going inappropriate use of the term Syntactic Sugar.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think the point is though, that these statements are logically congruent, Regardless of the fact that these sometimes generate different behavior. The implementation details of the compiler or language are completely separate from the fact that both terms represent "add 1 to the value of the variable x". The same can be said about any question of Syntactic Sugar - Are they different actions if you describe them in plain English? The answer in many cases is "not really". There are many ways of doing the same thing (referring to low-level processing), and no way is more correct than another.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some things are not semantically identical, and I think that needs more emphasis. Especially for things like pointers and arrays in C.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, as you ask, what <strong>is</strong> the correct definition of <strong>SyntacticSugar</strong>?
      </p>
      <p>
        -- anonX (now getting off his hobby horse. Suggestions as to why the <strong>for</strong> and <strong>while</strong> loops are not identical are welcome.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Suppose </em>'stuff;<strong> contains </strong>continue;<em>'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I certainly agree that these kinds of confusion can be quite dangerous, but I'm not at all sure that it is the duty of the term <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a> to prevent them. :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll continue thinking about the most useful definition. I'm adding a real life example at top of page, a quote from Larry Wall, which I think helps with context, without itself offering such a definition. -- dm

So in order to be able to do the appropriate thing, you need to either have a) an unbelievably smart compiler (especially for the time of C's design), or b) a way to tell the compiler what you want. Thus C needed an increment operator, and increment by some integer operator, and an assignment operator. What you see is not syntactic sugar, but the necessity of design.</em>

           Yeah, argued by people who think that wild guessing constitutes a good argument. To the contrary, <a href="DennisRitchie.html">DennisRitchie</a> says "People often guess that they were created to use the auto-increment and auto-decrement address modes provided by the DEC PDP-11 on which C and Unix first became popular.

        The first example above concerns me. As was said, incrementing and assigning are inherently different operations. As I mentioned on <a href="CsharpVsJava.html">CsharpVsJava</a>, the idea of switching on a string, more syntactic sugar, disturbs me for the same reason. In exchange for saving a few keystrokes and, perhaps, more readibility, I am giving up my intuitive concept of how something <em>works</em>. Incrementing <em>doesn't</em> (always) work by assignment. Switching on a string <em>doesn't</em> use a jump table. While the net outcome may be the same, the efficiency of the techniques are very different; the sugar may save me a stroke when typing, but it misleads me, especially if I'm less than 100% familiar with the language, when reading. -- <a href="AdamBerger.html">AdamBerger</a>

        The first example, "X = X + 1" can be expressed as "X += 1" or "X++" or "++X".
        The best way to express it depends on the thought you wish to express:
        If I wanted to "increment X", then I'd use "++X".
        <em>(Others could reasonably use "X++", but I don't like that style.)</em>
        If I wanted to "add one to X", then "X += 1" expresses the thought quite well.
        Even COBOL has special syntax that supports "ADD THIS-AMOUNT TO TOTAL."
        As for "X = X + 1", I have a hard time coming up with a clear English explanation as to what that's supposed to mean.

        Personally, my programming language preferences are similar to my preferences in meals. I like both to be tasteful, nourishing, and healthy. To me, that means a suitable dose of semantic carbohydrates to provide energy, some syntactic sugar to sweeten it a bit, a well-assorted library of proteins and fats, and a pleasant logical texture and composition. Salt and pepper to taste. Of course these ingredients can be mixed in all sorts of ways, and the result of course depends on the cook who prepares the meal. A language designed by a committee of course verifies the old saying about "too many cooks", and some swear to sugar-free diet languages, whereas others find they just don't taste right. Some languages combine very few ingredients in an astonishingly tasteful manner, whereas others seem to be made by taking what was available in the kitchen at the time and cooking it together into a strange stew. <a href="LanguageAsFoodMetaphor.html">LanguageAsFoodMetaphor</a>, anyone?

        <em>Or <bigwig></em>

      <p>
        Or in Java, JSE: <a href="http://jse.sourceforge.net/.">http://jse.sourceforge.net/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Am I the only person simultaneously terrified and slightly grossed out by the syntax of that JSE link? Holy moly, that's a maintenance nightmare waiting to happen. The reason Lisp gets away with macros is because of its minimal syntax. Java will probably be hurt more than it is helped if such a tool became part of common practice.</em>

        <em>All</em> programming languages are syntactic sugar for widely used patterns in previous generation languages. The structure of binary instructions became sugared as assembly mnemonics. Conventions for branching and iteration in assembly became flow control statements in third generation languages. Conventions for defining and calling subroutines in assembly became sugared as procedures in 3GLs. Conventions for organizing data in assembler became sugared as named variables, the stack of locals, the global segment, the dynamically allocated heap, arrays and structures. Conventions for implementing runtime polymorphism in C became virtual functions in C++. Hopefully, the industry will one day realize what LISP programmers have known all along, that programming is about creating <em>languages</em> in which we can express the solutions to problems, and we will start using languages that let us define our own syntactic sugar.

        <em>A'fuckin'men, the most logical statement on the page and the sad truth of the current state of the industry, why are so many of us shackled to languages we can't extend.</em>
      </p>

        No. Ridiculous. Compiled languages are as far from syntactic sugar as a Cat backhoe is from a garden shovel. Use the tool appropriate for the job. Don't poke at a tool just because it doesn't fit <em>your</em> need.

        Some languages, such as <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>, define a base language; and then define a syntactic sugar on top of the base language. One of the first things a Haskell compiler does is <em>desugaring</em> - transforming the syntactic sugar into equivalent base code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Macros in LISP and Scheme do the same thing: transform syntactic sugar into primitive code at 'read time'.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NemerleLanguage.html">NemerleLanguage</a> is similar - all the iteration constructs (c-style for loops, foreach, while, do...while, etc), for example, are defined as macros that transform the iteration into tail-recursive functions (and the conditionals are just macros layered over the pattern-matching syntax). And of course, you can write your own macros that can be used just as transparently as the ones from the standard library.
