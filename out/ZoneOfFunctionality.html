      <ul>
        <li>
           zones of functionality not walled off (as separate applications), but resulting from certain operations and views taken together 
        </li>
        <li>
           activities you might want to do by themselves, ignoring the rest of the system 
        </li>
        <li>
           activities that are easier to explain by themselves, even though they are deeply woven into the system.

      <p>
        An idea I have been toying around with is to mount a filesystem which interprets files and provides structure so that content is viewed as if it resided in sub folders
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest case of displaying archives (ZIPs) as their content is often already simulated by file browsers
      </p>
      <p>
        ---<strong>But my idea is to also</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           expand documents into folders for chapters, pages, paragraphs 
        </li>
        <li>
           possibly providing sym-links for cross refs
        </li>
        <li>
           a folder containing all embedded images
        </li>
        <li>
           provide sub folders for old versions (or use git for this)
          <ul>
            <li>
               I seem to remember that there is at least one CMS which does something like this.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           expand spreadsheets into sheets (and rows and colums)
        </li>
        <li>
           expand code artifacts into folders for classes and methods
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This way you can use your normal tools (file explorers, CLI, backup, RCS) on this structure.
        This would avoid reimplementing in each application
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           versioning
        </li>
        <li>
           navigation
        </li>
        <li>
           merging
        </li>
        <li>
           backup
        </li>
        <li>
           copy/paste, structured modification
        </li>
      </ul>

        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           most File Explorers
          <ul>
            <li>
               right click opens a context menu with options relevant to the current file (usually choosing one application)
            </li>
            <li>
               Windows (c) displays folders in a way suitable to their main content
              <ul>
                <li>
                   music folders get columns with play time, artist
                </li>
                <li>
                   video folders show preview
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

        <li>
           modern IDEs
          <ul>
            <li>
               the tree view for the "files" often goes deep into the structure of the coding artifacts
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PaperPort.html">PaperPort</a> is an application which allows the viewing (and modification) of a file found in one of the <a href="PaperPort.html">PaperPort</a> Folders.
          <ul>
            <li>
               If the file is a .jpg, it will be viewed by the default image viewer or application
            </li>
            <li>
               If the file is a .pdf, it will be viewed using the Pdf Viewer
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           There are other applications which perform in a similar manner
          <ul>
            <li>
               such as Artifactories
            </li>
