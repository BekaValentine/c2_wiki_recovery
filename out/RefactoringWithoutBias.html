        Refactoring Without Bias

        <a href="DeletionInWiki.html">DeletionInWiki</a> scares me. <a href="WikiRefactoring.html">WikiRefactoring</a> is starting to, also. If I've signed my work, I don't want anyone touching it (except to maybe fix spelling). Since Wiki is a writer's forum, as well as a reader's, I craft what I say (usually) with a fair amount of care... so don't go changing it, you! I said it with my own bias in my own style, not with yours thank you very much. Can anyone truly say that they can refactor a page and not put their own spin on it?

      <p>
        <a href="WikiRefactoring.html">WikiRefactoring</a> should be as minimal a process as possible. Fix spelling.  Rearrange <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> into <a href="ThereforeBut.html">ThereforeBut</a> or <a href="ThesisAntithesisSynthesis.html">ThesisAntithesisSynthesis</a>. Add cross-references. Break large pages into several smaller ones. Take flame wars OffLine, and post a summary on a new page. Just my suggestions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also don't keep track of what I write - I trust(ed) that it wouldn't be changed. See, it's a matter of trust. I want to trust that what I write will be unmolested. And I want to trust that what I read will be an accurate account of what happened, and will reflect the true intent and tone of the original author.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used to have blind trust in Wiki... but that's becoming harder to maintain.
        The reasons that I'm worried is the recent proliferation of pages discussing refactoring Wiki pages. Several of them mention deleting content, and being bold and free about changing page content (<a href="RefactorFasterDeleteMore.html">RefactorFasterDeleteMore</a>). This just makes me nervous. -- <a href="DavidHooker.html">DavidHooker</a>

        I don't keep track of what I write - I <em>trust</em> that it wouldn't be changed. I want to trust that what I write will be unmolested. And I want to trust that what I read will be an accurate account of what happened, and will reflect the true intent and tone of the original author. -- <a href="DavidHooker.html">DavidHooker</a>, paraphrased

        <strong>Final statement.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Signed work should be carefully and minimally edited. People write with their own bias and style. Editing can change this, violating the readers' trust that the account on Wiki is accurate, and the writers' trust that their reputations will remain unsoiled.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong> limit editing of signed work to fixing spelling, reorganizing a page, or adding cross-references. If you make a significant edit, you may want to mark the quotation as paraphrased, or make it anonymous altogether. Trust in <a href="PeerReview.html">PeerReview</a> to save you, but not <em>too</em> much.
