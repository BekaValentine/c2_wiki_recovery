        Stay Extreme

      <p>
        <em>Can this be succinctly summarised?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes: </em>Continue to be extreme.<em> Does that help?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider introducing the phrase into the local argot, to mean the same kinds of things as "see ya later", "have fun" or "maï¿½ana".
      </p>
