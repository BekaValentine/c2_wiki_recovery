        My opinions is that servlets encourage a <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> approach to development. You can't help generating a view (HTML returned to the browser), you are likely working from a back-end model (database, etc.), and it therefore makes sense to view your servlet as a controller--or at least part of it.

        <em>I use </em><a href="JavaServlet.html">JavaServlet</a>s as the MvcController, <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a> or <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a> as the <a href="MvcModel.html">MvcModel</a> and <a href="JavaServerPages.html">JavaServerPages</a> as the MvcView.  This lets me use the servlet to instantiate and populate a couple of beans, add them to the Request as attributes, and use getRequestDispatcher to return a JSP which uses the beans to build its content.<em>--</em><a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>

        <a href="WebMacro.html">WebMacro</a> [<a href="http://www.webmacro.org]">http://www.webmacro.org]</a> is a servlet framework which I wrote, and implements a <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> architecture. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also read my article on servlet design, which discusses this kind of approach in great detail: Fundamentals of Servlet Design [<a href="http://www.webmacro.org/FundamentalsOfServletDesign].">http://www.webmacro.org/FundamentalsOfServletDesign].</a>

        <a href="ServletDesign.html">ServletDesign</a> is a topic that's also occupying a lot of my time.  For anyone who's interested, here are a couple of URL's pointing to material that I've written on this:

        The first explains more about the Servlet API, while the second talks about the issue of preserving servlet state.  I used to think that the second one was a bit dated since the introduction of the 2.0 version of the JSDK, but lately I've started to work with clients where <a href="ServerAffinity.html">ServerAffinity</a> is an issue, and found out that the Hidden-field strategy is still useful.

        I've also got an article on the subject out in the June 1999 issue of the <a href="JavaReport.html">JavaReport</a>, that goes into more detail about the MVC concepts mentioned above.  That's the first article of a multipart series; we're working on more.

        <a href="JavaServerFoundationClasses.html">JavaServerFoundationClasses</a> can be described as a Swing-look-alike API for <a href="WebApplicationDesign.html">WebApplicationDesign</a>.  At JSFC's core is my belief that good <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> practices, including <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> (including <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a>), are applicable to <a href="WebApplicationDesign.html">WebApplicationDesign</a>. I was inspired to start it, in part, by the JavaPro article "Reusable UI Components for HTML" [<a href="http://www.devx.com/upload/free/features/javapro/1999/04apr99/ds0499/ds0499.asp]">http://www.devx.com/upload/free/features/javapro/1999/04apr99/ds0499/ds0499.asp]</a> by Daniel R.

        Very different article styles here. Kyle's article shows me how to actually write a servlet immediately. After reading Justin's, I still haven't seen the code for even one servlet. Justin provides a number of principles, which sound good. Kyle gives little guidance, but gets me on the road immediately.

        I suspect that good <a href="ServletDesign.html">ServletDesign</a> is the same as good <a href="WebApplicationDesign.html">WebApplicationDesign</a>.

        This is odd--I was <a href="FixingLinks.html">FixingLinks</a> on this page, and I found that one of the numbered URLs that appeared in the links page isn't actually referred to in the text of the page.  Anybody know what this was a link to originally?
