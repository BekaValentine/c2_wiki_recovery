        I have spent all of my career writing application code in the semi conductor industry. Progression NCR->ATT->Symbios Logic->Symbios->LSILogic (I never quit in this part of the progression, the company kept on changing under me) 
      </p>
      <p>
        I left LSILogic to work for AMCC. AMCC promptly closed it's local office and I'm back at LSILogic.

        I read the other day on here that someone said he writes code to make money to afford survival so he can write code.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm kind of the opposite. I write code so I can make money so I can do other things.

        I tried to start a software company once. It was bringing in about 2K a month then I made some mistakes and it cratered.
