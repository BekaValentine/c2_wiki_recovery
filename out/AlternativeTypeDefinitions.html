        According to <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, there's a wide variety of "types" or definitions for types in programming language definitions. Of course, we have <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> and programming language theory having a very consistent view on the subject, but nevertheless here they are:

        Of course, the claim that Top has collected these is of no use if he cannot provide some proper context (at least proper citation for the source, the importance and usefulness of the source, etc). Otherwise, we can go on a spree trying to collect what's everybody's opinion of how should we define atom, but that doesn't mean that all the opinions collected warrant a representation on a wiki page. As <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> puts it, wiki does not offer a guarantee to everyone that everybody's 2c will be preserved for eternity like in a mausoleum, regardless of merits and value for wiki.

        What does it mean to respond to "<a href="WhatAreTypes.html">WhatAreTypes</a>?" with "Substitutability"? <strong>It means nothing</strong>. It's purely and simply crap. It's top's in-your-face laziness trying to articulate that in some type systems substitutability is an important aspect related to types and there are different approaches about how type systems should solve substitutability (<a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a> with names and explicit declarations, versus <a href="DuckTyping.html">DuckTyping</a>, etc). But he cannot in all honesty claim that "substitutability" is a definition for types or an explanation about what are types.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I may be providing a </em><a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> whereas <a href="JohnReynolds.html">JohnReynolds</a> may be providing a <a href="UselessTruth.html">UselessTruth</a> (at best). This approach may be more usable for newbies. Further Reynolds' work is not really a definition, but rather a model under which to analyze types. The implication is that something "is a" type if it can be reworked to fit Reynolds' model, but not if it doesn't. For one, this is not how "normal" definitions work. <strong>It's mistaking models for definitions</strong>. Second, it could be that one's lack of creativity is preventing them from fitting (re-mapping) something "into" Reynold's model, not inherent lack of type-ness. We want to determine "type-ness", not human ingenuity. It's a disturbing problem that my detractors do not appear to wish to resolve. Even if you are crazy enough to be satisfied with "it's a type if it can be made to fit Rennie's model", that still makes it a bigass 100+ page definition, which would make normal researchers strive for a shorter variant. Excessively long definitions are a smell. -- top<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And, of course, Top does not realize he doesn't argue for another type definition, but for a <strong>design methodology</strong> that within a given language/ programming environment is able to help the developer to identify the types. Therefore he protests the <strong>OO methodology</strong> of trying to identify a hierarchical taxonomy in the real world that translates into OO "types".
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that this is a valid criticism. But the criticism however cannot be applied against <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> because the theory offers you just the tools, and the tools are valid and adequate when put to good use. The criticism is against the OO method for using the tools. So he barks up the wrong tree.

        <em>The people who set out to make say </em><a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> were not interested in implementing any math-based type theory.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, Smalltalk choose not to use the tools given by <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a>. It's a trade-off that smalltalkers consider worthy to make. As a matter of fact, David N. Smith, a noted authority on Smalltalk, is on record in his Smalltalk FAQ that Smalltalk has classes, but it has no types in the proper meaning of the word. Does any Smalltalker around have a copy of David Smith's Smalltalk FAQ?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But some Smalltalk fans do claim that Smalltalk has "types", just not in the sense used in other languages. I invite them to explain in more detail.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be more accurate to state:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The earliest versions of Smalltalk were developed in the 70's, which is about the same time that <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> came out into its own as a sub-discipline of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Many of the useful results of <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> (how to perform <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> and other static program analyses) are of little applicability to Smalltalk, due to its highly dynamic nature. Attempts to add static typing to Smalltalk (ie <a href="StrongTalk.html">StrongTalk</a>) have met with limited success.
        </li>
        <li>
           Many things that Smalltalk does (true <a href="FirstClassTypes.html">FirstClassTypes</a>, for instance) make <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> (in the general case) undecidable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A consistent typing system can be developed for Smalltalk - actually two. One (a very weak one) is based on classes and inheritance; the other (a very powerful one) is based on <a href="DuckTyping.html">DuckTyping</a>. Of course, Smalltalk implementations don't perform type judgements <em>per se</em>, but <a href="DynamicDispatch.html">DynamicDispatch</a> in Smalltalk performs mini type judgements as needed.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Reliance on <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> is problematic.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not reliance on <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>, it's asking you to provide a context so that we can double-check your claims that you really collected <strong>significant</strong> differing views on <a href="WhatAreTypes.html">WhatAreTypes</a>. Otherwise, we can go into MacArthur Park in Los Angeles and ask every other person what he thinks of types for 2 hours. Collect all the opinions and put them here.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>That might be a useful exercise, for it helps in the goal of seeing if formal definitions match informal definitions, and if not, why. However, I would rather see a summary rather than every response.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Citing research isn't <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>, top. Now, if some professor were to offer up unsupported conjecture on a subject, and we were to quote such, <em>that</em> would be <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>. But referring to scientific results (in other words, the <em>science</em> and not the man) is not AFA.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also, I have not seen any clearly superior definitions that fit within say 2000 words. If a definition takes an entire book, it probably has very limited practical use.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Last I checked, a reasonable and thorough explanation of the </em><a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> requires more than 2000 words (<a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a>'s book is over 1000 <strong>pages</strong>). Can we assume the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> has limited practical use then? The notion that <a href="ScienceShouldBeEasy.html">ScienceShouldBeEasy</a> is a well-known fallacy.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Date's book is mostly about explaining techniques and issues, not defining. Relational can be reduced to a small set of primitive operations similarly (but not quite as small) as to how Boolean Algebra can be defined compactly. -- top
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Really? Can one explain all of the following topics in 2000 words or less, and do so well?
          <ul>
            <li>
               Definition of relations, tuples, attributes, and domains
            </li>
            <li>
               The <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> (select/restrict, project, join, union, intersection, etc.), and the closure properties (based on a small set of fundamental operations/tranformations). Formally equivalent to <a href="RelationalCalculus.html">RelationalCalculus</a> (the two are inter-convertible)
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Not sure this is required for a root definition. (<em>It is. -- Doug</em>)
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>Please clarify "closure properties"</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   This is the minor thing (I don't mean that sarcastically - it's important, but only a small change) that distinguishes relational operators from ordinary set operators. <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> AnIntroductionToDataBaseSystems 7th ed. sec. 3.2 pg 60: "<em>the result of each of the three operations is another table</em> (in other words, the operators are indeed "operators that derive tables from tables," as previously stated). This is the <strong>closure</strong> property of relational systems, and it is very important. Basically, because the output of any operation is the same kind of object as the input - they are all tables - so <em>the output from one operation can become input to another.</em> Thus it is possible, e.g., to take a projection of a join, or a join of two restrictions, or a restriction of a projection, etc., etc. In other words, it is possible to write <em>nested expressions</em> - i.e., expressions in which the operands themselves are represented by general expressions, instead of just by simple table names. This fact in turn has numerous important consequences, as we will see later (both in this chapter and in many subsequent ones)." [italics in original.] -- Doug
                </li>
                <li>
                   He further clarifies in chapter 6 in discussing the <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> operators. P157, under <strong>Union</strong>: "although that result [of a union of two different kinds of tuples] is a set, <em>it is not a relation</em>; relations cannot contain a mixture of different kinds of tuples, they must be "tuple-homogeneous". And of course, we do want the result to be a relation, because we want to preserve the closure property. Therefore, the union in the relational algebra is not the usual mathematical union; rather, it is a special kind of union, in which we require the two input relations to be of the same type -- meaning, for example, that they both contain supplier tuples, or both part tuples, but not a mixture of the two. If the two relations are of the same (relation type), then we can take their union, and the result will also be a relation of the same (relation) type; in other words, the closure property will be preserved. [Footnote]: Historically, most of the database literature (earlier editions of this book included) used the term <strong>union-compatibility</strong> to refer to the notion that the two relations must be of the same type. This term is not ver apt, however, for a variety of reasons, the most obvious of which is that the notion does not apply just to union." [emphasis in original] -- Doug

                   <em>Perhaps this discussion belongs in another topic, such as </em><a href="DoesRelationalRequireTypes.html">DoesRelationalRequireTypes</a> or <a href="TupleDefinition.html">TupleDefinition</a>. I find it odd that a union-generated table should be treated differently than any other table. A created table, virtual or actual, should stand on its own. Pedigree should not be an issue.<em></em>

                <li>
                   You are correct, nor is <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> saying otherwise. You simply misunderstood the quoted text, somehow. The point is just that relational operators accept tuples and produce tuples (that's the closure property), whereas set operators accept sets and produce sets, and that the two are not precisely the same even though they're very similar. When you do a join, typically you want the result to be "flattened" - each row a simple tuple of simple values, whereas the set version would product rows of tuples containing nested tuples. (<a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> does not rule out nested tuples altogether; that's a different topic.)

                   As for which page to move this definition of <strong>relational closure</strong> to, yeah, maybe it's not best here; it's part of the definition of relational databases, so putting it on a very general page might be in order. It's a digression from <strong>this</strong> page's discussion, certainly. -- Doug

                   Certainly, many programming languages predate <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a>. Others have very simple type systems - Smalltalk is one example, with only one "true" type - Object. (This is why some folks refer to dynamically-typed languages as "untyped" - a notion I disagree with). One can retroactively view a collection of message signatures - called a "protocol" or an "interface" in other languages - as a type, and if you did so you'd come up with a consistent type system. Most modern languages, however, are designed by folks with at least a working knowledge of <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> - even if they don't have fancy <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> engines or otherwise use techniques on the bleeding edge of the theory.

           Its applicability to programming

      </ul>
      <p>
        In the case of the first one, <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> is a mathematical discipline subject to axiomatic proof, and as such is beyond reproach from the likes of <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>.

           I have to disagree with that. Something may map better to the human mind(s) than to a mathematically derived system. Newtonian physics is not as sound as Relativity because it is not as accurate, but more useful to the vast majority of humans because we can relate to it better. Even a toddler banging away at toys is learning Newtonian principles. See also <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>.

        <li>
           <em>But only because Newton remains highly accurate at low velocity. If Newton's laws of motion were shown to be grossly inaccurate, they would be useless. Worse than useless, in fact.

            </li>
            <li>
               Then we need a better BS-detector. Making a lot of math around an idea does not grant that idea a monopoly. Better-explored, perhaps, monopoly, no.

            <li>
               <em>Again, you're obscuring the issues. Is </em><a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> an internally-sound branch of mathematics? Definitely. How applicable is it to programming (both language implementation and application development)? That depends. <em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Since we know that some things that may not be provably internally sound are still useful, why exclude such things as they relate to types? We would have to delete 95% of wiki if that is the criteria.

           I suspect its use may be related to the problem domain. It may be more useful for modelling unwavering laws of nature than human-personality-centric domains, such as business. And, I am saying that there may be multiple ways to talk about types, regardless of their usefulness.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Or you can talk about <strong>different concepts</strong> altogether. If you think about another concept with your taxonomies and everything, give it a <strong>different name</strong>. In the context of programming languages, <strong>types</strong> already have a well-defined and widely recognized meaning. 
            </li>
            <li>
               And I am already on record supporting your idea that in some domains <strong>programming language types</strong> are not adequate tools that can map one on one with <strong>classifiers in the problem domain</strong>. Which may be a mistake that some OO programmers make sometimes (but not always) when trying to map every classification from the real world into a corresponding OO class (and consequently into a type). But this criticism of yours has nothing to do with criticizing types as they are understood in <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a>. What's so hard for you to get?

        In the case of the second issue, there is much debate.

      <p>
        In short: ypeTheory is a <em>tool</em>. Whether or not it's a <em>useful</em> tool has little to do with its correctness (assuming it is correct, of course - if <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> itself were a load of codswallop, it probably wouldn't be useful to anybody).
      </p>
      <p>
        My opinion on the matter: ypeTheory is indeed a useful tool in many contexts. In some, it probably should be a <em>required</em> tool, where the increased ability to reason about a program's behavior that type theory affords might make the difference between life and death. If you're doing a <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>, on the other hand, I'm for leaving it up to the programmer(s) and customer(s) to figure out what practices are most likely to produce the desired result in the most cost-effective fashion.

      </p>
      <p>
        In a practical sense, "types" in strongly-typed languages are basically just a little hidden or not-readily-seen flag(s) in each variable (compile-time or run-time) that is used to indicate what operations can be done with that variable. Variables that may be derived from compound or multiple types must use various algorithms to determine the final type and/or which operations are valid. Some languages will require a final single "type", while others use hierarchies and other means to allow a "type path search" to be done on a derived variable to know which operations are valid.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some languages, the operations and their types must be "registered" together ahead of time somehow, while others allow each user of a type to determine how it is going to handle a given type on its own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, more than one flag may be needed. For example, if we declare "foo" as type "int" (integer), then anything of type "foo" is both of type "foo" and of type "int". Type systems are basically the management of the trees and/or graphs that determine what type something is or what operations are allowed on it.

        If it is a cut-and-dried situation, let's see the evidence. I don't deny that there is a lot of math surrounding "type theory", but if it is tied to only syntax, it is possibly flawed.

        Perhaps we should move this somewhere else, but my complaint is not so much about usefulness in this case (that is another story), but about it being tied to syntax. One can have identical "typing" features using non-syntax-based "languages". <strong>Just because one does it in a structure instead of text should not change the nature of "typeness".

           I have an argument to discredit <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a>, so as to add to the argument that it has little to do with programming: it is anchored in a Platonic world that is not relevant to actual Reality where one programs on some form of <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>. These two spaces are completely different, and have evolved two different poles that the whole <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> field hasn't sufficiently <em>separated</em> so that their differences can be appreciated: <em>logic gates</em> vs. <em>logical "calculus" and symbols</em>. There is very little crossover as I can see. Perhaps the problem is the common use of the Greek root <em>logikos</em>. In the former,"logic" pertains to binary arithmetic, where in the latter, it retains its original Greek meaning relating to *speech* and symbols, i.e. <em>logos</em>. <strong>This is why there is no relevance!</strong> Further, one can notice that in the former, the progression has been towards more sophisticated <a href="DataStructures.html">DataStructures</a> (hence the evolution towards <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a>), where in the latter, I'll argue, the progression has been towards function sophistication (where recursion seems to be paramount).

As mentioned on another page; <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> has consistent type semantics, even though the syntax of the language makes little mention of "types". The syntax of Smalltalk does provide several explicit operations which have impact on types. When an object is created, one must send the "new" message to its class; usually the class is explicitly named (though "aClass new" is perfectly legal in Smalltalk - the equivalent is not legal C++ or Java). Inheritance is another (inheritance is always made explicit), and defining a method within a class is another (if a class understands a given message; than it's a subtype of the implicit type of all classes which understand that message). It sounds like the argument reduces to how much type annotations should be provided by the programmer; which is a far cry from suggesting that <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> is an interesting mathematical diversion with no practical use.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The above is not about the practicality of types nor dynamic types. The <a href="RunTimeEngineSchema.html">RunTimeEngineSchema</a> is based on "static typing" because it checks the tables <em>before</em> running the stored instructions.

        Typing is a way to ensure that polymorphic dispatching finds one and only one method before methods are actually called, or at least a way to reduce polymorphic ambiguity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More generally (and more correctly), typing is a way to a) ensure that program operations are well-defined and well-formed, and b) resolve ambiguity.</em> {A little too general.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> is not "typed" because a message may find zero or one method. <a href="PredicateDispatching.html">PredicateDispatching</a> is not typed because it may return zero, one, or many methods (or their equivalent).

      <ul>
        <li>
           That would be a heretofore unheard of definition of "typed". <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> does not necessarily require that a program fail (either to compile, or to terminate if running) if a type error is encountered. The reason for typing is to avoid <a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a>. Handling a discovered typing error via <a href="DoesNotUnderstand.html">DoesNotUnderstand</a> is a perfectly acceptable practice in many problem domains (there are some problem domains, such as mission-critical software, where <a href="DoesNotUnderstand.html">DoesNotUnderstand</a> would be considered unacceptable; however the issue of how to handle typing errors is outside the scope of <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a>.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, but we need clarity with regard to what is "undefined behavior". And a "does not understand" is a language-specific thing that may not be in place even if supported. If a language simply did nothing if a method was not found, one can consider its doing nothing "defined". Nothing is fully defined, otherwise we would not need programs to handle input combinations that we don't know yet. In other words, "defined" is continuous, and subject to </em><a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> problems.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, "defined" is a binary term; it refers to the specification of the language or other system in question. A language spec will specify the behavior of a program written in the language; anything not specified by the standard is generally <em></em><a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a><em>. Language standards frequently identify specific behaviors as undefined. There should be no question if a given operation in a given language is defined or not; otherwise the standard is defective. (See </em><a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a> for much more discussion of this). In most cases, a program which exhibits undefined behavior is in error. Examples: some languages (like C) have no way of trapping an invalid type operation (such as a bogus pointer cast) at runtime - the best the standard can do is warn that invalid pointer casts have "undefined behavior". <a href="DoesNotUnderstand.html">DoesNotUnderstand</a> (in <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>) is <em>not</em> undefined behavior; what happens when you send a Smalltalk object a message it doesn't like is very well defined - and <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> doesn't need typing because it has very few <a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a>s. And you are correct - if a language decreed that unsupported message sends resulted in nothing happening, or an exception being thrown, etc... that also is defined behavior. It may not be useful behavior, but it is defined.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If it is left to the language, your definition is a </em><a href="UselessTruth.html">UselessTruth</a>. How something handles an "unexpected" extra or missing dispatching result is an implementation detail (and can potentially be user-configurable). Grand definitions should not be tied to such trivial details in a big way.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is unclear where you think the 'trivial details' are being tied into this, but understanding what means "<a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a>" in programming is quite useful to distinguish programs into three classes: those provably with undefined behavior, those provably without, and those that are not yet decided either way. And "undefined" is different than "implementation defined". In old versions of GCC, use of unrecognized #pragma directives - which are "implementation defined" - might fire up a game of <a href="NetHack.html">NetHack</a>. Undefined behavior is a problem because many expressions for a program won't be decidable either way... esp. those that depend on runtime inputs. I.e. it may be 'undefined' what happens when you dereference an invalid pointer or index outside the range of an array. Exactly what does happen - anything from hard crashes to exceptions to a game of <a href="NetHack.html">NetHack</a> to a subtle security hole that a hacker will notice years down the line - is free to vary from case to case even within the implementation, as opposed to being defined once per implementation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The "at least a way to reduce polymorphic ambiguity" was added to the definition because <strong>under strong dynamic typing</strong>, types are still used to help decide how to dispatch. For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        a = b + c
      </p>
      <p>
        In some languages "+" may also mean string concatenation, depending on the "types" of the two operands. It is usually implemented as a "type flag" that comes with each variable (see above). (Generally I prefer that a language have a different operator for concatenation, such as "&" or ".". But, this topic is about definitions, not ideal language design.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The biggest problem with this definition is that it depends on the definition of "polymorphism", which itself may be subject to interpretation. Also, sometimes polymorphism may not be involved. For example, the above may have an implementation or internal equivalent that resembles:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = b.plus(c)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or
      </p>
      <code>
        a = plus(b, c)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If a language does not support <a href="ParametricPolymorphism.html">ParametricPolymorphism</a>, it may have to use IF or case statements, something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        method plus(operand2) {<br/>
        if (this.operand1.typeFlag=='number' And <br/>
        operand2.typeFlag=='number') {<br/>
        return mathAdd(this.operand1, operand2);<br/>
        } else {<br/>
        return stringConcat(this.operand1, operand2);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or
      </p>
      <code>
        function plus(operand1, operand2) {<br/>
        if (operand1.typeFlag=='number' And <br/>
        operand2.typeFlag=='number') {<br/>
        return mathAdd(operand1, operand2);<br/>
        } else {<br/>
        return stringConcat(operand1, operand2);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is not polymorphism in the strict sense. One could also emulate the same thing by creating an array in which one element is called a type-flag of sorts and the other is the value. Some languages just have built-in "arrays" for each variable, which contain the "hidden" type flag and the variable value to simplify the syntax and provide a consistent convention. Such languages essentially are performing the following shortcut:
      </p>
      <code>
        foo = 7;  // shortcut in dynamic strong typing<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // the long way<br/>
        foo['value'] = 7;<br/>
        foo['typeFlag'] = typeCodeOfConstant(7);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I see nothing that really distinguishes the two other than being built-in versus hand-rolled. Thus, the definition either needs work, or "types" is inherently a vague concept.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You forgot to plug <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>, apparently... no mention of querying a database for this stuff. :) At any rate, how runtime type machinery is constructed is an implementation detail, one that <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> abstracts out. An important one for language designers to consider - the big block of 'if's is generally considered a bad idea, due to it having average-case O(<em>n</em>) performance - but an implementation detail.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="PredicateDispatching.html">PredicateDispatching</a> was mentioned above. Also, we need clarity to differentiate between "dispatching" and "look-up", if such is even possible. All dispatching could be seen as <a href="PredicateDispatching.html">PredicateDispatching</a> of some sort or the other. Sometimes it just takes place at compile time and an error is raised if anything but one answer is returned. This is generally the case for static typing.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Again, implementation details. <a href="PredicateDispatch.html">PredicateDispatch</a> is the most general form of dispatch; all other forms can be ReFactored into predicate dispatch. Predicate dispatch suffers from several problems:
          <ul>
            <li>
               It's slow - O(<em>n</em>) for single dispatch; up to O(<em>n^k</em>) for <em>k</em>-ary dispatch.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   You said that already. This is not about performance.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               It doesn't conveniently allow the dispatch criteria to be specified in separate locations; one of the strengths of OO dispatch is that one can override a base class method without touching the base class definition. With predicate dispatch, one would have to add clauses to the big switch statement.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   "Locations" is a useless term in the virtual world of bits and databases. See <a href="GroupRelatedInformation.html">GroupRelatedInformation</a>. Now we are <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a>ing over "location", eh? Polymorphism is simply a language-supported tree search algorithm.

        I think the underlying reason for the differences in opinion is that I view code as simply a view on an internal (or semi-internal) data structure and things like polymorphism and inheritance are simply code lookup (dispatching) algorithms or rules, usually based on tree-search algorithms. Strong typed languages simply do tree searches to validate "types" and "subtypes". Some do it at compile time, and some do it during run-time, but it is all just a tree search behind the scenes. This view is not necessarily "wrong", but rather a perhaps minority viewpoint. But, it can model anything syntax can for most languages. Most of the formal or "accepted" type theory seems to view syntax as syntax, not as a data structure(s), and thus a data-ist finds the definition foreign. Whether the formal theory can be translated to a data-ist viewpoint, I don't know. Does <a href="TypeTheory.html">TypeTheory</a> suffer from <a href="LeftHandedSyndrome.html">LeftHandedSyndrome</a>? Is it my fault for not converting my head to proverbial right-handed?

      <p>
        As an example of its use, I did not "get" recursion until I started viewing code as a data structure. It clicked when I was finally able to mentally picture the variable stack being filled up and view how the code was separate from the stack. The code is a static structure during the recursion process and each "instance" of the subroutine call was an empty template of the variables copied onto the stack to be filled in. It works. It may be a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>, but a very, very useful one to me. If I tried to explain recursion to somebody else, drawing the stack and copying the instance template onto the stack for every new call is the only direct way I know how to convey the concept. I have read other explanations, but they seem very indirect and obscure, like a politician beating around the bush to avoid being specific. // <em>Oddly, I would never have grokked recursion with that visualization. I always thought of it (in imperative languages) as just "do the same thing". E.g. to walk to the store, "take one step toward the store. Now walk the rest of the way to the store". Or for trees: "Put this together by putting the pieces together. Put the pieces together by putting their pieces together". We think recursively all the time, without the benefit of diagrams of boxes and stacks.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I find it tough to explain things in terms of syntax, but data structures are just a matter of look-ups and filling in the right cell at the right time. And, you can draw them with grids, boxes, arrows, and numbered steps.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this view, all the fuss about types seems to boil down to guaranteeing one and only one behavioral "cell" is found per dispatch. The <strong>one-and-only-one rule seems to be the common thread to separating "typeness"</strong> from things not normally considered types; and the primary way of doing this is the "hidden flag" (above). The hidden flag is in both static and dynamic systems. Static or compiled systems just toss it at an earlier stage. Maybe Reynold's approach is just another way to say essentially the same thing, but without reference to data structures. Even multiple inheritance (MI) with its complex lookup process still produces one and only one answer in the end. If it did not, I doubt it would be called "types". (MI's "flags" are sets or lists instead of a single value.) Tying Reynold's definition to the data-structure viewpoint may make it more useful and informative because it provides another perspective. The best teaching methods use or try multiple perspectives.

        Are you suggest that the less problems that can be checked/prevented at compile time, the less "typish" it is? C++ sacrifices certain kinds of checks or error complaints for speed and flexibility. You keep seeming to suggest that types are ALL about compile-time prevention of problems.

        Of course, these leave out all kinds of language-specific details. Note that the "flag" may also be a list, especially in cases of multiple inheritance. Of course, this makes a pedigree check more resource-intensive. Non-trees also risk circular definitions, which the compiler/interpreter must somehow intercept, otherwise risk an infinite loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "flag model" offers proper type substitutability using tree-search/traversal (or graph-search if MI) algorithms commonly described in the body of published data structure knowledge. For example, if type A is defined in terms of type B, and type B is defined in terms of type C, then the tree search will eventually find the definitions in C as it looks up through the type hierarchy. For MI there may be circular definitions. The algorithms for detecting cycles in graphs are also well-established. Signature-based type matching/validation such as Java interfaces or parameter overloading are similarly merely data structure traversals to find a matching signature (or report a "no-find"). Thus, the flag model does not lack published theory, but merely borrows from it (data structure theory). Or, perhaps one could say it piggy-backs on it. Yes, it is kind of a mechanical definition, but that also makes it less vague than some of its competitors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor is the flag model tied to "syntax", unlike competitors. Syntax can be viewed as merely a human-friendly wrapper around a data-structure(s). Most compilers and interpreters convert syntax into internal data structures of one kind or another anyhow in order to better process the information. It is possible to program by putting info directly into data structures (such as an <a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a>)), bypassing syntax altogether. And the usual type checking can still be performed despite lack of a syntax coat.

        A type could be seen as a hidden or visible sticker that tells you what type something is (i.e. on an apple you can have a sticker that labels the type of apple it is.) Note that this is a <a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a> definition of types since it isn't even a definition! Just like side flags, it doesn't define what types are, it only tells you that a sticker can label something. The sticker tells you the type of apple it is; the definition of type remains undefined. It's a tautology definition that goes around in circles to <a href="DodgeTheIssue.html">DodgeTheIssue</a>, at best describing a way to label what type something is at a particular point in time (put a sticker on the apple, put a flag/tag on a value or variable).

        <em>It's not perfect, but neither are the other candidates. Those that say what types are, are not clear on what they are not. A definition that doesn't offer a way to falsify its application (what is not an X) is faulty.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Top, the definition I provided, "a type is a set of values and 0 or more associated operations", clearly offers ways to falsify its application.  You just don't like it because it isn't "type tags".}

      <p>
        <em>"Operators" and "values" are not clear-cut. I've shown that "types" can be used as values and vice verse.

        {You've never shown that types can be used as values. Your example only showed that a string value associated with a type -- a type name -- can be compared to other strings. Furthermore, using types as values (which <em>can</em> be done) doesn't damage or alter the definition at all. It still holds true. There's nothing that precludes the "set of values" in "a type is a set of values and 0 or more associated operations" from being a set of type values. Furthermore, there is no need to measure closely-associated vs loosely-associated.  Associated is associated!}

        <em>It's fairly trivial to conjure up a version that doesn't depend on strings. String was just one of many implementation or language-specific approaches among many possibilities. And, are you sure you want to allow ANY association? Still, no clear-cut rules have been established for assigning with 100% reliability the "parts of speech" of languages (values, types, operators, etc.) We all have notions and pattern recognition in our heads that have a rough commonality, but that's not good enough for tight debates, and leaves a lot of fuzzy areas where two different people will label them differently. One can define a language with "stem objects" than can act like common types, values, operators, etc. and switch between them willy nilly. Pattern recognition may be "good enough" to label C/Algol-like languages, but that may not extrapolate to other languages. Thus, pattern recognition (it's an X in Z because it "looks like" the X in Y) is not sufficient.</em>
