        Web Beacon
      </h1>
      <p>
        A line of code specifying an image located on a different server, than the one on which the page is hosted, which is used by a website or third party ad server to track a user's activity, such as a registration or conversion. A web beacon is often invisible because it is only 1x1 pixel in size with no colour. Also known as web bug, 1 by 1 GIF, invisible GIF and tracker GIF. Tracking is possible, because loading that image, causes the web browser to send information such as IP address and browser among others. Disabling cookies will stop the sending of unique information, however, an anonymous visit will still be recorded.
