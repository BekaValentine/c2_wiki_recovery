        Process Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        Any model of 'processes' - especially of communications between software components - might be called a <a href="ProcessModel.html">ProcessModel</a>.  Some examples include the <a href="ActorModel.html">ActorModel</a>, <a href="CommunicatingSequentialProcesses.html">CommunicatingSequentialProcesses</a>, <a href="PiCalculus.html">PiCalculus</a>, and <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a>, and even <a href="SharedMemory.html">SharedMemory</a> MultiThreading 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Note that while most programs can be multi-threaded, MultiThreading cannot be said to be the language's "process model" unless the language <em>explicitly</em> provides support for it (via syntax, semantics, or a <em>standard</em> library).  MultiThreading is one of the least 'safe' and most difficult to comprehend or correctly program models of all, and is popular only because it is simple to implement efficiently - a fine example of failing the KISS principle by going from 'simple' to 'simplistic' where you need to start <a href="AddingEpicycles.html">AddingEpicycles</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Merely having an explicit <a href="ProcessModel.html">ProcessModel</a> does not imply support for <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> processes, but is a precondition for it.  The <a href="ProcessModel.html">ProcessModel</a> is required as a basis for mobility, persistence, and runtime construction of new processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all languages have a <a href="ProcessModel.html">ProcessModel</a>, especially those that were largely procedural in design like <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> or <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, pure functional languages or declarative languages, etc.  However, some languages that do have a <a href="ProcessModel.html">ProcessModel</a> include <a href="ErlangLanguage.html">ErlangLanguage</a> (which is based on the <a href="ActorModel.html">ActorModel</a>), VeryHighDefinitionLanguage (<a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a>), and various WorkflowLanguages.
