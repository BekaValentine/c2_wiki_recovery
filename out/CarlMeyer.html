      <p>
        <a href="CarlMeyer.html">CarlMeyer</a> is young (22); tall (6'2"); remarkably skinny (145 lb); recently married (8/11/02); self-educated (left high school and college in favor of self-directed education); enjoys <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, running around in the mountains, <a href="GameOfChess.html">GameOfChess</a> (also <a href="GameOfGo.html">GameOfGo</a>, though a rank beginner), gardening, and just about any kind of learning; gets paid to write/maintain a not-very-interesting <a href="ContentManagementSystem.html">ContentManagementSystem</a> in <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>; and is looking forward to spending his summer outdoors growing organic vegetables for market.  He likes nothing better than learning about new concepts in just about any field, has spent far too much work time already browsing this Wiki, and hopes to be a useful contributor at some point.

        Really, that's about it. Have a great day.

        Oh, and I dislike arrogance, greed, imperialism, war, and watermelon (among other things). I enjoy building and participating in grassroots action against the first four; the last is inexplicably popular but mostly harmless, so I leave it alone.
