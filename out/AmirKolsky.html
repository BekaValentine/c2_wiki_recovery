        Been in the software business for awhile now.

        Started with a 10 year stint at IBM Research where I dealt with everything from <a href="NaturalLanguageProcessing.html">NaturalLanguageProcessing</a> to OS/2.

        Worked for several startup companies usually in the Architect/CTO capacity. Started my own company -  MobileSpear, and eventually ended up forming XPand Software here in Israel.
