        My current business card says I'm a Senior Software Developer at Creative Solutions (and it wouldn't lie, would it?).  I guess I'm senior in a junior sort of way - 8 years of software development.  Most of it desktop applications in C++ on the Win32 platform.  The coolest project I was involved with was CALVIN - a distributed data logging system for Ford.  Alas, this was also the most politically hampered project.

        I consider myself a 3 (3.5 on a good day) on a 1 to 5 scale of C++ skills (we always ask candidates to rate themselves like this - 1 means you can spell C++ 5 means you're intimately acquainted with Storustroup - nearly everybody says 3 and most people we interview are 2.5 or less.  That's obviously subjective!  I consider myself lucky to work with some 4's.

        About once a year, I get re-sensitized about "process" (or our complete disregard for it) - I'm currently reading up about XP (shame about the name).

        Oh, yeah - I have a disease called "verbositis" ...
