        Ended up here by straying a few links beyond references to David C Hay.  Have just read his book "Data Model Patterns - Conventions of Thought" which I can highly recommend.

        This site looks very interesting, I was overwhelmed by some of the projects, they need (and deserve) more than an on-line browse to pass any more judgment than that.

        I've bookmarked it and plan to return real soon, in the interum I will continue my quest for Data Patterns. (last edited September 20, 1997)

        This editing feature is great, I just hope you get more worthwhile contributions than this for your efforts.
