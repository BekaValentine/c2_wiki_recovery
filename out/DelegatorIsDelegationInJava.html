        Delegator Is Delegation In Java
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DelegatorIsDelegationInJava.html">DelegatorIsDelegationInJava</a> makes Delegation available in the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's an API in native Java so adoption for Java Programmers shouldn't be a problem
      </p>
      <p>
        It supports full delegation and combines this with java static typing.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's currently in a proof of concept - stage of development, but I'm doing my masters thesis on the subject (starting feb 2005, ending dec 2005) so improvements should be expected in the near future.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be found at <a href="http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/delegator">http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/delegator</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have any featurerequests / bugreports please let me know so I can incorporate them in my current work.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently planning on working on

        Klaas, any chance you could describe what it is you are doing on this? Specifically, what features are missing, why this is a problem, and what you propose to solve the problems?
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked at the delegation pages and it is all a little vague. I'm hoping you can provide a little clarity by example. --<a href="RichardHenderson.html">RichardHenderson</a>.

        Progress:...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Delegator couldn't handle Multiple Threads - i.e. would crash - this has been fixed
        </li>
        <li>
           A mechanism has been added for monitors in delegation. Note that in a context of delegation objects (which are composed) no longer map to monitors 1 to 1
        </li>
        <li>
           Java's access modifiers still pose a problem (though this is now well-documented)
        </li>
        <li>
           Exceptions are now passed correctly
        </li>
        <li>
           The components which constitute used to leak out (a last twitch of the self-problem) - a solution has been found
        </li>
      </ul>
