        Work Week
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="WorkWeek.html">WorkWeek</a> is the working days of a <a href="CalendarWeek.html">CalendarWeek</a>. That's typically five, five and a half or six days, depending on how much of a slave driver your company is. In France, though, a <a href="WorkWeek.html">WorkWeek</a> is four days and the wine is better too.
