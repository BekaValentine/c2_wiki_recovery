        Stupid Self Interest
      </h1>
      <p>
        Living life on autopilot.  Living life for one's self without considering the best method to do that.  Choosing behaviors based upon personal preference without questioning whether the behavior will be beneficial for the individual either in the short term or long term.  Basing one's "world view" upon one's desires rather than on reality.  Assuming one's personal observations define reality, even if they conflict with substantial evidence to the contrary. --  <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>

        I try to go with the notion that people are all inherently selfish and illogical and to live, flurish, and even try to enjoy that framework instead of trying to fix the world and fix people. Nobody appreciates 99% of all "fixers". See <a href="HowToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople.html">HowToWinFriendsAndInfluencePeople</a>.
