        Allocation Of Responsibility
      </h1>
      <p>
        The essence of <a href="ObjectDesign.html">ObjectDesign</a> - allocating responsibility over a set of abstractions forming a <a href="SystemOfNames.html">SystemOfNames</a>. If you're familiar with <a href="WritingEffectiveUseCases.html">WritingEffectiveUseCases</a>, you know that your software is responsible for serving its actors and protecting the interests of its stakeholders. Meanwhile you're contemplating a set of abstractions. Some of these may model your problem domain (a <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>). Others may result from applying patterns, such as <a href="PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture.html">PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task is to decompose and allocate your software's responsibilities over the set of abstractions you're contemplating.  You make trade-offs in the process, balancing such forces such as clarity, flexibility, expediency, and atomicity. You adjust your decomposition; you select and discard candidate abstractions. The process goes on forever. It is object-oriented design.
