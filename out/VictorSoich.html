        I'm a java programmer ( I think...) who is interested in learning about patterns, extreme programming, et. al.

        I gained a bit of a "distopian outlook" streak after not being hired by so many corporations and organizations, and after being accepted to Reed college and not getting any financial aid, etc. et. al. but the people I've run into who espouse Extreme Programming seem to have a methodology and/or philosophy of effective programming that also allows one's humanity to be acknowledged.  This gives me hope...although I wouldn't mind making a ton of bucks with some sort of IPO...ah...the latter statement sounds too much like libertarian, a.k.a. avarice, thinking.

        I'll think of something with more perspicacity later....
