        An Extreme Conversation
      </h1>
      <p>
        A completely hypothetical conversation between an IT Manager and a lead programmer. I hope you'll add to it.

        I think it's interesting that your conversation is documented in a similar form to the "two-column" method described by <a href="PeterSenge.html">PeterSenge</a> in his book <em></em><a href="TheFifthDiscipline.html">TheFifthDiscipline</a> : The art and science of the learning organization.<em>  Was this somehow in your mind when you wrote this? </em>

        Nope, never heard of it.  This was strictly <a href="StreamOfConsciousness.html">StreamOfConsciousness</a>.

        Excellent! A very good example of <a href="DontCallItExtreme.html">DontCallItExtreme</a>. I wonder if it would be worthwhile to write up some <a href="AcceptanceTestsForMethodologies.html">AcceptanceTestsForMethodologies</a>.
