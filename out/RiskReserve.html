        Risk Reserve
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is the amount of extra budget and time we add to our project plan to match the level of risk we want on our project.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we add an amount equal to our total <a href="RiskExposure.html">RiskExposure</a> then we are setting the level at 50%. That is, we are as likely to come in before time and under budget, as we are to come in over time and over budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can use <a href="RiskMitigation.html">RiskMitigation</a> to reduce our overall <a href="RiskExposure.html">RiskExposure</a> and therefore the size of our <a href="RiskReserve.html">RiskReserve</a> while maintaining the same level of risk.
      </p>
      <p>
        As our <a href="RiskExposure.html">RiskExposure</a> evolves over time, our level of risk also rises and falls. If at a given time our <a href="RiskExposure.html">RiskExposure</a>, and therefore our level of risk, has fallen because a set of risks expired without impacting the project, we can transfer some of our reserve to a less fortunate project and still maintain our original level of risk.
