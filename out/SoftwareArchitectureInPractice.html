        [ISBN 0-201-19930-0] From a review: A significant book on the practice of software architecture. Should be read by anyone who doesn't think that a Software Architect is an elitist scum and something evil to aspire to.

        <dd><em>Ultimately, the only problem with this excellent book, as with many covering software engineering topics, is that the people who most need the knowledge it contains won't read it.</em></dd>
