      </p>
      <p>
        I like being in the presence of <a href="OoDesigner.html">OoDesigner</a>s and OoExperts. But what I cannot <strong>stand</strong> are the OoPurists (some would call them <a href="ObjectWeenie.html">ObjectWeenie</a>s) who take very strict definitions of what <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> is and what it requires (see <a href="DefinitionsForOo.html">DefinitionsForOo</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, I take offense to statements of the form "As soon as you as a programmer (do X in your code, or use language Y), you are no longer writing <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> code, but some (description of combination of OO and procedural/etc. code which makes it sound like some Frankenstein creation)." The tone comes off as <strong>very</strong> aggressive to me and I don't need to hear that. Plus, some values of X rather disturb me. I've heard people go so far as to say that in Java, the design of the System class is a horrible mistake, and you simply can't have "object oriented" code if you make calls to System.[in|out|err].* anywhere. And go further to say that you should at least mitigate the problem by doing it <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, by making some Singleton object which acts as a wrapper by delegating calls to System... <em>Give me a break.</em> What's next? Barring use of primitives outright in favor of the wrapper objects, because it's a "mistake" in Java that primitives aren't first-class objects anyway?   <a href="JavaObjectOverheadIsRidiculous.html">JavaObjectOverheadIsRidiculous</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effect on the outside code is to change "System.out.println(...)" to "MySystemWrapper.outPrintln(...)" or something along those lines. Maybe "MySystemWrapper.out().println(...)", but then you're violating the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a> it seems. Since there are a fair number of methods, maybe you even implement the Command pattern and do "MySystemWrapper.delegateOut(Println.getInstance(), ...)". Again, <em>Give me a break</em>. Sure, now you can pass around references to MySystemWrapper. <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.

        But yes. Just one example there. Wow, really good at ranting aren't I?

        I believe reasonableness comes with experience.  I like the OO model a lot, but I also recognize cases where it fails and forcing the code into a pure OO form does not provide benefit out-weighing the cost.  Two examples.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) Inheritance fails when the system logically demands a widely used singleton instantiation of a class.  Examples are typically a logging class or a database connection.  The OO solution is usually to pass the singleton in via a constructor or initialize function, but this can be cumbersome when you start subdividing classes.  A non-OO alternative is a global class.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) Encapsulation fails when the system is comprised of multiple subsystems.  For example, we have a COBOL subsystem that preprocesses data and passes it over to a VB and C++ subsystem on a different platform.  To encapsulate this data, we would need a single class containing both the COBOL functions and the VB and C++ functions.  The pragmatic approach is to "un-encapsulate" and just pass the raw data between subsystems.  A similar problem is usually encountered with GUI code, where raw data is passed from GUI classes to business classes.  I have never seen anyone attempt to write a class with GUI functions, business rule functions, and database access functions within a single class to provide "pure" data encapsulation.
        </li>
      </ol>

        The OO model is a good one, but it does not make sense to become a coding martyr to be 100% pure.  When the OO model falls down, use something else.
