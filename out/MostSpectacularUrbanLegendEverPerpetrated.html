        If you include y2k, you have to include the WarOfTheWorlds, which was arguably bigger. I don't think either should be included, though.

        <em>We said there'd be a bug, then we fixed it and said it was fixed.</em> (Then when the critical time events passed, with no major incident, we proved it was fixed.)

        I think Y2K is similar to an urban legend in many respects. The biggest
        difference is that Y2K was a prediction of things to come rather than an account of a past occurrence.

        There is no real reason <em>not</em> to believe that a nice suburban family could actually end up with a deep-fried rat included in their bucket of chicken. It's a little far-fetched, but the natural human horror of contamination causes us to fixate on the possibility, while ignoring the odds. Even an experienced software developer is prone to get hung up on the possibilities of an unplanned-for century rollover, while not giving too much thought to the fact that bugs are a natural part of his everyday life. It is also a function of the human imagination that one might expect that the majority of y2k bugs would result in catastrophes instead of minor annoyances. The setup to the story is just too good for it not to have a spectacular ending.

        What has always fascinated me about urban legends is that they are usually propagated without malice. Your friend <em>really believes</em> that his sister-in-law's cousin's neighbor actually <em>did</em> bring home a cute doggie from vacation, only to find that it was a huge, vicious, Mexican rat. -- <a href="TimVoght.html">TimVoght</a>

        Y2k was more profiteering through fearmongering. I give you organizations like <a href="http://www.tenagra.com">http://www.tenagra.com</a> that will now be scrambling for a reason to exist. Likely they'll "keep a close eye on the unfolding events to make sure no real problems occur." Yeah.

        I notice that the VodaPhone network in the west of Scotland fell over a couple of hours before midnight. The problem was reported to have no relation to y2k. Yeah, right. After all of the hype, how many companies would own up and admit to a lack of preparation? -- <a href="DavidMcNicol.html">DavidMcNicol</a>
