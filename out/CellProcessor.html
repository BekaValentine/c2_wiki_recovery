        Cell Processor
      </h1>
      <p>
        A parallel vector processing architecture intended for use in consumer electronics (including Playstation3, HDTV's, cell phones, and PDA's).
        Principle parties are Sony, Toshiba, and IBM.

        Or probably neither.

        Based on what I know of the cell, it certainly looks interesting. And it'll give the PS3 a whole bunch of oomph (one columnist for the <em>San Jose Mercury-News</em> remarked on the wisdom of providing supercomputers to those who like to play <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>), for sure.

        But I suspect much of the hype is the result of some wishful thinking. <em>Some</em> of the wishful thinking, I suspect, comes from those who desparately <em>want</em> the architecture of current production computer systems to be smashed -- folks who don't like Intel or MS as vendors, folks who don't like monolithic kernels and monolithic hardware architectures, etc. Some of the hype for the Cell reminds me of some the hype surrounding the <a href="SegwayDevice.html">SegwayDevice</a> -- it will require cities to be renovated, and so forth. Generally, new inventions that require such massive infrastucture modifications in order to succeed, will fail -- evolutionary rather than revolutionary technology tends to fare better. OTOH, the <a href="SegwayDevice.html">SegwayDevice</a> didn't have the likes of IBM, Sony, and Toshiba backing it.
