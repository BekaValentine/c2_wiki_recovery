        Csee Transport
      </h1>
      <p>
        CSEE Transport is a French company that makes automatic train control systems,
        from trackside hardware to central control room software.
      </p>
      <p>
        We first used XP on an 8 person project developing a metro supervision
        system. The system is soft real time and distributed, developed using
        C++ and libraries from ILOG.
      </p>
      <p>
        XP was definitely a bit of a revolution here, but management were
        convinced to try it because of the promise of higher productivity and
        because of the high emphasis on <a href="RelentlessTesting.html">RelentlessTesting</a> (we develop
        safety-critical systems).
      </p>
      <p>
        That project started in January 2000, and the original scope was
        finished essentially on time and budget some 18 months later. The
        project continued with extensions and maintenance, with a reduced
        team. The project was quite successful. Developers were delighted with
        XP, managers were interested largely because it made developers happy
        and also because they got good quality reporting. The main problems
        were blamed on not having an <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> and not having
        <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        We thus tried to improve this on a second project (a command/control
        system for a high speed railway section), by having a
        person playing the role of proxy Customer and Tester, and
        automating <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s from the outset (including the GUI, which
        was driven and verified by Python scripts via CORBA and using some
        event handling tools from the GUI library).
      </p>
      <p>
        This second project was not a success (globally, not just the part
        done with XP). The point of view of the team was that, considering the
        circumstances, we were doing extremely well, and XP was very much
        appreciated. The point of view of upper management was that we, and
        XP, could conveniently be blamed for everything, because we had chosen
        to be different. I was asked to leave the project and to quit
        introducing new ideas. I decided to quit altogether. Just in case you
        wondered, that did not solve their problems, by any measure.
