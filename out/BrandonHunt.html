        I'm a jack-of-all-trades, I guess.  Been doing IT work for about 10 years now of all sorts.  Done a little DBA work, some hardware stuff, a lot of web development, and a little programming.

        My current obsession is to learn (and apply, hopefully) some of the XP practices to my development work.  I also poke around the patterns section of the site as well.  I'm just one of those people that likes to learn new things for the sake of knowing them.
