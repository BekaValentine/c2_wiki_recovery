        While I am saying IDEs force people to use the conf and workflows of others, I
        won't deny that those *workflows* can be smart, that's why I always want to
        try IDEs to see whatever nice feathers they have, I won't use them directly
        inside that IDE, instead if I find something I really love, I will try to
        figure out how to do the same with Vim. Let me give a example, QtCreator has 
        the abilty to obtain the documantation for a certain Qt class through clicks,
        I checked it and liked it, and later I succeeded in doing the same(just faster) 
        using Vim and lynx.  Vim is a programmer's editor, besides fast text editing, it does has the 
        smarts to "understand" programmings(plz try *:h gd*, *:h tags*, and *h: 
        cscope*...).
        and I also use plugins like a.vim, taglist.vim. As to your text changing
        operation, I think Vim&Cscope can do the same. If you know something really
        neat and efficent in your IDE that you love and you believe Vim can not do, 
        plz let me know. I won't claim I am a Vim expert, because I am not, but I
        believe there is nothing of real value that a IDE can do and Vim can not.--<a href="PeterWang.html">PeterWang</a>

        I love Vim, and love to use command line to do everything(Maybe not 
        everything, I do use GIMP and firefox and lot more :)). Vim just works better with things like Bash and 
        Git, and thus represents the Unix culture well. Developers love Unix, since
        they get to know the basic and important ideas quickly, for the same reason
        the love command line over GUI. But maybe that's also why so many people find
        it so hard to learn Vim, since they'll first have to know some CommadLineFu --<a href="PeterWang.html">PeterWang</a>

        what do you think?

        My preference for a GUI may be due to being dyslexic. IMO both command line and GUI are powerful, and both have a niche to fill.
