        Octo Radial Menus

      <p>
        <a href="OctoRadialMenus.html">OctoRadialMenus</a> are a specific class of <a href="PieMenus.html">PieMenus</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Characteristics of a fully implemented OctoRadialMenu:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           PieMenu with 1,2,4, or 8 possibly recursive options
        </li>
        <li>
           Mouse navigation of menus & submenus
        </li>
        <li>
           Keyboard navigation via keypad
        </li>
        <li>

        <em>The beauty of </em><a href="OctoRadialMenus.html">OctoRadialMenus</a> is that they allow physical memorization by mouse gesture movements, and are perfectly matched with memorizable keypad sequences. i.e. up,right,down is equivalent to 8-6-2<em></em>

        I've actually seen these somewhere... it was beautiful, to a programmer. I'm not sure how average users would like it though.

        <em>I love using it (Optimoz) for </em><a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a>. NeverwinterNights used the keypad version to good effect.<em></em>

        Okay, so I've been extending this concept in my software for a keypad-only scenegraph manipulator.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically the center keys (1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9) all map to octoradial menus and submenus(shape, material, etc)
        The Ins, Del, Return keys are mapped to Translate, Scale, Rotate respectively (so Ins+8 moves the object +y)
        The -,+ keys are mapped to translate on the Z coordinate for convenience.
        The /,* keys are mapped to scale larger and smaller
      </p>
      <p>
        So for instance to move an object up and to the right, then change it's shape to the next possibility, it'd be (Ins+8,Ins+6,7,6) - where 7 is the shape menu, and 6 is "next" (or in gesture notation, up to the left, then directly right). Incidentally to change it's specular red to half is 972(material->specular->red 0.5)
      </p>
      <p>
        This allows for full 3d transforms as well as the program's command set - all within a standard 101 keyboard's numerical keypad. In the softare, I draw the octoradial icons for each command or submenu, although in live performance it would not be displayed, but mapped to through mental/muscle memory.
