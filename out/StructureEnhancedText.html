        Each <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a> seems to use its own markup language. There was another markup language, Setext, designed to work well with plain text. There was even a <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> filter for it, so it was ready for use in wikis. It seemed well thought out.

        <em>Update, 2003:</em> Work on setext seems to have stopped in the mid-1990s, and the format appears to be moribund. Most links to documents about it are broken.
