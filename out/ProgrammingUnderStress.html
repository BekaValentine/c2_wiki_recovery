        Programming Under Stress
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is anyone aware of any studies of programmer performance under stress:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           External pressure
        </li>
        <li>
           Self-applied pressures
        </li>
        <li>
           Long hours
        </li>
        <li>
           etc ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Is it safe to presume that performance studies of workers in general would not be useful?  I would imagine that there is at least some applicability.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly studies of knowledge workers could be expected to correspond. I'd be willing to argue from studies of garbage men if the study supported my position!

        I don't know if this will help nail something down or not:  In the novel <a href="TheDeadline.html">TheDeadline</a>, one of <a href="TomDeMarco.html">TomDeMarco</a>'s characters notices that productivity only increases by a fixed percentage regardless of how much pressure is applied.  He asks an oracle why this is.. the answer comes back: "because people don't think faster under stress."
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems like it might be hard to do a controlled experiment of knowledge work like this.  You'd never know whether it was individual ability or something else which made the difference.

        I believe there have been studies done on this kind of issue using 
        programmers.  A good place to start would be the journals <em>Work And Stress</em>
        and <em>Ergonomics</em> (available at or though your local college/university).
