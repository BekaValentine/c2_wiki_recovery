        Many see unsigned criticism of OOP and other certain topics and automatically assume it is from <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, a frequent OO critic. However, not all OO criticism is from <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>.  It is an issue because <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> has been accused of inserting his opinions in too many topics, so criticism accounting appears to be necessary to verify and correct this accusation.

        Maybe if I did it for every last one from the beginning then it might be clear. But I have not. I'm open to useful alternatives, but that's not one, to be frank.

        This page is stupid.  Anyone can be, and frequently are, anonymous on this Wiki.  Who the H*ll cares?  The content or comment should and does stand on its own, to say otherwise is discrimination.  A comment should not be treated differently when the author is known to be a certain person or not.  I notice that there is a huge barrier in communication on this Wiki because of language and cultural differences.  I grow tired of discrimination and hen-pecking of certain individuals.  In other words, ignorance and depravity.

        <em>People do make distinctions, for good or bad. This topic was created to reduce repeated confusion over identity. It is intended to solve a repeating actual problem. Sometimes it's just easier to create a marker than to change people or nag them repeatedly.</em>

        By "topic" do you mean Table Oriented Programming Integrated Circuit, a new computer (<a href="HaHaOnlySerious.html">HaHaOnlySerious</a>) that processes tables as if they were machine code? --<a href="NonTopAnonymousDonor.html">NonTopAnonymousDonor</a>

        <em>I'm not sure that's a spoof question. There are certain statements that appear to be from me, but are really not, and people sometimes jump on me based on them. I simply wish to make it clear that I didn't make the given statement.</em>
