        Fear Of Adding Methods
      </h1>
      <p>
        The naive belief that adding methods to a class always makes it more complicated...
      </p>
      <p>
        "No," the novice said, "we should use this design instead of that one because it's clearly simpler; it has fewer methods." (...leading to "one big massive 'do it all' method" a <a href="GodMethod.html">GodMethod</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        But the thing is.. if all this <a href="GodMethod.html">GodMethod</a> does is to execute an complex object graph that somehow represents a kind of expression language.. is it still a <a href="GodMethod.html">GodMethod</a>? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Where should one paint the line between adding methods or creating a new language (also possible known as a new object graph?)
