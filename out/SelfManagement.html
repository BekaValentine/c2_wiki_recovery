        A few years ago, after the popularization of EQ (<a href="EmotionalIntelligence.html">EmotionalIntelligence</a> quotient) there arose a new term called AdversityQuotient. It was said people with good social skills may behave badly (compared to average)when exposed to stressful conditions for a long time. The social skills helped the people as long as the threshold for breaking down is not reached. And some people have higher threshold than others, or react more mildly even though they are not normally considered to be better skilled in relationship matters.

        I hate to label myself as one. I have lots of other ways for rationalizing my wiki behavior. When <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> started to have blocks in Mar05 all kinds of withdrawl symptoms surface. Especially at times (so random) that I cannot even access existing pages.

        It is time for me to reread the page I have started on <a href="SelfManagement.html">SelfManagement</a> (from Google cache if necessary).
