        An Aug05 article explored a recent survey that suggested no compelling TOC considerations for Windows to Linux switch, as contrasted to a Unix to Linux switch. The paper asserts "...integration and interoperability issues among the various Linux and open-source distributions and applications was the main roadblock to the uptake of <a href="LampEnterpriseSolutions.html">LampEnterpriseSolutions</a>. (Also) the lack of enterprise-level application support and documentation for the aforementioned software packages also is an issue." From <a href="http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=100000028WT4">http://www.newsfactor.com/story.xhtml?story_id=100000028WT4</a>

        <em>That article seems to be a little misleading.  See </em><a href="http://news.com.com/a/2100-7344_3-5185069.html">http://news.com.com/a/2100-7344_3-5185069.html</a> where it says, "At companies with 5,000 or fewer users, Linux can save more money than other systems, including Unix and Microsoft's Windows software, said the Boston-based company."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> '"Clearly, many people who have Linux like it a lot, but if you propose a wholesale swap to most large companies, you're looking at a significant up-front cost, and many executives are asking why they should do it," said Yankee analyst Laura DiDio, who authored the report.' </em>

      <p>
        <em>Summarizing: If you have a really large company and have already heavily invested in Windows technology, the savings of using Linux may be outweighed by the cost of change.  But I think the report is mostly talking about desktop use, not the server use that </em><a href="LampEnterpriseSolutions.html">LampEnterpriseSolutions</a> talks about.<em></em>

        <em>By posting such a misleading statement, </em><a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> appears to be a Microsoft shill attempting to scare people away from open source.

        LAMP stands for Linux, Apache, MySQL and Perl. It is mostly unix based open sourced software.

        <em>Might want to broaden the "P" to mean Perl/Python/PHP...</em>

      <p>
        Maybe something like <a href="JbossServer.html">JbossServer</a> to keep the Java people happy that the configuration can indeed be <em>Enterprise class</em>.

        Can both camps be right and that they are referring to different things?
