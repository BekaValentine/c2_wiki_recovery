        Distributed Mind
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DistributedMind.html">DistributedMind</a> operates like <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> in <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a>. It is a cross between a <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a> and a <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="DistributedMind.html">DistributedMind</a> has a set of autonomous agents who collectively form one idea, but the agents don't have individual thoughts. Instead, the <a href="CollectiveIdea.html">CollectiveIdea</a> is formed from the collective brain power and stimulus of all the minds in the system. Like a <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a>, there is only one idea for the group; however, unlike a <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a>, the idea isn't imposed from one individual. You can consider a <a href="DistributedMind.html">DistributedMind</a> like a distributed calculation like <a href="SetiAtHome.html">SetiAtHome</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps a <a href="DistributedMind.html">DistributedMind</a> better fits the term, "<a href="TheCollective.html">TheCollective</a>" than a <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>'s society if only because of <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it makes you feel warmer inside, Jane from <a href="EndersGame.html">EndersGame</a> (well, SpeakerForTheDead) is also a <a href="DistributedMind.html">DistributedMind</a>.

        An <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> team is very much like a BorgCollective.  (As <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> were originally introduced in "Q Who," that is; not as they were transformed in later episodes and the movie.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> make decisions as a collective.  As "Q Who" explains, this minimizes the kinds of mistakes that a single individual might make.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> is a small-scale example of this kind of collective thinking.
            </li>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Borg vessels do not have localized specialized subsystems.  (For example, there is no centralized navigation system, or centralized defense system, etc.)  Rather, this functionality is distributed throughout the vessel.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> teams practice <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a>.

          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As a result of the distrubuted nature of systems on Borg vessels, a Borg vessel can not be disabled by damage to a small area (or to a few small areas).
          <ul>
            <li>
               One result of <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> is that the <a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a> is high.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

           <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> have the ability to "analyze and adapt."

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> waste no effort.  Every action has a purpose, and nothing is done until it the need is demonstrated.  For example, when the landing party from the Enterprise was exploring the Borg vessel, the Borg did not make any effort to interfere, because they did not perceive the landing party as a threat, and hence interference with the party was not needed.

        <li>
           Because of their eXtreme success, natural confidence, and single-minded obsession, <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> teams can generate lots of Fear and Loathing among the surrounding species.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>You have it wrong. </em><a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> only has one personality. An XP team has several. XpIsaCollectiveIntelligence, not a <a href="DistributedMind.html">DistributedMind</a>.<em></em>
