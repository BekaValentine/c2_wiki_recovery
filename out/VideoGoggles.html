        PDAs are way overpowered for such tiny displays. What I want is <a href="VideoGoggles.html">VideoGoggles</a>. It's almost 2002 - surely time for such things. Anyone know where I can get 'em? With no display, but the PDA embedded in a nice foldable keyboard?

        Microvision offers, for price between $1500 and $2500 depending on how many pixels and shades of grey you want, a unit which will clip onto your glasses and shine a laser onto your retina.  (Only one eye at a time; no stereo vision...)  The maximum size is, I believe, 800x600.  According to wearable fans who have tried the things, the image looks excellent...  Because it's projected at a focal distance of about ten feet, it doesn't strain your eyes.  Accepts VGA input; requires a belt-mountable scan converter (included).  Providing the PDA is up to you.
