        <strong>Is this page </strong><a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>?<strong></strong>

      <p>
        It is <a href="NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo.html">NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo</a>, a BetterThanNothing page.

        <a href="HalfBakedAttemptsLeadNowhere.html">HalfBakedAttemptsLeadNowhere</a> viewpoints are as valid as the <a href="HalfFinishedWorkLeadsToCollaboration.html">HalfFinishedWorkLeadsToCollaboration</a> viewpoint. The key is <a href="MakeRoomForAllViewpoints.html">MakeRoomForAllViewpoints</a>, and the contrary opinions assist the readers to do <a href="CriticalThinking.html">CriticalThinking</a>.

        This page was created to reduce the size of <strong></strong>PandemicResponsePatterns<strong> so the former page could have a more focused discussion on the main topic. And at this later point in time I say </strong><a href="NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo.html">NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo</a> is a page should stay to make "a statement on its own". If <a href="CommunityBuilding.html">CommunityBuilding</a> efforts at this wiki become more successful, then there will be less need to rely on <a href="NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo.html">NotGoodEnoughButHaveToMakeDo</a>, to convey important but ignored pattern related topics. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

        <em>There was an article about this in probably </em><a href="NewScientist.html">NewScientist</a> sometime in the past, oh, year. If not that then <a href="SciAm.html">SciAm</a>. It just summarized some of the work done using computer simulations of epidemics and how effective different responses are. I say this merely to point out the dearth of solid information and references in this page despite its attempt at a serious tone.<em></em>

           thanks for picking up your pen and you are right in your remarks. I value SayItDirectly

           there are lots of information left unsaid (on purpose) by the original author, who has followed this topic for years (as a lay person). For example, who did the original research that led to the development of vaccine. What vaccines are available. What do the government leaders (e.g. a health minister) say about distribution, which notable persons in which countries made recent remarks on the topic, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           these are left out because:

               avoid <a href="DeathFromPerfection.html">DeathFromPerfection</a> and <a href="DeathByPerfection.html">DeathByPerfection</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               above all, avoid <a href="WikiSuccessCanInhibitNewWriters.html">WikiSuccessCanInhibitNewWriters</a>. I want more ways open to attract new contributors

        <li>
           also please note the parent page is trying to focus on "getting a community based solution" on "an inevitability". We do not want communities to turn against each other, "loss of democracy" when things start to move.
