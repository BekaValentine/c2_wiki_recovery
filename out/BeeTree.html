        Bee Tree

        Actually written as a B-Tree.

        A <a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a> frequently used for disk based ISAM index files (eg SQL tables).

      <p>
        The Tree is built up from nodes like a <a href="BinaryTree.html">BinaryTree</a>, but unlike a binary tree each node can have more than two pointers. Pointers will be added to a node until it exceeds the size of a disk block at which point the node is split into two nodes which are now both half full.
      </p>
      <p>
        This optimizes for minimum node access, assuming node storage reads and writes are expensive compared to in-memory key comparisons.
