        Your classes are huge and your methods are bigger; you've said everything again and again and again and you've added another piece of unnecessary code.

        Somewhere far away a toddler in a toy shop approaches a leaning pyramid of Tickle-me-Elmo boxes. He is leaning...teetering...reaching for a toy.

        Outside a drunk undoes his zip and leans against the wall, waiting for a pedestrian to pass by while a stray dogs rustles through discarded pizza boxes.

        Loudly, a fart backfires.. you never once tested.

        Try aiming for the <a href="ExtremeNormalForm.html">ExtremeNormalForm</a> next time...

        I've heard that too often to count. Sometimes it's even true. It's pretty much in the same category as blaming bugs on the compiler; compilers do in fact have bugs, but it's not the first suspect.
