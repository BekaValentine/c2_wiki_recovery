        Eval Apply
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Before we apply a function we must first evaluate its arguments.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This, or something like it, is one of the inner mysteries of programming languages. <a href="EvalApply.html">EvalApply</a> is written, inside a ying-yang logo, on the front cover of <a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a>. When in <a href="EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk.html">EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk</a> <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> bet he could define "the most powerful language in the world" in "a page of code", what he delivered was essential Eval and Apply. <a href="ChristopherStrachey.html">ChristopherStrachey</a> pointed out that we must also evaluate the function itself, if function-expressions are first-class objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, if you're going to be minimalistic, you can define a </em><a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> language with an array and "subtract, then jump". Big deal. The goal is to make a usable language.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. Smalltalk is usable, and is close to what Kay had in mind. Lisp likewise.

        <em>But, with </em><a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>, you don't have to evaluate the arguments until they're actually used.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed. Logical "before" rather than temporal.

        <em>It's pretty easy. In a </em>subexpression<em>, you might have a function call. The function call has arguments that are also </em>expression<em>s. Thus, an </em>expression<em> can contain other </em>expression<em>s. To evaluate the parent </em>expression<em>, you have to evaluate the child </em>expression<em>s first. The apply is just the function call. Hence, </em><a href="EvalApply.html">EvalApply</a>.<em></em>

        Here's roughly how the famous pair looks:
      </p>
      <code>
        define eval(expr, environment):<br/>
        if is_literal(expr): return literal_value(expr)<br/>
        if is_symbol(expr):  return lookup_symbol(expr, environment)<br/>
        ;; other similar cases here<br/>
        ;; remaining (and commonest) case: function application<br/>
        function  = extract_function(expr)<br/>
        arguments = extract_arguments(expr)<br/>
        apply(eval(function, environment), eval_list(arguments, environment))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        define apply(function, arguments):<br/>
        if is_primitive(function): return apply_primitive(function, arguments)<br/>
        environment = augment(function_environment(function),<br/>
        formal_args(function), arguments)<br/>
        return eval(function_body(function), environment)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        def eval_list(items, environment):<br/>
        return map( { x -> eval(x, environment) }, items)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There are plenty of minor variations: you can cram the two
        functions into a single <em>evalapply</em> function and gain a little
        efficiency that way; you can put your environment implicitly on
        a stack; you don't really have to build a new list for your
        evaluated arguments; and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        More interestingly: the above implements lexical scoping. For
        dynamic scoping (as e.g. in early Lisp systems), pass the
        environment from <em>eval</em> into <em>apply</em> and extend that
        instead of the defining environment of the function being
        applied.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It also implements </em><a href="StrictEvaluation.html">StrictEvaluation</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yep. For lazy evaluation (albeit not done very efficiently),
        you can do something like: slap an extra eval around the call
        to <em>lookup_symbol</em>, and don't do <em>eval_list</em> on the argument
        list before handing to <em>apply</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point here isn't that it's exciting that we can implement
        any one evaluation or scoping scheme, but that changing from
        one to another need only involve changing a few lines of code.
        Of course, if you want an <em>efficient</em> language implementation
        then you need to work a bit harder.
