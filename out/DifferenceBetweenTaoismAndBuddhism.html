        Difference Between Taoism And Buddhism
      </h1>
      <p>
        Buddhism says, "suffering is caused by attachment". Taoism says, "suffering is the universe's way of telling you you're doing it wrong". --<a href="EasternWuss.html">EasternWuss</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The above statement is highly superficial</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How western civilization has degraded us! All right then, with more wind and less pith:
      </p>
      <p>
        Buddhism's "Four Noble Truths" courtesy of <a href="http://www.buddhaweb.org:">http://www.buddhaweb.org:</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Suffering exists
        </li>
        <li>
           Suffering arises from attachment to desires
        </li>
        <li>
           Suffering ceases when attachment to desire ceases
        </li>
        <li>
           Freedom from suffering is possible by practicing the <a href="EightfoldPath.html">EightfoldPath</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That path is summarized at <a href="http://my.tbaytel.net/arfh/dhamma/eightfold.html.">http://my.tbaytel.net/arfh/dhamma/eightfold.html.</a> Taoism does not oppose this view - it connects directly in <a href="LaoTse.html">LaoTse</a> chapter 19 (<a href="http://www.chinapage.org/gnl.html#19).">http://www.chinapage.org/gnl.html#19).</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        But the frame of <a href="TaoChia.html">TaoChia</a> has nothing to do with suffering; it's about what works - what endures. So we have <a href="LaoTse.html">LaoTse</a>'s "Three Treasures" courtesy of <a href="http://www.chinapage.org/gnl.html#67">http://www.chinapage.org/gnl.html#67</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Compassion, by which one finds courage.
        </li>
        <li>
           Restraint, by which one finds strength.
        </li>
        <li>
           Unimportance, by which one finds influence.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Then "those who are fearless, but without compassion, powerful, but without restraint, or influential, yet important, cannot endure". <a href="LaoTse.html">LaoTse</a> focuses outward, on everyday life, social systems, and politics, rather than inward, on escape. Consequently its view of suffering is more related to <a href="AjiKeshi.html">AjiKeshi</a> than <a href="WabiSabi.html">WabiSabi</a>.
