        Visual Basic Problems With Relative Path Names
      </h1>
      <p>

        <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> (old <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>) often gets confused about relative path names when working on projects in more than one directory.
        It will add redundant relative paths to all the modules and classes you add.
        <em>(And sometimes, in a fit of confusion, it may add them to all modules and classes in a project.)</em>
        I find that I must always edit the project (.vbp) files by hand before checking into source control, whenever I add classes, modules or forms to a project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
        I'm working on a group of two projects, one in "C:\a\b\c" and the other in the "d" subdirectory, "C:\a\b\c\d".
        When I add a class "class.cls" to the project in the "c" directory, the project file (.vbp) will usually show "Class=class; ..\..\a\b\class.cls".
        In other words, the relative path says "go up a few directories, go back down through the same directories to the same directory where you started."
        Before I check in, I always have to pull up the project files in the "VisualNotepad development environment"
        <em>(or any other text editor ;-)</em>
        and reduce "Class=class; ..\..\a\b\class.cls" to "Class=class; class.cls", which is exactly the same thing -- except that it still works when directories get rearranged.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's a minor annoyance.  I shouldn't have to </em>'hack<em>' the project file contents, but it's the only way I can get clean portable builds.</em>

        Keep everything in the same folder if you can. Then there are no relative folders to confuse. -- <a href="ThomasEyde.html">ThomasEyde</a>
