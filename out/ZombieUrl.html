        A <a href="ZombieUrl.html">ZombieUrl</a> is an "unbroken" link such as <a href="http://thephpwtf.com/.">http://thephpwtf.com/.</a>  It is now a <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>, with no server, While in the past it may have had a server, it did not provide useful content by any stretch of the imagination.
