        <a href="ObjectiveComputerSystems.html">ObjectiveComputerSystems</a> developed two really landmark evolutionary projects in the 1990s, both using Smalltalk a lot but not exclusively.  David was one of the few people involved in both of these projects.  In the first he was the most junior programmer, in the second he created the whole project out of three days initial Smalltalk development and consultancy.

        After that he was so impressed with what he had learnt that he became a money broker!  But that didn't really surprise me.  More than anyone else that worked for Objective David understood and practised <a href="BusinessValueFirst.html">BusinessValueFirst</a>, at every stage of a client relationship and project.  Maybe he'll teach me more about how to make real money one day.
