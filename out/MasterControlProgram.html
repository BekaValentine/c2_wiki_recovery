        Master Control Program
      </h1>
      <p>
        The name of the OS on some/many/all Burroughs mainframe computers was the Master Control Program.  Also known as the MCP.  I've read the BEALGOL source code for one of these and think that the <a href="TronMovie.html">TronMovie</a> image kind of appropriate -- with a procedure Hoover in charge of security. -- <a href="DickBotting.html">DickBotting</a>

      <p>
        "Hoover" would also be a neat name for a mark-and-sweep garbage collector. <em>One must wonder whether "Hoover" is a reference to vacuum cleaners or J. Edgar; I tend to think its a reference to the latter in this case.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hoover <em>tends to apply the Decorator pattern to itself in interesting ways.</em>
