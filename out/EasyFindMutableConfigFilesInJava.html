        Easy Find Mutable Config Files In Java
      </h1>
      <p>
        When developing cross-platform applications in Java or other languages, a common problem (and source of user errors) is where to store (and thus later, find) configuration files. We typically need configuration files because (in Java: barring the somewhat young and untrusted Preferences API) there is no other reliable cross-platform method. Ideally, they should be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Automatically and reliably findable by the application they configure, without user intervention or special installation processes.
        </li>
        <li>
           Editable programatically, so the application or its users can persist changes to configuration state.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ive encountered many difficulties fulfilling these requirements as a developer myself, and used enough 3rd party java applications that are hard to configure to know Im not alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first requirement is often solved by loading resources through the classpath, using the <a href="ClassLoader.html">ClassLoader</a>.getResource() family of methods. This is a good solution because for the app to be running at all, the classpath must be basically correct to locate out config file. One needs to be careful which <a href="ClassLoader.html">ClassLoader</a> you use; I use getClass().getClassLoader() myself.
      </p>

        What the <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/configuration">http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/configuration</a> implemntation taught me, that isnt widely realized, is that one can convert the URL returned by getRecource() back into a writeable file. Thus, it is possble to locate a config file from the classpath only, but then write back to it. The XMLConfiguration class from the Apache commons configuration API is a nice example of the technique in action.

        The catch is that you need to have a file on disk, and not in a JAR, so the distibution does need to be exploded out :(
