        In Band Signal
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you get a busy signal, it comes through the same band (using the same bandwidth) as the voice you hoped to hear. This in-band signal is convenient because it appears just where you were listening and you know what to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        It also ties up a lot of switching equipment and trunk capacity for a rather small bit (<a href="BooleanRepresentation.html">BooleanRepresentation</a>) of information. And it isn't all that easy to interpret when it's a machine placing the call. Finally, in-band signals are subject to spoofing which has been the mechanism of considerable telephone fraud.
      </p>

      <p>
        Compare these two idioms ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           while ((ch=getchar()) != EOF) { ... }
        </li>
        <li>
           [aStream atEnd] whileFalse: [aCharacter := aStream next. ...]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The former uses an in-band signal for <em>end-of-input</em>,
        the latter sends it through a separate <em>band</em>. One is easily made atomic, though not idempotent. The other conserves type-space even though it is hardly in short supply.

        In <a href="WritingSolidCode.html">WritingSolidCode</a> by <a href="SteveMaguire.html">SteveMaguire</a>, he spends a chapter discussing <a href="InBandSignal.html">InBandSignal</a>(s), and how, especially in the C libraries, they make it easy to write bad code. Two examples from the book:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) The getchar() function mentioned above. Because of the name, it's easy to think that it returns a <em>char</em>,
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        even though it returns an 
        <em>int</em>
        because of the <a href="InBandSignal.html">InBandSignal</a>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) Memory management functions like <em>realloc</em>,
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        which return the <a href="InBandSignal.html">InBandSignal</a> 
        <em>NULL</em>
        which indicates an "unable to complete operation" signal. If a programmer isn't careful, the signal will be ignored, leading to memory leaks, e.g.
      </p>
      <code>
        pbBuf = realloc(pbBuf, sizeNew);<br/>
        if (bpBuf != NULL)<br/>
        /* use the larger buffer */<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Modern languages generally use exceptions instead of in band signals.
      </p>

        A more recent example of an <a href="InBandSignal.html">InBandSignal</a> being used (in C) for nefarious purposes are <a href="FormatStringAttack.html">FormatStringAttack</a>s
