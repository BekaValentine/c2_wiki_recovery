        Complete Responsibility Rule
      </h1>
      <p>
        A corollary to the <a href="OneResponsibilityRule.html">OneResponsibilityRule</a> and <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. Once a class, method, or package takes on a responsibility, it should take full and sole responsibility. Clients should depend on it to take on the task, and not concern themselves with special cases, general setup, and the like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Refactoring should proceed to move responsibility from the clients of the class into the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        The responsibilities accepted by a unit of code should cohere (see <a href="CouplingAndCohesion.html">CouplingAndCohesion</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        This does not mean that responsibilities should be lumped into large classes. Responsibilities may in turn be subcontracted out in smaller responsibilities to smaller-level units. Large responsibilities belong to applications or packages. But there needs to be a clear boundary, whether it be module, class, method, package, or whatever, where we can say "the buck stops here". Further, this boundary should be minimal (<a href="OneResponsibilityRule.html">OneResponsibilityRule</a>).
