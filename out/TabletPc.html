           But other options exist, see for example a mid05 <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a> alternative by Nokia at <a href="http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1835275,00.asp">http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,1895,1835275,00.asp</a> <img src="http://common.ziffdavisinternet.com/util_get_image/10/0,1425,sz=1&i=101577,00.jpg" />

        The company has listed amongst the ten main benefits, the ability to use <strong>all</strong> features of <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> (see <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/evaluation/toptenbenefits.asp).">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsxp/tabletpc/evaluation/toptenbenefits.asp).</a>

        One of the newer interaction methods made possible by the tablet PC is the <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a> called DigitalInk, which provides handwriting recognition. It also separately identifies handwriting ink from drawing ink. Ink can be used as annotation to regular documents via OLE.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Also it has gestures, which include speech recognition modules with support for Chinese and Japanese languages. Gestures can be custom constructed.

        <em>Any body has recent news (e.g. 2004) on additional merits of a convertible </em>TabletPC (one that can function as a laptop as well). Or is it going to remain a novelty item due to lack of killer applications that attract the laptop buyer?<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TabletPc.html">TabletPc</a> support multiple display rotation and reorientation, and its digitizer picks up pen movements but not other physical pressure (e.g. palm).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I also have a concern regarding the ability for the TabletPC os to keep up with the monthly critical service packs issued for <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a>.

           Later in the same month another eweek article, "Reports of Tablet PC's Death Have Been Greatly Exaggerated", provided a different perspective at analysing the facts.

      <p>
        According to <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, this 2006 created category of hardware runs <a href="TabletPc.html">TabletPc</a> operating system, and supposed to run some <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a> version when it evenuates.

        Instead of having an electromagnetic screens allowing interaction with a specialized pen, a lower cost touch sensitive screen is provided.
      </p>
      <p>
        UMPCs have form factors between a PDA and a <a href="TabletPc.html">TabletPc</a> and is priced between these ranges too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PowerUsage.html">PowerUsage</a> is said to be a key shortcoming of UMPC, as users try to compare their experiences with a <a href="SmartPhone.html">SmartPhone</a> or <a href="PocketPc.html">PocketPc</a> which typically do not have a spinning harddisk and myriad of applications.
