        A twist on <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a> for fun and profit. Feel free to move this to <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> topic when cooked.

           <em></em><a href="GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a><em> - Every sufficiently complex application will either have to use a database or reinvent one the hard way.</em>

        <li>
           <em>Greenmux's Tenth Rule of Programming</em> - No powerful classification system can work effectively by assuming mutual-exclusion of type or category. Thus, sets are more flexible than <a href="PrimaryNoun.html">PrimaryNoun</a> and polymorphism. (<a href="MutuallyExclusiveCategoriesDontScale.html">MutuallyExclusiveCategoriesDontScale</a>)

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Greennav's Tenth Rule of Programming</em> - OOP languages with lots of meta-ability are essentially a OODBMS, which are really <a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a>s that store code snippets (methods) or pointers to snippets. (DOM and the <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> environment qualify.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Greenfix's Tenth Rule of Programming</em> - Any serious attempt to clean up and formalize navigational structures will lead to something that looks suspiciously relational.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Greenverb's Tenth Rule of Programming</em> - At least half of OO app methods are usually repetitious reinvented forms of <a href="DatabaseVerbs.html">DatabaseVerbs</a>.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Greenpsyc's Tenth Rule of Programming</em> - Any detailed evidence for OO betterment will rely on assumptions or pet theories about human or personal pscyhology. (And the theories will either be wrong or not universal.)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Greenlink's Tenth Rule of Programming</em> - OO'ers talk about how powerful OO's behavior-handling abilities are, but the hard part and source of most OO headaches is managing all the relationships <em>between</em> objects.
