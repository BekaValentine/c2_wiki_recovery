        The idea of a <strong>Wiki</strong> may seem odd at first, but dive in, explore its links and it will soon seem familiar. "Wiki" is a composition system; it's a discussion medium; it's a repository; it's a mail system; it's a tool for collaboration. We don't know quite what it is, but we do know it's a fun way to communicate asynchronously across the network.

        To find a page on any specific topic, go to <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a>. To see an auto-generated list of pages which have changed recently, try <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. If you want a short list of randomly-selected pages, try <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a>. <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a> is the top level of page categorization; you can use it to delve deeper into the site.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edit pages by using the <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> link at the bottom of the page you wish to edit. Don't worry too much about messing up, as the original text is backed up and can be easily restored (meaning, everyone can see the changes made, and will be able to correct mistakes, erase, and so on, if necessary).

        The <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a> are quite simple, and the <a href="TipsForBeginners.html">TipsForBeginners</a> will help you learn to apply them gracefully. You'll probably want to start by editing pages that already exist. The <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a> is set aside for editing practice. Go there now to try it. (Please don't edit this page; changes here will likely be reversed within a few minutes).
