        Hey there and how goes it!
        I have yet to check all the links on Wiki out, don't have That much time on my hands. I was bidding on a freelance job where the question (one of many) was <em></em>'Are you familiar with <a href="WikiForums.html">WikiForums</a><em></em>'. I had no idea what she was talking about, than started thinking <em>man guess I'm getting out of touch</em>. Now other folks out there would probably include other comments on that as well...but with a quick google here I am and here I've been.
        --I was surfing a few links and came across a pretty cool discussion from two guys and a girl here: <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>.

        Guess that wraps it till I'm bored again, I mean after all <em>Happy Hour</em> is now over. Beautiful day gota say 80â˜¼ on Feb 26t
