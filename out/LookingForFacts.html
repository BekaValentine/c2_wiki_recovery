        Looking For Facts
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some of the potential "solutions" for the wiki "problem" could rely on cookies, 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          What is the definition of the problem?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>At the time, persistent vandalism and destructive behaviour suggested the need for user accounts.  Browser cookies were suggested as a component of a technical solution.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A counter argument was, that cookies are not universally acceptable, and not everyone uses the same computer all the time.
      </p>

        Could we get some hard facts here? Please add a digit to the following vote: 0 means cookies would make wiki impossible for you, 9 means it would have no effect, and 5 means it would be inconvenient. Thanks.

           Wiki with cookies scores out of 9 ...

           Cookies would be a minor inconvenience for me as I use multiple computers to access wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           I frankly don't see what cookies could possibly solve. Do you mean mandatory authentication ? You can do it without cookies, with the minor inconvenience that it is not persistent across browser sessions.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Cookies can store ratings, references, previous edits, and other information related to the user for the purpose of trust metrics. There are ways of doing this without cookies - this page is an attempt to ask just how many people would be inconvenienced by requiring cookies. I note that you didn't answer.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>I wanted to focus the discussion on </em>'what<strong> not </strong>how<em>'. Once we know the what, how we do it is a mere technical detail (it's not always this simple with software, but in this context, I believe it is). So it doesn't make sense to ask people if they could suffer cookies, if you don't elaborate what will the cookies accomplish. Assume that people allow cookies, then what ? People are more likely to agree to cookies and to disagree with what the cookies will be used for. </em>

              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               I agree completely that <strong>what</strong> is an important question, and the technicalities of the implementation are just that, technicalities. However, other pages are descending into madness - sorry - hosting that discussion, and I was interested in learning something about the users. This is a datum on which to help me focus my thoughts. Experience and evidence suggest that I think differently from most - this is part of my approach to the question of the future of wiki. I note that you still haven't answered.
