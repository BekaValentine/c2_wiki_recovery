      <p>
        Theodor Seuss Geisel, a.k.a. <a href="DoctorSeuss.html">DoctorSeuss</a>, is best known for his children's books, of which he wrote more than 40.  Many (his best-known) he also illustrated himself; his artwork has a rather unique and humorous style.  Some of his best known are:

        He won the <a href="PulitzerPrize.html">PulitzerPrize</a> in 1984 and three Academy Awards, and died in 1991. Sadly missed. Notwithstanding considerable confusion over the spelling of his <em>nom de plume,</em> it is <strong>"Seuss"</strong> -- Not spelled Suess, but search ought to get you here to see the correction anyway.

        In addition to <a href="DoctorSeuss.html">DoctorSeuss</a>, Geisel also used the pen name "Theo. LeSieg" (Giesel spelled backwards) when he was the author but not the illustrator of a book.
