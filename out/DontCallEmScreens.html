        Dont Call Em Screens
      </h1>
      <p>
        Today, a lot of software is designed to run on computing devices with window systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of it uses phrases like <em>the next screen</em> and <em>the login screen</em> to refer to things that are not screens, such as dialogue boxes or web pages.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So, what's wrong with that? "Screen" is a fairly well-understood term for a chunk of UI that has to be interacted with before you can go anywhere else. While it sounds a little odd to PC-centric types, it's not hard to understand. --</em><a href="MichaelGates.html">MichaelGates</a><em></em>
