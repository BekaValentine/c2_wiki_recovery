        Incremental Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've been kicking around some ideas for translating the successful programming technique of <a href="IncrementalDevelopment.html">IncrementalDevelopment</a> to the Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Technical Problems:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Browser/Computer/Connnection Unreliability -- You can either hate your computer's stability, or you can adapt to it.  Assume that content in your browser's buffer doesn't exist until you send it Ward's server's disk drive.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Conflicting Edits -- This Wiki once used "No locking at all", which deleted some edits without warning -- see <a href="SteppedOnMyEdit.html">SteppedOnMyEdit</a>. The current "first one wins" protocol is much better, but still annoying for those who are not "first".
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Human Problems:</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Lost Ideas -- The <a href="CreativityGoblin.html">CreativityGoblin</a> runs by and distracts you from what you were trying to say with a different, shinier idea.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Overwhelmed Thoughts -- Breaking off too big a chunk can bring confusion to our poor little minds.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Lack of Formatting Feedback -- Especially when you're learning the <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>, it's nice to see the end result as you go.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Solutions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Save First Drafts as <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s -- Divert to <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a> until you're ready to advertise the new version on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. <em>[Note: this is no longer possible. See </em><a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a> for reasons.]<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Don't Edit Me Yet" Notes -- Sometimes you might want to put up a flag asking the residents to let you finish your thoughts before they contribute.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Embrace Incompleteness (a.k.a. <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>) -- It's okay if you can't treat the topic as thoroughly as you'd like to. Write your first thoughts, leave "TODO" and "______" markers where appropriate, and come back later. This sometimes leads to that magic experience when a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> fills in the TODO's and blanks for you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I like the way all consecutive edits by a single author are considered a "single edit" by <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a>. That avoids cluttering <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> with all the little minor typo-fixes that occur to me milliseconds <em>after</em> I hit "save".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ThoughtShotgunWriting.html">ThoughtShotgunWriting</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Atomic Edits/Refactorings. For one example, see: <a href="TypeItInNotepadFirst.html">TypeItInNotepadFirst</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DistributedWiki.html">DistributedWiki</a>.  Refactor wiki into a <a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a> platform, it's natural evolution.
        </li>
