        Hidden Context Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        To illustrate the vast scope of meaning and context, consider the following problem:
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine AgentX typed the message "Foo is awful^H^H^H^H^Hgreat!" into a computer, translated to egyptian hieroglyphs, saved as a spreadsheet, encrypted, stenographed into an image, converted to a spectrum of sound, and a program that would wait four days then call a remote phone to play the sound once before deleting itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        System Requirements
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Find anything AgentX knows about Foo without alerting AgentX.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>- consider the context needed just to read and understand the problem.</em>
