      <p>
        one person's opinion: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>IBM </em><a href="SanFrancisco.html">SanFrancisco</a> [1] is a Java-based set of components that allows developers to assemble server-side business applications from existing parts, rather than build from scratch. Pre-tested <a href="SanFrancisco.html">SanFrancisco</a> components enable developers to build and modify business applications quickly.<em> </em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        an opposing opinion:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="SanFrancisco.html">SanFrancisco</a> is bloated, over-designed, and over-promised. It makes the fatal assumption that all business are the same. You are better off building what you need.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Are there any systems in successful production deployment on top of </em><a href="IbmSanFrancisco.html">IbmSanFrancisco</a>?  Do they have adequate response time performance, especially when scaled?  It seems unlikely that they would, given that <a href="IbmSanFrancisco.html">IbmSanFrancisco</a> uses <a href="EntityBeansAsDomainObjects.html">EntityBeansAsDomainObjects</a>, which flies in the face of one of the first rules of distributed object design: don't make every object a distributed object.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There are no known implementations of <a href="IbmSanFrancisco.html">IbmSanFrancisco</a> in the wild.  Perhaps they have become extinct?  One key point:  SF components are not EJBs, and do not run within an EJB server.  Say it ain't so?	Sorry, it's The Truth.  SF components require their own runtime, which is distinct from IbmWebSphere, distinct from IbmComponentBroker, and distinct from the 5 other distributed object runtimes that IBM markets.

        <em>is anyone </em>'actually<em>' using these?  Real experiences, not opinions</em>

        It seems <a href="IbmSanFrancisco.html">IbmSanFrancisco</a> is a third generation framework with design roots in <a href="EtPlusPlus.html">EtPlusPlus</a> then Taligent.  Interesting to see if GammaEtAl are using it or have moved on.

        Judging from <<a href="http://www-3.ibm.com/software/ad/sanfrancisco/">http://www-3.ibm.com/software/ad/sanfrancisco/</a>>, IBM has discontinued <a href="SanFrancisco.html">SanFrancisco</a>. Possibly parts of it have been transplanted to "<a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Business Components".

        More or less accidentally, I had grabbed <a href="SanFranciscoDesignPatterns.html">SanFranciscoDesignPatterns</a> from my bookshelf and wondered what had happened to the project. --<a href="MichaelSchuerig.html">MichaelSchuerig</a>

        Sometimes over ambition generates good ideas.  <a href="SanFranciscoDesignPatterns.html">SanFranciscoDesignPatterns</a> is a great (if dense) book, with lots of advice in designing complex object oriented business systems.
