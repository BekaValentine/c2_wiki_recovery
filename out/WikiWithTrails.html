        Wiki With Trails
      </h1>
      <p>
        (Proposed by <a href="SteveHowell.html">SteveHowell</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are supporting a product, you can put user documentation on a wiki, so that all of your advanced users can easily modify inaccuracies and add elaborations upon more subtle concepts of your product.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, new users need to have their hand held when they go through the documentation. The Sun Java documentation has a notion of trails, which I think should be supported on certain wikis. You should be able to write a wiki page that acts as a <a href="TrailPage.html">TrailPage</a>, and if the trail becomes enabled, all pages on that trail show the trail table-of-contents in a left hand pane, as well as previous/next links. Most new users would move sequentially through your trail, although all other wiki navigation mechanisms would still work as per normal.
      </p>
      <p>
        You should be able to turn off the trail mechanism if you are surfing in more of a <a href="WikiWalking.html">WikiWalking</a> sort of mode. Any page could be made into a <a href="TrailPage.html">TrailPage</a> at any time by adding a <a href="TrailPage.html">TrailPage</a> tag to the top. Any time you visit a <a href="TrailPage.html">TrailPage</a>, you should be able to make its trail be the current trail.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most trail pages would specifically advertise themselves as trail pages, and they would consist of a bullet list of links with some text underneath. But, the only true requirement for being a trail page is that you contain the <a href="TrailPage.html">TrailPage</a> tag and at least two <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> in a bulleted list somewhere on the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        There should be a many-to-many relationship between trail pages and trailee pages.
      </p>

      <p>
        Let's say there was a wiki with the following pages:
      </p>
      <code>
        AdvancedDataStructures<br/>
        HowToProgramInCee<br/>
        HowToProgramInJava<br/>
        HowToProgramInCpp<br/>
        HowToProgram<br/>
        HowToFindaJob<br/>
        WhereToFindCoolJavaJobs<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        One user might make a GetaJavaJobTrail:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="TrailPage.html">TrailPage</a><br/>
        HowToProgramInJava<br/>
        HowToFindaJob<br/>
        WhereToFindCoolJavaJobs<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Another user might make a BecomeVersatileProgrammerTrail:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="TrailPage.html">TrailPage</a><br/>
        HowToProgram<br/>
        HowToProgramInCee<br/>
        HowToProgramInCpp<br/>
        HowToProgramInJava<br/>
        AdvancedDataStructures<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Possible Implementation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are random bits of pseudocode that would implement a trail scheme as described above.
      </p>
      <code>
        if page_served contains <a href="TrailPage.html">TrailPage</a> tag<br/>
        all <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> on own bulleted line get put into numbered list<br/>
        store trail cookie to user<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        when serving page<br/>
        do-normal-page-stuff<br/>
        if user-has-cookie-for-trail and <br/>
        our page is on trail (<em>prolly just read Trail page, could be cached</em>)<br/>
        then<br/>
        add-trail-stuff-in-left-pane<br/>
        endif <br/>
      </code>

        Steve,

      <p>
        Isn't this is sorta implemented in <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a>? The page holder feature allows me to load <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> in the left hand panel and every link I click on opens the page in the right hand panel. It could also be done with *gasp* frames (which has been deprecated for how many centuries??).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I didn't know about the MS feature, but it sounds somewhat similar to what I want. I'm anti-frames too.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course this doesn't help the people with other browsers, so I'm in support of your trail concept. If I can help out, let me know. ~SO. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Like your idea of creating trails for particular interests. In a perfect world, <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> is supposed to do that, but any active topic never seems to get to <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not sure I see the connection.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's just that when pages get popular, <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> is the result. It's only after the thread calms down that a <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> distills it to <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>. For example, the exchange below. It was threadmode, but now it's closer to a <a href="WikiTrail.html">WikiTrail</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proposed names for trail pages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           HappyTrails (whimsical)
        </li>
        <li>
           CategoryTrails (*yawn*)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How about 'Rhizomes'?
        </li>
      </ul>

        I was doing this over at zwiki.org but gave it up.

        The new <a href="http://zwiki.org/WikiLine">http://zwiki.org/WikiLine</a> is related, any thoughts ? --<a href="SimonMichael.html">SimonMichael</a>

        The idea is fine but, to me, the terminology is a little confusing: a trail is, for me, something I leave behind (e.g. trail of bread crumbs to find way out of the woods, string to find way out of the maze). Within the context of other wikis (e.g. <a href="OpenWiki.html">OpenWiki</a>) it's also pages visited. Is your idea of a trail different than a <a href="RoadMap.html">RoadMap</a> - places to go and see (not where you've been)? Sounds the same, but perhaps with on/off mode?
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the trail (visited) as you can jump right back to a topic without repeatedly hitting the back-button. I love the idea of <a href="RoadMaps.html">RoadMaps</a> as they provide hand-holding for newbies (and aid navigation for oldies :). The <a href="RoadMap.html">RoadMap</a> - constructed by people for the good of others - can easily provide multiple views (domains?) of the same chunks of information/knowledge which is nice too. Kind of like <a href="TopicMaps.html">TopicMaps</a>, but simpler.

        The term trail is right (if I understand what is being proposed).
      </p>
      <p>
        A trail to me means the path worn by others when traveling over open land -- an urban park, a mountain trail. By moving over the same ground, the trail becomes stronger. Jumping off the trail and taking or making another path is still an option.
