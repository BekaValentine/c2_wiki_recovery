        Use Prototypes To Challenge Assumptions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Prototypes are very indicative of what a function/method/object
        does. A good programmer can scan quickly an object definition
        and its methods in prototype form and discover if it fits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at prototypes encourages people to think in terms
        of encapsulation. Basically the question being asked is
        "Does this method need any more or less information to give me
        this result?". If the answer is yes then there is a design
        error in the method, its object or somewhere else.

        I (<a href="EwanBirney.html">EwanBirney</a>) personally like the IDL language for quick
        prototype check, using <a href="DesignInIdl.html">DesignInIdl</a> even though I rarely use CORBA (IDL's main
        implementing system) in real life
