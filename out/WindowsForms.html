        Windows Forms

      <p>
        <em>Windows Forms</em> is the name of the part of the <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> framework (and <a href="DotNetCompactFramework.html">DotNetCompactFramework</a>) that supports implementation of rich GUI applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contrast with <a href="MicrosoftWebForm.html">MicrosoftWebForm</a>.

        An example of <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a> creation, in sample chapter at <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/sampchap/6702.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/mspress/books/sampchap/6702.asp</a>

        It appears <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a> is not used much amongst the <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> community. Its predecessor, client server applications, is still viewed to be a better implementation option where it is appropriate to have "rich client" applications. Perhaps this is related to the fact that the <a href="MicrosoftOffice.html">MicrosoftOffice</a> software components that are being used do not themselves integrate well with <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>. <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a>.

        As for the future, there are already remarks in the publications that with <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a> looming over the horizon, todays <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a> application will be so different in a Avalon ExtensibleApplicationMarkupLanguage based world that <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a> are themselves a legacy liability.
      </p>
      <p>
        As at end 2004, two years after official launch of <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>, uptake of <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a> has not been as spectacular as <a href="MicrosoftWebForm.html">MicrosoftWebForm</a>, possibly due to the fact most workstation software (including MS own office products that are in use) are still operating within the unmanaged <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a> world. And the fact that the development environment for <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> has not yet caught up with the likes of <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the case of <a href="VbDotNet.html">VbDotNet</a>, in 2005 it will be much closer to <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> in convenience, as expected in the upcoming <a href="VisualStudioWhidbey.html">VisualStudioWhidbey</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        A little known (or used) aspect of <a href="WindowsForms.html">WindowsForms</a> is that there are ZeroDeployment options (via web) aimed to minimize problematic software upgrade process. However this needs to be balanced with increased security provisions which adds complexities to such undertaking.
