        Result Object Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        A pattern for <a href="ResultObject.html">ResultObject</a> from <a href="JamesNoble.html">JamesNoble</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a computation which returns a complex or important
        result. How can you best store and manage this result?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a long or important computation, performed by a server
        object, and you wish to retain the results of the computation. Perhaps
        the computation returns more than one object, or the result is needed
        several times or at several places throughout the program. Perhaps you
        need to keep information about how the result was obtained, or wish to
        avoid the  cost of recalculation.
      </p>
      <p>
        One possible technique to do this is to use lazy initialisation within
        the server object that calculates the result.  The server is given an
        extra variable into which the result can be cached after it is
        calculated. When the result is again required, it can be fetched from
        the cache variable. More cache variables can be used to return
        multiple objects or provide additional information about the result. A
        great advantage of lazy initialisation is that it only affects the
        server's implementation: the server's protocol is unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using lazy initialisation to manage results also has several problems.
        It reduces the cohesion of the server, since the server must now store
        the calculation as well as compute it, and also increases coupling,
        since the result cannot be used independently of the server.  This
        will increase the size and complexity of the server, especially if
        multiple objects must be cached. Finally, multiple independent results
        cannot be handled by lazy initialisation, unless the server has some
        way to provide access to more than one cached result.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong> Make a new object to package up the entire result of
        the computation. Make one instance variable in the <a href="ResultObject.html">ResultObject</a> for
        each value to be returned. If additional information about the result
        is required, store this in the <a href="ResultObject.html">ResultObject</a> also.  Provide the usual
        accessor messages so that this information can be retrieved from the
        <a href="ResultObject.html">ResultObject</a>.  Modify the server to create and return a <a href="ResultObject.html">ResultObject</a>,
        and the server's clients to retrieve the results out of the
        <a href="ResultObject.html">ResultObject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this pattern introduces a dynamically created object into the
        program, which may increase memory consumption and reduce execution
        speed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A Metric_calculator object for calculating software metrics
        provided the following protocol:
      </p>
      <code>
        m := Metric_calculator computeMetricsFor: anObject.<br/>
        m sizeOfProtocol.<br/>
        m numberOfInheritedMethods.<br/>
        m numberOfOverriddenMethods.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The <strong>computeMetricsFor</strong> method initialises the calculator, and
        the subsequent methods traverse the object's inheritance hierarchy and
        compute metrics. As originally implemented, the traversal was done
        whenever an individual metric was required, and repeated should the
        result be needed again. Since each metric requires exactly the same
        traversal of the inheritance hierarchy, this is in fact a single
        computation returning multiple results --- the various different
        metrics.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be simplified by introducing a <a href="ResultObject.html">ResultObject</a>. All the metrics
        can be calculated in one traversal, and a <a href="ResultObject.html">ResultObject</a> (called a
        <em>Metric_report</em>) returned. Individual metric values can be retrieved
        from the Metric_report).
      </p>
      <code>
        metricReport := Metric_calculator computeMetricsFor: anObject<br/>
        "now returns a metricReport"<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        metricReport sizeOfInterface<br/>
        metricReport numberOfInheritedMethods<br/>
        metricReport numberOfOverriddenMethods<br/>
      </code>

        <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> includes Systemerror objects, package together return both
        error codes and identifying parameters from external errors in the
        system. The <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> Reference Manual describes how objects can be used to
        return multiple values from message sends.
