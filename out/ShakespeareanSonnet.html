      <p>
        Poetic form, also known as "English sonnet", consisting of fourteen lines in iambic pentameter rhyming <em>abab cdcd efef gg</em>. Typically, a poet will introduce some subject in the first quatrain, develop it in the second and third, then reply to it in the final couplet.

        <strong>Sonnet CXXXVIII</strong>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>When my love swears that she is made of truth</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>I do believe her, though I know she lies,</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>That she might think me some untutor'd youth,</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Although she knows my days are past the best,</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>But wherefore says she not she is unjust?</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>And wherefore say not I that I am old?      </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,   </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>And age in love loves not to have years told:</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	 </dt>
        <dd>Therefore I lie with her and she with me,       </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>	 </dt>
        <dd>And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.</dd>

        This is somewhat similar to the Japanese <a href="RenGa.html">RenGa</a> form, where a series of poems are linked together, starting with a 5/7/5 syllable poem, followed by a 7/7 syllable poem, replied to by a 5/7/5 poem. This last is the origin of the <a href="HaiKu.html">HaiKu</a> form.

        The term <em>sonnet</em> came into English via Italian from the Proven√ßal <em>sonet,</em> a little poem, from <em>son</em> song, from Latin <em>sonus</em> a sound.
