        Kernel Language

        The most notable difference between Kernel and other Lisps is that it unifies functions and macros through the mechanism of <em>fexprs</em> (which see <a href="RuntimeMacro.html">RuntimeMacro</a>.)

           I've never heard this phrased used to refer to such.  I've always heard it expressed as the "core language".  That being said, I <em>have</em> heard <a href="KernelLanguage.html">KernelLanguage</a> used to describe any programming language usable for writing an OS kernel (e.g., C). --SamuelFalvo

           <em>Ah, well, I guess it's some sort of educational colloquialism.  I've only ever heard it called the 'kernel language' or 'kernel of the language', as in "the Scheme kernel language".  Within my own memory, the languages suitable for programming </em><a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> kernels has been termed a 'systems programming language'.<em></em>
