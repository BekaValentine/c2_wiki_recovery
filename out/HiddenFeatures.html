        Hidden Features
      </h1>
      <p>
        Important and useful features/capabilities of a system that are available only if you know the secret code. Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In MS Excel (at least through '98), F4 changes a cell reference from relative to absolute, cycling though all four possibilities. I have never found a menu entry or tool bar icon to invoke this action, and finding the process in the Help file is difficult. (As I recall, it is listed only under the topic that describes the actions of all function keys.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Also in MS Excel, the powerful and useful array formula is hidden away unless you learn the <a href="ExcelCtrlEnterSecretHandshake.html">ExcelCtrlEnterSecretHandshake</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           To see just the most recent change to a wiki page, click on the date of that change at the bottom of the page or click on the time since the change as reported in <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>. A neat and useful feature but hardly an intuitive user interface, or one that is documented in an obvious place. Both link to <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           To see the links to a page, click on the title. <em>Everybody knows about this, but it's not at all intuitive, and it took me ages to discover. -- </em><a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a><em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
