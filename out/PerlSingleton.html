        Perl Singleton
      </h1>
      <p>
        By convention, a Perl5 class's constructor is typically written to create a new object by blessing a new anonymous hash (or other reference). (Smalltalkers will note the similarity between <em>bless</em> and a one-way <em>#become:</em>) Objects created in this manner are distinct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Arranging to create and return a singleton object is straightforward: bless an object when the constructor (e.g. <em>new</em>) is first invoked, remember that object, and hand it out on subsequent invocations of the constructor.
      </p>
      <code>
        [Singleton.pm]<br/>
        package Singleton;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        my $singleton;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        sub new {<br/>
        my $class = shift;<br/>
        $singleton ||= bless {}, $class;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        [foo.pl]<br/>
        require Singleton;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        my $object1 = new Singleton;<br/>
        my $object2 = new Singleton;	# same object!<br/>
      </code>
      <p>

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Yet another way (I won't claim this is better, but it avoids any extra logic on subsequent calls to new):
      </p>
      <code>
        package Foo;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        sub new {<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
          new = \&old;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        $Foo::bar = bless {}, shift;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        sub old {<br/>
        $Foo::bar;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        An alternative is to exploit the feature that perl classes are just namespaces (i.e. packages) with functions in them. Since every namespace is automatically unique in a perl program, it can be a singleton object itself. In this case, the "object" is the name of the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like so:
      </p>
      <code>
        my $sngl = 'Some::Singleton::Class';<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        $sngl->foo;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        as long as that subroutine exists in that package, everything works fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are, of course, ways to wrap this approach in an abstraction that makes it look like normal (blessed-ref) object usage.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        [Perl punctuation commentary follows]
      </p>
      <p>
        The ||= operator is a handy lazy assignment operator which evaluates the rhs and assigns it to the lhs if and only if the lhs evaluates as false.
      </p>
      <p>
        (The only "problem" is that || tests for truth, not definedness. However, references are always true, so there is no problem in this case.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So equivalent long-hand notations include:
      </p>
      <code>
        $singleton = bless {}, $class  unless $singleton;<br/>
        $singleton or $singleton = bless {}, $class;<br/>
        $singleton = $singleton ? $singleton : bless {}, $class; <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Using these longer forms, you can test for definedness explicitly.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, <a href="ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt.html">ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt</a>... but consider that
        ||= gives the lowest <a href="PerlGolf.html">PerlGolf</a> score ;-).
      </p>
      <p>
        And since perl 5.9.0, you can use //= to test the definedness.
      </p>

        I do something like this now:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <a href="ClassName.html">ClassName</a>::ClassSingleton() for access to a single instance of the class.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ClassName.html">ClassName</a>::Singleton(primary key) to get a cached version or create an object
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        and then cache it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find these idioms easy and obvious. Being too clever isn't a win.
      </p>

        I find that "new" is inappropriate in a singleton API.  My view is that you
        should not call a constructor, but instead a getInstance () method.  That way,
        it's lucid in your client code that indeed you're dealing with a singleton.  It
        will help you avoid hours of searching when you're wondering why several "new"
        objects are not really new at all.
