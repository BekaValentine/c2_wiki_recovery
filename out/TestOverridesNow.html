        Test Overrides Now
      </h1>
      <p>
        A typical <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> establishes some known initial conditions (by creating objects with known values), executes a method with known parameters, and checks whether return values and side effects match expectations.  But what happens when the method uses the system date and time?
      </p>
      <p>
        Some Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How many days in a pay period?
        </li>
        <li>
           Which accounts are overdue?
        </li>
        <li>
           Has the credit card expired?
        </li>
        <li>
           What is the sale price today?
        </li>
        <li>
           How many days was the video rented?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One would like to control the system date and time during testing to test with a known time (or more typically several known times).  However, each method that needs the current time executes system.timeNow (names vary with language). This will to <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> by letting the system code do it <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>,
        but allows no control over the value of <em>now.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (Also see the <a href="VirtualClock.html">VirtualClock</a> test pattern.)

        Some ways that the <a href="TestOverridesNow.html">TestOverridesNow</a> are ...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Objection:</strong>
        Having all your code call one "current time" function that you write <strong>does not</strong> violate <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, as the system's "current time" function does not implement the required "override the clock" testing functionality.
        So, implement a "system.localTimeNow" that returns a certain preset time in certain testing situations, or otherwise calls system.timeNow.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Note that the answers will change if the input (i.e. date) changes. Therefore don't change the input.  Therefore don't override now. Have a method accountsOverdueOn: aDate and test that on a known date, thusly:
      </p>
      <code>
        accountsOverdueOn: aDate<br/>
        ^accounts select: [ :each | each overdueOn: aDate]<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        accountsOverdueToday<br/>
        ^self accountsOverdueOn: Date today<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The need to test accountsOverdueToday is, um, limited.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Tests that work with dates (and code in general) should almost never reference "now". Exceptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Filling in default values in a user interface
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        From: <a href="TestPrintedOutput.html">TestPrintedOutput</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the contrary. In most cases, to test with known values, the input dates must in fact NOT change.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you give an example of this?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Why not just pass in the test date as a parameter rather than getting the system date internally?  This not only makes the routine easier to test but makes for a more general method as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one must leave the system date internal to the method, then test by varying one's input date.  One can test with System Date - 1 day, System Date, System Date + 1 day, etc.
      </p>

        Or change the system clock. What, you run tests as a limited user? <a href="HaHaOnlySerious.html">HaHaOnlySerious</a>
