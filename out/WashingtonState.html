        Washington State
      </h1>
      <p>
        Once upon a time, God was missing for six days. Eventually, Michael the Archangel found him, resting on the seventh day.
      </p>
      <p>
        He inquired of God. "Where have you been?"
      </p>
      <p>
        God sighed a deep sigh of satisfaction, and proudly pointed downwards through the clouds, "Look, Michael. Look what I've made."
      </p>
      <p>
        Archangel Michael looked puzzled, and said, "What is it?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "It's a planet," replied God, "and I've put Life on it. I'm going to call it Earth and it's going to be a great place of balance."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Balance?" Inquired Michael, still confused. God explained, pointing to different parts of earth...
      </p>
      <p>
        "For example, northern Europe will be a place of great opportunity and wealth, while southern Europe is going to be poor. Over there I've placed a continent of yellow people, and over there is a continent of black people."
      </p>
      <p>
        God continued pointing to different countries. "This one will be extremely hot, while this one will be very cold and covered in ice."
      </p>
      <p>
        The Archangel, impressed by God's work, then pointed to a land mass and said, "What's that one?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Ah," said God.. "That's Washington State. The most glorious place on earth. There are beautiful streams, hills, and forests...the people from Washington State are going to be handsome, modest, intelligent and humorous, and they are going to be found traveling the world. They will be extremely sociable, hardworking, and high-achieving, and they will be known throughout the world -- as diplomats, and carriers of peace."
      </p>
      <p>
        Michael gasped in wonder and admiration, but then proclaimed, "What about balance, God? You said there would be balance!"
      </p>
      <p>
        God smiled, "Wait until you see the idiots I put in the other Washington."
