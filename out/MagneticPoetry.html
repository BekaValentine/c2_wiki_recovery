        Magnetic Poetry
      </h1>
      <p>
        We're creating a group poem at work. You are assigned a day of the month and on your day, it's your turn to add a line to the poem. You can use the words that we've accumulated, or you can make your own word by rubbing letters onto blank magnetic strips.
        <em>Why magnetic?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Magnetic words just add another dimension of fun to writing.  They attract some people who have adverse reactions to poetry per se, but become mildly interested in the challenge of making something meaningful from an assortment of single words put in front of them.

        This is our poem so far . . .

        At my previous employer I had very positive reactions to an idea I called PoetryCorner. Every thursday I would send a poem to the whole department. I tried to pick a wide variety so that there would be something for everyone. Often people would email their reactions to the poem or send back poems that the first poem had reminded them about. On occasion somebody might write something and send it as a reply. It was fun and always upset the stereotypes other departments had about programmers.

        Sounds great as long as you put 'Poem' in the title of the mail message so I can set up an appropriate junk mail filter. :-)
