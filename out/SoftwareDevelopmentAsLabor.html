        Software Development As Labor
      </h1>
      <p>
        Software development has been described elsewhere on this Wiki as craft; that is, the combination of skill and artistry to produce a work of both form and function.
      </p>
      <p>
        What drivel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software development is labor, plain and simple. For every task to be accomplished in software there are numerous ways to go about it. So what if the developer chooses one approach over another? As long as it is <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> you don't need to take it any further. There's no art involved. Just get it to meet all the requirements and then move on to the next task. <em><sigh></em>

        Oh, and collect your paycheck for getting the work done, too.
