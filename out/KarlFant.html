        Karl Fant is the author of two seminal books of potential interest to anyone concerned with the barriers to future progress created by the current paradigm of clocked processors and sequential programming (the <a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a>).  The first, <a href="LogicallyDeterminedDesign.html">LogicallyDeterminedDesign</a>, introduces an innovative clockless logic that removes all concern for timing closure from hardware design.  The second, <a href="ComputerScienceReconsidered.html">ComputerScienceReconsidered</a> (The Invocation Model of Process Expression) presents the new theory of computer science that led to the new logic.  The theory transcends hardware and software, and encompasses all processes ranging from physics to biology to man-made digital computing.  This book concludes with a new concurrent assembly language which has been prototyped in the <a href="IplPackage.html">IplPackage</a>.
