        Filth Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        Imagine a <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> that works like a web page or the <a href="WikiUserInterface.html">WikiUserInterface</a>. Unlike the <a href="WimpInterface.html">WimpInterface</a>, with its windows, menus, icons and programs, which might be a broken idea (See: <a href="WimpIsBroken.html">WimpIsBroken</a>), why not use FILTH instead?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Formatting, Images, Links, Text and Hypermedia. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (Hasn't this already been invented?  <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a>?)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Formatting: </strong> Text formatting, with a cursor and a mouse, highlighting text, a clipboard and a WYSIWYG interface. The user can arbitrarily edit, save, load and delete content generated by programs.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Images: </strong> Pictures, loaded from separate files. Since there are already a wide variety of conveniently available image formats, reinventing the wheel here might be a bad idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Links: </strong> Hyperlinks between pages, locally, globally, and among different programs.  Like in a web browser, there will be certain buttons available to all parts of the system, such as back, forward, reload, save, load, etc.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Text and Hypermedia: </strong> Essentially all other content that the interface despools (<em>displays ?</em>) without thinking too hard, like text, line drawings, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        An operating system with a FILTH interface would have a much shorter learning curve than one with windows, icons, menus and programs, while maintaining a certain degree of usability one expects from computers. Third party software would not look nearly so un-unified (and occasionally ugly) as the stuff available for Xwindows and Microsoft Windows [Can't agree with that. Every looked around in the web? unified looks? nope --TyberiusPrime].

        Well great for some apps.
        But ever tried to just rearrange a list of items in a filth interface?
        No way without adding at least some in page scripting abilities.

        It's filthy all right, and not a significant advance over the <a href="WimpInterface.html">WimpInterface</a>. Some of the stuff (save and load buttons) is just plain wrong. Other stuff (arbitrary editing) is only an insignificant consequence of a much more powerful idea.
      </p>

        It's hard to see what the description above means since even a bullet point listing of features in a GUI would run to several pages. There are more fundamental principles in GUI design than there are features listed above.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, the idea of basing all interfaces on web browsers is old hat. It's also stupid since web browsers have horrible interfaces. The best of the lot, <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a>, is still generations behind what you can cobble together from existing research.
      </p>

        <em>Care to elaborate on "existing research"? Oh, and Opera? Puh-leeeze.</em>

        Look up CHI on the <a href="ResearchIndex.html">ResearchIndex</a>. Twenty minutes' browsing will net you dozens of papers that have investigated <a href="ZoomableUserInterface.html">ZoomableUserInterface</a>s, 3D, and many other concepts.
