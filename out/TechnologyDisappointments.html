        </li>
        <li>
           Inherent design conflict: cars are safer when heavy, yet flying machines should be light (safety vs fuel economy).
          <ul>
            <li>
               SkyCar has best mileage of 20 mpg, SUVs have worst mileage around that.

               Complete computer-control via GPS may be possible (if in large population areas) so that terrorists and drunks cannot take control. However, cracks will be found.

            </li>

               Roads are congested (flying cars don't need them), and parking spaces can be reused.

        The Flying Car is hilariously impractical.
      </p>
      <p>
        A friend once said, "I admire you because you can go up there and fly those things and not every idiot driving around on the freeway can do something like that." An excellent point.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, after an unusual predicament in the air one day, a flight instructor said, "just remember, those same idiots driving down there are flying up here." And thus, it was all put into perspective very quickly.

        <strong>Cheap Nuclear Power</strong> - 50's predication: "will be too cheap to meter"
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Disposal is politically difficult (but compare to the environmental impact of burning fossil fuels).
        </li>
        <li>
           Expensive, as long as there is direct access to low-cost fossil fuels. (<a href="http://www.uic.com.au/nip08.htm)">http://www.uic.com.au/nip08.htm)</a> The marginal costs of nuclear power are lower, but the capital costs are much higher. (The marginal costs are higher if you demand extremely high levels of staff redundancy and security, as has been the case for most of nuclear's history.)
        </li>
        <li>
           High-profile accidents {3-mile Island, Chernobyl, Japan tsunami} involving actively cooled reactor designs have given it a possibly deserved reputation as unsafe, and thus made it politically unpopular.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Note: converted to document mode. The subject is "reasons for possible tardiness" - not the actual merits and flaws of the technology.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ummm...but surely actual flaws in a technology would contribute to tardiness! Surely you're not saying that perception is on topic here, but (claims of) actual reality are off-topic? How can a line be drawn there? I'm open to suggestion if you think there's a way.

However, it's not the default way our phones work and there does not seem to be enough demand to better coordinate that feature among vendors such that it's easy to switch on. Whether it will be one day is hard to say because the momentum seems stuck in a lack-luster state. It may take a catchy ad to make people want it enough to trigger vendor results.</em>

        <li>
           There are probably several different "safety mechanisms" that have to be attacked at the same time. Evolution has appearently put in too many back-up mechanisms to make sure we store enough to survive dark days of injury, illness, and Katrina. Who knows, maybe only chubbites will survive armegeddon.

        <strong>Space Travel for the Masses</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Chemical fuel too weighty and too costly
          <ul>
            <li>
               You'd be surprised how small a factor this is
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I dunno, a 15-to-1 fuel-to-payload ratio is quite smelly no matter how you dice it.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               The cost of the fuel is next to nothing all things considered. It's the complexity that kills it.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Perhaps if "for the masses" meant occasional vacation, I would agree. However, living and working in space would still be limited by the costs of chemical fuel even if the other costs were minimized.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Not really. You're using the <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a> that people would commute to space, which is absurd. If people only move back and forth every 3 months, paying a few thousand in fuel costs means nothing.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Still too expensive to make it safe
        </li>
        <li>
           Economic "pushes" for space travel, such as asteroid mining, are not at a profitable level yet.

        <strong>Interstellar Space Travel</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           For a trillion dollars, we may be able to build a multi-generation nuclear-powered ship that would take say 200 years get to the nearest stars. But that is still hardly Star Trek.
          <ul>

        <strong>Cure for Cancer</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cancer seems to be just plain entropy and natural selection (of rogue cells). We would have to find a way to reverse entropy.
          <ul>
            <li>
               The entropy argument makes no sense -- we reduce entropy all the time (within a limited region, by increasing entropy elsewhere).
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Yes, but how is this done at the micro-cellular level?</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Hard to target problem cells since they are almost identical to legitimate cells.
        </li>
        <li>
           No single cause
        </li>
        <li>
           Still only have some broad ideas what causes cancer, new theories are still being developed in the 00s.

        <strong>Cure for the Common Cold</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no "common" cold. Colds are really a variety of viruses.
        </li>
        <li>
           Viruses are too simple and thus far more difficult to break than bacteria without hurting the host.

        <strong>Artificial Intelligence approaching at least Dog Levels</strong>

        <li>
           A much harder problem than originally thought. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               NeuralNetworking is fundamentally orthongonal to conventional computer architecture, and so is slow to simulate.  
            </li>
            <li>
               Hardware implementations are very expensive to build
            </li>
            <li>
               Hardware-power NN is only useful in a very limited problem-space, so there is a ChickeAndEgg problem for the technology.

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Computing power missing - A mammalian brain still has more computing power than what is affordable to most AI labs. Based on current growth rates, portable versions of that power point won't be reached until around 2025.

        <strong>Appliances that Accept Voice Commands</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           People confuse natural language processing with voice recognition; the former requires AI.
        </li>
        <li>
           People don't actually want to communicate to appliances that way.
          <ul>
            <li>
               You need to use the commands often, dozens of times a day, in order to derive any benefit.
            </li>
            <li>
               People may feel silly talking to the drier but if it weren't more fundamental, they'd get over it.

        </li>
        <li>
           It takes 10 years for any innovation to spread, voice recognition has to first get accepted by interface designers and then by consumers, hence 20 years. Yow!

            <li>
               DragonNaturallySpeaking only came out in 1996 so voice recognition is perfectly on track. <em>Please note that Naturally Speaking is a POS that can't capture vocal command input accurately, if at all.

How about MIRACL (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRACL),">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIRACL),</a> just one of the directed energy weapons about which one can actually get published data.

        <strong>Easy-to-Maintain Personal Computers</strong> - Dealing with them is as much of a headache for consumers as owning an automobile.

               This differs from my observation. It's still a heated cat-and-mouse game between hackers and system vendors. The tighter the security, the more intentional applications and add-ons have problems also. Apple is perhaps the closest to the ideal by controlling almost the entire product, but at the cost of freedom and flexibility. I doubt there is a free lunch here, only trade-offs. Consumers often choose dazzle over safety and reliability because that's human nature and partly because they don't know any better.

           Many cars now have an RFID-based lock (but until they have RFID implants, you could still lose the RFID dongle.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               worse, you could lose the dongle in the car structure, leaving you unable to lock the car until the dongle battery fails.

           If you're cheap enough, you can get a car that uses a coathanger for the door lock and a screwdriver for the ignition.  But you then you'd probably want one that needs keys.

          Effectiveness versus lethality varies too much for most Less Lethal systems to be truly effective across the board, and the need for effective stopping power reaches the breakover point of applying lethality in cases where it really matters. For those cases where lethality is not justifiable at all there are other means of applying stopping power, such as brute force or club-type weapons.
