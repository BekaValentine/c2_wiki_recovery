        Php Unit
      </h1>
      <p>
        There is an implementation of <a href="PhpUnit.html">PhpUnit</a> available as part of the PhpPear native libraries found at <a href="http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=38">http://pear.php.net/package-info.php?pacid=38</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The rest of this page concerns a separate implementation.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="PhpUnit.html">PhpUnit</a> is a rudimentary implementation of the <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> in PHP3 [it has since been updated to work with 3 and 4].
        Please see <a href="http://www.ontosys.com/phiki/PhpUnit">http://www.ontosys.com/phiki/PhpUnit</a> for more information.

        I've been extending <a href="PhpUnit.html">PhpUnit</a> over the last several weeks with
        some things I find useful (e.g. compare a URL to a file, show
        a color-coded diff, and let you approve the differences by
        clicking a link).
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone's interested, I can probably clean the code up
        (maybe I <em>should</em> treat test code like production code...)
        and submit it to the CVS archive.  --<a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>

        I think it's a bad idea to put functionality into <a href="PhpUnit.html">PhpUnit</a> that's not directly related to managing and reporting on tests (like making color-coded diffs). This contradicts do-one-thing-and-do-it-well and <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>. The particular case of having to "approve differences" also contradicts <a href="CheckOutputAutomatically.html">CheckOutputAutomatically</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also done a lot of refactoring on <a href="PhpUnit.html">PhpUnit</a>, mainly to make it easier to extend. The main user-visible features are a test profiler, and email- and ascii- test reports. The responsibilities between classes are a bit more cleanly divided, but it breaks the mold of JUnit. I've sent my changes to <a href="FredYankowski.html">FredYankowski</a> for him to include in his version as he sees fit; I'll send them to you too if you ask. --<a href="AdrianKubala.html">AdrianKubala</a>

        Eventually I'm going to stop reading this as PhbUnit.

        (Wish I'd checked on this page sometime in the past six months;
        still, better late than never:)
      </p>
      <p>
        I added functionality to <a href="PhpUnit.html">PhpUnit</a> because I needed it.  I frequently found
        myself making a small change, breaking a few test cases a little bit,
        and having to manually update them.  So I added a "BLESS" feature to one
        of the assert methods: <a href="PhpUnit.html">PhpUnit</a> shows me the failed test's actual and expected output (as usual), and if
        the changes to it are OK, I can just click the "BLESS" link, saving myself
        at least a minute each time.  (Note that I only have to approve tests
        when they FAIL, not every time; I wasn't very clear about this above.)
      </p>
      <p>
        After a while, I got tired of using Emacs to ediff the more complicated
        failed tests, and added some simple color-coding that usually makes it
        obvious what changed.  Again, I did this because it made my life easier.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, I put these things in a subclass of <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>, so whatever mods
        you made to the existing <a href="PhpUnit.html">PhpUnit</a> classes will probably be very easy for
        me to integrate.  We're not getting in each other's way here.
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, have you figured out some intelligent way to simulate
        exceptions in PHP?  Or to get a test to quit once one of its assertions
        fails?  (I haven't thought much about the latter.)

        There seems to be several PHP unit testers all called PHPUnit.
        Is this one still active?

        My PHPUnit (see <a href="http://www.phpunit.de/)">http://www.phpunit.de/)</a> is the most complete xUnit-Port for PHP and very much alive. It is a complete port of JUnit 3.8.1, includes the functionality of junitour and allows for Code Coverage analysis.

        You use Unit testing to help you build and run tests.
        A PHP Test Coverage tool is a very nice complement,
        as it tells you what your tests have tested.
