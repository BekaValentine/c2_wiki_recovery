        Humans never evolved to live in these gigantic cities anyway - only bees and ants are suited to such scales of organization. It was insect-like for we engineers to endlessly reimplement the systems that all the other bees are already buzzing over in the corporation next door. TheTechJobMarketIsAnIllusion.

        Yes. Research it carefully - you're going to have to make a life there. You're looking for a community of people you can relate to and trust. Some middle-American cow town ringed with rusted out cars and trailer parks isn't going to make you a happy camper. Visit as many IntentionalCommunitys as you can before pulling up stakes.

        <a href="TurnOnTuneInDropOut.html">TurnOnTuneInDropOut</a> was coined in 1968 by then Harvard psychologist Timothy Leary, famed for his experiments with and advocacy of LSD. So isn't advocating <a href="TurnOnTuneInDropOut.html">TurnOnTuneInDropOut</a> in an engineering forum the height of irony?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What is advocated on this page has little of necessity to do with Timothy Leary or with LSD or other drugs.  One can move to the countryside without getting stoned; one can just as easily get stoned without moving to the countryside.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even <strong>without</strong> using Leary's phrase, a page advocating this kind of thing in a computer medium is the height of irony. Computers and the Internet depend on a developed-world global infrastructure that could not exist if everyone followed this advice. And I notice that back-to-nature enthusiasts somehow always manage to take e.g. a steel axe along with them. Irony, I say, irony.

Once we have enough brainpower living naturally, we'll start to find other ways to build infrastructure. DNA chips are already on the books.

        Little hick towns are far from Shangri La - they're generally closed-minded centers of ineloquence full of trapped and impoverished folk who dream of something better for their children. You want to be part of a community like that, you better get ready to lower your expectations.

        I've lived in towns and cities of varying sizes, and more people does not equal a guarantee for social interaction. Social activity is found wherever you look for it, and whether or not you feel you've found it is completely up to personal preference.  --<a href="DanielSherman.html">DanielSherman</a>

        Small towns generally foster <em>more</em> social interaction than do large cities.  Whenever I've lived in urban areas, I've noticed that the only social interaction is a friendly-but-empty "Hi" when I pass my neighbors in the parking lot.  "Don't smile" and "avoid eye contact" are the principal social rules in large cities.  --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        Scott has exposed the fallacy behind Leary's 3 commandments.  The social structures, institutions, organizations, etc. that we find ourselves in weren't imposed by any external force. They aren't "unnatural". People continually choose to TuneOutTurnOffDropIn because they like to.  They may bitch about the unexpected consequences and some minority would be happier living another way, but most humans seek the comforts of large scale social hierarchies.  If the entire population of the earth turned on, tuned in and dropped out we'd just rebuild the same crap in less than a generation.  -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        Bingo.  Of course, some folks (not necessarily the authors of the above) seem convinced, come hell or high water, that the HumanCondition <strong>was</strong> imposed by an external force, and is therefore unnatural.  (See <a href="GrandConspiracy.html">GrandConspiracy</a>).  And that those of us who aren't clever enough to recognize this are by definition fools
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To be a bee in a hive, a cog in a machine, an engineer in a cubicle, - is that really all you're capable of? No one here has suggested any </em><a href="GrandConspiracy.html">GrandConspiracy</a> that forces you to live the life you do. And this page isn't calling anyone a fool. It's simply saying there are very pleasant and productive ways to live outside of the <a href="HumanHive.html">HumanHive</a>. That there is a way out, and a big beautiful world outside. That you can go live there when you get tired of doing what you're told. Doing what you're told isn't foolish. It's natural.<em></em>

      <p>
        I'd much rather be programming in a cubicle than a farmer.  I've worked on a farm (as have my parents, grandparents, etc.) and all of us have busted our humps to make sure we don't have to do that for a living.  It can be fun on the weekends and a nice place to retire, but living on what you grow is boring and exhausting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Certainly farming for a living is the pits, one of the most brutal ways to exist that you can choose. But farming for a living isn't what's being proposed on this page. Keep engineering for a living, or whatever else it is you like to do. Just get debt/attachment free and go some place where you're not packed in like sardines.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Without large scale social organization we all have to farm to survive.  Moving your laptop to a rural community isn't dropping out, it's just relocating.  You're still using power generated by large power companies consuming resources and funded by municipal bonds traded on bond markets.  You have to buy the laptop from a manufacturer that employs busy bees and uses chips made in factories that pollute rivers.  That satellite dish doesn't do anything without a satellite, the companies that made it, the rockets that lifted it, the companies that made the rockets (who also probably make ICBMs and other implements of war), etc.  Or is this page merely advocating myopia?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You can enjoy all the products of the hive without living inside it. That's not myopia. It's perspective. And once outside you can look at what's possible rather than just what exists now. The fact is the oil is running out, the infrastructure is coming apart, and even the folk in power forsee the end of the way things are now. We've got to change the way we maintain our civilization away from all the pollution and dehumanization. Humans have made bigger jumps in the past. It just takes guts and brains and a tangible need.

      <p>
        I'm capable of whatever I set my mind and body to.  However, I derive my satisfaction in life from activites outside of work; not from what I do in the office.  I'm fortunate in that my job is enjoyable, pays well, and has reasonable hours--but it is certainly not the MeaningOfMyLife.

      <p>
        It's also telling me that if I choose not to exercise that way out, then I'm a "bee in a hive", etc.  Buzz.  In other words, it seems to be suggesting that there is something wrong with me should I choose <em>not</em> to <a href="TurnOnTuneInDropOut.html">TurnOnTuneInDropOut</a>; and that moving to the hills with the laptop in tow is the only <em>true</em> way to find happiness; all else is inferior.

        Of course, you can feel free to move to the countryside if you want to, and congratulate yourself (publicly) on your newly-found independence.

        People didn't start off in giant cities, but people didn't exactly start off with advanced technology or open social orders, and the two have developed somewhat hand in hand.  However, there have been several radical approaches to urban planning in the last few centuries, and they've had notably different results.  How many of the problems noted here are associated with living in cities, and how many are associated with living in broken cities?
