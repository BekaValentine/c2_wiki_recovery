      <p>
        <em>The Commonwealth</em> is a large international organization that includes many former and current British colonies as well as the 15 <a href="CommonwealthRealms.html">CommonwealthRealms</a>. Only the Realms and colonies recognize the Queen of England as their head of state. The Commonwealth's republican members, such as <a href="IndiaCountry.html">IndiaCountry</a> and SouthAfrica merely observe the Queen as the Head of the Commonwealth, a ceremonial figure who holds no political power over their nation.
