        Turninga Wiki Intoa Structured Cms
      </h1>
      <p>
        (db) There have been, over the years, very few attempts at turning wikis into structured CMSs with regular table of contents and chapters or sections. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Can it be done? Surely but this can be only done with wiki engines that allow for group implementations. As far as I know, only two wikis have the group feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="UseMod.html">UseMod</a> wiki. See: <a href="http://usemod.com">http://usemod.com</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               A CMS implementation can be found at: <a href="http://spookydistance.com/cgi-bin/public-wiki.pl?Starting_Points">http://spookydistance.com/cgi-bin/public-wiki.pl?Starting_Points</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           PMwiki. See: <a href="http://pmwiki.org">http://pmwiki.org</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A CMS, almost by definition, needs to maintain a clear outline and a rigid organization of its concepts. Therefore, not any wiki engine will do.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I don't see this.  Why does a </em><a href="ContentManagementSystem.html">ContentManagementSystem</a> have to have a rigid organisation of its concepts? Why can't it be more like Google, and allow complex, free-form searches?  By definition a CMS has to manage its content, but that does not of itself imply rigid organisation, nor clear outline.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anyone know of wikis that operate like CMSs? Is a wiki engine really fit to run a CMS?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="AtlassianConfluence.html">AtlassianConfluence</a> has <a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a>s and page hierarchies. <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> has page categories (it also has namespaces but they have a more administrative role).<em></em>
      </p>

        <a href="WiKi.html">WiKi</a>, a powerful mind,if the CmsViaWiki comes,a different era,I think.
