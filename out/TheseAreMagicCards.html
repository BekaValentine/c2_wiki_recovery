        These Are Magic Cards
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s "These are magic cards" speech:
      </p>
      <p>
        These are magic cards. They have the magic power that anything you
        write on them will come true.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are a couple of rules about what you can write on the cards.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It has to be testable.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It has to be something that can be created in less than a week.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Now, don't worry, if you write something on it that's not testable,
        we'll tell you, and we can figure out something similar that *is*
        testable. And if you write down something that's too big, we'll tell
        you that too, and help you break it down into smaller parts.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Then the rest of the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>... Desire is
        limitless, but resources are finite, so we have to prioritize the
        cards... After a week, we can count the number of cards we did, and
        then we know exactly how many cards we'll get done next week... and so
        on.]

        Kent, how'd I do?)
