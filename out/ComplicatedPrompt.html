        Complicated Prompt
      </h1>
      <p>
        The BashShell provides zillions of ways to customize your prompt.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a> uses this prompt -- the prompt is shown both before and after the code that creates it:
      </p>
      <code>
        # 00:55:43 garrod@humu 1.74 $ cd ~ && grep ' 'PS .profile<br/>
        # yyp!!grep PS ~/.profile<br/>
        # PS is the prompt string, and can be customized a zillion ways<br/>
        PS1="\n"	# PS1 is the most commonly seen prompt is PS1 see man bash<br/>
        PS1="$PS1#"	# Make accidentally pasted lines comments<br/>
        PS1="$PS1$tickenv"	# w/TicketNo<br/>
        PS1="$PS1 \t" # the current time<br/>
        PS1="$PS1 \u" # the username<br/>
        PS1="$PS1@"	# the at sign (we're building an email address here)<br/>
        PS1="$PS1\h"  # the host name<br/>
        PS1="$PS1 `/bin/basename $tty <em> 2>/dev/null||/usr/bin/basename $tty </em>`" <br/>
        PS1="$PS1."	# separate tty from command number<br/>
        PS1="$PS1\#"  # command line number in history<br/>
        PS1="$PS1 \\$"	# This is a dollar sign for normal use or a # when superusered<br/>
        PS1="$PS1 cd" # make it paste cleaner<br/>
        PS1="$PS1 \w" # the working directory - bracketed by space for cut/paste<br/>
        PS1="$PS1 &&" # make it paste cleaner across multiple windows and hosts<br/>
        PS1="$PS1 "	# make it paste cleaner<br/>
        PS2="	"	# wait to close quotes or compound statement (paste it!)<br/>
        PS3="Pick a number:	"	# try: select name in *;do echo $name;done<br/>
        alias PS="grep PS ~/$DotFile"<br/>
        export PS1 PS2 PS3<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        # 00:56:03 garrod@humu 1.75 $ cd ~ && <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        My favorite features are that inadvertant pastings of screen scrapes make prompting lines comments. 
        The string in PS2 is actually a tab, so the whole continued command can be pasted elsewhere for future use.  
        And having the <strong>cd</strong> to the current working directory followed by <strong>&&</strong> (if it worked do the rest) and then the current command I have typed.
        There's also a blank line separating the output of the previous command from the prompt
      </p>
      <p>
        PS3 is something I rarely use, so it's comment has a paster for me to try
      </p>
      <p>
        The final result of the above code looks like this for my PS1, the primary prompt string
      </p>
      <code>
        PS1=\n# \t \u@\h 1.\# \$ cd \w &&<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Years later, my prompt has evolved.  Today it looks like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        # 20130415.232138 garrod@MinnieTheMoocher ttys000.1 $ cd ~ && echo $PS1<br/>
        \n# \D{%Y%m%d.%H%M%S} \u@\h ttys000.\# \$ cd \w &&<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        # 20130415.232155 garrod@MinnieTheMoocher ttys000.2 $ cd ~ && <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I use multiple Terminal windows on my Mac, so it helps to know which one I'm looking at just by the prompt.  
        The first floating point number is a <a href="DateStamp.html">DateStamp</a>.<a href="TimeStamp.html">TimeStamp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's my prompt.  What's yours? -- <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a>

        "Freeware" sometimes tries to trick people into installing crapware with prompts that resemble:
