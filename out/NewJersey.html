        Why does California have so many lawyers and <a href="NewJersey.html">NewJersey</a> so many toxic waste dumps?  <a href="NewJersey.html">NewJersey</a> chose first.

        In Dick Gabriel's famous "<a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>" paper, the <em>New Jersey style</em> of software design (make it easy to implement and efficient, and if you can make it elegant and easy to use and robust that's a nice bonus) is contrasted with the <em>MIT</em> style (make it easy to use, reliable, consistent, and generally the Right Thing, even if that makes it hard to implement); Gabriel's partly-serious claim is that the New Jersey style is better because when you do things that way your system gets used more widely and then gets improved until it's nearly as good as it would have been if you'd made it the Right Thing and no one else had ever used it. :-)
