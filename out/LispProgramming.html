        Lisp Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Lisp Programming is in fact a complicated culture grown around one of the famous programming languages, Lisp. It includes lots of different things including hi-order functions, closures etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And there's also a heresy which claims that Lisp is about S-expressions, not functions; that is, the primary point is that Lisp operates on lists (or objects) combined of arbitrary-typed datums.

        <em>This is potentially an interesting topic, but the above is not yet "content" IMHO, so unless there's more to be said, it seems to me that this page is in risk of being a deletion candidate.</em>

        Sandewall wrote an insightful article "Programming in an Interactive Environment: the 'Lisp' Experience", in the '70s. One thing he does is step deliberately through an example where he builds an appointment/calendar system in Interlisp.

        <em>Perhaps it should be changed for CL and posted here. There is also a calendrical calculations book out there which uses lisp, and in the coming months someone is planning to release a free library for these calculations.</em>

        BTW, it is possible to do <a href="LispProgramming.html">LispProgramming</a> without the Lisp Language itself, as <a href="InteLib.html">InteLib</a> proves.
