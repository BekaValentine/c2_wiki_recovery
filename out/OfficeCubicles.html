        Office Cubicles
      </h1>
      <p>
        Office buildings tend to have huge areas which are sectioned off into smaller areas by use of <a href="FuzzyPartitions.html">FuzzyPartitions</a> which form the walls of the cubicle. These cubicles are generally designed for use by a single employee. The cubicle will generally contain a desk, chair, telephone, and computer. There cubicle walls are generally 4 to 6 feet high and with no door.

        Some claimed benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Modular design allows for new floor plans to be easily implemented. (Has anyone actually seen this happen?) Yes, I witnessed several reoganizational shufflings. Having solid walls did not stop the reorganization to cause the redesign of several rooms into offices.
        </li>
        <li>
           Small amount of privacy afforded to workers (though phone calls and other activities are still open to witnesses.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Allows for easier communication between workers.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Some claimed problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Noise easily distracts and breaks concentration. Programmers need concentration to work.
        </li>
        <li>
           Allows for easier communication between workers (see noise.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Cubicle walls block natural light. Lack of natural light may contribute to depression.
        </li>
        <li>
           Cubicle size and location may become the subject of envy, rumours and politicking.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        As cubicles offer a uniform environment, some offices pale at the idea of employees embelishing their cubicles with their individual tastes and employ <a href="FurniturePolice.html">FurniturePolice</a> to keep things like decoration of the cubicles to a minimum or within corporate specs.
