Symptoms include mental flashes of "okay . . . wait. . . now is bit 3 a value of 4, do I mask it or check to see if it's equal. . . <aaaarrggghg>"

        Been there, done that.  What the above doesn't mention is that the "okay . . . now is bit 3 a value . . ." bit occurs during things which normally have nothing to do with hex dumps.  Writing out a time sheet, for instance, or deciding which road to take home.
