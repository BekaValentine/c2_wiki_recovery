        A mathematician, a physicist, an engineer, and a computer programmer were each asked to "prove" that all odd numbers are prime.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mathematician says, "The principle of mathematical induction says that if something is true for the first n, and if being true for n makes that thing true for the next n, then that thing is true for all n. Three is a prime, and that's n. 5 is a prime, and that's the next n, so therefore, by induction, all odd numbers are prime."
      </p>
      <p>
        The physicist says, "Three's a prime, five's a prime, seven's a prime, nine - let's just throw that one out as experimental error - eleven's a prime, and thirteen's a prime, so empirical evidence suggests that all odd numbers are prime."
      </p>
      <p>
        The engineer says, "Three's a prime, five's a prime, seven's a prime, nine's a prime, eleven's a prime, thirteen's a prime, fifteen's a prime..." He goes on for a while until the other three shut him up.
      </p>
      <p>
        That leaves the computer programmer, who says: 
      </p>
      <code>
        Three's a prime.<br/>
        Five's a prime.<br/>
        Seven's a prime.<br/>
        Seven's a prime.<br/>
        Seven's a prime...<br/>
