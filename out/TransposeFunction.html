        Transpose Function
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="TransposeFunction.html">TransposeFunction</a> takes a collection of columns and returns a collection of rows. The first row consists of the first element from each column. Successive rows are constructed similarly.
      </p>

        In general, the formalism of transposition takes a function of two arguments, f(x,y) and replaces it with a function which takes the same arguments in reversed order.  In formal mathematical terms one interprets a function of many arguments via currying as a function of one argument (the first) returning a (likewise interpreted) function of the rest; so our function of two arguments is
      </p>
      <code>
        f = ( x -> ( y -> f(x,y) ) )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and its transpose is the function
      </p>
      <code>
        ( y -> ( x -> f(x,y) ) )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course, in programming languages, we use various things in ways that formal mathematics can describe as functions; pretty much anything that takes an input (array index, hash key, function parameter list) and produces an output can be construed in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where it comes to collections of collections, we effectively (by iterating over the collections) treat the collections as lists (even if we call them sequences or arrays); so we have a list of lists.  Mathematics happily construes a list as a function from (an initial subset of) the natural numbers; so our list of lists is a function returning functions and we have what we need to apply transposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any time you have a list of lists (or kindred <a href="DataStructure.html">DataStructure</a>) and find yourself having to pass down both the list of lists and a second-level key (i.e. f and y in the above) so that the recipient can supply first level key(s) as appropriate, passing down transpose(f)(y) instead will give a simple function (or list, as appropriate) that the recipient can use simply.

        <em>I </em><a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>, but I shouldn't have had to reinvent it. Anyone know of a good source for patterns of this sort? This is the kind of thing that eventually becomes obvious when you look at certain kinds of problems <strong>long enough</strong>, but it'd be nice to have a shopping list to choose from ahead of time, to borrow some other smart person's analysis of common forms and solutions. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a><em></em>

        See the <a href="TransfoldPattern.html">TransfoldPattern</a> which has an embedded <a href="TransposeFunction.html">TransposeFunction</a>. It is described in the book <a href="FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign.html">FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign</a> and I am currently working on an implementation, described in <a href="ObjectFunctionalImplementation.html">ObjectFunctionalImplementation</a>. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
