        Low Earth Orbit
      </h1>
      <p>
        Geosynchronous (or parking) orbits are at about +/- 22,400 miles up.
      </p>
      <p>
        While this is quite handy for things like TV broadcasting, where a signal doesn't need to make a round trip, it kind of sucks for high-speed interactive communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the good side, once the object is in place, little additional attention is required to keep it on station or, more importantly, to track it in the sky.  <em>A significant fraction of the mass of most geosynchronous satellites is dedicated to station-keeping fuel.  Before the XIPS </em><a href="IonThruster.html">IonThruster</a>, this fraction was roughly 1/4 to 1/2, for satellites with a 20 year useful life.  The XIPS <a href="IonThruster.html">IonThruster</a> reduced this fraction to 2% - 5%.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the bad side, a round trip signal, and its response (for interactive) is 4 trips over this 22,400 miles, meaning that (given speed of light) the total travel time (not including any ground switching) is at least two-thirds of a second.  This latency is why it sucks for interactive comms.  Telnet at that speed is truly painful.
      </p>
      <p>
        To overcome this latency, it is necessary to station participating satellites at a much lower altitude -- a "low Earth orbit" -- so that the latency from radio wave travel time is minimized.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no one set altitude.  Anything above the majority of the Earth's atmosphere, say 200 km, works.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the good side, the latency can be practically eliminated.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the bad side, you don't get a useful communications constellation until you have *all* the satellites in place and, because they *can't* be stationary at this lower altitude, you have the "cell phone handoff" problem in reverse as satellites pass into and out of the aperture of the ground station(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        Other low orbit applications would include such things as satellites tasked with photographic missions, weather tracking, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="LowEarthOrbit.html">LowEarthOrbit</a> is thus a suitable orbital altitude, below the "parking orbit" altitude of "ClarkesConstellation" for a given application of satellite resources where the higher orbit is inconvenient or useless.
