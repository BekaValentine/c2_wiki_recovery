      <p>
        In 2004 Simon was writing his fourth novel when Fremantle Press, an Australian trade publisher, offered a contract for his first three books. They were published over a five-year period, and were distributed by Penguin across Australia and New Zealand.

        Simon now has five Hal Spacejock novels, two Hal Junior novels and a dozen short stories in print. The first Hal Spacejock novel is also available in French translation.
