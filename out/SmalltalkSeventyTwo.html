        Smalltalk Seventy Two
      </h1>
      <p>
        Early dialect of <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, and considered to be the first "usable" version of Smalltalk (Smalltalk-71 was a rather primitive prototype).  For a long time, Smalltalk-72 was a project internal to <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a>, and didn't became known outside until well after Smalltalk-80 (what is usually meant by just "Smalltalk") was released.  Smalltalk-72 was described by <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> in <a href="EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk.html">EarlyHistoryOfSmalltalk</a>; and <a href="DanIngalls.html">DanIngalls</a> has recently made a re-implementation of Smalltalk-72 in <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>: <a href="http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/989">http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/989</a>
