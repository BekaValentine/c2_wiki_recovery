        <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a> read it some time ago:
        As I recall, I thought it was a good book, with plenty of useful ideas. But, as one should expect, you'll have to filter his recommendations with your experience. I found a few things in the book that I disagree with, but given the contentious nature of coding standards, I really found almost nothing I'd say was "outright wrong". -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>
