        Secondary Information
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's information compiled/generated/created by computer.
        Secondary information can be deleted and regenerated at any time.
        Human input can't be secondary information because it can't be deleted and easily regenerated, so it's always <a href="PrimaryInformation.html">PrimaryInformation</a>.

        <em>You seem to have missed a step - you haven't explained </em>'why<strong> Human Input is </strong><a href="PrimaryInformation.html">PrimaryInformation</a>. Surely you need to say something more like this:<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Secondary Information is information that is derived from other information.
        </li>
        <li>
           Primary Information is information that is not derived from any source, but is "given".
          <ul>
            <li>
               No information is both primary and secondary.
            </li>
            <li>
               All information is either "given" or derived.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Human information ...
          <ul>
            <li>
               is not derived from other information.
            </li>
            <li>
               is "given"
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore Human Input is Primary Information, not Secondary Information.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I think this is circular reasoning. What is "given" information? as in: what does that actually mean?</em>

        I agree, so we can say that <a href="PrimaryInformation.html">PrimaryInformation</a> is GivenInformation and <a href="SecondaryInformation.html">SecondaryInformation</a> is <a href="DerivedInformation.html">DerivedInformation</a>. -- Aleksey

        I never thought about "No information". -- Aleksey
