        I had some great <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> messing around with a commercial ES product (student version) in the early 90's. I couldn't make anything practical out of it, but it's fun tweaking with logic rules and their weights to see what the result is. It did shape some of my views on <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>, and <a href="BusinessRulesMetabase.html">BusinessRulesMetabase</a> techniques. Good times, except for the "C" I got on the project because I was suppose to extract rules from somebody else's head, not mine. I'm too annoying of a person, nobody wants to talk to me that long ;-P -t
