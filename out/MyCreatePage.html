        Here's my first feeling of <a href="WiKi.html">WiKi</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        Try, try, why not try,
        Let my fingers fly.
        Low to the keyboard,
        High to the sky.

        My second writing about Wiki:
      </p>
      <p>
        Reality or propaganda, I was attracted by the computer world. So wonderful it seemed to be, So frustrated now to me. "Here comes an age of no more paper work," they said, but even more paper is used, the electronic version and the paper version, Magic? We can now double checked. Yes, much more efficient, but also much more work to do, to get even less paid. Hell or heaven, I've already stepped into the IT world, So young to be attactive, So young to be divided, Too many languages or systems to learn, A little of everything, No time for concentration. More efforts, more loss? Withdraw or move forward? A cloud is yet to be cleared. One thing for sure, I am again attracted. This time by Wiki, for its instant interaction, for its wakening my creation.
