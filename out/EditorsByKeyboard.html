           <strong>Netbeans IDE:</strong> Their 'Ctrl', 'Space', 'Arrow down' and 'Enter' keys are worn out.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ViEditor.html">ViEditor</a>: Their '.', ':', and 'Esc' keys are worn out.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a>: Their 'Meta' and 'Bucky' keys are worn out.
        </li>
        <li>
           WordEditor: Their 'Ctrl', 'Alt', and 'Del' keys are worn out.

        <a href="ViEditor.html">ViEditor</a> was created by a touch-typist (<a href="BillJoy.html">BillJoy</a>) for touch-typists. Keyboard usage is very carefully designed to allow one to keep one's fingers in the touch-typing "home" position, to not require many finger contortions that are awkward for touch typing.

      <p>
        <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a> was created by a non-touch-typist (<a href="RichardStallman.html">RichardStallman</a>), and therefore he and it think nothing of requiring contorted hand positions for "control-meta-cokebottle" constructs; the fact that they interfere with the ergonomics of fast and comfortable touch-typing wasn't even on his radar.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of which has anything to do with why <a href="ViEditor.html">ViEditor</a> wears out '.', ':', and 'Esc', which is amusing but sort of true, kind of.
