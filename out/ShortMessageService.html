        Short Message Service

      <p>
        <a href="ShortMessageService.html">ShortMessageService</a>, aka SMS, is a very popular mechanism for communication between busy people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides costs that are cheaper than a direct call, it also allows for store and forward messaging, so your mobile does not have to be on while message is sent.

        SMS can be sent to foreign countries, not all service providers are equipped for this.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some reasons some people are hooked on using SMS.

        Another application in Australia is for advertising where bar codes are transmitted to phones that can be used to function as discount coupons. Seen that in the business section of an Oz newspaper on 7th July05.

        MS is said to have advertised email <a href="PushTechnology.html">PushTechnology</a> in <a href="WindowsMobile.html">WindowsMobile</a> 2003, and implemented via the use of a <a href="ShortMessageService.html">ShortMessageService</a> based intermediary. This was said to operate only on CDMA (<a href="CodeDivisionMultipleAccess.html">CodeDivisionMultipleAccess</a>) networks. But the <a href="ShowStopper.html">ShowStopper</a> is actually cost of this service, which requires the use of 2003 version of <a href="MicrosoftExchangeServer.html">MicrosoftExchangeServer</a>.

        SMS message gateways exist on the web. Anyone found good use of this outside of US? What countries and for what purposes? And why SMS ?

           A new (Aug05) Mobile<a href="InstantMessenger.html">InstantMessenger</a> service in UK aim to provide comprehensive connectivity for <a href="MobilePhone.html">MobilePhone</a> users, with links to PC based <a href="InstantMessaging.html">InstantMessaging</a> as well. The Senjoo system is supposedly cheaper than use of <a href="ShortMessageService.html">ShortMessageService</a>. Maybe UK pricing is too high, compared to rest of the world where SMS has taken off?

           The default "ring tone" for SMS is actually <a href="MorseCode.html">MorseCode</a> for SMS.

           In the UK, sending SMS to a BT landline is converted to speech and "delivered". <em>Similar services exist in Canada and Australia, I believe.</em>

           Some people thought SMS stand for "Short Messages Service", which is wrong.
