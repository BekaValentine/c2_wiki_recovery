        I design & program (C++) custom applications in Minneapolis.
        My interests lie in OOD and now patterns.  I used to think of myself
        as an OO person who works in C++. . .  until I heard <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>
        speak on the multi-paradigms in C++.    Now I desire to be
        a C++ developer who knows all of the paradigms of C++ ( OO, 
        templates, procedural, etc. ) and knows how/when 
        to apply them in my designs.

        There's so much to learn, but I get to my goals by 
        persistent reading, studying, and applying.  I find
        most people (in all professions) <em>want</em> to be at a 
        higher level, but not enough to <em>work</em> for it.

        I have forged a position for myself within my company:  
        <a href="ReuseRepository.html">ReuseRepository</a> Manager.  I proposed the idea, and 
        I was granted the authority--as long as I remain productive 
        in day-to-day projects.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm grateful for the opportunity to manage this project.  This is an excellent
        opportunity to apply theory, develop ideas/techniques, and experiment
        in a real-life/business-setting "lab."  I hope to write a paper or two on
        my experiences and submit them.  Any offers to publish me?

        If you read <em>Software Development</em> magazine, note that Racko Roland 
        used my letter (from "Randy C") to start into his current discussion on an 
        organized program of reuse.

        I hate to bother busy and public people, so any questions
        are infrequent, succinct, and pertinent.  My sincere thanks to 
        <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> and <a href="JohnVlissides.html">JohnVlissides</a> for responding to my recent 
        questions via email.

        My hobby is keeping and breeding freshwater tropical fish.  
        I've bred over 100 species in five years.
