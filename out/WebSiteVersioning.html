        Web Site Versioning
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you're releasing an open-source or off-the-shelf package, your users have a clear choice about when to upgrade. Early adopters will be on a bleeding edge version or an x.0 release. Late adopters will be several versions behind.
      </p>
      <p>
        This choice isn't available with web sites. There is only one release version: <strong>CURRENT</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>(tm): you're not letting the user make a choice.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>(tm): you have to learn to add new features without adding new bugs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any thoughts?
