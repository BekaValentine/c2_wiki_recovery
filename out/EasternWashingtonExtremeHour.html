        Eastern Washington Extreme Hour
      </h1>

        A great help in better understanding how some of the principles are used in actuality. The talked-about change of QA and development teams working together would have made our mousetrap release much more successful.  Seeing how this system would work in actual programming would be an even better help. -- Davin Casper

        Only having 10 minutes for each phase of the development cycle seemed a little short and rushed. However, overall I felt that the extreme hour was beneficial in getting a hands on example of XP. Extreme Programming seems to be a very efficient and logical way of development. -- Dan Carpenter
