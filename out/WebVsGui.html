        Web Vs Gui
      </h1>
      <p>
        Differences between HTML-HTTP-based UI's and "traditional" GUI's.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Web pages have no built-in state. They must be redrawn upon each server communication. (Of course there are ways to work around this or emulate state, but none are standardized or smooth.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Web pages have the "back" button convention, while GUI's don't. The expectation of or ability to back-up complicates integrity and state management. Related: <a href="BackIsNotUndo.html">BackIsNotUndo</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           User can have multiple instances of a given web page or web form, which creates problems similar to those of the "back-up" issue.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Web pages lack widgets that GUI designers are used to. Solutions are often proprietary, limiting browser audience. Missed widgets include:
          <ul>
            <li>
               combo-boxes (select boxes with optional type-in)
            </li>
            <li>
               tab buttons (that don't require a page refresh)
            </li>
            <li>
               edit-able data grids that provide a spreadsheet-like feel
            </li>
            <li>
               menus (frame usage tends to muck up web emulation)
            </li>
            <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Web page designer tools tend to be "flow-based" (hierarchical) while GUI tools tended to be coordinate based. (Which is better seems to be a strong personal preference -- <a href="CoordinateVersusNestedGui.html">CoordinateVersusNestedGui</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           GUI's often use "modal" screens for certain types of interaction. This is where one cannot return to the original screen or MDI area until they complete a diolog box or series of dialogs (sometimes called "wizards"). <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> error messages provide this, but are not customizable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           GUI kits usually have the option of MDI screen management where all sub-screens are visually contained in the MDI window. Usually there is a "main" screen in MDI interfaces.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hyperlinks are not a traditional GUI concept, however it is possible to add such a feature, at least for non-modal screens.
        </li>
      </ul>
