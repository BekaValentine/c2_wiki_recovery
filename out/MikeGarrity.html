        Hi, I'm a <a href="GraphicsWeeny.html">GraphicsWeeny</a> at the MathWorks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Previously an architect of a visualization component set in Java & C++ at a company that had adopted several extreme practices, but hadn't switch over completely. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Way back, I was doing graphics hardware (back when there were more than 1 or 2 companies doing that sort of thing) and microcode.

        Currently interested in the space where <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> meets NumericalProgramming.
