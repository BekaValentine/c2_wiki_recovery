      <p>
        I'm a C++/C# developer. I've been a programmer since 1984, and had been programming for a couple of years before that.

        My interests are Software Development, XP, .NET and C#, reading and writing fiction. Nothing published yet though. Lots of other things fascinate me too.

        I like relaxing with friends, family, or my cat, Surly.
