        Louis Ferdinand Celine
      </h1>
      <p>
        The biggest defeat in every department of life is to forget, especially the
        things that have done you in, and to die without realizing how far people can
        go in the way of crumminess. When the grave lies open before us, let's not
        try to be witty, but on the other hand, let's not forget, but make it our
        business to record the worst of the human viciousness we've seen without
        changing one word. When that's done, we can curl up our toes and sink into
        the pit. That's work enough for a lifetime.

        First Guy: What do you think?
      </p>
      <p>
        Second Guy: As little as possible.
