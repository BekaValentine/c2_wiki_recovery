        Split Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think this wiki needs to be split into computer-related topics and non-computer-related topics, or at least "sanctioned" versus non-sanctioned. Techies obviously need to vent on non-computer topics every now and then, but it is cluttering up the computer and software topics.

        Aaah, you must read more grasshopper.. such as <a href="MySignalIsYourNoise.html">MySignalIsYourNoise</a>. The dynamic tension on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is one of the things that makes it great. Use the category system (<a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a>) to go straight to your favorite tech subject, or perhaps use one of many <a href="RoadMaps.html">RoadMaps</a>. -- <a href="TheEditor.html">TheEditor</a>

        <em>Yes, but the side topics could perhaps be explored further if they could grow without harming or crowding out the software engineering topics.</em>

        Not when it turns into ugly, Ever-lasting <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s.

        <a href="SplitWiki.html">SplitWiki</a> by selecting pages that do not require code word to edit. Although I have no interest in discussions in movies, I see it useful to allow <a href="CategoryMovie.html">CategoryMovie</a> entries editing all the time. This will encourage viewing (and maybe reviewing) contents that have more serious contents.
