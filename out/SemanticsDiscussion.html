        {It's self-evident that constructs like "if (p) {} else {}" and "while (p) {}" have the same semantics in all popular imperative programming languages.  That is sufficient to demonstrate commonality.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sorry, it's not obvious to me. Perhaps <a href="CommonSenseIsAnIllusion.html">CommonSenseIsAnIllusion</a> is applicable. Every head is different. I might use the same thought processes between similar languages, but that is not a necessity, nor do other humans necessarily use the same thought processes that I do. What keeps somebody from using Head Model A for say End-X style block (VB-like) languages and Head Model B for curly-brace-style languages? (PHP) Granted, such may be poor reuse of mental models, but that's a "design quality" issue, not an absolute requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        {If it's not obvious that constructs like "if (p) {} else {}" and "while (p) {}" have the same semantics in all popular imperative programming languages, then there should be an example of a popular imperative programming language where "if (p) {} else {}" or "while (p) {}" differs semantically from other popular imperative programming languages.  What is that language, and how do "if (p) {} else {}" or "while (p) {}" differ semantically in that language?}
      </p>
      <p>
        But it may be tradition (historical patterns) that say the End-X block style is interpreted similarly (processed similarly) or matches the curly-brace style. In other words, it is "ingrained" that language patterns such as "while...end while" can be interpreted as (mentally replaced by) "while {...}" There are different mental techniques to arrive at similar answers and thus different mental techniques to apply these cross-substitutions in the mind when needed. For example, person A may think in End-X style and person B think in curly-brace style. When person A sees curly braces, in their mind they will translate to End-X style; and vise versa for person B. To me they are using different semantics in their head, but can cross-translate as needed. Person C may use a mental Tinker-Toy model to "run code" in their head, and translate both End-X and curly-brace style into their tinker-toy model. Person C is not using the same semantics as person A and B, but can translate the syntax to his/her preferred semantic model. I'm not sure there is an objective or clear commonality between all 3 people's head models. X being able to be translated into Y does not necessarily mean X and Y have "common semantics".
      </p>
      <p>
        {What does this have to do with "head models"?  "Different semantics in their head" is irrelevant, and treating "End-X block style" as different from "the curly-brace style" is about syntax, not semantics.  Programming language semantics are about how language statements are computed, not what sequences of characters (or whatever) are used to specify them.  I know of no language where "if (p) {} else {}" or "IF p THEN ... ELSE ... END IF" does anything but evaluate boolean expression 'p' to determine which of two code blocks is executed.  I know of no language where "while (p) {}" or "WHILE p BEGIN ... END WHILE" does anything but repeatedly execute the code block as long as the boolean expression 'p' evaluates to 'true'.  You can choose whatever words or formalisms you like to express it or describe it, but what happens in terms of the language on the machine -- i.e., the semantics -- are the same.}
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't know if it's about semantics or syntax or both without x-ray-ing heads. Heads may be able to gleam a lot of info from JUST syntax patterns; enough to convert it into a personal arbitrary pet "semantic" model. A programmer may think in <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a>, and develop mental techniques to internally parse Php into <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a> in their head, and then "run" it as <a href="BrainFuck.html">BrainFuck</a> in their head. If their head is running <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a>, they are NOT processing Algol-style languages.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           A <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a> interpreter does not "have" ("apply"?) Algol-style semantics, correct? 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           And we can write a translator that translates Php into <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a> via syntax rules, correct? (I'm assuming here syntax-based translation is not application of "semantics", but since "semantics" is vague, am not fully committing to it.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           And then we can run that translated version of code on a <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a> interpreter, correct?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           But the <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a> interpreter is STILL NOT processing "Algol-style semantics", correct?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Thus, we don't need Algol-style semantics to run/emulate Algol-style code (such as Php), correct?

        {We don't have to "xray heads" to distinguish syntax from semantics.  In programming languages, syntax consists of rules -- typically expressed via a grammar -- that define what characters may appear where in order to form valid statements.  Semantics describes what the language parts are, how they interact, and what they do at a language level.  Semantics are what define that a statement like "a = foo() + b;" means -- and by "means", I mean (hah!) how language statements describe or use variables, assignment, functions, function invocation, addition, values, and so on.  All of these things have to be defined, mapped to syntax, and rules created that specify how they interact.  That's semantics.  When we say, "the keyword 'while' is followed by a left parenthesis, an expression (itself a series of rules for assembling characters), a right parenthesis, a left curly brace, an arbitrary block of code (another set of character sequence rules), and finally a right curly brace", that's syntax.  When we say that the syntax describes "a 'while' loop that executes the code block as long as the boolean expression is true", that's semantics.}

      <ul>
        <li>
           Again, that doesn't communicate to me anything specific or concrete about "semantics". "Meaning" is in human heads and <strong>probably subjective</strong>; varying per head. Interpreters don't "think" and don't have "ideas". Nor do they translate code to English, and different people will give different English translations/versions of "meaning" of a given code snippet. Semantics may exist in their head, but nothing above proves a measurable commonality between each English writer's "semantics". A rough common generality in such English versions would probably be physical analogies such as moving or copying "stuff" from one "thing" or "object" to another "thing" or "object', not unlike marked bricks from buckets to buckets. But the labels, classification, and/or packaging (grouping) of these things and parts varies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {No, variables, assignment, functions, function invocation, addition, values and so on are all very real components of the language, regardless what we call them.  We may interpret them different ways, but they execute one way.  A loop is still a loop, and a variable is still a variable, whether you recognise it or not.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Most of those listed have an objective syntax representation per grammar/parse rules of the language. I don't dispute that. We've been over that already.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Sure, in many languages it's possible to unambiguously map syntax to semantics (and in some it's not, or it's very limited) so grammar specifications frequently refer to semantic elements in order to make them easy to read.  However, all that syntax <em>really</em> specifies are things like "<sequence of characters> := <sequence of characters> ( <symbol> <sequence of characters> )*".  Associating "variable reference" or "expression" with a given <sequence of characters> is semantics.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The last sentence is not clear to me. Who or what is doing this associating, and why does association alone make it "semantics" exactly?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {A language designer defines the association, and a compiler/interpreter writer implements it in code.  It's "semantics" because that's what <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> call it.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But it's not formally defined any more than "idea" or "meaning" is formally defined. Just because an (alleged) scientist uses "idea" to describe something does NOT by itself make the term a rigorous concept. Ideas <em>influence</em> language design and algorithms, but that's not the same as "being in" them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {What does "formally defined" or "rigorous" have to do with it?  Semantics aren't an "idea", they're simply the mapping between language statements and language interpretation.  Without such mapping, you have a syntax recogniser and nothing else.  With such mapping, you can build an interpreter that implements what the language designer intended.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's an algorithm, not "semantics". Yes, semantics influence algorithms, but that's not the same as "containing" semantics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {A variable isn't an algorithm, but what a variable is, in a programming language, is defined by semantics.}

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As we've been around before, "is" is vague. (Bill Clinton was right.) It implies equivalency or classification, which generally is relative to need or context, which is generally notions or ideas in human heads, not machines.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Despite "is" apparently being vague, it shows up frequently in English and communication successfully carries on in spite of it.  Language consists of two components, syntax and semantics.  Every programming language construct -- variables, for example -- will be defined in terms of zero or more syntactic aspects, and zero or more semantic aspects.  Note my use of "zero or more": some syntax has no semantic role -- commas in lists, for example -- whilst some semantic elements have no syntactic aspect, such as return values returned by functions.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           People bicker over categories and classifications all the time in colloquial conversation, such as whether ObamaCare is socialism. Colloquial English is hardly a model of rigor. (Commas in a list have no "meaning"? That's a curious claim.) A variable "can be viewed as" a <a href="StateMachine.html">StateMachine</a>, but that does not necessarily mean it "is" a <a href="StateMachine.html">StateMachine</a>. "Is" is too strong a statement. Generally <strong>one has to select a fairly rigorous model of some concept or idea in order to be able to do rigorous analysis and comparisons on the concept</strong>. But participants have to agree on the validity of the model, and they may not necessarily be obligated to do so. <a href="TheMapIsNotTheTerritory.html">TheMapIsNotTheTerritory</a>. I do not accept your version of "value" as a necessary sub-model or "part" of programming language models, even though I accept it as a valid alternative. It's inclusion or exclusion has various trade-offs associated with it, and we disagree over the weighting of these tradeoffs, which I won't get into here.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {If you're unhappy with the rigour of English, we can switch to using purely mathematical notation.  That will make our discussions unambiguous and rigorous, but I suspect they'll be a tad hard to read.  People do indeed bicker over categories and classifications, but they don't usually bicker over "is".}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {The commas in a list have no semantics -- they only syntactically delimit the items.  Should "Dave" "Bob" "Richard" mean something different from "Dave", "Bob", "Richard" in a list of names?  There's nothing that says we <em>can't</em> associate meaning with commas in a programming language -- say, with commas it's a linked list but without commas it's an array -- but we <em>don't</em>, at least not in any popular imperative programming language that I'm aware of.  Commas in a list are there only to simplify the parser and/or improve human readability.}

      <ul>
        <li>
           {Ah, of course.  They are semantically significant in many languages.  I was thinking purely of its use as a separator in, e.g., "int a=1, b=2, c=3, i=0;"  I'd forgotten its use as an operator in, say, "i = (a += 3, b + 2)";}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As far as the list and commas, they do have meaning to me. They tell me adjacent items are not part of the same "cell". I'd likely interpret the list different without commas, or be confused by it. If I saw "Dave" "Bob" "Richard", I wouldn't know what the hell it is (unless some prior convention is established).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {You are again conflating human interpretation with programming language semantics.  The presence or absence of commas in a list of names has no effect on the list of names.  Unless we deliberately defined the language so that commas have semantics, the same list would result in the computer's memory (assuming the syntax supports it) whether the commas are there or not.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And "is" does create contention fairly often, per my "socialism" example above. And switching to a purely mathematical notation will not necessarily resolve conflicts. Your "math" model would probably define values similar to your existing writeup, and I'd disagree with it, and the same fights would break out. To satisfy your claim that your version of "value" is necessary, you'd have to demonstrate that all possible "correct" models must clearly use your version of "value". This is what I informally refer to as the "uniqueness requirement". (By "correct", I mean "I/O profile" matches as previously defined.) Thus, the existence of a math model by itself won't necessarily resolve conflicts over <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> issues, which I believe is what this conflict is about, not some universal objective truth. We have multiple models that work correctly. The dispute is whether they reflect "common semantics". Actually, I'm not clear on the scope of your claim. Do you claim that all correct models MUST have your version of "values", or that most developers mentally use your version of it?

           In <a href="ValueExistenceProofTwo.html">ValueExistenceProofTwo</a> I've asked for objective evidence of that, and have not seen a satisfactory answer.

        <li>
           No, similar to how I cannot verify there are no ghosts on planet Earth. I know of no objective tests of their existence or absence in terms of a language's I/O profile. One approach we've tried is to see whether all possible (or "known" as a sampling proxy) models that match a language's I/O profile require their existence, and that answer clearly is "no" to me. But you claim I'm not recognizing something undefined (to me).

What matters is that the answer to these questions possesses the same semantics in every popular imperative programming language, modulo those differences described at the top of <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>.  You may quibble about minutiae all you like, but the fundamental truth of that is indubitable and borne out by both program behaviour and language references.}

Your appear to inject your pet interpretation into them (without realizing it), and mistaking those interpretations for equivalency. What I'd like to see as a starting point is clear steps that resemble the following:

      <ul>
        <li>
           {What is a "semanticsExtractor"?  I can provide evidence that they do have the same answer.  Here's some Javascript: "v=3; function foo() {return 3}; alert((v == foo()) == (v == 2 + 1) == (foo() == 2 + 1));"  Now, provide evidence that they do not have the same answer.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "semanticsExtractor" is some operation that returns some kind of textual representation/notation of semantics. I'll let you decides what that is (although I'll ask a lot of questions about it later). And your example is comparing output, NOT semantics. If you wish to use the stated "I/O profile" criteria to measure "semantic equivalency", or something like it, be my guest. Just be clear that's what you are doing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {<a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> provides a textual representation/notation of semantics.  Is that what you mean?  My example isn't comparing output at all.  It's comparing the result of a function invocation with what's stored in a variable with the result of evaluating an expression -- where a literal 3 is stored in the variable, a literal 3 is used to denote the function's return value, and the expression should evaluate to 3 -- then outputting 'true' if they are all equal and 'false' otherwise.  The only output is "true" or "false".  Not surprisingly, it outputs "true".  So, what does a variable store? What does a function return? What does an expression evaluate to?  If they're equal, they must be the same.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sorry, you lost me. They are the "same" in what way? You mean the result of both expressions are equivalent (as defined by the language)? That's not necessarily a measurement of semantic equivalence. If you claim it's a legitimate way to measure semantic equivalence, then you need to establish that first. Otherwise, it appears you are making up semantic equivalence tests out of the blue. And I'm not convinced that <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> is actually encoding pure "semantics". That paper just claimed it was, as a given. It's a legitimate question to ask how one knows if a given notation system is actually encoding semantics and not partly or in whole something else (such as algorithms or mere "logic observations" about the code).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {The results of all three expressions are more than just equivalent, they're equal.  The language demonstrates this.  Unless we have reason to believe the language uses its equality operator ('=') to lie, it demonstrates that the result of expression evaluation, function evaluation, and variable dereferencing are the same by showing that they are equal.  This demonstration -- with mere syntactic tweaks and changing to whatever each language uses in place of 'alert' -- works in every popular imperative programming language.  We can create further demonstrations to show that the result of expression evaluation, function evaluation, and variable dereferencing can be used interchangeably everywhere an expression may appear, thus confirming their equivalence. What is notable, however, is that whilst we can assign to a variable -- e.g., "v=3" -- we cannot assign to an expression and we cannot assign to a function invocation.  It seems "foo() = 3;" doesn't work, nor does "2 + 1 = 3;"  Thus, in popular imperative programming languages, there is a clear distinction between variables and the result of function invocation or the result of expression evaluation.  Whatever the result of result of function invocation or the result of expression evaluation might be, it isn't the same as a variable.}

           Re: "works in every popular imperative programming language" -- Okay, but what does this objectively say about semantics? Such languages share similar conventions, I don't dispute that. If 3 companies steal a typewriter design from company X and clone it with minor variations, then all 3 typewriter brands will work similarly and have similar conventions. That's a no-brainer. Everybody copied a popular tool.

           {This objectively says they have common semantics in common.  The "similar conventions" are syntactic, and certainly semantic, because if we're not talking about language syntax, we're talking about language semantics.  There isn't anything else except language design philosophy, language history, etc., that aren't relevant here.}

           I don't see how it's objective. Please elaborate. And the last 2 sentences don't make sense to me. "Talking about" for what? You seem to be doing some kind of subtraction. Two other things that can be looked at is output and algorithms. We may be able to say that similar syntax results in similar I/O profiles, but I'm not sure semantics are defined by I/O profiles. I'm not sure what semantics are because they are ideas/concepts/notions in peoples heads and are not any more dissect-able than "love" is.

If syntax and semantics are described completely, then the language is completely described.}

           Perhaps the definition of "syntax" comes into play. Anyhow, I don't know what changing identifiers shows us. Please clarify. That different "Algol-style" languages have similarities does not necessarily mean they have the same "semantics". They have similar "behavior", but is that similar "semantics"? In your view, what is the relationship between behavior and semantics? Two things having similar behavior means that given the same or similar environment, the two things will react similarly. This is close to the "I/O profile" metric I refer to. An animal example would be "predator". Mammal predators will display similar behavior in a similar environment and we can identify these patterns, such as observing and stalking prey, selecting the younger or lame animals from a group, lunging, surrounding the prey (if hunting in a group), etc. In colloquial-land, it would be a stretch to call such similarities "similar semantics" or even "similar meaning" (since "semantics" may be reserved for languages and not animal behavior). It's not "meaning", it's just their behavior.

      <ul>
        <li>
           {That different "Algol-style" languages "have similarities" is simply a way of saying they share common syntax and semantics.  Indeed, by in large, they mainly differ in syntax, and differ in semantics as described at the top of <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>.  Semantics define language behaviour.  In short, semantics describe what happens when a program runs.  For example, if the semantics state that, for example, "a = 3 + 4;" means "the value resulting from evaluating the expression '3 + 4' is assigned to a", we can verify the behaviour defined by the semantics by writing, say (in Javascript), "var a; alert(a == 3 + 4); a = 3 + 4; alert(a == 3 + 4);"  We'd expect it to pop up "false", then "true".}

           Sigh. If IBM created a C# compiler, but its debugger looked and worked a lot different than Microsoft's, most would not use that as a reason to say IBM's C# is "not the same language" as Microsoft's C#. In most heads, computer languages are not defined by what the debugger shows. We don't use the I/O of the debugger as a definition of a given language. In fact, IBM wouldn't even have to include a debugger. Debuggers are just "courtesy views" into the back room, which may be implementation-specific. Further, I've used a debugger that broke expressions down into "internal variables" similar to what's seen in <a href="TopsTagModelTwo.html">TopsTagModelTwo</a>. <strong>It's where I got the idea</strong>. (I don't remember the language; that was roughly 30 years ago.) Granted, it may have done "bloaty" stuff when debugging was switched on versus when it was off, but that just shows there are different ways to implement the guts, kicking the canonical cat in the cocoanuts.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Of course debuggers don't define languages.  However, they are very helpful for understanding language behaviour by allowing the user to "walk through" programs step-by-step, and observe as loops cause blocks of code to be repeatedly executed, 'if' statements cause code to be executed or skipped, variable assignment causes the value in a variable to change, and so on.  Some debuggers do permit nuanced views of the underlying machine, but that's not the usual use of a debugger, which is to execute programming language code in slow motion and observe what it does.}

           Yes, but debuggers just allow us to see the guts of a <em>particular</em> implementation. It does not make the implementation canonical. For example, a debugger may let one "see" the expression evaluation stack, but your side already agreed that stacks are an implementation detail and don't represent a canonical "semantics" (for lack of a better term). Seeing an expression stack in a debugger can be quite useful, but it's merely a courtesy view to a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>. In fact, a powerful debugger would let us change the "values" in such stacks. Mutable!  -t

I don't even know how to get into that mode on the debuggers I frequently use, assuming it's supported.  Change the values in the run-time stacks?  Maybe that can be done, but I can't imagine why.  (And the values themselves are immutable; the stack is, necessarily, mutable.)  Normally, a debugger is used to single-step through the source code, executing it statement-by-statement so that you can examine the effect of each statement.  For a given language, that will do exactly the same thing in every implementation.}

           I didn't mention "machine language" in the prior paragraph. And you seem to be limiting "debugger" to a fairly narrow definition here. I have seen expression de-construction debuggers as described (although the details are foggy). Statement-sized is sometimes too large a granularity of debugging when working with expressions with lots of parts. Expression-stack X-raying would be another approach to examining sub-expressions. Further, as I pointed out elsewhere, "smart" interpreters/compilers can potentially perform certain sets of statements in parallel, even thorough a debugger may show it only sequentially. That's to fit human notions or perhaps to keep the debugger simpler, not to represent all possible execution/emulation techniques.

        <li>
           {If you can "see" the "expression evaluation stack", it typically implies at least some level lower than the language whose source code you're stepping through.

Optimisations -- such as parallelisation -- are irrelevant unless they affect the semantics.}

           The stack shown in the debugger does not have to be machine language. It can be a "cleaned up" view of the stack, somewhat like the function call stack, which is usually viewable with function names instead of say RAM addresses. My point is clear: debuggers can and do show specific implementation perspectives that are not necessarily required features of a language. You lost that sub-debate, give it up.

           You have implied it, but let's drop it for now. My main point is that a debugger is not guaranteed to keep implementation specifics out of its interface. Whether current ones do or not, who knows. Nobody's done a thorough survey, only anecdotes. I don't recognize debuggers as reliable comparison tools, other than suggesting further exploration.

           {I've never seen a debugger that, in a single-step mode, did anything but unambiguously show the expected visible language elements like variables and source code.  If anything else was visible -- like the underlying machine code being executed, or live stack traces -- it was clearly distinguished.  I would certainly expect a debugger to be a far less ambiguous or confusing view of semantics in action than relying on I/O, because relying on I/O conflates the statements being examined with the statements that implement I/O.}

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Search for "magazine" for a section below that looks at "absolute" debuggers versus existing debuggers. And yes, I/O statements can affect our view of things, but we don't have a better choice, because debuggers may leak implementation specifics or have arbitrary features. For example, they may format numbers with commas to make them "nice", but another vendor's debugger for the same language may not include commas. If we compare on debugger I/O, then both languages are not equivalent because one shows commas and the other not, which goes against the common notion of what defines languages. <strong>Languages are NOT defined by their debuggers</strong>. They don't even have to include a debugger. It's merely a bonus or a peak view.

           I don't know why you keep talking about these "reverse assignments". It's an odd obsession of yours. My model doesn't accept that (despite your repeated false insistence that it does). And for the sake of argument, even if one wanted to make a language that accepted that, nobody has shown a use for it. It doesn't do useful work, or hasn't been defined in a way that both does useful work and is simpler than existing conventions. Nobody's going to deviate from the Algol convention like that unless it adds utility (such as less code than the existing alternatives). Even if I "broke" my model to allow such syntax, it doesn't affect the results because the "temp" variable would either never be used by later steps or be overwritten by the next step (unless you break yet more things inside). It would be as good as a <strong>no-op</strong> and wouldn't affect the output. I could jury-rig your model in a similar way to create an orphan value that nothing uses. -t

           {I talk about "reverse assignments" because your model appears to accept them.  If values and variables are the same -- call them valvarueiables -- and we can assign to valvarueiables, then we can assign to valvarueiables. What part of your model decides that you can assign to a valvarueiable in once place and not another?  Your model doesn't appear to deal with language syntax (nor would I expect it to), so there can't be a syntactic restriction.}

        <li>
           Then you don't understand the model. There can be any syntactical restriction needed to model the target language. Most won't bother to add such because they came to work on type-related issues, not syntax issues. But if you don't bother to put the filter on your fish tank as a short-cut, then don't complain if junk accidentally gets through. It's only a model, so no real fish or puppies die anyhow. One can remove/skip the safety equipment to get a better look at the device's guts, but that also means you have no safety equipment: tradeoffs tradeoffs.

           See above, I spruced up the safety analogy. I'm not sure what you mean by the second half. As I've mentioned elsewhere, I've seen vendors change at what stage errors were caught in subsequent versions, and few would consider the revision a "different language" (in a practical sense). I'm not sure what "harm" you are trying to prevent. "Forced"? Odd choice of words. I'm not even sure the user should have to care about "stages" of code processing. If something is wrong in the code, it's wrong. Error messages tend to leak info about the implementation guts when they don't have to. Statement processing and syntax checking could in theory be more heavily intertwined than it typically is, but interpreter makers don't do it that way, perhaps because it makes it harder use and find "generic" components because the specifics of processing would then be dictated by syntax issues.

        <li>
           {You require that syntax be restricted in order to prevent a semantic problem -- assigning to valvarueiables when it is inappropriate to allow assignment.

Yes, it would involve "nesting", but every programmer is already familiar with the idea that a variable "nests", i.e., stores, a value.}

      <ul>
        <li>
           How are you measuring "overly complex"? That's a rather general statement. You are exaggerating the weight of this "problem", if it's even a problem to being with. Like  I keep saying over and over again, the variable thingy is the most frequently-used structure in the model. Sure, users can "get used to" reading through the extra verbosity of nested-ness just like one can get used to COBOL's verbosity, but given a choice I'd rather have the most common structure be as simple as possible EVEN if it complicates rarely used parts as a TRADEOFF, and I believe most regular programmers would agree with such a decision. (And no, I cannot "prove" they would. It's an estimate, just like your counter claim will be.)

           Re: "Execute one way" - I call that their "I/O profile" (IOP, and source code is part of "I"), but matching IOP hasn't been proven to also mean semantics match. And the labeling of source code parts can be defined and mentally identified via syntax patterns alone. Even source code patterns (multiple statements) can be done via syntax pattern recognition alone, using a large-enough training set. <strong>No higher-level cognition is necessary</strong>; it can be done with plane-jane pattern training using off-the-shelf AI algorithms. Such a setup could probably say, "X has a double loop" without ever "knowing" what a double loop "is" (in the human sense).

           {The only thing that ever needs to "know" what a "double loop" is, is the language interpreter.  And by "know", I mean only that the interpreter can mechanically turn source code into the machine execution that the language designer intended.  Are you sure "off-the-shelf AI algorithms" (?) will work to unambiguously model an "I/O profile"?  Based purely on syntax, you can successfully identify language parts in most languages simply by writing a parser based on the language's documented grammar.  No "higher-level cognition" is needed for that, either.  However, there are elements crucial to implementing (and modelling) languages that syntax alone does not express.  Sometimes there are grammar ambiguities that only semantics can resolve; operator precedence, for example, is specified in the semantics rather than the syntax.  Of course, some parser-generator tools will let you specify operator precedence in the grammar.  I'm not aware of any, however, that allows you to specify, say, short-circuit evaluation.  I.e., you have to recognise whether or not bar() will be executed in a statement like "if (foo() || bar()) {}", if foo() returns true.  In many languages, if foo() is true bar() will not be executed; it will only execute if foo() is false, which may have significant effects on how the program subsequently runs if bar() has side-effects.  So, if source code is part of a language's "I/O profile", then you're probably going to have to take (at least) operator precedence and short-circuit evaluation into account, and that means dealing with semantics.}

           Operator precedence is defined by algorithms, and these algorithms usually follow the precedence rules we largely learned in school (multiplication before addition unless parenthesis, etc.). Interprets have their particular version/implementation of such algorithms and each human head also has it's own. That's "algorithm", not semantics.

        I agree that an algorithm can be influenced by "semantics" (ideas, notions, concepts), but that is not the same as an algorithm "having" semantics "in" it. How do we objectively verify an algorithm "has" semantics "in" it, and how do we compare to know if algorithm A has equivalent semantics to algorithm B?  -t

        <em>Algorithms don't have semantics, so your question is ill-formed. However, this quite clearly comes from the claim that semantics are implemented with algorithms. You can tell if implementations have the same semantics by comparing the effects of running them. (Note: the effects in question are limited to the ones the language in question specifies at the abstraction level specified by the language in question. Generally, we don't care if a particular bit is set or cleared. We just care whether or not the variable (however that got implemented) contains the value 5 of type integer (however that got implemented).

        <em>Perhaps interpreters don't "see" or "contain" meaning the same way humans do -- we don't know how humans see or contain meaning, so we can't tell -- but we certainly know how interpreters "see" or "contain" meaning.

In a typical interpreter or compiler, this requires (in part) explicitly associating elements of the language grammar with actions that are to be performed by the interpreter or compiler when those elements are encountered whilst parsing the source code.  That's how the meaning of a language is "seen" or "contained" by an interpreter or compiler.</em>

        But there are multiple ways to implement interpreters. Most are shaped by common conventions modeled after time-tested and road-tested ideas and tuned for machine efficiency on existing hardware. Future hardware or new interpreter ideas may change all that some day, or there may be interpreters built merely to predict and highlight certain concepts/features without concern for efficiency (sound familiar?). What you describe as "understand" above appears to be <strong>one of many possible paths to "understanding"</strong>. Measuring understanding by current or popular implementation techniques does not produce the "canonical semantics" you claim/suggest exists. The "uniqueness problem" still persists. And who's to say that human programmers all run the same "ideas" in their head to predict code results? There's probably multiple "meaning" paths in human heads also. I already gave examples of different "school paper" techniques one can use to process expressions on paper. -t

        <em>There are multiple ways to implement interpreters, and there are perhaps multiple ways for us to understand the semantics of languages.

I'd like better evidence. English rephrasing doesn't cut it, in part because such descriptions are not unique per target code snippet, and because much of English is vague or ambiguous. I agree there could be a "historical habit" of ways of thinking about or describing the processing of code, but it's hard to extract such information from developers beyond anecdotes. Further, the historical habit doesn't have to be universal. It may be shaped by machine efficiency concerns and/or just plain historical habit ("we always did it that way"). Please make clear what stance you are taking or talking about with regard to actual-as-is/historical canonization versus universal canonization (independent of human/Earth history/habits/hardware). I tend to partly agree with the <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> complaining about bias of the "Von Neumann habit" (<a href="CanProgrammingBeLiberatedFromTheVonNeumannStyle.html">CanProgrammingBeLiberatedFromTheVonNeumannStyle</a>). Our thought processes may be shaped by it, and that's not necessarily a bad thing (our common reference "engines" may necessarily be some arbitrary common <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> to aide in communication), but it may be possible that the real universal "canonical" semantics may look very different from the usual descriptions we give it (such as "move the results of expression evaluation on the right to the slot on the left"). Humans talk in terms of moving and copying parts or objects to and from slots or buckets (arguing over the names of these parts and buckets). But these are metaphors borrowed from our physical human world. Perhaps there's a quantum or many-worlds metaphor/semantics that is equally or more valid, for example. -t

Machine-side efficiency is a key driver of design for most experts of language (interpreter) implementation. They can be socially or philosophically inept, but masters at squeezing out the last drops of space and speed from digital hardware. <strong>I believe current descriptions and documentation are heavily tainted by hardware-centric concerns</strong>, and any commonality may reflect that hardware-centric viewpoint. (There is also a body a "free" interpreter-building tools and parts that may taint viewpoints of implementors even though they may not be the most efficient.

           It illustrates a probable flaw in your reasoning technique by showing a pattern of the flaw occurring both in your analysis of machines (software) and of human beings. Something about someone's motivation is "clear" to you because you inject your internal interpretation or estimate of what's going on into your external description of that other person, place, or thing. There's no clear, unique logic path that can be externally presented that proves that insults are a sure sign the other person is "losing the debate". There can by myriad reasons a person insults another (including frustration). But you discard those and go with your personal "gut" feeling, mistaking it for "clear" (your words). I believe at this point it should be obvious to the reader that <strong>you have a projection problem</strong> with BOTH humans and machines, and that's why discussions with you are difficult and anti-science.

We don't have to rely on observations of output to examine program behaviour any more than we have to rely on the output of a pocket calculator to understand an algebraic formula.

           This is consistent with science: some phenomena are difficult to analyze. Evidence for the Higgs boson was hard to come by based on limited clues, but with enough experiments, the models can be reasonably evaluated. With imperative languages we use the <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> of sequential execution and independent statements and break expressions or programs down into smaller programs so we can analyze the "parts" in a more isolated setting to avoid the flood of too many factors fogging the results. In practice, an optimizer may re-org the execution order etc. to make more efficient use of existing hardware. For example, an optimizer can execute some loops or statements in parallel rather than sequential if it detects certain patterns (of non-time-dependance). Thus, Sequence is merely a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> to better tie it to human experience. One's mental model or machine model (optimizer) does not have to live with such <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>s. <strong>There are multiple valid paths to match the working definition of "I/O profile". None are "canonical"</strong>, other than perhaps via popularity vote (which is a sticky issue and may be shaped by "hardware habits", as much of our terminology and idioms come from past physical design, such as "dialing" a phone number).

           I think you are thinking I'm claiming one can "learn about" the program and/or language in a <em>thorough way</em> by studying the output in this particular example. That's NOT my claim. The test only validates the model formed by other tests, mostly based on simpler app programs. This is typical of science: we run controlled experiments on small or isolated parts, and then use that insight to form models, and then check those models against observations in more realistic conditions ("the field"). One tends not to gain the details from the field, but merely <strong>confirm the models</strong> gained from more controlled experiments.

They didn't settle on them because some equation or <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> said THIS IS THE RIGHT WAY TO DESIGN A LANGUAGE. Further, they are heavily influenced by math notation, which was invented before machines could process math. Math was designed to communicate with humans, not machines. And like I've said many times, existing documentation on dynamic type-related issues sucks. As far as debuggers, that's discussed above.

From an "I/O profile" point of view, a program that prints a random number is a different program every time it runs because its output is different every time it runs.  In short, "I/O profile" is meaningless, except perhaps when applied to individual language statements.  When it's applied to individual language statements, it becomes merely an awkward way of describing the semantics of language statements, and then it requires a conflation of I/O statements and language statements in order to be meaningful.

           I already told you why your "list of primes" would fail a "full" I/O profile test. You keep falling back into the habit of only testing one case. And TRUE random numbers would require outside INPUT. I know of no language that has a built in true random number generator. You are scraping for obscure excuses via obscure features. It appears to be desperation. And I already addressed your complaint about I/O statements. I'm not going to repeat it.

Since most modern pseudo-random number generators are seeded by some source of entropy, they're sufficiently random for the purpose of demonstrating that your "I/O profile test" trivially fails.  Another example is a program that simply prints the current time; using your "I/O profile test" it's a different program when the time changes.  As for proving whether or not two interpreters/modules "run" the same language, you can't.

And in a practical sense, it does NOT depend on testing every possibility. No scientific theory can be 100% tested for 100% cases. Sampling is common and normal in science and the metric is as accurate as you want, per resource devotion (economics). We've been over these already. Every language I know either uses the system clock and/or a seed value to manage random number generation, generally because lack of repeatability makes testing applications a PITA (and science too). And your "alternative" appears to be either "nothing" or "trust the author". Clearly, my approach is better than "nothing" or "just trust me" even IF your nitpicky edge cases and fake flaw claims were real problems (which they are not). I'm racing ghosts, it seems.

Further, our "type" issues are not related to clocks, so it's only an academic issue here. You are inventing problems.) And what exactly is "mathematical science"? And semantics are NOT defined (in any clear, objective way). Thus, if you depend on that fact, you are screwed royally.

           Higher math is often difficult for most people and programmers. Using an imperative algorithm may make a more palatable model. Your mistake is to assume the math-centric models are the One True Model, which is utter bullshit. Further, higher math cannot practically be used to prove compilers/interpreters are 100% accurate. At least some empiricism (spot testing) is necessary.

           My working definition of "language behavior" is the described I/O profile. And yes, I agree language documentation should be fixed, but nobody agrees on how to fix it. I have not seen dynamic types documented well and I myself DON'T KNOW HOW to do it well using primarily English. That's precisely why I formed the tag model because I can <strong>show instead of tell</strong> using communication techniques most programmers must know to get a job: empirical code and XML. It's not perfect, but it's either better than the crap out there, or provides an alternative way to explain dynamic types (in terms of observable behavior) to supplement or replace other techniques a programmer may struggle with.  And I reject your claim of a canonical model of internal "values".

           <em>How could an "I/O profile" (it's still not clear what that is) describe language behaviour?  Assume input is received in the first of ten statements, and output is produced in the last of ten statements.  How does the "I/O profile" explain what happens when the eight statements with neither input nor output are executed?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Didn't you already ask a question like that? You seem to be assuming that one develops a model based on a SINGLE I/O instance, which is rarely the case. "Profile" is a "wide" profile. Remember the double-loop? And I/O profile cannot build models itself, it only validates them. And, usually smaller simpler snippets would be used to analyze I/O profile to help form initial models. One wouldn't typically start with a complex example of the kind you describe. Such a thing would be used to test the model, not form it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Even if you develop a "'wide' profile", with the majority of programs the I/O portions will be a small percentage of the overall processing, such that the majority of the run-time behaviour will only be indirectly related to I/O.  If, on the other hand, you're simply using I/O to validate individual statements and operators, then you're not creating an "I/O profile", you're simply using I/O to explore and verify language semantics.  I/O, in that case, is just a tool roughly equivalent to using a debugger, though probably not as good because it conflates I/O with the statement or operator you're examining.</em>

           I'm not sure what you are getting at still. "Individual statement" outside of syntax is merely a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> (for humans). They don't have to exist to qualify the interpreter. The interpreter does not have to process stuff sequentially, like one would typically do on paper, for example.

Of course, in most imperative programming languages, parallel execution can create very different results from sequential execution -- whether intended or not -- such that parallelisation does affect semantics.  For that reason, most imperative programming language compilers employ parallelisation in very strict and controlled contexts.  In such contexts, parallel execution is indistinguishable -- from a user's point of view -- from sequential execution, so the semantics are invariably (for simplicity's sake) described in sequential terms.</em>

           It's always good to have rigor behind claims or opinions. And you already know my opinion about existing manuals. You even agreed that Php's online manual is poorly done for certain aspects. The existing writing on dynamic types, in particular, for dynamic languages sucks dirty smelly ass on a good day. Nobody knows how to write about them in a clear and approachable way. With a few tricks, one can generally cajole such languages to get what they want without a having clear model, but having a clear model is still a nice thing. An imperative model may be as good as anything out there being that the bar is so low. And your "finite time period" is not a significant complaint, per <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>. It sucks less than the alternatives.

           <em>Rigour is good where rigour is possible.  Much like a high resolution image cannot be made from a low resolution image, high rigour cannot be created from low rigour.  If PHP's online manual is the best description we have of PHP semantics, you'll not make them more rigorous by rephrasing them, unless you extrapolate rigour from somewhere else -- such as general understanding of dynamically-typed imperative programming languages.  Regarding the "finite time period" required by your "I/O Profile", I mentioned it because as you've described your "I/O Profile", it is not possible to derive an "I/O Profile" in a finite period of time.  That makes it useless, as described.  However, if we read between the lines, it seems your "I/O Profile" is nothing more than a collection of examples of source code and the run-time behaviour of the resulting programs.  That's fine, and a helpful way of confirming or understanding language semantics.  It does not, however, add any more rigour than any other example programs.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't know how to use English to describe dynamic types well, and have not found anybody who has. Thus, I created an imperative model instead because most programmers know imperative programming. We've been over this many times already repeatedly redundantly. As far as <a href="IoProfile.html">IoProfile</a>, it's a fallacy to say that something is useless because it's imperfect. By the same reasoning, science would also be "useless" because we cannot practically observe every particle at every instance everywhere. <strong>Science accepts "spot testing" as a practical alternative to idealism</strong> (a God-wide view of all). You are being obstinate for obstinate's sake. Shape up! And your "collection of programs" claim is wrong.

           An example of the "leak" issue is that it would be acceptable for a debugger to display an expression stack as expressions are being evaluated (such as stepping thru expressions). However, expression stacks are not typically part of the language documentation (nor a common head model among typical programmers) and are often considered an implementation detail. Thus, debuggers are NOT required to match "language semantics as documented". My model does not contradict typical debuggers anyhow.

        Suppose a new programmer learns to program in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> (JS) and gets a few years under their belt. Then they are asked to program in VB-Script (VBS). At first the different syntax throws them for a loop (no pun intended), but after a short while they mentally learn to translate VBS into JS back and forth in the mind (and learn rules of thumb to handle the differences in capabilities). They are <strong>not reading meaning</strong> directly from VBS, but translating it into JS in their mind. It's essentially "dumb" syntactical translation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We can extrapolate this scenario into the mechanical view. Syntactical patterns could probably be mentally mapped to mechanical constructs (which are capable of producing the correct output). In fact "stack" comes from a mechanical idiom.

        <em>Of course they don't "run" English.  "Assign an expression to a variable" is the English we use to describe the language semantics, but "assign", "expression" and "variable" are all real language constructs regardless what we call them.</em>

        You are describing syntax elements. Even a non-AI machine can identify such parts (AKA parser).

      <p>
        <em>No, syntax only describes the above as something like "<sequence of characters> <symbol> <sequence of characters> ( <symbol> <sequence of characters> [ '(' <blah blah blah> ')' ] )*".  Syntax defines allowable arrangements of symbols that form valid sentences in a language.

      </p>
      <p>
        "Meaning" as it takes place in human heads is not directly measurable. Two interpreters having similar behavior (I/O profile) only tells us they have similar behavior. To say anything about some supernatural force called "semantics" is not useful because it's not scientifically analyzable (so far). It's useless to talk about such, it does not help communication. Please stop. I can say interpreters have a force called Zazzo in them. You can neither confirm nor deny it's existence in interpreters. "Semantics" is no more meaningful to me than Zazzo.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Meaning as it takes place in human heads is irrelevant for our purposes, and it only matters to programmers to the extent that they need to understand how programming languages work in order to use them.  Our interest in language semantics -- as software engineers, computer scientists, or language designers -- ends long before we reach the point of considering a programmer's interpretation of language semantics.  As a language designer, it is sufficient to document the intended semantics -- using English, formal notations, code examples, or a reference implementation -- and from that a compiler/interpreter author can create a compiler or interpreter that implements them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Their "work" is defined in terms of behavior. And written descriptions sometimes employ <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>s, yes, but that does not make them universal truths.

      <p>
        <em>What does this have to do with </em><a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>s?  Semantics defines behaviour; semantics also defines static structures, relationships between language components, and so on.<em></em>

        Quibbling over lack of science? Guilty!

      </p>
      <p>
        Math is what we use to communicate and document models of reality. Ideally, all parts of models should be tested against reality to make sure there is not a problem somewhere with assumptions/givens or math/model derivation or computation mistakes. (In practice we spot-check instead of check everything.) However, I don't really see how it's relevant here since this is no mathematical model of semantics actually being used in these debates.
      </p>
      <p>
        [That is one use to which we put it, but it's not the only one. And even if it were, it still wouldn't make applying natural science techniques appropriate. Your final point is also incorrect. Some of the semantics under discussion have been mathematical and the one on <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> is a portion of a mathematical one presented informally. Other models have been physical, as in the ones implemented in compilers and interpreters.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a> has models that may be influenced by semantics, but that's not the same as mathematically examining semantics, such as determining equivalency of semantics from one model to another or one language to another.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Mathematically examining semantics can be done with <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> and other formalisms, but I don't think that's necessary in order to recognise the simple and inarguable fact that "a = foo() + b;" has the same semantics in every popular imperative programming language.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I have to disagree. There are multiple <em>different</em> mental models that can process or analyze such expressions similar to how there are different algorithms to process it. Again, you seem to be mistaking your personal preference or existing mental model for a universal truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        {"Mental models" are irrelevant.  However, even if we consider programmer's "mental models", it's highly unlikely that a programmer will have one mental model for "a = foo() + b;" in Python and a completely different mental model for "a = foo() + b;" in PHP.  Do <strong>you</strong> have different mental models for "a = foo() + b;" in Python and PHP?}
      </p>
      <p>
        But one can often just cross-translate one into the other, like I already described. One may be mentally syntactically translating PHP into VBS in their head if they are used to VBS and are a newbie at Php. Thus, it could be only a single "semantic" with mostly syntactical translation. Further, that says nothing about inter-mind semantics even IF an individual were using the "same semantics" for common dynamic languages. Studies on monkeys who have their arms chopped off and then have a prosthetic robot limb added shows they use the same "arm" portion of their brain (via scans) to successfully control the prosthetic limp. They don't have to grow a brand new "limb lobe", they reuse what's already there and just translate at a higher level. The monkeys are using reusing the same "arm semantics".
      </p>
      <p>
        {The fact that you can "cross-translate" from one language to another based on common syntax is proof of identical semantics.}
      </p>
      <p>
        In a specific head? Maybe, but that's not a useful fact for our purposes. It says nothing about a shared semantics among similar languages or among different heads. It can be "explained" by using a single instance of semantic, plus syntactical translation, to get by using a single semantic in an individual's head. There's no "common semantics" there's only ONE semantic. It's not "identical" (your word), it's the <em>same</em> instance. "Identical" implies copies that are equivalent. There's is <strong>no copy</strong> in this scenario. I suppose the same identical "thing" is by definition identical to itself, but that's a <a href="UselessTruth.html">UselessTruth</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        {No, how language semantics are interpreted by a "specific head" or "different heads" is irrelevant.  The fact that a statement like "a = foo() + b;" will perform the same computations at run-time in all popular imperative programming languages (modulo those differences in <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a> behaviour documented on <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>) is proof of identical semantics.}

Many rigorous things do not require formal methods in order to be rigorously understood.  A good example are the rules for chess, which can be played at an international competition level without recourse to formal notations.  Programming language semantics are rather like chess, in that there are pieces -- functions, variables, values, expressions, literals, types, operators, etc. -- and rules -- syntax and semantics -- governing their interaction.  Also like chess, we can discuss the "rules" in English (or whatever other human language we understand), supplementing them with examples in the programming language under discussion.}

           It was you guy(s) who insisted there was One Standard/Common/Canonical "semantics", but I am highly skeptical because semantics is human thoughts and different brains can process things differently (and still arrive at a similar or same answer).

        {I don't recognise "I/O profile" as being meaningful, so I neither promote nor demote statements that perform I/O.  I don't treat them as any different from any other statements, so I may include them or exclude them as I see fit.}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you don't recognize it, what alternative do you use to compare and verify that one interpreter is equivalent to another (runs the same language)? Assume poorly written manuals for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        {I don't preclude using I/O as part of empirical verification of semantics, but it's hardly the sole means for grasping language semantics, and I certainly don't regard I/O as any more or less significant than any other means.  You can also read the documentation -- "poorly written" does not preclude understanding language semantics -- or examine the run-time behaviour of statements in a debugger.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider the I/O profile the best arbiter of language and interpreter equivalency. There are indeed multiple ways to "learn about" languages, but they each have weak areas. English documentation can be vague in certain areas, and debuggers can "leak" implementation specifics, and may not represent "output" well and/or be different per language vendor, for example. But in this context, we are talking about proof, not about learning.

        If an entry showing a (hopefully) simple example of a difference between syntax and semantics is inappropriate on a page called semantics discussion, then perhaps I am misinterpreting the name. I would probably grok it more quickly if it were called TopsSemanticsDiscussion.

        <em>Why does everyone use English to represent semantics, and say "this is the semantics..."? It's your personal interpretation of semantics.

        [They don't. If we were two people who spoke only Russian, we would be using Russian instead of English. We're using English here because it's the language of choice here.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I doubt using Russian would free it from similar problems. English, as usually used, is insufficiently rigorous for our needs, such as measuring semantic equality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's entirely possible to represent semantics without using human language.  </em><a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> is a good example.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then use it to prove your similarity/equivalency claims. Plus, you haven't demonstrated that DS is capturing ONLY semantics and not something else, such as restated algorithms mislabeled as "semantics". We've been over this already. Do we really need to reinvent this fight here again?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What is a "restated algorithm mislabeled as 'semantics'"?  Semantics refers to the meaning (in both human and computational terms) of language statements.  How would a language statement be a "restated algorithm"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we know that whatever notation "comes out of" DS represents/encodes "semantics" and not the other things mentioned?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A language consists only of syntax and semantics, so if what's being described isn't syntax -- for which we have EBNF and other formal notations -- then it must be semantics.

I don't know of any programming language reference manual -- which is a description of language syntax and semantics -- that contains a "restated algorithm mislabelled as 'semantics'", so I don't know why <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> would somehow capture it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Syntax or semantics might be true of the language(s) itself, but not necessarily of what DS generates. In other words, limits on what a language must be don't necessarily apply to DS results. You seem to be conflating them. It may be generating an algorithm, for example. And many language manuals do describe some statements/operations using algorithms. I'd even argue that's how the better manuals do it because it's often clearer that way. Plus, instructions normally don't classify themselves such that not seeing a mis-classification doesn't tell us much. A mute person rarely misspeaks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm afraid I don't follow any of this, except for "And many language manuals do describe some statements/operations using algorithms."  It is true that the semantics of some operators can be described algorithmically.  </em><a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> describes them formulaic-ally.  How does that relate to a "restated algorithm mislabeled as 'semantics'"?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know why you can't follow any of it. It's clear to me, upon review. I don't know where the communication breakdown is happening such that I cannot "fix it". How do we know that the formulas generated by DS are "semantics" and not just "algorithms" restated in another way? DS produces something, I'll call X. How do we know that X is semantics and not something else? Remember, I'm asking this about DS, <em>not</em> about "programming languages"; thus your statement "A language consists only of syntax and semantics, so if..." does NOT apply. <strong>I'm asking about characteristics of DS's output</strong>, not (directly) about programming languages at this point. (That's a later step.)

        <em>I don't know what the question "how do we know that the formulas generated by DS are 'semantics' and not just 'algorithms'?" means.

Do you understand what denotational semantics are?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure, but my answer doesn't excuse you from proving that the output of DS is semantics and only semantics (or at least is free of algorithms). If you say the output of X only contains Y, then prove it only contains Y. Whether I understand X is irrelevant to your proof. Your proof wouldn't care if I was dumb.

        That's a copout. Generally one can provide evidence that something is an X instead of Y if they are not bullshitting.

        <em>What is "pure semantics"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Semantics, or a representation of, lacking syntactic and algorithm information, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you given an example of non-"pure semantics", particularly using </em><a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The example in that topic that has a rule that syntax in the form of the left side "means" an operation/function described on the right side:
      </p>
      <code>
        [[A + B]] = plus([[A]], [[B]])<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That is or can be viewed as a partial <em>algorithm</em> that can be used for the purposes of interpreting/compiling language statements. True, one does not have to use it as an algorithm or part of an algorithm, but again "meaning" and "intention" happens in human heads and different heads may do different things with the same given info.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>An algorithm is a set of steps to be followed to solve a problem.  I see no steps, only an equivalence of a syntactic construct to a construct in some other (perhaps mathematical, or perhaps the implementation language) domain.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An algorithm does NOT have to be "steps". Functional and logical algorithms can lack explicit "steps", for example.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The definition of "algorithm" is "a set of steps to be followed to solve a problem." (There's an alternate wording at <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algorithm</a> .) It immediately follows that algorithms have to be composed of steps.]
      </p>
      <p>
        So a logic-constraint type of language, such as non-procedural queries, are not "algorithms"? I don't believe most would agree with that. Those definitions are probably colloquial definitions and not industry-vetted. And even if they were not, they are still not "semantics" any more than queries are "semantics". It appears to me that DS is merely producing alternative syntax for languages that perhaps may aid in analysis, but this is not necessary pure "meaning". It looks more like a half-ass interpreter meta language. It's similar to a device that builds an <a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a>. Would such a device be called a "semantics extractor"? Perhaps, perhaps not, but it's not necessarily isolating <em>unique</em> semantics, but merely one of multiple possible semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        [That is correct, the non-procedural queries would not be an algorithm. Those definitions are the ones provided by the industry, so they are industry-vetted. As for what appears to you, it would help if you opened your eyes. <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> are not half-ass, do tell you what meaning to assign to what language constructs (and is therefore semantics).

        Interpreters/compilers also tell the computer "what meaning to assign to what language constructs". Compilers describe such "meaning" in terms of machine code or machine code patterns and DS uses a kind of meta language. Machine code may not be very friendly to read, but that's a quality/target-audience question, not a definitional issue. Nor are the results unique.

        Such a meta language may be quite useful for a compiler designed for multiple hardware platforms (CPU chip instruction sets) so that we only have to build one "front end" compiler to do roughly half the work, and a meta-language-to-machine-language translator "back end" would be built for each chip type to translate the meta language to the target machine language. (This is somewhat like Microsoft's CLR.) But such a meta language is not "pure semantics". It's at least partially algorithmic information. Nor is it unique: there are multiple ways to define and build such meta languages. Thus, even if by some stretch we consider such meta language "semantics", it does not prove a unique or canonical semantics for a given language family. Perhaps we can force it to be the same for a target family, but this itself does not necessarily prove canonical-ness because we can't rule out the similarity being due to artificial decisions that have the intent/goal of forcing similarity. The existence of semantics was not our point of contention, but COMPARING semantics to objectively say the semantics of X are the same as the semantics for Y. That's our ultimate goal.

           [Such meta languages are used to rigorously (beyond what can be accomplished using natural language) define the semantics of programming languages.

That does not look very much like Microsoft's CLR, where all of the compilers only understand a fixed set of languages. The big difference for this discussion would be that the <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> wouldn't be used as a target language. It would tell the program how to translate from the source language to machine language. Once again, the "pure" and "uniqueness" constraints are unnecessary.

If, at the level of abstraction of interest, they do the same thing, they have the same semantics.]

           DS does not produce semantics, but rather <strong>converts syntax patterns to partly-digested implementations</strong>.

I'm hesitant to call it "semantics" unless we end up agreeing that implementation is a sub-set of semantics. <strong>It's sort of like adding/integrating implementation hints into Backus–Naur Form</strong>.

Even if DS produced "semantics", unless you prove that there is only one possible output string (from DS) for a given language and that output string is the same for both languages, you have not shown equivalent semantics between those two languages. It appears a human worker has to assign "meaning functions" (for lack of a better description) to produce the DS output. Thus, DS is not an objective system.

        DS doesn't produce a meta version of the app source code, but is more like a meta language for meta language producers. I'm not sure I'm saying that right. I'm lacking for a way to describe it well in English right now.

        You seem to be calling descriptions similar to person A's description "semantics" and person B's description an "implementation suggestion" or an "algorithm".
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I see no reason to make a classification distinction. A's description is also an algorithm. A's approach is generally how we learn to describe and process it in grade school and thus it's more entrenched human-wise. But it's <strong>just as arbitrary</strong> if we remove such upbringing influence. You can call both "semantics" if you want, but then you are agreeing that implementation and semantics are or can be the same thing, at least as English descriptions. (Notice how B does not really need a "store" step. Thus, "store" is not universal either.) -t

           That's not necessary semantics. It could be merely symbol substitution such that when somebody sees "assign the result of evaluating expression <expression> to 'x'" on paper one translates that to "x = <expression>" in their code editor. It's an alias. I remember in math class the teacher would show students how to literally take certain sentence patterns and translate it into math notation via "copy part A to part B" kind of things using arrows that mapped source to destination. It was brain-dead syntactical substitution, not necessarily "meaning". A non-English speaker could do it without even knowing what the words meant. (Well, I didn't know what they mean either because they were math-specific phrase conventions, not unlike "Find the Midenheimer Plex Transformation equivalent of X for the non-open set Y" or such. I just followed the substitution steps like a good little savant...sometimes.) As far as one can tell, the phrase you gave is simply a syntax convention that's equivalent or can be viewed as equivalent to the "code" version.

           Few read the language's official documentation to learn. It's usually training-related materials that are used. Official documentation is mostly meant to describe the language to those who already know how to program, not to those starting from scratch.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Training-related materials are fine; they're a reflection of the official documentation, invariably (aside from inadvertent error) reflecting the same syntax and semantics.  As for starting programming from scratch, that's something else entirely.</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           They are not necessarily a reflection of the "official" documentation for a given language. The author may choose different techniques. However, there are indeed common traditions in such writing such that everybody copies each other to some extent.

           If done well, it may work. I have yet to see a good example, but I cannot rule it out. Like I mentioned before, if one can "think in stacks" for expression evaluation, that's perfectly fine. He/she is not committing any sin. And "assign" is not necessarily "meaning". It's just a shared label we give to something.

        I agree they are very different, but that does not tell us precisely what the first thing is in terms of classification.

      <p>
        <em>The first thing is an expression assigned to a variable.  That's what it means, and therefore that is its semantics.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As described above near <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> pattern-839, that could merely be a language pattern that is associated with a syntax pattern through habit or convention. It's not necessarily "meaning". Providing an <strong>alias</strong> is not necessarily meaning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're talking about how it might be inferred.  Inference is irrelevant.  I know of no popular imperative programming language where it would not have been specified as an expression assigned to a variable.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure what you mean by "inferred" in this context. Manuals and training materials follow certain conventions of description, true, but that does not necessarily make those conventions "meaning". They can merely be conventions that are treated as aliases of the kind described near <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> pattern-839. You see "foo is assigned to thing" and you can just mentally translate that to "thing = foo" out of tradition by studying word occurrence patterns in the books. Even a non-English speaker can do such because it's a pattern that can be learned without mentally associating meaning to each of the words or phrases. It's one of the reasons why foreign students often do so well in math in US universities despite flunking out of English 101. If you have a near-photographic memory, you must memorize word pattern usage in math books and plug in the "linguistic parameters" where appropriate. As long as the tests keep to the same conventions, the test taker can apply such linguistic substitution and get a good grade. -t

        <em>Again, you're making reference to inference rather than specification.  Semantics are specified.  Language statements mean what the language designer wants them to mean.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, meaning is whatever anybody wants meaning to be. The language author cannot prevent me from using my favorite model etc. in my head to predict language behavior. Any documentation by the language author is a suggested model/description only. They are not God and their writing is not The Bible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're confusing "meaning" with "interpretation".  Language statements mean what the language designer wants them to mean.  How meaning is interpreted is up to each individual.  Of course, when an individual is the author of a compiler or interpreter, hopefully there is a close concordance between the semantics intended by the language designer and the semantics implemented by the compiler/interpreter author.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You haven't demonstrated that they are fully distinct. One can use whatever model their head wants to analyze and predict source code. Nobody can stop them, not the language author and not you. -t
