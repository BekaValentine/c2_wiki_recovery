        <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> is one of those languages that you tend to either really love or really hate.

        The Turing-completeness rejoinder to the power of languages is, of course, completely fallacious. You can compare Turing-complete languages based on their relative power.

        An advocate would say "everything is easy in Perl."
        A critic might say "everything is hard in Perl."
        One would ask of both, how much experience do you have in other environments? in Perl?
      </p>
      <p>
        I will say that the "smart match" operator, the given/when, and the easy ability to format variables into strings are worth saving--then dump anything else that isn't already widely used in other languages.

        And since we so often want to do the same simple things over and over again (fetching a webpage, sorting a list, grepping a logfile) Perl helps us get out job done more easily.

        Perl is the Quasimodo of programming languages - he is as ugly as hell, but you want him on your side. You can't help but love him, warts and all.

        Today, in my office, two developers with, I estimate, more than 30 years experience between them, having used procedural, functional and OO languages in a range of industrial and research settings throughout that time, were, in the space of a three-hour session, unable to understand how to capture the output of a system command and subsequently pass it into a subroutine. They were new to Perl, and were working from an O'Reilly book. Anyway you slice it, that makes Perl a hard language. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> Here are a few ways to dice it that don't necessarily make Perl a hard language: (i) Your book wasn't good, or (ii) programmers who get stuck in a book and don't use Google to help them resolve their questions are probably imbeciles posing as smart workers. </em>

        I'd say that demonstrates more about your colleagues <a href="RtFm.html">RtFm</a> skills. It's a FAQ for crying out loud! Perl is a language where neophytes really must read a structured introduction; its approach to many common tasks is distinctive.
      </p>
      <p>
        [-- how can use "structured <anything>" and "perl" in the same sentence?! I use perl because its good at processing text. I also hate its ugly syntax and insane inconsistencies <a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a>]

      <code>
        D:\Dev>perldoc -q capture command output<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Output snipped for brevity, but had they bothered to use the tools that come with Perl they would have quickly found the answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Wow! <a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a> for "-q". My Perl RTFM skills kind of stink.]
      </p>
      <p>
        this works every time: 
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+capture+command+output+in+Perl">http://www.google.com/search?q=how+to+capture+command+output+in+Perl</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Aaaa! Eeeek! Had they been working from a reference card rather than a book they might have found backticks faster -- or if they had ever captured the output of a system command in a shell they would have found backticks familiar -- backticks! <a href="BackTicks.html">BackTicks</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        After some discussion here we have determined that the programmers in question had figured out that `command` evaluates to the string which is the captured output of command. They had also figured out that a subroutine with this argument could be called with or without parenthesis. The mystery that stumped them was that the arguments to the call aren't bound to formal parameters as is the practice in most other languages. Instead they are assembled into an array which is bound to the name "_". From here forward <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> programming practice varies ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           $string = $_[0];
        </li>
        <li>
           $string = shift;
        </li>
        <li>
           ($string) = @_;
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Which either directly addresses the first element of the array; removes the next element of the array; or does an all at once assignment of the array to an equal sized list of names.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of these are highly idiomatic with perl. If you know them, then you (probably) think perl's versatility elegant. If not, you are (probably) left searching the manual for examples of a formal parameter list. 
      </p>
      <p>
        such as
      </p>
      <code>
        sub takesthreevalues($$$){<br/>
        my ($firstarg, $secondarg, $thirdarg) = @_;<br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That is how to do pass-by-value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually that's only partially correct. takesthreevalues() is prototyped (a badly overloaded term) to take three and only three values regardless of the context that it is called in. Such a prototype is <em>severely</em> frowned upon by most competent perl programmers. That should be written:
      </p>
      <code>
        sub a_sub_that_takes_uses_up_to_three_vars {<br/>
        my ($firstarg, $secondarg, $thirdarg) = @_;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The crucial difference between these two is the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        my @array=(1,2,3,takesthreeargs 4,5,6,7,8,9);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        is the same as 
      </p>
      <code>
        my @array=(1,2,3,a_sub_that_takes_uses_up_to_three_vars(4,5,6),7,8,9);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Except the latter requires the parens or it will "slurp" all of the args following the sub call. Prototypes mostly exist so that power users (and if you use $$$ willy-nilly IMO you ain't one) to redefine the lexing rules at compile time. As i said most perl programmers almost never use prototypes.

        That sums up my experience: <em>adrift on a conceptual sea without a cognitive compass.</em>  I tried on several occasions to learn Perl, but could not quite wrap my head around it.

        <em>The history of the matter must be understood. As an unfunded open source project, nothing has ever been added to Perl except things that people capable of adding bothered to add, for whatever might have motivated them. And "people" was a very small group until perl 5 was released, and it is still a rarified committee. Having exactly one calling convention makes the linkage to routines easier, just like having a subroutine call standard makes writing assembler easier. If you are really need a formal pass-by-value you might be better writing in C. You can protect data like so: suspicious_subroutine(my @throwaway=($arg1,$arg2,$arg3)) that will prevent suspicious_subroutine from receiving references to the arguments, because they will get copied first.</em>

        <em>In Perl6, it probably will be. Perl programmers never found it necessary - the 3rd approach (above) is the closest. Even function prototypes were a late addition (and they are rarely used).</em>

      <p>
        Also, note the highly effective idiom of calling subroutines with a list of named arguments as in <em>mySubroutine( baz => 'a', foo => 'b' )</em>. This idiom is used  prominently in CGI.pm amongst other places. Such a list is easily converted to a hash table with code such as the following ...
      </p>
      <code>
        sub mySubroutine {<br/>
        # my %param = @_; <br/>
        # here's how to use unordered named parameters with default values<br/>
        my %param = (bar => 37, baz => 24, action => 'hike!', @_);<br/>

        The idiom above is buggy. The QUERY_STRING can contain multiple key/value pairs with the same key. The hash approach would  clobber these. Also, the key/value pair separator is sometimes a semicolon, not an ampersand. CGI.pm takes care of these corner cases. -- RutgerVos

        As a counter to some of the above gloom, I've worked on a mid-sized, Enterprise application written primarily in Perl (about 80KLOC worth, plus some Java and a lot of DHTML). We had competent Perl programmers on the team. The code was well structured and easy to read (once one had become competent in Perl). Perl gave us a lot of leverage, both from powerful regular expressions for munging text, and from the availability of powerful add-ons, like DBI/DBD for database access. Because Perl is interpreted, bug fix turnaround was rapid. We ran circles around people trying to do similar things in Java.
      </p>
      <p>
        We did eventually suffer from lack of stable threading, but that was well along in the product's life cycle, when we were starting to push hard on performance. We also ran into a far amount of "Perl, yuck! Java cool!" bias, including some from customers.

Heck, just see the Perl GUI Programming FAQ at <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=108708.''">http://www.perlmonks.org/?node=108708.''</a>

        I read here and there: a Perl script in 3900 lines, 4500 lines. Does this mean that Perl is not as modular as C? It is a huge script and not a bunch of small modules? -- ra

        <em>Perl can be modular (in fact, more modular than C). Perl has packages, which can hide parts of one file from other parts of the same file, but C does not have (or need) this feature.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding modularity, in the "chunks of code" sense, Perl has a huge number of modules implementing an extremely wide range of functionality distributed as free software on <a href="TheCpan.html">TheCpan</a> (See my comments on that page.) In the "hiding things" sense, good OO Perl will encapsulate carefully to encourage people to do things the right way (see <a href="ObjectOrientedPerl.html">ObjectOrientedPerl</a> for more on this). Of course, though, the language will never force you to do this, because that wouldn't fit with <a href="TimTowTdi.html">TimTowTdi</a>. The Perl you encounter will be only as good as the person that wrote it. -- EarleMartin

        Can you write a bootloader in Perl?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Define bootloader.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Should</em> you write a bootloader in Perl?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Cowards!}
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In this case the essential part of the definition is a bootloader has to run without memory mapping and load certain blobs into certain addresses. Turing completeness doesn't cover everything. A Java applet is still Turing complete but is not fully complete because no virus can be written (assuming no exploit against the sandbox). In fact the Java applet is only Turing complete because it can emulate a complete computing platform, and that platform can have a virus just fine.

        Is there really nothing that Perl cannot do?  I find that <em>very</em> hard to believe.
      </p>
      <p>
        For one thing, I doubt that Perl can trisect an arbitrary angle, using the computational equivalents of a straightedge and compass.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I would be surprised if, given a computational straightedge and compass, Perl can square a circle, or double the volume of a cube.
      </p>
      <p>
        And certainly, if Perl were to integrate the function exp(-x^2) in terms of elementary functions (ie, polynomials, trigonometric functions, exp(x) and ln(x)), I would certainly raise an eyebrow.  And it would be highly amusing if Perl were to come up with integers n, x, y, and z, with n greater than 2, such that x^n + y^n = z^n.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said this, I <em>do</em> know of one thing that Perl can't do:  Perl can't parse its own syntax, without running a Perl program.  Indeed, it has been proven that the halting problem can be encoded into Perl's syntax itself, and it's been proven that no Turing-complete language can solve the halting problem (ie, no program can determine if a given algorithm will be able to complete, without getting into an infinite loop)...which, incidentally, is something else that Perl can't do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, to be fair, these are all things that no computer language can do, because they have been mathematically proven to be impossible; I find it amusing that there are people claiming that there is nothing that Perl cannot do, considering these things!
