        Official Certified Double Blind Peer Reviewed Published Study
      </h1>
      <p>
        Slang for an intense and carefully-documented and reviewed study to "prove" that a given technology is "better" or that a given statement is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This "slang" is used exclusively by </em><a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, and almost always used as a derogatory reference to the standards for evidence that science has set for itself.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's an <strong>in</strong>accurate statement. I usually use the term in reference to situations where somebody wants super-tight evidence in one situation but accept super-loose evidence in another, such as <a href="ArgumentByElegance.html">ArgumentByElegance</a>. In other words, <strong>inconsistency or hypocrisy in evidence level requests</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It would be really nice if we had rigorous studies about contentious paradigms, techniques, tools, BUT, we usually don't. I'm just asking that the same standards and criticisms be applied to <strong>both sides</strong>. Just because I don't have an <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> for my position does not dismiss your side from the same burden. Example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Person A: "The sky on Venus is pink."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Person B: "No it's not; it's green."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Person A: "Do you have an <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> that shows it's green?"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Person B: "No, I don't."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Person A: "I knew it! See, it's pink."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It should be obvious what's wrong with the last statement.

        I usually don't. It's when they imply there is some objective metric or universal truth of superiority that the fireworks starts.

People efficiency is the subject of <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>, HCI and the like.  Studying it is expensive and difficult, and sometimes subject to curious constraints.  For example, the university where I work recently introduced a stringent approval process for studies involving people or other creatures, citing potential ethical issues as a motivation.  The result is that to do any new research -- regardless whether you're an academic or a student -- you must complete a ten page application and get it approved by a university Ethics Committee.  It's a pain to fill out, and speaking as a member of an Ethics Committee, it's a bloody pain to approve.  However, if your research involves <strong>no</strong> human subjects, it's possible to get away with filling out only the first two pages of the application and approval is almost guaranteed.  As a result, myself and the other three academics in my office have refused to conduct or supervise <strong>any</strong> research involving human subjects.

           I didn't dismiss that some CS breakthrough work will come along, but it is harder to find such and SE is an open prairie of opportunity in comparison.

           I don't believe such actually exists (or at least is too sparse and narrow), and I'm not going on a unicorn hunt to verify <strong>your</strong> claim that unicorns exist. You expect the jury to go to the library to research your claim, which is silly. Perhaps it would be "nice" or "convenient" if they did, but you <strong>cannot insist on it</strong>. Your sense of burden is off base here.

           Further, I believe benefits ultimately come down to individual <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>. There is no magic universal formula or <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a>. I believe the best productivity would come from mind-specific tools and mind-specific conventions and the ability to find and hire like-minded individuals. Edward Yourdon's study of <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> productivity suggest this is the case. Early users of <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> scored fairly high in his productivity metrics. However, when <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> became fashionable, many people flooded into it, and productivity flat-lined to match a "typical" language. One tentativeness explanation is that people who pick a language/paradigm/technique/tool because they like it are more productive than those who select it because it's in style. Tool favoritism would make in interesting study, but I don't have the resources to pull it off. Studies with just "code counts", such as <a href="CodeChangeImpactAnalysis.html">CodeChangeImpactAnalysis</a>, may not show any significant objective differences. While this may demonstrate that there are no (objective) golden hammers, and quiet some zealots, it won't deal with <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> issues, and that's why I'm not that interested in them. <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> studies, which would hit far closer to my interest and claims, are far more expensive, and beyond my means. (A thorough code-change-impact study would probably also be resource-intensive, per <a href="WhyNoChangeShootout.html">WhyNoChangeShootout</a>.)  -t

           "Like"? I think not. Your arrow is really a boomerang. Your sample studies are a horrible selection as far as the kind of topics we usually argue over.
