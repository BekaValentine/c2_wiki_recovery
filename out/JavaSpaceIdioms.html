        Java Space Idioms
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page lists various <a href="JavaSpace.html">JavaSpace</a> patterns and idioms. Most of them are just being moved over from <a href="http://www.cdegroot.com/cgi-bin/jini">http://www.cdegroot.com/cgi-bin/jini</a> as there has been a lot of vandalism there and I think the stuff should be preserved and exposed to a wider audience.

        <a href="JavaSpaces.html">JavaSpaces</a> puts you in a programming mode that is quite different from what you're used (<a href="AssociativeMemory.html">AssociativeMemory</a>), and in some ways the transition may be bigger than the one from procedural to object-oriented computing. Furthermore, it is a pretty low-level implementation of <a href="TupleSpace.html">TupleSpace</a> (only "equals" as a matching operator, for starters), and you need unique solutions to solve your problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        This part of the Wiki tries to help you by collecting patterns and idioms for <a href="JavaSpaces.html">JavaSpaces</a> design problems. Patterns need discussion, pondering, shaving, so please participate!
