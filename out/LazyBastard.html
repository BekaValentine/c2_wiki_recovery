        Lazy Bastard
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LeoScott.html">LeoScott</a> insists that the best programmers are lazy programmers.  I think he is right, because an ambitious programmer untempered by <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> and <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> will write too much code, causing as much harm as good.

        Paradoxically, you may find a lazy programmer working very hard.  This happens whenever working hard now will avoid more hard work in the future.  --<a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>

        Sorry, but I think this is bogus.  Lazy programmers are bad programmers. Lazy programmers cut corners, don't bother to keep up in their field, and duck responsibility.  However, efficient programmers--people on top of their craft, their project, and their environment--may appear to be kicking back more than their less efficient brethren. This isn't laziness--it's control. --<a href="DavidThomas.html">DavidThomas</a>

        The word <em>lazy</em> has so many 'negative waves' attached to it that it is hard the see through to the positive. I think this shares some of the problems people have with the label <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a>. I would never call myself efficient and yet I would lay claim to the attributes that <a href="DavidThomas.html">DavidThomas</a> listed. I would call myself lazy in that I am constantly looking for a solution that is simpler than anyone thought possible while making the customer happy and making my life easier. I am always on the lookout for something to leave out, something that makes it so that poeple change their minds or add new features and nothing in my code changes. I think lazy fits much better than efficient. --<a href="LeoScott.html">LeoScott</a>

        Yeah, yeah ... Laziness is the mother of invention and all that. But, I was just thinking that the word <em>Bastard</em> has so many 'negative waves' attached to it that it is hard the see through to the positive.  --<a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a> (<em>See </em><a href="PissTake.html">PissTake</a> for an explanation of the meaning of "bastard" in this context.<em>) </em>

        Maybe the Australian use of the term <em>Bastard</em> is more appropriate here. Think more down the <em>Blighter</em> end of the scale rather than the <em>Complete Twat</em> end.

        There is a real <a href="LazyProgrammer.html">LazyProgrammer</a> page. Maybe this stuff should go there?
