        "Reflections," a Windows graphical FTP product writes "100" as the year to its log files.  That is, each log file line starts with "01/07/100 " (previously "12/27/99").
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Impact:</strong>  Minor annoyance to people, should they look at the log files.  (...which only happens when other problems cause the program to fail.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Remediation:</strong>  Currently ignoring the problem.  If scripts automatically read and interpreted the log files, they would probably be patched.
        <em>(Better yet, have the vendor fix the FTP program that produces the log file!)</em>

        <strong>Credit card charges on January 1st charged over & over...  forever.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Discovered:	Wednesday, January 5th
        </li>
        <li>
          Fixed:	Last year, but many small merchants did not upgrade until early January 2000.
        </li>
        <li>
          Impact: Visa and MasterCard charges made on January 1st were also charged on 2nd, 3rd, 4th, etc...  Problem happened at some of 100,000 merchants that use the CyberCash software.
        </li>
        <li>
           Cause: CyberCash software uses file name of last digit of year + 2 digit month to store charges.  But it also uses the special file name "001" for charges not yet posted.  So January 1st charges erroneously went to the special file.
        </li>
        <li>
           Remediation:	Banks will find and fix most duplicate charges before you're billed.  Check your Visa and MasterCard bills carefully.

        </li>
        <li>
           Cause: Unclear; expiration dates (on mag stripe or in central database???) should have been automatically extended when users "deposited" more money.
        </li>
        <li>
           Remediation: Use real cash, or checks.

        (evidently this was due (can't find the damned link) to having used an "almost correct" algorithm for counting days in the year -- y2k was a leap year although normally years evenly divisible by 400 are not)

        <em>Why does a thermostat know what day it is?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some nice computerized thermostats that (in the winter) turn down the heat when no one is (expected to be) home, then up the heat and start warming the house just before the first person is (expected to be) back from work.
        Since the leave-the-house and return-to-house times are typically *different* on the weekends than on regular weekdays, they work best when they are set to the correct time and correct day-of-week.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I agree with the main point -- there's no reason for a thermostat to know what *year* it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm pretty sure that you need to know the year to be able to correctly tell when a day falls on a weekend or weekday due to leap years and other calendar oddities.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not if you know what day it was 7 days ago.  Maybe it knows public holidays as well?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When Thermostats become part of the <a href="InternetOfThings.html">InternetOfThings</a>, such things might need to be known, particularly when the host and the Client must operate independently on occasion. See: IndependentOperationOptions
