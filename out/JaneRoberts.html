        <em>The only hope we have is for good people to discipline their innate tendency to do bad things.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The spontaneous self, the inner self left alone, is a good thing. And we will not go into a definition of the word <em>good</em>! Left alone, the inner self keeps your body functioning and your eyesight keen; it keeps your balance perfect; it keeps you alive. It gives you a sense of joy and vitality and it fills you with a joy of All-That-Is, which is my term for the word <em>God</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Left alone, then, you are a perfect creature - and you feel a oneness with nature. And when you walk down the street, you feel a unity between your fingertips and the leaftops and between you feet and the pavement beneath them. It is only when you meddle with the spontaneous self that difficulties arise - and these difficulties you may, if you prefer, call evil.
      </p>
      <p>
        Evil arises, and we will not go into a definition of the word <em>evil</em>, when - and precisely when - you do not realize that the inner self is the source of joy, vitality and creativity! At that point, indeed, when doubts enter in, then you mistrust yourself and the inner self that forms your physical image. Then when you do not accept the spontaneous self, you decide you will accept certain feelings and deny others. And those that you deny, that you do not regard as acceptable, these grow up within you until they achieve a strong charge; <em>and </em>those repressed charges, individually and <em>en masse </em>, cause violence! <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you want to equate the word <em>violence </em> with <em>evil</em>, then that is the origin of it; and it is mistrust of the spontaneous self - the inner self - that is within you all.

        <em>I guess I agree that repressing your feelings leads to an explosive anger, but it seems to me that, recognizing this, the individual should strive to look for the goodness in himself and cultivate it a little bit - given the world situation and all...</em>
