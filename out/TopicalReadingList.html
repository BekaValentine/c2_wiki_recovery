        A new method of reading the wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Method: An editor creates a list of pages and external links which serves as an aid in understanding a topic which is considered important enough to consist of several to many pages. It should contain just enough related text as to make the page understandable to the many readers who visit this wiki from time to time.
      </p>
      <p>
        While several mechanism already exist which are aids in reading the wiki, such as Categories (see <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a> and its <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s) and <a href="RoadMaps.html">RoadMaps</a>, this would be another way readers would be able to become better informed on important and valuable topics which have grown in this garden.
