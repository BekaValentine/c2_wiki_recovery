        Thank to <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>, I have realized that this proposal is in the same gist as <a href="ManaMana.html">ManaMana</a>/<a href="ViewPoint.html">ViewPoint</a>/<a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a>, except with the B word added. I'll see if I can whip up yet another parallel codebase later this summer. ;-) -- <a href="ClaesWallin.html">ClaesWallin</a>

        My thought is basing it on <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>s bzr - weaves look very nice. Or knits as they are called now.

        I'm considering building something like this when making the jump from a static <a href="WebLog.html">WebLog</a> to a Bliki (<a href="WikiBlog.html">WikiBlog</a>). Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why a bliki?</strong> I want to enable commenting on my site, and Wiki seems like a reasonable way to do it. In one form or another. Also, it would leverage <a href="WikiMarkup.html">WikiMarkup</a> for my blog entries, and it would allow me to keep entries short, but still develop the ideas on the side, for anyone interested.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Why alternate timelines?</strong> I am "afraid" of spam. But I am also afraid of strangling the input by moderating comments. So if I could let people run haywire in their own timeline and then carefully choose which one is the default, I would have both unregulated commentability and a clean version for the casual passers-by. The interested viewer could navigate from the default point into the not-yet-default future and sideways into censored edits, for full transparency.

        The main problem is probably how to present this in a usable way.
