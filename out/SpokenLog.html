        Spoken Log

      <p>
        I've been trying to keep closer tabs on this site so that I can understand the ways people act here. This weekend I added voice synthesis. This turns out to be a lot of fun and pretty informative too. I'm writing to other server operators to encourage them to give this a try. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

      <p>
        My mac has a command line program that will pronounce text. If I want it to say hello to the world I would type:
      </p>
      <code>
        say hello world<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I can add this to my perl wiki server by adding the line:
      </p>
      <code>
        system("say $page&");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Place it in wiki.cgi just after where it figured out the requested page. I add the & to the command so that the server doesn't wait for the speaking to finish before serving the page. This could be a lot of fun if you're running a wiki for a group of people who happen to sit near the server. A more useful variation might be to add the speaking to the edit.cgi script. This would announce which pages are being edited so that people can avoid conflicts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I don't actually sit anywhere near my server so I had to monitor its activity remotely. I'm used to using tail -f to watch my server logs. This works fine through secure shell too:
      </p>
      <code>
        ssh c2.com 'tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So I wrote this into a perl script, something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        open(L, "ssh c2.com 'tail -f /var/log/httpd/access_log'|");<br/>
        while(<L>) {<br/>
        system("say $1&") if /([A-Z][a-z]+([A-Z][a-z]+)+)/;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This looks for wiki names in the log and pronounces them as fast as they come. I put the system call into a subroutine and added a sleep to limit the rate to one a second.
      </p>
      <code>
        sub say {<br/>
        system("say $1&");<br/>
        sleep(1);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Longer names take more than a second to say so the talking can overlap. But this is easy to understand so long as the starts are staggered.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've added a second voice for more rare events, like posts back to the server for saved pages:
      </p>
      <code>
        system("say -v Bruce post&") if /POST/;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Bruce is easy to understand even when my default voice, Victora, is gabbing away. I've actually added five or six triggers for Bruce. When he gets going I know someone is doing something weird to my server.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also found it useful to ignore the robots. With them crusing through my site the talking gets way too complicated. I added this right inside the while loop:
      </p>
      <code>
        next if /googlebot.com/;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You will have to tune what you look for and how you say it so that you get a good feel for what is going on moment by moment. Once you have it working, try watching the log the old fashion way in a separate window. You'll find more things you might want to pronounce.

        Cool idea, Ward, but where did you get the command line program 'say'? All I can do is
      </p>
      <code>
        osascript -e 'say "Hello world"'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which means I'm telling my shell to tell <em></em><a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a><em> to say something. -- </em><a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>say</em> is available in 10.3.
      </p>
      <p>
        Aha! I'm 10.2. So if I get a <a href="RoundTuit.html">RoundTuit</a> I'll write a script that wraps the osascript call.
      </p>

        If you have a windows machine and want to use <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, this might help. I wrote it when I first saw Ward's post. (You have to have MS Speech SDK 5.1 <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/speech/download/sdk51">http://www.microsoft.com/speech/download/sdk51</a> , Python <a href="http://www.python.org">http://www.python.org</a> , and python win32all module <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=78018</a> installed on your computer)
      </p>
      <code>
        import win32com.client<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        MARY_VOICE='Microsoft Mary'<br/>
        voice= win32com.client.Dispatch("SAPI.SpVoice")<br/>
        default_voice=voice.Voice.GetDescription()<br/>
        voice.Speak("Hello %s. I'm %s. Nice to meet you."%(MARY_VOICE,default_voice))<br/>
        voice.Voice=voice.GetVoices("Name=%s"%MARY_VOICE, "Language=409").Item(0)<br/>
        voice.Speak("Hello %s. I am glad to meet you."%default_voice)<br/>
        voice.WaitUntilDone(-1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There are three voices included in the sdk : Mary, Mike and Sam. Take a look at the speech sdk in msdn.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to use wsh instead, make a file named speak.pys:
      </p>
      <code>
        #speak.pys<br/>
        voice = WScript.CreateObject("Sapi.SpVoice")  <br/>
        voice.Speak("Hello world") <br/>
        voice.WaitUntilDone(-1) <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and run "wscript speak.pys"
      </p>
