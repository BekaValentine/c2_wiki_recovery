        Applets Are Applications Too
      </h1>
      <p>
        A technique that I have found to be very useful is to take the time to make sure that <a href="JavaApplet.html">JavaApplet</a>s can be run as applications too.
      </p>
      <p>
        This takes some additional work, but in the long run (particularly for large systems), it is definitely worth it. In particular, it confers several benefits that I appreciate:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The system can be unit tested more easily. Stopping and restarting a <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a> (all too common) is painful (shades of DOS Alt-Ctl-Del for pointer errors comes to mind).
        </li>
        <li>
           It can give you more flexibility down the road if you decide to make the system an application.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It does introduce some complexities though. In particular, you will need to maintain 2 versions of the code associated with your applet/application. Additionally, if you are depending upon <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a> authentication (such as HTTP Basic Authentication), you will need to build some kind of dialog which prompts the user for their login and password.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, if your application requires tight integration with the browser (i.e., lots of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and other browser-based technologies), then this may not be a good strategy for you.
      </p>

        My few applets are designed to download as quickly as possible. So they don't contain any application code that they don't need to do their applet job.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be easy to make a variant of AppletViewer than can turn any applet into an application by configuring it with the applet's class name. I've never felt the need for this because I can do what I need with AppletViewer itself. If you want it for a test harness you should develop a test harness.

        It doesn't take much to make a <a href="JavaApplet.html">JavaApplet</a> run as an application. All you have to do is write a main() method that creates a frame and slaps the applet into the frame. In fact, <a href="VisualAgeForJava.html">VisualAgeForJava</a> automatically generates this kind of code for you when you create an applet. I tend to think that the benefits of writing the few additional lines of code outweigh the (few) additional bytecodes that the method generates.

        Well, it takes a little more than that. You need to support getParameter() and a bunch of other stuff. It can (and should) be factored out, so you end up with something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        new UK.co.bhresearch.Applet.AppletViewer( new MyApplet() );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        in the MyApplet main() method. In which case you might as well also have:
      </p>
      <code>
        new AppletViewer( Class.forName(args[0]).newInstance() );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        in the AppletViewer class. In which case, why bother with the code in MyApplet?
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that removing those 100 bytes or so from the applet is an extreme optimization, but in some cases it's justified, given how little extra utility they add.

        You mean a class like Acme.MainFrame? See 
        <a href="http://www.acme.com/java/software/Acme.MainFrame.html">http://www.acme.com/java/software/Acme.MainFrame.html</a>
        This class allows applets to stand alone. (However it was written with pre JDK 1.1 <a href="JavaEventHandling.html">JavaEventHandling</a>.)
