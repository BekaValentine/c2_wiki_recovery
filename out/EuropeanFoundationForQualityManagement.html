        European Foundation For Quality Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        An industry body endorsed by the European Union, the EFQM seeks to promote a version of <a href="TotalQualityManagement.html">TotalQualityManagement</a> throughout the EU. The EFQM maintains an <a href="ExcellenceModel.html">ExcellenceModel</a> against which companies may be audited.
      </p>
      <p>
        EFQM assessment differs from <a href="IsoNineThousand.html">IsoNineThousand</a> accreditation since it is a measure, not a boolean, and since it asks whether or not your processes are <em>any good</em>, as measured by the satisfaction of your stakeholders: managers, employees, customers, suppliers, partners, and, ultimately, the general public.
