        This arose out of the <a href="ShieldPattern.html">ShieldPattern</a> discussion, where I seemed to find that there were a lot of different ideas about what a <a href="ShieldPattern.html">ShieldPattern</a> was, and they all seemed to be correct, but at different levels of detail.  So, I put forth that the <a href="ShieldPattern.html">ShieldPattern</a> was a <a href="MetaPattern.html">MetaPattern</a>, but that discussion seemed to be more about a way to discuss patterns better.  Thus, this page.  --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
