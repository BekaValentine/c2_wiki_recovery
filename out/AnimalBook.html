           A book published by O'Reilly Publishing (<a href="OreillyAndAssociates.html">OreillyAndAssociates</a>, <a href="http://www.oreilly.com)">http://www.oreilly.com)</a> which has an artful drawing of an animal on the cover.

           Any book published by O'Reilly Publishing.

        This is quite a good idea. It gives their line of books a uniform appearance while still giving each book an individual identity, with the <a href="CamelBook.html">CamelBook</a> as the prime example. Similar is WroxPress using photos of authors on the covers.
        O'Reilly has posted a few essays about their use of animals on book covers: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20090226012506/http://letters.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/letters/2003/animal_index_0203.html">http://web.archive.org/web/20090226012506/http://letters.oreilly.com/pub/a/oreilly/letters/2003/animal_index_0203.html</a> Date: February 2003

        Don't you love the way they had a perfectly good animal given the title of this book, but completely disregarded it?

        <em>There is a reason: </em><a href="http://www.rmi.net/~lutz/lp-cover-post.html">http://www.rmi.net/~lutz/lp-cover-post.html</a> Wood rats <strong>must</strong> learn about Pythons!<em></em>

        <em>Alternatively, maybe this is why:</em>

        The "Learning" books often have smaller, cuter animals than other books. Compare

        I'm not sure there's such a thing as a cute python, but a cute rodent is easy.
