        Domain Expert

      <p>
        The term domain expert is frequently used in expert systems software development, and there the term always refers to the domain other than the software domain.

      <ul>
        <li>
           A domain expert is a person with special knowledge or skills in a particular area of endeavor. An accountant is an expert in the domain of accountancy, for example.

        <li>
           The development of accounting software requires knowledge in two different domains, namely accounting and software.

        <a href="DomainExpert.html">DomainExpert</a> is a fancy term to describe people in a company with valuable functional knowledge, often called <a href="DomainKnowledge.html">DomainKnowledge</a>.

        It's a highly useful concept, one which the business community didn't value until a couple of years ago.  After firing numerous such people, and not realizing the productivity gains or cost decreases they expected, businesspeople asked why--and finally noticed what's obvious to many of us--employees with specific knowledge in some problem domain are worth their weight in gold.  Nowadays, you hear managers in corporations all around the world (who used to extravagantly claim that employees were all fungible commodities--sort of like cattle) speaking of <a href="DomainExpert.html">DomainExpert</a>s in reverent tones.
