        Greg Vaughn

      <p>
        A terrific Java developer who works for Delphi Consultants in the Dallas area.
        (Unless, of course, some other "Greg Vaughn" has coincidentally started 
        contributing to the <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> just two weeks after I first mentioned it to the
        Greg Vaughn I know.)
      </p>
      <p>
        No coincidence. However, I have run into quite a few other <a href="GregVaughn.html">GregVaughn</a>(s) on the Internet. I don't know how many emails I get from people who think I am the baseball player
