        Gordon Letwin
      </h1>
      <p>
        Gordon is one of the most amazing programmers on the planet.
      </p>
      <p>
        He wrote a vast quantity of software for PUCC and other Purdue University organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gordon At Purdue</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gordon practiced software reuse before it was popular. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Back in punched-card days, we used to get a kick out of Gordon's habit of recycling cards. He'd periodically sort his discards and keep them in a box. Then if he subsequently needed a "DO 100 I=1,N", he could pull it out of his box and he wouldn't have to wait in the "express" punch line. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We made fun at the time but I've never met a more productive programmer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gordon At Wintek</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At one point, Gordon began working for <a href="WintekCorp.html">WintekCorp</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of Gordon's projects was to develop a PL/M cross compiler with the 8080 as a target. After a while, Intel lawyers advised Wintek to cease and desist using the PL/M name, which they owned. Wintek then renamed the product PL/W.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another big Wintek contract was to provide a suite of development tools for an 8080 prototype microprocessor lab they were going to produce. For this contract, Gordon wrote
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Interactive text editor
        </li>
        <li>
           An assembler
        </li>
        <li>
           A 4K Basic Interpreter
        </li>
        <li>
           Floating point arithmetic package
        </li>
        <li>
           An interactive debugger
        </li>
        <li>
           A linker/loader.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This consisted of around 10,000 lines of 8080 assembly code and Gordon completed this work in just a couple of months.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JimBesemer.html">JimBesemer</a> took considerably longer to port this suite to the 6800. On this project, Jim learned the storage management technique Gordon used called <a href="ManagedTables.html">ManagedTables</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After completing this project, Gordon was hired by Heath Corp. to maintain it and this began his "Gordon At Heath" career phase.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gordon At Heath</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Supporting this 8080 Basic at Heath ultimately put Gordon in head-to-head competition with <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a>. Although Gordon was then a Heath employee and arguably had the technically superior implementation, Bill was able to overwhelm Heath executives with a superior marketing and sales pitch. (The pitch relied heavily on "industry standard" and other intangible arguments, which have worked well for Gates and Microsoft ever since.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Gordon was royally pissed losing to a technically inferior product. But Gates knew a valuable asset when he saw one and ultimately was able to convince Gordon to come to work for him. A key part of his pitch to Gordon included privately admitting that Gordon had the better implementation: "see, they obviously don't appreciate you here; come work for me where people will recognize your extraordinary talents." This made Gordon one of the first dozen or so people to join the then fledgling Microsoft. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gordon At Microsoft.</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Gordon's first assignment at Microsoft was to produce a Basic compiler. He completed that in about 2 months.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Other things he did for Microsoft include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           managing Xenix (which more or less took care of itself)
        </li>
        <li>
           managing DOS (a never-ending headache)
        </li>
        <li>
           work on the C compilers
        </li>
        <li>
           work on <a href="CodeView.html">CodeView</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           perhaps most notably, serving as the chief architect for OS/2.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In recognition of his contribution and devotion to the company, Bill Gates
        awarded him a stock grant of 1% of the company when Microsoft went public.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Gordon In Retirement</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Gordon's work at Microsoft afforded him an enviable and comfortable retirement. When he's not vacationing or commuting between his southwestern ranch and his modest Redmond estate, he pursues a long-standing programming interest of his: Home Automation. I understand he's working on automating the home of his buddy, <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a>, in addition to his own.
