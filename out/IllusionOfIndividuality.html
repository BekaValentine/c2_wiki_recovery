        Illusion Of Individuality
      </h1>
      <p>
        Two boxers fight in a ring. One falls to his knees. The other triumphs. Do you care which is which? Well, it's unlikely you'd pay good money to watch just one boxer beat himself unconscious. So it takes two. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We can model a boxer in a computer and make the two fighters absolutely identical. Let the starting conditions of the fight - the tiny irregularities in the mat, the difference in the noises from the crowd, the breeze blowing across one fighter's back - determine the outcome. A butterfly's wing would do.
      </p>
      <p>
        In real life, we are all like these boxers. A thought doesn't care whether it is thought by you or by me. As you read this, your understanding is no different from mine as I write it. We are just boxers, one up, one down. The feeling that you or I am somehow unique, different from all the other yous or Is, this <a href="IllusionOfIndividuality.html">IllusionOfIndividuality</a>, is just a <a href="CulturalAssumption.html">CulturalAssumption</a>, the <a href="NamShubOfEnki.html">NamShubOfEnki</a>.

        This is perhaps technically true but only in the sense that consciousness is a bona-fide conceptual object of some kind with a "platonic" form some"where", and each individual is an "instance" of this form with some "accidental" qualities like "likes the color red," "longs for his lover," or "occasionally hears whispers in the sounds of machines."  There is no reason to believe a priori that consciousness is such a phenomenon and many reasons to believe it is not.  For instance, when we open a brain up we do not find a luminous (perhaps invisible) mote of pure concept - we find a messy organic computing device which is manifestly the platform upon which our "consciousnesses" sit.  There is no ideal form or identical conceptual object to which all minds are related - if my mind "moves" similarly to yours, <em>that</em> is the accident, an accident of similar construction.  The real substance of any consciousness is the rich froth of accumulated information and processes which is, by any sane definition, a mind.  The boxer on the ground is, from this point of view, a wildly different object than the one still standing, and both are wildly different from you, the observer.  The idea that they might be identical could be called. TheIllusionOfSameness.  -<a href="VincentToups.html">VincentToups</a>

        <em>On a sufficient level of abstraction, I agree with you. I also believe that individuality as seen in the media is grossly exaggerated. We are really distinct only in our immediate environment. If someone only gives three or four aspects that make him special (e.g. a family tragedy, a certain unusual education, an accident), I bet there will be lots of people with the same set of experiences.</em>

        <em>But I do not agree in general: We are special in our immediate environment. And my understanding of the above sentence (and all of the implied or not implied context) is surely different from yours - though the understanding is sufficiently alike to talk about it. -- </em><a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a> (see also <a href="NearestFittingContext.html">NearestFittingContext</a>)<em></em>

        A question I've had for a long time...
      </p>
      <p>
        I see a color, and I call it "red". You look at the same thing, see a color and also call it "red". However, just because we've both been trained to identify our experiences of the same thing as "red", do we really have the same experience? A rose, by the same name, would smell quite differently?
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, I heard that researchers have found striking differences in the ratios of the different color-sensing cones in the retinas of different people's eyes, so perhaps we all do experience different "red"s, and without even needing to invoke the differences between our various brains and minds, which surely have even larger implications (unless they don't since we can't really know - I guess that's Phenomenology).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Let's find someone whose left eye differs markedly from their right in that respect, so that they can tell us if they notice any difference between, say, left-eye red and right-eye red.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (As someone with strabismic amblyopia, I can say that each of my eyes detects color differently. One seems to be "warmer" and the other "cooler".)
      </p>
      <p>
        [Related to this, I highly recommend the writings of neurologists Oliver Sachs and V. S. Ramachandran, who have written extensively on perception, perceptual defects, and the effects of these on cognition.]
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Are we really talking about "individuality", or "uniqueness"? The argument seems to be that there is no difference between people. Well, I certainly see a difference between that guy over there, and myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As does he. No difference.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if we look alike, even if we are alike in every perceivable way, <em>he</em> is <em>him</em> and <em>I</em> am <em>me</em>. I am not him, and he is not me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That is your representation of the distinction "Me". You represent yourself as "Me". He represents himself as "Me". There is no consistent distinction between your representations of "Me".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if we are not unique in any way that would matter to any other observer, we are still individuals, aren't we? -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        <em>If your concept of individuality relies on the work of actuaries, I suspect this philosophical conversation may prove opaque to you. At least I have no experience of actuaries who question the frame of their statistics</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Read what Pete said again. He didn't say individuality relied on the work of actuaries at all. He said actuaries categorize our commonality. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        <em>Actuaries draw distinctions relevant to the function of insurance companies and banks. How are they relevant to individuality?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actuaries find common properties. Commonality can be seen as the opposite of individuality. That's how they are relevant. -- EH

        <em>So ... how are we more unalike than two waves? Actuaries may make a catalog of waves, big ones, small ones, ones that curl, ones that reflect ... this reflects their distinctions on their observations, not distinctions between the waves - which do all these things over and over.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. The really remarkable thing that actuaries represent to me is that the suicide rate, the result of a very personal, agonizing decision, is very amenable to statistical prediction. -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        To some extent, in that we may be unique, but we also follow trends. It may be more that we are subject to external influences, and those influences, being broad in effect, alter our actions more than we credit. -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        This is only an illusion if you lack the ability to perceive identity. If we could create 2 cubes that were identical in every measurable way (except their location in space), they wouldn't be one cube. They would be two distinct cubes. Having the same properties doesn't destroy identity. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        They aren't the same note. One happened earlier. -- EH

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see your point. Are you saying some boxers are echoes of other boxers? -- EH
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Boxers make waves. Pianos make waves. I'm trying to draw your distinction. You say if I play twice, that's two distinct notes, but if I play once and there's an echo, then what? Is your distinction in the ear of the listener or the finger of the player?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither. It isn't "my" distinction. There's a note and an echo. The distinction exists without a finger or an ear. It's caused by a wave striking your ear, then a reflection of that wave striking your ear.
      </p>

        <em>Without someone to make the distinction, what distinction can there be? Let's say I play through an effects pedal that adds an echo to each note I play.

If you'd like to argue instead that we all make the same distinctions I rather think you're making my argument for me ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        More solipsism. Are you saying the humans create all of the differences between one sound and an echo of that sound? -- EH 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not a solipsist. I'm saying you haven't provided a clear distinction between an echo of a note and the same note played twice. If you distinguish a note from the sound of a note I'd like to understand what you mean by that, too.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's solipsism to suggest that there are no distinctions without someone to make them. You're saying that reality doesn't exist without you. -- EH
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, I'm saying distinctions don't exist without someone to make them. And I'm asking you about the one you're making here. If there's solipsism in doing that, I'm afraid I don't understand it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As to the origin of a distinction, it doesn't have to be direct perception. For example, my father was red-green colour blind. He couldn't visually distinguish between red and green. But he accepted that distinction when others made it. Colours are distinctions particular to humans - there's a very broad continuum of electromagnetic wavelengths we might distinguish as colours, but we don't. Does that suggest to you that colours exist even though we don't distinguish them? Or rather that we distinguish colours where in reality there are none?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Our [in]ability to distinguish colors neither creates nor destroys those colors; there are some humans who have four color receptors in their eyes rather than three. In other words, they are able to see and distinguish two distinct colors that you and I would view as being the same color.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor are colors "particular to humans". There are many insects (such as bees) which are able to distinguish colors in the ultra-violet range.
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal inability to distinguish certain colors does not mean those colors are not distinct.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Light frequencies exist without humans. We can't distinguish colors that don't exist in reality. The ranges and names of colors are humans' inventions, but the different frequencies exist even if we never see them. -- EH
      </p>
      <p>

        <em>You're a great boxer EH! If you prefer something a little less fleeting, look closely at the next rainbow you see. That's an illusion created by the refractive properties of gazillions of drops of water. Where are those rainbow colours "in reality"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In reality, they are the frequencies of light refracted by those gazillions of drops of water. They have those frequencies even when I close my eyes. -- EH
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are many other frequencies they refract. And many plausible distinctions between them. And many disagreeing vantages concerning where the rainbow is anyway. You make your distinctions about the rainbow because of artifacts of your sensory apparatus - the spacing and location of your eyes and the range of sensitivity of the neurons within them. So though there are frequencies galore when you close your eyes, and when you open them, the colours and shapes are distinctions that don't exist without you to make them.</em>

      <p>
        <em>Now solipsism suggests only I exist - and so I can call grey blue if I like. Taoism suggests instead my map of reality is no less generative than your map, that both maps are so interconnected in reality that our notions of disconnectedness and uniqueness are illusory.

        You are inconsistent in your terms, and thus your arguments are invalid. If I play all the same notes that are in "Ode to Joy", but in ascending tonality, it is not the same piece of music, despite having the same number of notes, of the same values.

      </p>
      <p>
        "The SV (or OW) does indeed have implicit in it both live cat and dead cat possibilities, but the completed transaction allows only one of these possibilities to become real. Because the collapse does not have to await the arrival of the observer, there is never a time when "the cat is 50% alive and 50% dead". And the need for consciousness, permanent records, thermodynamics, or alternate universes never arises. The 'buck stops' at the absorber, in this case the Geiger counter, and the uncollapsed SV need not be tracked any further."
      </p>
      <p>
        The transactional interpretation doesn't involve multiple universes or cats smeared out across space-time. There is one cat and it is either alive or dead.

               No; if there are multiple worlds, then each world has one cat.

Whether boxers are distinct physical entities doesn't directly imply anything about them being or not being distinct psychological being or being mentally represented as such (and vice versa). Of course there is some very complicated relation between these two domains (via cell chemistry, neuropsychology...) but the meaning of "individual" certainly doesn't lift 1-to-1 from physics to psychology.

        Since we think with a physical organ, our brain, and it is our thinking that provides the basis of psychological identity, I'm not sure how you could separate the two. At all. Ever. The very thoughts of "I" by both the boxers are unique as the organ that produced them. Do the boxers share the same concept of individuality? Probably not. Because, I think, ever concept is really derived in association with other concepts. Perhaps one boxer believe "I" is an extension of his family. The other believes "I" is a product of society.

        <em>What does it mean, "to think"? In the absence of any empirical distinction, we must fall back on observable processes - in particular, "to represent". Hence the </em><a href="LeibnizianDefinitionOfConsciousness.html">LeibnizianDefinitionOfConsciousness</a>. Representation is something we can watch you do, and we can watch your neurons do; thinking, except in terms of a process of representation, appears to be a popular myth.

And all of these neurons interact intimately with the neurons of everyone around you all the time. These words you type are plentiful evidence that the majority of your neurons have been trained by shared cultural processes beyond any puny mortal thoughts. [</em>Hulk Smash!<em>]</em>

           <em>Sentiment - attachment, irrational emotional motivations, make the rocking world go round. But sentiment can be overcome by rationality.

           You speak as if there were an individual monk, individual Americans and an individual you. Aren't those all illusions? -- EH

        This reminds me of an idea that popped up, I think it was on EmbryonicStemCellResearch. Human existence is somewhat like an Aspen grove. The individual trees of an Aspen grove are really shoots off the root system of a single plant. They appear to be individual trees to the above-ground observer, but they are really all part of the same plant.
      </p>
      <p>
        This imagery of Humanity came to me when I read an interview with <a href="CarlSagan.html">CarlSagan</a>. The reporter knew of Sagan's atheistic <a href="WorldView.html">WorldView</a>, and asked him what he thought of abortion. He hoped Sagan would give a scientific answer to the question "When does human life begin?" Sagan's answer was that, inside the bodies of living humans are living cells that, when joined with other living cells from another living human, grow into living humans with living cells in their bodies that will join with living cells from another living human. Human life is a never-ending process, unless we end it. It reminded me of the Aspen grove.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, this is an interesting way to view humanity if there is only the physical. If there is more, like a spirit, this imagery falls short. What I see in <a href="IllusionOfIndividuality.html">IllusionOfIndividuality</a> is really a discussion of the spirit. Are our spirits really just <a href="PopUps.html">PopUps</a>? Places where the <a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a> manifests itself sporadically in our 4 dimensions. Or, are our spirits unique? I see no evidence for the former; but I have found considerable evidence for the latter. In my <a href="WorldView.html">WorldView</a>, all are individuals who are held acountable for their actions. The consequences of our individual <a href="FreeWill.html">FreeWill</a> life choices, in this <a href="WorldView.html">WorldView</a>, can be diametrically opposite and eternal. -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>

        Thanks for the link. I like it. I think what I'm hearing, though, is that since there seems to be a natural flow, or progression in consciousness, THEN, it means we are all connected? I would conceded that it is a <em>possible</em> conclusion; but not the only, or even the likely conclusion. It is a pretty concept. Very clean and attractive.

        Having read this article (which I thought for a while was authored by a single mind) I liken it to this half-baked analogy (I apologise now) to make sense of it all...
      </p>
      <p>
        Imagine two snowflakes falling from their point of origin (without getting too hung-up on the physics) on the same day at the same (point in) time, like leaves falling from a tree, but falling toward a boxing ring canvas - just the two of them (perhaps the canvas is a rippling pool of water). From received wisdom we know that the two flakes are observably unique, but which will hit the canvas first? They are influenced similarly by their environment yet they will both eventually reach the canvas and melt (place your bets) like decaying leaves, and become observably the same.
        You could argue that despite their form and circumstance, they are both pointlessly unique, yet both pointlessly the same. And if you disagree, then that's where you and I differ!
