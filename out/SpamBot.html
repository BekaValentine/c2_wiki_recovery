      <p>
        A Web Spider that walks through pages looking for email addresses, which will later be sent <a href="SpamMail.html">SpamMail</a>. They generally abuse HTTP and ignore the <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RobotsExclusionStandard,">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?RobotsExclusionStandard,</a> so they can impose a heavy load on a server.

        There are many web sites covering rude spiders in general.  I have found <a href="http://www.webmasterworld.com/">http://www.webmasterworld.com/</a> to be quite detailed, but I can't say I need or want to pay that much attention.

        which walks through wiki pages in a very similar fashion, but then posts spam directly on those pages.
