        Encourage People To Know

        You cannot argue something to your colleagues because
        of different experience. It's sometimes impossible
        to transfer the information in a rational manner.
        The solution is to try to develop common experience,
        so <a href="EncouragePeopleToKnow.html">EncouragePeopleToKnow</a> something you feel your experience
        depends on. Things I've tried successfully:

           <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> (<a href="EncouragePeopleToKnowSmalltalk.html">EncouragePeopleToKnowSmalltalk</a>)

        </li>
        <li>
            ‘’ - - After more then 10 yrs - - ’’
        </li>
        <li>
           Functional programming and Haskell 
        </li>
        <li>
           Constructivism, intuitionistic logic, type theory and Agda
        </li>
        <li>
           Category theory

        Learning common things leads to recognizing the common patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't forget that you're encouraged to learn too :)

        Nice notice :)) Ok, I'll try to give the reader a hint about dealing with disappointments. First, <em>even</em> if someone doesn't like the above, they now have a sort of experience that can help you both to communicate. The goal was not to EncourageToLike, but EncourageToKnow. Second, if they don't like something you think is very essential to you, maybe it could be smart to consider effectiveness of collective work. You probably <em>need</em> some common preferences to work effectively.

        <em>Sorry; I thought you meant </em><a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.  So what other kinds of patterns do you use for communication? -- jtg<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Jeff, here I meant patterns as the common way to structure knowledge. See <a href="OrganizationalPatterns.html">OrganizationalPatterns</a>, <a href="LearningPatterns.html">LearningPatterns</a>, NegotiationPatternLanguage. -- PP

        <em>[ <</em>MoveMe> Ok, one thing that I would like to put in the list but am afraid to, is paying attention to psychological aspects of people's technical reasoning.

        In my experience, anything in common works. In one of my jobs, four of us played coin-op arcade games together at lunch, and that became our common framework for explanations.
