        Disregard The Adjunct

      <p>
        <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> is an intentional sinkhole for content its creators want to delete, but don't have the patience to <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> away. Like the other <a href="SisterSite.html">SisterSite</a>s, it's not adequately integrated with <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> to maintain wiki's <a href="ExtremeIntertwingling.html">ExtremeIntertwingling</a>. So moving pages to the adjunct destroys content coherence and community coherence. Shut it down and move the content back please.

        <em>Come on, Pete, it's a bit late for that. Why the </em><a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My hat's not black; it's moth-eaten and frayed, doesn't keep the sun off or rain out, and chafes my ears. But I still believe in <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>, <a href="TolerateOffTopic.html">TolerateOffTopic</a>, and <a href="MakeSignalNotNoise.html">MakeSignalNotNoise</a>. As described on <a href="WikiContentGenerationProcess.html">WikiContentGenerationProcess</a> I don't have any faith in the present approach for these purposes. I don't believe in sister sites, stewards, edit codes, or any of the rest of it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But that's progress for you.
      </p>
      <p>
        I usually wave hands about going and doing something even less practical than wiki. Having no spare time to invest in impracticalities at present I thought, hey, let's at least dissent and let 'em scurry on with just a tinge of "maybe this isn't exactly the right thing to do ..." or even better "first, do no harm".
      </p>
      <p>
        And anyway, in the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>, how can anything be late? Or is <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> as old fashioned as <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>?

        Presumably you mean <em>anymore</em>. I'm truly sorry you feel that way. Or in refactoring <a href="WikiDom.html">WikiDom</a> either, 'cause that's all that's happening here. Maybe we'll get to a <a href="UnifiedRecentChanges.html">UnifiedRecentChanges</a> too. Would that make <a href="SisterSite.html">SisterSite</a>s <a href="InterTwingle.html">InterTwingle</a>d enough for you?

        Bollocks. You're suggesting wikizens have the same inclination to change an entry on their bookmarks as your average TelevisionAddict has to get off the couch to change the channel. I don't buy it. Maybe it's not news to you, but it is to me, <a href="UnifiedRecentChanges.html">UnifiedRecentChanges</a> is implemented on <a href="CommunityWiki.html">CommunityWiki</a>. See <a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/RecentNearChanges">http://www.emacswiki.org/cw/RecentNearChanges</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="UnifiedRecentChanges.html">UnifiedRecentChanges</a> is <strong>one bad idea</strong>. If others have implemented it doesn't mean that Ward should follow it. And if you don't like <a href="AggregationOnTheClient.html">AggregationOnTheClient</a>, you can consider running a third party IndependentAggregator. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, but I wasn't suggesting that he should, neither does it follow that because Ward doesn't implement it (for his own reasons, the most obvious being effort involved) that it's a bad idea. Why <em>exactly</em> is it a bad idea? (Remove and answer on <a href="UnifiedRecentChanges.html">UnifiedRecentChanges</a> is probably a good idea.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I meant to say it's bad idea if it's done on the server-side (as originally intended). </em><a href="AggregationOnTheClient.html">AggregationOnTheClient</a> makes it unnecessary while <a href="UnifiedRecentChanges.html">UnifiedRecentChanges</a> on the server runs contrary to the well known principle of <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> and will run into problems one can do without. -- Costin<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Different people have different groups of concerns, which is why we have different wikis, but they also can overlap, which is why we have <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>. <a href="UnifiedRecentChanges.html">UnifiedRecentChanges</a> is just another tool to make it easy for users to deal with <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>. <a href="AggregationOnTheClient.html">AggregationOnTheClient</a> requires a great deal more technical knowledge and effort than just being able to bookmark a single page. A third party aggregator would be fine, no one is suggesting that a <a href="UnifiedRecentChanges.html">UnifiedRecentChanges</a> needs to replace any wiki's own individual <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.

        Feh. Double feh. The little link pictures at the bottom of the page are going both ways now, so <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> is just as inter-twingled as anything else here. RegardTheAdjunct! -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

      <p>
        <em>What's the benefit of the little link pictures?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They automatically link to pages from multiple wikis.

        There's coherence in letting the <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> cruft build up and obscure the <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>? That must be a different definition of "coherence" than I know. I say <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> has performed admirably at giving a place for content that people don't want to discard, but really doesn't belong here. This has enabled a long overdue SpringCleaning. I say <a href="DeleteThisPageSoon.html">DeleteThisPageSoon</a>. (seconded)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You know, if I could figure out what the criterion for deleting or moving content is, apart from, "I don't agree with this", I might have some sympathy for all this cleaning you lot do.

Do you think that just by <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>ing or deleting anything that doesn't contribute to your own present inspiration you're actually accomplishing something here? <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not a matter of disagreeing. (Actually, I agree with some of what I've moved there. Most of the rest I've just considered irrelevant.) It's a matter of being <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, and not even a recent <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> discussion. If you really think this content is garbage, why not delete it? The point is that it has its defenders who don't think it's garbage. It's still <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, however, and doesn't belong here in perpetuity. (Or, is the problem determining what is related to programming and what is not?)

      <p>
        <em>Am I mistaken or have you just agreed with the rant that started this page?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You're mistaken. <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> gives a third choice between deletion and filling C2 up with <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> stuff. I think the idle chat should be deleted there, too. And I think this page should be deleted when cooked.

        <li>
           That's funny; there seem to be thousands of pages on programming here; many of them actively edited, too. While this site has neighbors in the programming universe (blogs like ltu, other wikis like cliki, etc) - this place is still active and useful. Most of the people who <a href="GaveUpOnWiki.html">GaveUpOnWiki</a> did so because they no longer find wiki worth their time - which is fine, it's their call. OTOH, claiming that one's particular tastes are the only worthy content on wiki, and stating that wiki's failure to cater to those tastes are in fact evidence of wiki's decline, is a remarkably self-centered point of view.

        I'm gonna found a new wiki called BestOfWiki. Any of the <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages on this wiki that are sterling high-quality, state-of-the-art discussions of <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>, we should move them from this wiki to my wiki immediately.

        Does anyone realize there is no moral or ethical difference between my BestOfWiki site and <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>? Either way it's just stealing pages... -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If Ward made BestOfWiki a <a href="SisterSite.html">SisterSite</a>, then the example would be relevant.

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I don't understand how moving pages equates to "stealing" them (the pages still exist and everyone can still access them), but there is a signficant difference between your proposal and </em><a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> even if moving pages is stealing. If there wasn't then garbage men would be criminals. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a> is right in some sense, and very wrong in another sense. To begin with, the operation of "moving" only confuses the discussion as far as "moral and ethical differences" are concerned. There are two operations that should be taken separately, at least prima facie. There's the operation of deleting text from C2 and there's the operation of adding text that was previously contributed to C2 to <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>. Deleting stuff from C2 is legitimate insofar as it contributes to cleaning up the wiki - whereas "cleanliness" is not a fixed, immutable scale but something that is continuously negotiated within the community. It is much more problematic to delete <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> than <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> material. I don't think anybody in his right mind would question in principl;e the legitimacy of deletions. Ifhe does, he should ask Ward to remove the delete feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now adding text that was previously contributed to C2 to <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> is more problematic ("in theory", mind you) in so far as the original contributors may have agreed to contribute to C2 but not necessarily to <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>. Such a problem wouldn't exist on wikis that enforce open licensing (such as <a href="CreativeCommons.html">CreativeCommons</a>, gnu documentations license, etc). But so far, only very recent pages have been moved to <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> most of the time with all the original contributors being aware of the move, so the problem is more theoretical than practical. So there's a very substantial "moral and ethical difference" between <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>'s gedanken experiment and <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>
