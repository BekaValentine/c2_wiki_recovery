        Python Sprint
      </h1>
      <p>
        Since early 2002 there have been quite a few events called 'sprint' in the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>/<a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> world. A sprint in this terminology is a get together for 3 to 5 days of programmers interested in working on an open source project. Sprints usually have a multinational audience.

        Often a conference is preceeded by a sprint (so much so that any self-respecting Python conference is now preceeded by a sprint), but sprints also occur standalone. One or more sprint coaches guide the process all along. Sprints are said to be inspired by an XP concept (references?).
      </p>
      <p>
        The first instance of the sprint phenomenon has emerged as part of Zope 3 development and there have been many Zope 3 sprints since then (in the US, Europe, Australia and South America):

      </p>
      <p>
        The sprint phenomenon has now spread to other projects like the Zope-based <a href="PloNe.html">PloNe</a> project:

        and the <a href="PyPy.html">PyPy</a> project, a project to reimplement the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> in an innovative way in Python:

      </p>
      <p>
        There has also been a sprint focused on the Python language core itself:

        Sprints have also spread beyond Python-land:
