        Numeric Notations
      </h1>
      <p>
        Often the question is asked "What is the notation for <octal/hex/binary/base-ten> numbers in software"?
      </p>
      <p>
        There are sometimes incomplete or conflicting notations. Please add any other forms.  <em>Reformatted as a table for easier comparison. -sf</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NOTE:</strong> not all forms listed below are actually syntactically correct; rather, the forms <em>would be</em> correct if taken to their extremes and actually implemented.

        <li>
           In <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>/<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>; any integer literal starting with 0x is hex, anything starting with 0 is octal.  Decimal integer literals must start with 1-9; fortunately the number "0" is the same whether decimal or hex.  The lexemes for floating point numbers (things with a decimal point in them) are always decimal in C/C++.
        </li>
        <li>
           '$' has been used as a hex prefix for many years (<a href="AppleTwo.html">AppleTwo</a> assembly, many <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> implementations)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>There are conflicts. For instance, is "1001" binary or base-ten? Lexical analysis will not be able to resolve the difference, although a LALR syntax analyzer might - with proper context</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is there no nice notation for binary. . . or "why doesn't C/C++ recognize 1001B as binary?"
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Dunno; it would be useful, especially given the low-level bit-frobbing that C/C++ are frequently used for.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Binary literals (0b1001010) are added to many embedded C compilers, such as for PIC microcontrollers, since you do a lot bit-level I/O on these devices.

        Some languages have an arbitrary-radix format.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Verilog, a hardware description language, extends number to include "don't care's" and "high-impedance" values as well as traditional numbers.
      </p>
      <code>
        <length>'<radix><digits><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Where <length> is the number of bits in the value, written decimal, <radix> is the radix expressed as one of h, d, o, or b, and <digits> is the actual number, written in base <radix>.  0-9 are themselves, a-f represent 10 through 15, z represents hi-impedance, x represents "don't care".  Some examples are

        </li>
        <li>
          'hdead_beef
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Other languages have similar constructs.

        <em>shouldn't the same example value (e.g. 42 2A 52 101010) be used for all bases?</em>

        I interpreted the original idea behind this page as demonstrating syntax, not arithmetic equality.  In fact, I used the same numbers which were originally posted by the original author.  --SamuelFalvo
