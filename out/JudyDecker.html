        I am a Web manager,communications and English teacher for a school and I write fiction novels and creative nonfiction short stories.  I am in the process of compiling a list of online journal prompts.  If you have a good quote or a compelling idea that writers might like to use for their daily writing exercise, please feel free to add them to the JudyDeckerJournal. <em>(see below)</em>

          The collective. An ant has a tiny reserve of nerve connections. Not too smart. But, an ant hill functions together, and collectively there is considerable ability to master the environment that is not present in a single ant. Could this be true of humans? Tell me your thoughts on two heads being better than one, or that consciousness is distributed and the more conscious minds that focus on one purpose the more apt is the solution to be found. Collaborative human mind. Whispering angel. Could there be a glacially slow consciousness in a forest?

           Law of diffusion. In physics there is a law of diffusion. The square root of N. Put a drop of ink in a glass of water and the ink equally diffuses in the water. A spray of perfume diffuses in the classroom air. Equally. People also diffuse: away from mean people, crazy bosses, boring towns with no culture, countries with no opportunity, and move toward better circumstances. Ideas also diffuse following the same law of physics. Ideas spread throughout our culture. Catchy phrases. Tell about things that have spread quickly throughout our culture.
