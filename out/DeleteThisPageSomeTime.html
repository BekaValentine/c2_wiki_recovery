        <a href="DeleteThisPageSoon.html">DeleteThisPageSoon</a> is often too harsh. 'Soon' seems to mean as soon as another <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> notices it.

        Sometimes a page merits considering deletion, but not necessarily <strong>really soon</strong>.
        Sometimes pages need to be looked at by a few people to see if it will be expanded.
        Or it is funny enough (though inappropriate) to let at least some <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s see it.
