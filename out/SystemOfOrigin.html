        I think mutual references without explanations explaining the differences are a waste of time, & disk space.  If someone has an explanation of <a href="SystemOfOrigin.html">SystemOfOrigin</a>, please erase my entry here & put in your explanation.  Also, if in the course of doing that you also reference <a href="SystemOfReference.html">SystemOfReference</a>, then you will have accomplished a great service to those like me who are trying to understand these concepts.  <a href="TerryLeeMoore.html">TerryLeeMoore</a> 27 Jun 02
