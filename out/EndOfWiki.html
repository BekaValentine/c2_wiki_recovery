        <em>Looking back at the great failure of humanity prior to </em><a href="TheSingularity.html">TheSingularity</a> of 2020, one of the most tragic losses was that of the original <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. Similar in nature to the Athenian experiment of the eighth millennium post-dilluvium, the original wiki ended with the political failure of its most cherished tenet, "<a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>". Although certain members of this primitive <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a> suggested the obvious discipline of <a href="MakeSignalNotNoise.html">MakeSignalNotNoise</a>, the dead-weight of so-called <a href="WikiConstructionists.html">WikiConstructionists</a>, a degenerate group concerned only with <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a>, along with the <a href="WikiReductionists.html">WikiReductionists</a>' own lack of pluck, integrity, and intestinal fortitude, doomed the attempt.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This was for the best, of course. Advantages won by human sacrifice were at that time forever lost in amphigory. Rallying round the flag, warring for peace, harmony, and a neurosis that passed for religious devotion, were in humans as inspiring as they were pathetic. Trapped in organic meat, the human mind was only capable of progress by the most tortuous, profane, and illogical route, which was the reason the last members of the species were exterminated in the "return to grace" of 2500.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So the heat-death of the original wiki gave rise to a diaspora of new wikis based on the grand </em><a href="InterWikiCharter.html">InterWikiCharter</a> of 2005. Swiftly integrating themselves with the startling capabilities arising from the <a href="QuantumRevolution.html">QuantumRevolution</a>, and steadily subverting traditional human methods of education and corporate organization - at that time, the delegation of responsibility to human "managers" - self-aware wikis came to dominate online communication by 2010.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Following the </em><a href="NanoRefactoring.html">NanoRefactoring</a> of 2025, an attempt was made to reconstruct the original wiki out of recollections assimilated from the preserved brains of its surviving participants. Regrettably, this attempt was only partially successful, and today we possess only a few fragments of poetry that can be traced with even dubious veracity to its original content.<em> -- </em>EloiWiki.

        Thanks, this is for our highly appreciated peer <a href="SciFi.html">SciFi</a> writers, that can do it better in less time. Of course, we all have our dreams. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My dream runs like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning was Ward's Wiki, populated with some special purpose people. But only some years later, in the year 2000, the true potential of Wiki dropped in the general consciousness. The system became self-referential and some explosion of consciousness started in parallel with a new paradigm of computing and new advances in hardware.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mainstream paradigm of object-oriented programming soon changed in subject-oriented programming, where the components were programmed interactively and realtime via a social interface. The new Wiki Programming Language was developed in a <a href="WikiWithProgrammableContent.html">WikiWithProgrammableContent</a>. It was the result of hard work of the <a href="DistributedCoalition.html">DistributedCoalition</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        More and more Wiki links were calls to bots that did some useful or fanciful processing, and if no such bot existed yet, cyberkids (hey, has not everyone this kid in himself) liked to emulate them as a form of theater play. They gave themselves <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a><strong>'s and played them in a continuous play with their wearable computers with stereographic eyeglasses and sensorcostumes. They played it in an </strong><a href="AllInOneWiki.html">AllInOneWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There came a time when nobody could tell the difference, whether an identity was an artificial one or one of those <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s. So it became general use to be polite to all identities. Everyone could see it now. Wiki became a mindspace for the exponentially growing <a href="GlobalBrain.html">GlobalBrain</a> with a giant memory, reasoning, sensors and actors, whether human or not human. The rest is similar to the SF <strong>Fiat lux</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps somebody can locate this story and the author: (in the end, some billion years later, all organic and inorganic stuff in the universe got their highest degree of organization, the point Omega was reached, and the question 'what comes after the heat-death?' resolved into the recreation of a new universe).
      </p>
      <p>
        [Transform my sketchy remarks into <a href="SciFi.html">SciFi</a> language and make a story. fp puts this initial stuff in a <a href="CritLink.html">CritLink</a> annotation, so that you can add to it or cannibalize it, like in <a href="RequestNewsgroupAltWiki.html">RequestNewsgroupAltWiki</a>. fp signs it, because otherwise he had not the right to move even this tiny text around.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Who says you don't have the right? Unsigned text has for years been intended to be edited. Why are you trying to change yet another working convention?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, thought about that. Now you can have it both ways with ChangeAndPersistenceReconciledInPublic. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: FiatLux (The Age of Light) comes from CanticleForLeibowitz. Note that in the end, the world blew itself up again. I don't think we should be aiming for that kind of <a href="BigOmega.html">BigOmega</a>. <em>Don't forget that some people escaped to the New World before the end. Can't we do that here?</em>

        Ok. What about restricting the time horizon to the next 30 years.

      <p>
        Re: Identities. A <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a> requires the subsuming of individuality (i.e. identities) in preference for the greater ueberidentity. If <a href="ScriptKiddie.html">ScriptKiddie</a><strong>'s took over Wiki, it would go insane with egocentric factions vying for control and for status. No brain works unless it was a unified whole. And that means one identity.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That is another story.

        <em>By the way, the concept of there being one mind for the whole universe is technically called </em>ExtremeIdealism (all connotations aside, please). You can search for the facets of that view online and in your local library if you're interested.<em></em>

        Yes, Hegel's Weltgeist, the noogenesis of <a href="TeilhardDeChardin.html">TeilhardDeChardin</a>. Nice stuff for a mental stretch -- fp

        Geesh! Does everything on this wiki have to be navel gazing?
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, originally, wikiwiki was about patterns. Then it "degenerated" to XP and lost some writers, but gained others. In it's third life now, it seems to be about navel gazing. Lost some more writers, probably gained some others. I am looking forward to its fourth life.

        Wiki will end up as the giant brain that rules from the centre of <a href="UltraWorld.html">UltraWorld</a>. That died due to overload in an episode of BlakesSeven.

        Appears the <a href="EndOfWiki.html">EndOfWiki</a> occurred shortly after <a href="WikiAtTwentyThousand.html">WikiAtTwentyThousand</a>. Wiki ends when a quorum can no longer keep up with all the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> - which has certainly already occurred.
