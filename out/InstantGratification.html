        Instant Gratification

      <p>
        <a href="InstantGratification.html">InstantGratification</a> is a Post-modern, western society Generation-X mentality and rank amongst one of the most common <a href="LifePatterns.html">LifePatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, the thinking applies to all aspects of life, fastfood, instant stardom / success, fitness pill, etc.

        From <em></em>'<a href="MediumIsTheMessage.html">MediumIsTheMessage</a><strong><em>, it evolved to </em></strong><a href="PromotionIsTheProduct.html">PromotionIsTheProduct</a><em></em>' thinking. And history demonstrated that it has a proven track record, at least for a while.

        The IT boom of the last decades of 20th century fit very well with this societal need. Management and developers alike participated in the perpetual search of the <a href="NextBigThing.html">NextBigThing</a>.

        Except that most societies have grown a bit weary of the bubble mentality. Case of a PatternTooFar.

        But we cannot afford to stop now for fear of implosion, which may well happen, do to a combination of the effects of <a href="PeakOil.html">PeakOil</a>, the CreditCrisisOfTwoThousandEight, and the consequence that the <a href="GreatSuburbanBuildout.html">GreatSuburbanBuildout</a> has at long last ended and will probably never start again.

        I think that the majority of sociey hasn't grown weary.  It's just that the weary birds of a feather flock together and don't realise how much of a minority they are.  I realized this might be the case when I saw the top 20 ratings (US)  for TV last week:  American Idol, Reality Show 1, Reality Show 2, Reality Show n.  All things I didn't particularly like, and thought were rabidly liked by a <em>small</em> fanbase and reviled by <em>many</em>.  As it turns out  <em>many</em> is not a synonym for <em>most people I communicate with</em>.  But I worry too much, don't I deserve a break today. ;)
