        I'm not a favorer of this particular translation, as I feel it lacks certain critical meanings which are present in the original Chinese but not here. I recommend the version by Dr. John C. H. Wu, ISBN 0-87773-388-0, myself. -- <a href="TaralDragon.html">TaralDragon</a>

        <em>Wu's translation is by all accounts excellent, and one I've been meaning to get around to. But I'm very interested in your criticism, and would really like to know any way the GNL version is lacking. The best thing about having a version under a GPL is it stays open to change. If you'd prefer you could email me at peter@san.rr.com, or comment here, whichever suits. Thanks!</em> --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        <em>On word choice, "harmony" is merely my best effort at finding a word for Te that fits the contexts used in the poem. Te is more commonly translated as "virtue" or "power", but neither seems to me to fit the use. I suppose poor old Lao, if he ever existed, would be amazed, appalled and amused at the mess we poor interpolators have made of him with our actions.</em> -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        Within <strong>te</strong> is the concept of potential, as the quote above demonstrates. The translation of te as "virtue" or "power" is natural to me, and more suggestive of its true nature than "harmony," unless one recognizes the potential action within harmony. Before you roll the dice, anything is possible, but once released, there is no question that there is a finite result, marked by a definite limit. This recalls Schroedinger's Cat.

        Well, yes and no. Where harmony is there is total equilibrium. Total or absolute equilibriums means that there is nothingness within nothingness, which is actually a paradoxon meaning that there is everything at once within absolute nothingness which basically also means that from harmony we come to absolute turmoil or rather, in physical terms, total entropy. And this is where it all began, the universe and all. From within absolute harmony, the absolute equilibrium of non-events. A state that cannot actually exist, as far as my analysis of the matter goes... 
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of Lao harmony simply means, forging the people being led by some puppet steered by the puppeteer, that is, the wise men, are in harmony iff they succumb to a common culture and common belief. This, however, always also leaves the question of whether or not that harmony is actually achievable and why it should remain constant, I mean, who is actually sufficient with what the state system in which one is living provides for oneself? Isn't there a better way to achieve things, to make things work and wouldn't it be better if everyone would be following yours instead of theirs cultural believes? in that it would preserve a new kind of harmony, namely, yours?
