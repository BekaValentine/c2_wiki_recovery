      <p>
        A <a href="SubjectSpace.html">SubjectSpace</a> is just a list of subjects. Each subject should have a self-contained description. As opposed to a description that depends on the context defined by its position in a <a href="SubjectHierarchy.html">SubjectHierarchy</a>. The problem with a <a href="SubjectHierarchy.html">SubjectHierarchy</a>, is that different individuals' hierarchies are very unlikely to match up, but individual subjects have a better chance of matching, and users can always rename their subjects at some later date. In effect each user's <a href="SubjectSpace.html">SubjectSpace</a> is a push-style channel that other users can subscribe to. Unless they want to.
