        Object Management Group Rules
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="ObjectManagementGroup.html">ObjectManagementGroup</a> has a rule about standards:
      </p>
      <p>
        A document doesn't get issued as a standard unless at least one company bigwig will sign a Letter of Intent making a public commitment to implement the standard in a real product.  If no such product appears within one year, the standard is withdrawn.  <em>No exceptions.</em>

        Interesting. Was this rule in force when the first version of the CORBA standard came out? Could it be why the early ORBs were found wanting in quality and interoperability? -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>
