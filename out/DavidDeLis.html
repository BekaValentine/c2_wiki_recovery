        Despite the votation about patentable software has been repeatedly turned down by the European Parliament, lobbies are still trying to push it into European citizens through their power over the the European Comission. Please support a Free of Software Patents Europe. Software and scientific data patents will only benefit the bigger companies (most of them of foreign to EU interests) and undermine the efforts of the small companies and <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> programmers, as well as independent scientific researches at Public Universities and Research Centers. Please support the <a href="AntiSoftwarePatents.html">AntiSoftwarePatents</a> innitiative.
