        Wiki Engine Review Rhk Criteria

      <p>
        <strong>Features I Want in a Wiki</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a bulleted list of the features I'm looking for in a wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand more about why or what I expect to accomplish with a wiki, see:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiEngineReviewRhkObjectives.html">WikiEngineReviewRhkObjectives</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiEngineReviewRhkCriteriaDiscussion.html">WikiEngineReviewRhkCriteriaDiscussion</a> (My motivation for a previous version of these requirements and <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>'s comments have been moved there.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To see some suggestions for extensions to <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a>, see:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiEngineReviewSuggestions.html">WikiEngineReviewSuggestions</a> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (That page expands on some of the features listed here -- I think you need to read it to get the full flavor of what I'm looking for.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I recognize that it is very likely I won't find a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> that meets all of these requirements.  That's OK -- then I'll try to pick the one that fits the set of needs that I consider most important. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Requirements List</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Easy for a newbie to install in Linux (or Windows)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Good performance with 100,000 pages (may require a database)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No proprietary software required (low cost)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Open source or freeware (so I can consider modifications)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Excellent means of finding information:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Page lists and indexes
            </li>
            <li>
               Possible hierarchical organization
            </li>
            <li>
               Ability to be indexed by Web search engines (perhaps selectable)
            </li>
            <li>
               Full text search including words, wild cards, phrases, boolean, within x
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Alternates to finding a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> with the search capabilities listed above could include using a separate search engine with a wiki that stores each topic in a separate file or finding a wiki that uses a database with those search capabilities.  See WikiEngineReviewAlternateSearchDiscussion(?).</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The ability to group pages for operations like application of password protection, email notification, import, export, translation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Subpages or other means of organizing pages in a hierarchy 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Email notification of changes on selected pages (or groups)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Security.  
          <ul>
            <li>
               Snapshots of most revisions, and associated rollback and diff capability, but provide a secure means of deleting snapshots to preserve the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> of forgetting mistakes
            </li>
            <li>
               No embedded HTML  
            </li>
            <li>
               Password protection on editing of selected pages (or groups)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Easy to read diff format
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Re Diffs: If a system is accepted that stores snapshots of only the last revision by each author, a means must exist to declare a new baseline for the diff.  (The problem I'm trying to address is the one, for example, where only one person modifies a particular page (or a private wiki).  In that case, the diff just keeps growing and growing (like the Energizer Rabbit?) and becomes useless to highlight the most recent change.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Maybe there is a workaround to the above if I create two separate identities for myself, and then edit pages alternately.  (Maybe RandyKramerA and RandyKramerB.)  I'm not sure what would be required -- am I identified on this wiki by a cookie?  Would I need to edit from two different machines with different cookies?  (A little cumbersome, at least.  I'm more curious than serious.)</dd>

               Each page in a separate text file -- tools like SED, Awk
            </li>
            <li>
               Pages stored in a common text file, possibly indexed -- editors with search and replace capability that can handle large files
            </li>
            <li>
               Pages stored in a relational data base (MySQL, msql, etc.) -- ??

        Notes I put on another wiki, may reflect the beginning of a prioritization:
      </p>
      <p>
        New Comments: What I want in a wiki: (See my <a href="WikiEngineReview.html">WikiEngineReview</a> at <a href="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngineReview,">http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiEngineReview,</a> which is rough and unfinished)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here I try to list the things I most want (essentials):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Easy to install (on <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           History (more than last edit by previous author)
        </li>
        <li>
           Diffs (MSWord style would be nicest)
        </li>
        <li>
           Easy import / export 
        </li>
        <li>
           Easy backup / restore
        </li>
        <li>
           Pages and history deletable
        </li>
        <li>
           Change notification by Email, per page (or group of pages) (pages might be grouped by Topic, Category, or "EmailGroup")
        </li>
        <li>
           At least three levels of headings (beyond emphasis)
        </li>
        <li>
           Customizable templates (by administrator -- I guess they all are)
        </li>
        <li>
           Lists (bulleted and numbered, nested)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nice to have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Global editing (to facilitate, for example, page name changes)
        </li>
        <li>
           Page locking or password protection
        </li>
        <li>
           Vastly improved search capability, including phrase, boolean, proximity (within x) -- might be achieved by an external search engine like htDig, with robots.txt limits on which engines can index.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> with numbers, all caps
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is in addition to what I consider the standard features of a wiki, not listed here.
