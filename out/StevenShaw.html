        A very ancient opinion of mine on programming languages:
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm interested in programming languages. I'm especially drawn to <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>, <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> and <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>. I've discovered that there is a strong relationship between the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> and the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pretty ancient update to that opinion:

        After this spout of interest in dynamically typed languages, I realised that there really is a lot to be said for good tools like Eclipse and IntelliJ. Static typing helps with tooling. I am interested in languages like <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a>, <a href="SmlLanguage.html">SmlLanguage</a> and even the <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>. However, probably more relevant is the <a href="ScalaLanguage.html">ScalaLanguage</a>, which has many of their traits (and a few extra) and runs on top of the Java and .NET platforms (note that .NET implementation is now languishing). In any language now, I am going to miss navigation/comprehension tools like goto definition (ctrl-click), find usages (Alt-F7), highlight usages (Ctrl-Shift-F7), icons to indicator of overridden methods; refactorings like safe rename, extract interface and source generators like implement inherited methods; and even little things like import help, as-you-type warnings/errors along with suggestions to fix these. The <a href="ScalaLanguage.html">ScalaLanguage</a> currently has a rudimentary EclipsePlugin but it's a language worth watching. Apparently, <a href="JetBrains.html">JetBrains</a> are working on support in IntelliJ for the <a href="ScalaLanguage.html">ScalaLanguage</a>!
