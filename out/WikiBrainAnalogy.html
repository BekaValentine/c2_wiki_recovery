        Wiki Brain Analogy
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was just noticing that this Wiki structure is an awful lot like how science believes the brain forms new connections.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was also wondering if it was all as simple as it sounds.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           so far
        </li>
        <li>
           so good
          <ul>
            <li>
               and even better...
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At least as far as it goes ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        And if a thought should wander ...
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not really understand what is analogous to what in this analogy. Could you elaborate? (Ah, I'm <a href="ArguingWithGhosts.html">ArguingWithGhosts</a>, last edit November 11, 2004) - and why does Wiki think that I wrote all of this?
