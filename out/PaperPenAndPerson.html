        Paper Pen And Person
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Intent</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Separate the mechanics of drawing from the act of drawing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Motivation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In building an OO graphics system you must connect to an 
        existing host windowing system.  The host windowing system 
        API usually contains operations for drawing graphics 
        primitives (lines, rectangles, arcs, etc.) in a window.  
        Mapping these API calls to a set of objects often relies 
        upon a basic conception of the way people draw.

        <strong>Participants</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Pen</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               performs drawing commands for graphics primitives (lines, arcs, rectangles)
            </li>
            <li>
               maintains an internal state (color, line width, etc.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Paper</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               represents (fronts for) the operating system surface being drawn on (bitmap, screen, window)
            </li>
            <li>
               often responsible for creating pens
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Person</strong>
          <ul>
            <li>
               draws meaningful shapes and figures using the Pen
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Collaborations</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Person knows how to draw a specific visual (be it a bar chart, or a simple line of text).  It performs this by sending drawing commands to the Pen.  The Person is isolated from the connection to a particular type of Paper, allowing the same figures to be drawn on bitmaps, screens or printers.
        </li>
        <li>
           The act of drawing is separted from the mechanics of how the drawing is done.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Implementation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pen will often directly wrapper the API calls necessary 
        to implement the drawing primitives.  Most windowing 
        systems require a window handle to send these calls, 
        so it obtains that from Paper.  Paper is often subclassed 
        to represent the different types of graphics mediums 
        (bitmaps, screens and printers).  Person will be subclassed
        to represent each specific type of visual object.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Known Uses</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Smalltalk/V and <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> utilize this pattern in their 
        graphics systems.  In Smalltalk/V, Pen is represented by 
        the class Pen,  Paper is represented by the class 
        GraphicsMedium and its subclasses.  The Person is 
        represented by subclasses of SubPane.  In <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> Pen 
        is the class GraphicsContext.  Paper is the class 
        DisplaySurface and its subclasses.  The Person is 
        represented by the <a href="VisualComponent.html">VisualComponent</a> hierarchy.
        IBM Smalltalk has a similar concept, but it does not 
        map quite as well as Smalltalk/V and <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Related Patterns</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Paper, Pen and Person pattern can be combined with 
        Decorator and Composite to form a graphics hierarchy of 
        visuals that can contain other visuals.
