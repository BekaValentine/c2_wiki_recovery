        Hi, even if I do not know who you are, even virtually, the Wiki idea is really interesting. I am going to write what I can, extend wikiwiki how I can, but of course, with the hope, that never ever wikiwikiwikiwikiwikiwikiwiki would became a commercial site.
        I am convinced that the message <em>Will you be making further contributions?</em> is more automatic. But I wrote the answer. <a href="HunMike.html">HunMike</a>
