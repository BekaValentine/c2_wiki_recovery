        (ISBN: 1591394449) DoesITMatter? "Does IT Matter?" is the name of a controversial book that suggests a rethink on the <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a> of IT (Information Technology).

        The author, Nicholas Carr, started with the controversies in his 2003 HBR article called "IT does not matter".
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the chapters "The Universal Strategy Solvent", has a subtitle called "The IT Infrastructure's Corrosive Effect on Traditional Advantages". I do not have resources to buy the book, but can understand that escalating costs and rapid obsolescence derail multi-year infrastructure projects.

        In the <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> book "The Third Wave", the authors made this observation
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Once embedded in a computer program, the IT department owns the process - forever...Give ownership of the business process management back to the business people</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In some companies, <a href="EnterpriseResourcePlanning.html">EnterpriseResourcePlanning</a> software is acquired precisely for that reason, to bring "unruly" users to using standard processes, as cost of customization can be really high. Having standard processes means more opportunities for <a href="BusinessProcessOutsourcing.html">BusinessProcessOutsourcing</a> later on.

           <a href="DoesItMatter.html">DoesItMatter</a>? :) Sorry for the pun. Seriously, although it can be annoying clicking on a link and come to this page, and subsequently finding unexpected contents, this kind of thing will happen anyway due to <a href="AccidentalLinking.html">AccidentalLinking</a>, which is actually a desired "feature" of wiki. It makes wiki more like real life, where chance occurrences have more influence on life's outcomes than people admit.

           If there is a serious concern by the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a>, I suggest use of a <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> approach to disambiguation. I would suggest letting the original creator of the page decide.
