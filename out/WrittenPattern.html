        Written Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are patterns and then there are patterns that
        have been written.  See also <a href="PatternsVsDescriptions.html">PatternsVsDescriptions</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are many forms for writing patterns that work.  I've
        heard concerns from several people that the motivational part of
        patterns, the context and forces, are being neglected in
        many written patterns.  In the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> book, I find it rather
        hard to pick a general solution out of a pattern.  I don't
        find the "structure" diagram in the book, or the object
        models in Coad's book, sufficient to <em>get</em> the pattern.
        This is a counterpoint to the more commonly stated view,
        that every pattern <em>must</em> have a picture, some picture.
        Personally, I try to capture all the elements of a good
        pattern into a conversational style with no obvious formal
        structure.  That way, people who aren't familiar with the
        trappings of patterns aren't intimidated, and will be able
        to understand my patterns without being indoctrinated into
        "the patterns movement."  --n00b
