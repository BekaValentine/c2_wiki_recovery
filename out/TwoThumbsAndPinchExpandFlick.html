        <strong>Two Thumbs</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Having as a birthplace the games scenario where the users play their games primarily with the use of their two thumbs, this allows the user to grasp the Manipulation/Display device with two hands and use the two thumbs to make things happen. (Some of the latest devices have moved to a one hand grasp and manipulate, where the one thumb can do all the work with a small amount of hand shifting the device)

      <p>
        <strong>Pinch Expand</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A technique which combines the movement of two digits, 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           usually the forefinger and thumb 
          <ul>
            <li>
               in a pinch (to reduce display size or Zoom Out) 
            </li>
            <li>
               and the opposite motion - expand/unpinch (to enlarge or Zoom In)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Flick</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A process of up and down as well as side to side movement of the display by touching and then flicking with the index finger or other digit
      </p>

        To this one might add motion sensors which orient or control the display by tilting or rotating the display device as well as by compass orientation sensors to rotate map or mapping displays, as in routing and locale devices, and also a <a href="LinkableLocale.html">LinkableLocale</a>.
