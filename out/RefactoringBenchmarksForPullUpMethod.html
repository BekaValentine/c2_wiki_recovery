        Refactoring Benchmarks For Pull Up Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        Few more benchmarks I used when debugging Xrefactory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those benchmarks consider simplified version of pull-up with
        just one method to be moved into superclass (opposed to pulling up
        of two methods introduced in Martin's book).
      </p>
      <p>
        In general pulling up a method looks like a simple copy and paste
        of code, but take for example the case:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Super {<br/>
        int x = 0;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Infer {<br/>
        int x = 1;<br/>
        void toto() {System.out.println("x==" + x);}<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You can't simply move it to the superclass because it would change its
        behavior. One would expect that refactoring browser will issue an 
        error message. It can also to move the method as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Super {<br/>
        int x = 0;<br/>
        void toto() {System.out.println("x==" + ((Infer)this).x);} <br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Infer {<br/>
        int x = 1;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, this makes too much automatic modifications of code and users
        don't like big changes in their code. Isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I would vote for an error message in this benchmark (Marian).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        On the other side, automatic correction is surely expected in the
        following case:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Super {<br/>
        int x = 0;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Infer {<br/>
        int x = 1;<br/>
        void toto() {System.out.println("x==" + super.x);}<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        should give:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Super {<br/>
        int x = 0;<br/>
        void toto() {System.out.println("x==" + this.x);}  // or simply x ???<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Infer {<br/>
        int x = 1;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Also following benchmark is disputable:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Super {<br/>
        void f(Super s) {System.out.println("f(Super)");}<br/>
        void f(Infer i) {System.out.println("f(Infer)");}<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Infer {<br/>
        void callf() { f(this); }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        after pulling-up of callf, it should be:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Super {<br/>
        void f(Super s) {System.out.println("f(Super)");}<br/>
        void f(Infer i) {System.out.println("f(Infer)");}<br/>
        void callf() { f((Infer)this); }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Infer {<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And no cast is necessary in the following (similar) benchmark:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Super {<br/>
        void f(Super s) {System.out.println("f(Super)");}<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Infer {<br/>
        void callf() { f(this); }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        so, pulling up can simply move the method:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Super {<br/>
        void f(Super s) {System.out.println("f(Super)");}<br/>
        void callf() { f(this); }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Infer {<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I don't understand this.  Is the problem that a subclass can define a
        new variable with the same name as a variable in the superclass?
        Moving a method will cause it to refer to the superclass variable instead
        of the subclass variable.  So, is the problem that when you move
        a function to a different scope, you have to make sure that it refers to
        the same variables that it did in the old scope?
      </p>
      <p>
        IMO, defining a new variable with the same name as a variable in a
        superclass is a code smell.  It makes the code harder to understand
        because you might miss the local variable definition and think it
        refers to the one in the superclass.  If there is only one possibility,
        you can't choose the wrong one.  We need freedom from choice.

        Those benchmarks are intended to check capabilities of refactoring
        browsers. That is why they present small non-trivial cases with some
        problem. They do not demonstrate nothing in their own, they are just
        examples of initial situation and the result which should be
        obtained after application of the refactoring. A browser passing
        more benchmarks is better (in some sense) than another passing less
        benchmarks.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when looking on benchmarks, actually it seems that those
        problematic examples are due to bad smells in code.  In fact, 
        anything making future refactoring
        difficult is a bad smell.
