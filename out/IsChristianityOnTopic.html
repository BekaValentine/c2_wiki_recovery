        Is Christianity On Topic
      </h1>
      <p>
        Suggestion: if you don't like the Christianity pages (as I don't), then don't read them and for G*d's sake (if there is one) don't respond to them. I'm going back to that strategy, just wanted to share it with those who haven't thought of it. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a> is a wiki that is much more suited to such discussions. .... <strong>I didn't find this page on Why? Why?</strong> <em>Because it is obvious that on Why, Christianity (as well as other world views) is (are) on topic.</em>

        As an exercise in reasoning and establishing empirical evidence rules and guidelines (a <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> in itself), it can be relevant. However, the <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> aspect of it is generally off-topic.

        You look around at humanity, and it's definitely a hack-job.
