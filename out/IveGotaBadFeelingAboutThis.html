        Ive Gota Bad Feeling About This
      </h1>
      <p>
        Famous phrase from <a href="StarWars.html">StarWars</a>; uttered numerous times through the movies, usually right before a <a href="TurdFanCollision.html">TurdFanCollision</a> occurs.  At least once in every movie; more than once in several.  (Even more often than instances of C3P0 getting disassembled -- and poorly re-assembled -- in humiliating fashion).
      </p>
      <p>
        Frequently heard in many IT and software engineering shops as well; often with a similar result.
