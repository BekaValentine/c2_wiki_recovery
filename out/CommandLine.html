        Command Line
      </h1>
      <p>
        The command line is a textual prompt for a command.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also used to describe the textual interface to the system, as in, "I dropped to the command line and ran the application."
      </p>
      <p>
        And actually most people just say <a href="CommandLine.html">CommandLine</a>, when they mean typing something into a <a href="UnixShell.html">UnixShell</a> or <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> command or cmd window.
      </p>
      <p>
        There's an interesting sense of <em>height</em> when referring to the command line, as illustrated in the quote above.  There's a sense that the command line is "lower" in the system, closer to the base of the system.
