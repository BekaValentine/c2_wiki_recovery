        <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>'s imprint. A division of Microsoft, unlike many other "house" imprints like AdobePress and CiscoPress which are joint ventures with large tech publishers like <a href="PearsonEducation.html">PearsonEducation</a>. Most of its titles are specific to Microsoft products, but it also publishes books of broader interest like ScottMcConnell's <a href="CodeComplete.html">CodeComplete</a>. Holds a significant slice of the computer book market all to itself.
