        GPS, the General Problem Solver
      </p>
      <p>
        An early <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> program described in the paper "GPS, a Program That Simulates Human Thought" by Alan Newell and Herbert A. Simon. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In chapter four of his book <a href="ParadigmsOfArtificialIntelligenceProgramming.html">ParadigmsOfArtificialIntelligenceProgramming</a> <a href="PeterNorvig.html">PeterNorvig</a> describes the algorithm and gives an implementation in <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> (available from <a href="http://www.norvig.com/paip/README.html).">http://www.norvig.com/paip/README.html).</a> He then goes on to list many reasons why the General Problem Solver is not as general as it might appear at first contact (e.g. the SussmanAnomaly).

        See <a href="http://www.math.grin.edu/~stone/events/scheme-workshop/gps.html">http://www.math.grin.edu/~stone/events/scheme-workshop/gps.html</a> for a documented <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> implementation of the algorithm.

        In his famous 1976 essay "ArtificialIntelligenceMeetsNaturalStupidity" <a href="DrewMcDermott.html">DrewMcDermott</a> remarks: "By now, `GPS' is a colorless term denoting a particularly stupid program to solve puzzles. But it originally meant `General Problem Solver', which caused everybody a lot of needless excitement and distraction. It should have been called LFGNS - `Local-Feature-Guided Network Searcher.'"
