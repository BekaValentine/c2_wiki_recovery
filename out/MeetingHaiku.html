        Meeting Haiku
      </h1>
      <code>
        Why am I sitting <br/>
        In this dark conference room now? <br/>
        Outside, the sun shines<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Another slide show <br/>
        More details than I could want <br/>
        My desk gathers dust<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Prove that you are smart <br/>
        Ask more questions that show how <br/>
        You feed your ego<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Cool winds stroke soft grass. <br/>
        Birds sing sweet in budding trees. <br/>
        Is this meeting done?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Amazing talent <br/>
        Wasted in this conference room <br/>
        On status updates<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        All our good intent <br/>
        Lost in thick fogs of groupthink <br/>
        Can't wait for the break<br/>
      </code>

        I've been writing "boring meeting haiku" for a number of years; I write them as memos in my Palm.  Here are some of my efforts, for your enjoyment.  Feel free to quote, just please give me credit...
      </p>
      <code>
        Time crawls, eyelids droop<br/>
        Fools trying to think out loud<br/>
        Meetings can be hell<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Communication<br/>
        We try so hard, but we fail<br/>
        Please say that again<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Clash of departments<br/>
        Hidden agenda icebergs<br/>
        Glad I'm not a boss<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Sloughing through the code<br/>
        The devil is in the details<br/>
        I want to go home<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        We're off in the weeds<br/>
        Meetings multiply time waste<br/>
        Get me out of here<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that in general I'm not this morose; these are from the depths of particularly long, boring, stupid, endless meetings.  I've actually written more upbeat haiku...  -- <a href="AndyMoore.html">AndyMoore</a>

        Ponderous framework<br/>
        Over-designed new system<br/>
        The project is doomed<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Smoking cigarettes<br/>
        Outside on the fire escape<br/>
        Is more fun than this<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        This meeting is dull<br/>
        But the work is even worse<br/>
        Result: more haiku<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        For my sakes I hope<br/>
        The other people in here<br/>
        Don't see my glazed eyes<br/>

        I was expecting examples of sneaking Haiku's into what one says at the meeting.

        Like this?

        I have a question<br/>
        I thought this was a meeting<br/>
        Where are the donuts?<br/>
