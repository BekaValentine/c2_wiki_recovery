        William Shatner
      </h1>
      <p>
        An actor with more lives than a cat. Consider the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Various and sundry early 60s TV and movies (including the episode of <em>The Twilight Zone</em> with the monster on the airplane wing, and the infamous <em>Incubus</em> with dialogue entirely in (badly mispronounced) <a href="EsperantoLanguage.html">EsperantoLanguage</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Captain James T. Kirk on <em></em><a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a><em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           murderer on Columbo episode (early '80's?)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>T. J. Hooker</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Golden Throat (see <em>Singing Shatner</em> below)
        </li>
        <li>
           PriceLineDotCom beat poet
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Emergency 911</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Mazola Oil pitchman
        </li>
        <li>
           grocery store pitchman (but by gosh, the price is right!)
        </li>

        <strong>Singing Shatner</strong>
      </p>
      <p>

        His version of <em>Mr Tambourine Man</em> is particularly memorable...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Shatner as Kirk</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Prime Directive? What Prime Directive?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many variations on the "Kirk better than Picard" theme:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="http://wiw.org/~dopey/txt/kirk_over_picard.txt">http://wiw.org/~dopey/txt/kirk_over_picard.txt</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>"43. Picard flunked his entrance exams to Starfleet."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And lest we forget...
        Kirk <strong><em>cheated</em></strong> at Starfleet, and got away with it!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Spock, Sabotage the system."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Storage compartments? Storage compartments?"
      </p>

      <p>
        My dad's big brother's second wife's parents are pals with LeonardNimoy, which means they get to hear stuff about Shatner from time to time. They (my aunt and uncle) are horse people, and can't get enough of stories about Shatner falling off his quarter-horses in foolish circumstances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Only Shatner could take himself seriously enough to ask "Who put the tribbles in the quadrotriticale and what was in the grain that killed them?" with a straight face.  I do believe that was his primary purpose in the universe, and having done so, should have left the acting profession.  smj

        Shatner has an effective self-effacing cameo role in the film <em>Showtime</em>.  Noting "That guy is the worst actor I've ever seen," he gives acting lessons to RobertDeNiro.
