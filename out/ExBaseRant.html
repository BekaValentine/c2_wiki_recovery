        Ex Base Rant
      </h1>
      <p>
        (A rant about <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> moved from <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"I'm sniping </em><a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> as though <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s mouth is a clay-pigeon shooting machine... it's fun! join in."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [I did some sniping above, a while back. It was a bit like using an M198 howitzer to shoot an obese, sluggish fish in a small, almost-empty barrel; it seemed unsporting to take shots at such an easy target. I sometimes wonder if Top even belongs to the same IT world as, well, anyone else. I <em>do</em>, however, vaguely remember views like his causing a certain degree of irritation in the late 80s, when hordes of dBaseIII [<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>] "programmers" (I use the term loosely), uninformed in computer science, descended on the developer world like noisy, opinionated, ill-informed, irrational, illogical lemmings. Most of them -- driven mad by their own coding inability combined with stressful incomprehension of rising ideas like object-oriented programming -- plunged suicidally over the proverbial cliff years ago. Top seems to be the last of that breed. His sheer tenacity, against all reason (literally), accounts for how he survived.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [[ I think the reason you don't see anyone support <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> here, other than Top, isn't that they thought <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> was bad. They just don't want to be associated with Top's many other silly and ill-informed opinions.]]
      </p>
      <p>
        [It's got nothing to do with Top.  Most of us here are long-term professional programmers, and a significant number of us are professional programmers who lived through the <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> era and had to professionally endure the fact that <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> -- in all its various clones and incarnations -- wasn't just bad, it was awful.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [[ Professional programmers use the best tool for the job. <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> language/database programs were like a DSL for business applications. How would you compare a Visual <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> (VFP) database to Access? (If you say Access, you have never touched <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>.) If you think that Java or C#, with some third party libraries plus a RDBMS from another company is a quicker development environment, than VFP, you aren't much of a professional programmer. I would estimate that up to 1992 (Windows introduction), at least 90% of all small business custom software was developed in <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> products but they were obviously all wrong? ]]
      </p>
      <p>
        [They were all wrong, but not necessarily intentionally so.  The majority of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> programmers didn't come from a professional PC programming background -- they were former middle managers, or "kitchen table" amateurs, or accountants interested in (or driven to) technology, or (at best) former mainframe COBOL programmers -- so they didn't learn anything except <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> because they were unable to use anything except <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>.  That wasn't their fault, really -- they just weren't really programmers.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [I've used a variety of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> implementations -- dBaseII, dBaseIII, dBaseIV, dbXL, Quicksilver, FoxBase, Clipper, and Visual <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>.  They were all crap.  Access was (and still is) crap, too.  Asking which bit of crap is better than another -- like asking me to compare VFP to Access -- is like asking which turd I think smells better.  They all reek.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [[I think people calling other people's languages and development techniques names is quite unprofessional. There are many languages I would never use for reasons that seem important to me but I wouldn't call into question the professionalism of somebody who thought otherwise. That's just "unprofessional"!]]
      </p>
      <p>
        [Normally, I wouldn't call other people's languages and development techniques names, except <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>. It was so unutterably dire that anyone who defends it is beneath contempt.  If we're going to talk about what "unprofessional" is, I'll state this for the record: "Unprofessional" doesn't even begin to touch the level of deliberate incompetence that defence of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> clearly represents.]

        </li>
        <li>
           It was file based so lacked some security that was inherent in RDBMS
        </li>
        <li>
           It processed all data on the client computer rather than the server and so didn't scale as well as RDBMS

           I agree. I think you missed the point of my points above.

           [Actually, I don't want to call Top names, haven't done so, and he doesn't deserve it.  I'm not sure where you got the idea that I thought "[microcomputer] custom business software circa 1990 was done with Relational Databases", "micro computers were just toys" or that "'real software' could only be written for mainframes", but the reality was that whilst it was indeed possible to churn out brittle, inflexible, un-reusable code rather quickly using <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, it was also possible to churn out flexible, reliable, reusable code even faster using in-house custom tools.  That's what my company did, and we were very successful at it.  Within our market area, we put the <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> coders out of business; they couldn't compete with us.  Of course, it didn't hurt us that the average <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> coder knew little to nothing about <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>, business, bookkeeping, accounting, finance, social agility, marketing, or any other useful skill -- indeed, many of them were "downsized" middle managers and ex-government employees, with at best a smattering of project management experience and a lot of useless knowledge of bureaucracy -- so it didn't take much to help them be the architects of their own undoing.]

I've never met an <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> defender that I would call a "professional programmer".  Every one of them who didn't lift him or herself out of the <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> morass was incompetent.

        The <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> programmers were 3 times more productive than the bloat-creating OO fans.

The pressure from <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> programmers has forced MS to include the LINQ hack in their OO languages. OO may be okay for <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a>, but it gave business applications indigestion. OO fans used to chant "reuse reuse reuse". After a while it became apparent that it wasn't increasing reuse, and then the OO fans changed their story to vague, hard-to-measure, and inconsistent alleged benefits. -t

        [<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> programmers were so irritatingly boastful, and yet so staggeringly unproductive (as they drowned under a seething, spaghetti-like mass of unmaintainable <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> code and unmet requirements) that the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a>es rejected <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> and <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> programmers en-masse and switched to <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming, <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, and <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> out of sheer desperation. Top, it's ironic that the very thing you rail against -- <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programming for business applications -- is <em>exactly</em> what you and your ilk <em>drove</em> the PHBs to advocate. Your ignorance, arrogance, and inability to deliver value made them do it. Even an ounce of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> knowledge would have shown you the folly of relying on <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, a staggeringly flawed language and environment that was inherently unstable, unscalable and unmaintainable beyond trivial toy applications. Earlier tonight, I asked a room full of 100+ database students if any of them had heard of DBaseIII. One hand went up. Then I asked them how many had heard of Java, C#, C++, Python and so on, each in turn. Every hand went up. There's a reason <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> is almost unknown: It's because it <strong>sucked</strong>. Good riddance to bad rubbish...]

        That's different generations. You are ignorant about it. There's a reason Microsoft has maintained <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> until just a year or so ago. I agree that <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> failed to modernize, and tried to become more C++-like when it should have tried to take advantage of it's table-orientation. That being said, I've talk to multiple managers who agreed that <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> programmers were more productive than OOP fans. OOP sucks for most biz apps. But we're getting off topic here. <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> has almost nothing to do with <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>.

      <p>
        [That's my point: <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> is the <em>old</em> generation. Indeed, it's the <em>dead</em> generation. What is significant about <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> is not that Microsoft maintained it until recently, but that its last full release was in late 2004 and there won't be more. That should tell you something right there. There's a reason Microsoft dumped it, and that's because it's crap. Furthermore, it's unprofitable crap, because no one except a few lingering, aged desperados want anything to do with it. The problem with <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> was not its lack of, uh, "table-orientation", but the fact that it was slow, unreliable, based on a ghastly scripting language, incapable of scaling, unmaintainable, unsupportable, and was surrounded by ignorant, arrogant fanboys who didn't have the education or perspective to realise their pet environment was a dire, festering blight on the information technology landscape.

Thankfully. Congratulations on finding the "multiple" managers (what? all two of them?) who lived in fantasy-land along with you deluded <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> developers.

And being easily-learned by itself does not make it "bad". MS-Access has far more easier-trumps-coherency features, such as the need for mass replication of "column lists" for each query layer. They didn't remove redundancy, but instead made it easy to drag-and-copy. <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> is based on a <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> query product called Retrieve.

        <strong>LINQ Influence</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe Microsoft LINQ (<a href="LanguageIntegratedQueryProject.html">LanguageIntegratedQueryProject</a>) to be in large part fueled by MS <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> fans wanting query/table-centric features in app languages. This is based on personal observations and MS product conventions where <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> is often mentioned, as in, "I think you <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> fans out there will like this part of the demo...". And now Java and other languages are starting to get on the band-wagon. While there are some big warts in LINQ, it's a good start in the right direction; a refreshing refrain from 18 years of "everything must be an object". You can thank <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> for influencing LINQ. <strong>Good ideas never die, only take long naps</strong>. I'm not a fan of MS, but sometimes they accidentally get it almost right because they have their fingers in so many pies. - <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're making a wild speculation that is not supported by evidence. That LINQ is mentioned to </em><a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> fans is hardly evidence of LINQ's origins, but ample evidence of Microsoft's reasonable attempts to market a new feature to a notably irrascible developer community. Actually, attempts to overcome the so-called <a href="ImpedanceMismatch.html">ImpedanceMismatch</a> between imperative application development languages and database query languages are older than the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> itself. LINQ, <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> and <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>, <a href="EmbeddedSql.html">EmbeddedSql</a> (a close relative of LINQ, and its most likely inspiration), ORMs, and so on, are all attempts at addressing this. LINQ was not inspired by <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>/<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>. Rather, both were inspired by the divide between databases and programming languages that has been noted since CODASYL, and that has arguably only really been addressed by <a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is more optimized (interface-wise) for internal data structures than for communication with outside RDBMS. It would be the other way around if what you claim is true. Most likely Microsoft will favor integration with it's own SQL-based products, and it could be argued that's what they are after. But neither of us can dissect the neurons of the person(s) who made the final decision inside MS, so it's speculation either way. There are rumors that <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> fans had an influence, but I have no <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> to prove it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What do you mean by "[i]t is more optimized (interface-wise) for internal data structures than for communication with outside RDBMS"? Arguably, the person "who made the final decision inside MS" is Anders Hejlsberg; given that he's an experienced language designer, it's highly unlikely </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> was his inspiration. It's far more likely he was inspired by the same well-understood limitations of the application-language/database-language division that led to the creation of <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>/<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>. As for there being "rumors that <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> fans had an influence", obviously no "official double-blind certified peer-reviewed published study" exists to prove it, but <strong>some</strong> evidence would help. Got any?<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I heard it through the grapevine, and the grapevine may be wrong. The only way to know for sure is to interview those who brought about Linq.

        <strong>Frustration</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's frustrating not being able to communicate what I like about <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> and I continue to find current tools and languages lacking, taking me twice as long or more to do the same things. People seem to think old means bad. I'm all for finding a modern version or something that <strong>borrows the good ideas</strong> into an updated language, we just have to make sure modernizing it doesn't strip what was good about it. The <strong>three biggest factors</strong> that make it special are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Smaller granularity than SQL, assisting with <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Easy integration/mixing of relational operators with procedural scripting so that each does what it does best without verbose mapping between them.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ability to (optionally) see and/or use the intermediate results for trouble-shooting and <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> reduction. (This is partly facilitated by smaller granularity.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        My theory is that being used outside of what it is suited for is what mostly gave it a bad reputation. As a primary data repository (AKA "master tables") or as a heavy-duty app development platform, it is not well suited (at least in its current form). That I don't dispute. But for extraction for custom and "local" reports and statistics, and for ad-hoc data chomping, it's hard to beat.
      </p>
      <p>
        It just has the feel of something designed by practical people doing actual work. It's like that long lost love that left you ten years ago that you keep remembering because the current gal is a pain in the. 
      </p>
      <p>
        -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your choice of analogy is interesting, and perhaps revealing. There is no long lost gal I pine for; my current love by far the most amazing woman I've ever met. Every moment I'm with her, and every time I think of her, I'm ecstatic </em>'not<strong> to be with any of my ex-wives or lovers. Likewise </strong><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>. I'm glad it's gone and I don't want it back. I'd rather make a living licking bus-depot toilet seats than use it to write another business application, or use it for "local" reports & statistics or ad-hoc data-chomping. If there were good things in <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, like finer-grained operators than SQL, they are found in emerging but embryonic efforts like <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>. My implementation of it, the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>, is increasingly being explored by students, researchers and organisations for use in research projects and small-scale practical applications. Like me, they see its potential. Each update adds functionality or fixes that bring it closer to the inevitable point where it will be a serious contender against the major database-driven-application development environments. I'm working now on facilities to connect it to external data sources (text files, Excel-format spreadsheets, and external SQL DBMSes) and exploring adding a user-friendly front-end -- including reporting, graphing and data-analysis facilities -- to its currently-crude desktop client. It will get better and better and better, but <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> is frozen in the past and won't be back.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe it's time to look to the future. If you feel the future should include elements of the </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, then please consider joining the effort to produce <strong>better</strong> tools, rather than merely repeating the past.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> is too "type anal" in my opinion. Maybe for medical, bank, or space apps that approach is worth the type fastidiousness tax, but I'm thinking <strong>scripty tables</strong> while you are thinking "Ada tables". If this is going to turn into another "type fight", then we can just acknowledge existing topics that war over that rather than reinvent them here. I'm happy to have a marketplace with both kinds of tools/approaches. Nothing wrong with "repeating the past" if there are good things about the past. <strong>Lisp is an example of something that is conceptually brilliant and has useful niches despite it's age</strong> (and still being refined, such as the Arc project). And again, I'm not against modernizing <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> or something like it. -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think you're projecting your own negative fantasies here. Have you tried Rel? It is no more "type anal" than SQL -- or </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> -- if you like. You can easily create user-defined types, but nothing forces you to do so. I certainly have nothing against good things from the past -- indeed, my PhD work is based on a paper written in 1968 -- but <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> wasn't a good thing from the past. It certainly wasn't conceptually brilliant. It's simply a thing you knew and nostalgia supplied the rest.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't buy the nostalgia argument. I've used MS-Access for about the same amount of time now along with some other DB tools, and they are just missing something. They all have different things that I like, but just have a big conceptual gap that they cannot fill well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What conceptual gap?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Other than a cleaner relational and typing model, what does <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> do significantly better than PL/SQL (Oracle's SQL-procedural-bridging language)?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Cleaner syntax, familiar programming language "variable" semantics for "tables" (better known as </em><a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s), trivial creation of local/temporary <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s, explicit <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a> operators for finer-grained operations, it's a general-purpose programming language with DBMS capabilities rather than just a DBMS with internal procedural scripting, support for nested relations, no NULLs, no dependency on column order, support for true database constraints, etc. Future <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> extensions include desktop DBMS capability (a la <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>), connections to external data sources, data analysis & reporting/graphing plugins, etc.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I applaud the finer granularity, but column order and nulls are often <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>s that simplify certain things the same way that positional parameters often are more reader-friendly than named (key-word) parameters (ideally a language allows a mix).
      </p>

        <em> positional parameters might be </em>'writer<strong> friendly, but absolutely not </strong>reader<em>' friendly (just try to find out which values match with field in a list with 10 or 20 of them</em> (some examples of code with and without parameters here <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Named_parameter</a> ).

      </ul>
      <p>
        I didn't say <em>always</em> use positional parameters. You are using somewhat extreme cases. <a href="PickTheRightToolForTheJob.html">PickTheRightToolForTheJob</a>. As far as function calls, my general rule of thumb is limit the quantity of positional parameters to 4 if infrequently called and 7 for frequently-called functions/methods. If I am doing a UNION to a bunch of thin tables, such as a heavily-selected set of tables split by year, then positional can simplify life. (Whether it's good to split tables by years may not always be a good practice, but users of the data don't always have that design choice.)

      <ul>
        <li>
           [<em>Positionality in UNION is a SQL thing. In </em><a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, the UNION of (for example) three tables might be <strong>UNION {YearData2008, YearData2009, YearData2010}</strong>.

        Just thought I'd clear up a few points about Visual Foxpro (VFP). The discussion here suggests that the participants aren't really aware of some things about this development system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> is one of *two* languages implemented in Visual Foxpro (VFP). The other is a variant of SQL. With the last version of VFP (VFP 9), many limits on SQL expressions present in previous versions were removed. It's not a complete implementation of the ANSI standard current at the time of release, but it has the most common features. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When discussing <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, it's important to make a distinction between its flat-file table storage system, and the accompanying (often very rich) programming language. There are clear limitations to the aging flat-file table design, in terms of both security and scaling. However, the programming language remains a very viable tool for middleware, and, in the case of VFP, for GUIs. VFP can talk to any separate RDMS that provides an ODBC driver. And once it has its hands on the data, its internal RDMS can do things with that data quickly and easily (in both design-time and run-time terms) that users of other languages can only dream about.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What do you mean by "flat file" here? Do you mean lacking "automatic" indexes? Almost every vendor eventually added real indexing, it's just that they didn't follow a universal standard, splitting the dialects.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        [I was a designer/developer of an <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> product in the 1980's and I never saw any <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> program (including dBaseII) that didn't have "automatic indexes". <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> products were created by many competing companies and they had an <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> flavor but were never designed to be 100% compatible with each other. --- <a href="DavidClarkd.html">DavidClarkd</a> ]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Most <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> products did not have "automatic indexes".  They had to be specified explicitly by the developer.  Once specified, they were automatically updated as their associated tables were updated.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm sorry. I'm probably not using the term correctly. I meant to differentiate VFP tables from "set-based" relational database management systems that have "self-contained" data storage. VFP is relational, and is capable of SQL-type manipulation as well as <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>-style operations. It also has a system for linking separate tables into a "database" and incorporating some advanced database features, such as referential integrity, constraints, stored procedures, triggers, and security rules, into them. Use of those features is optional. And, unlike "big-iron" databases, in VFP every table is a separate file, and the database linkage metadata for them is stored in a separate control table called a "database container". FoxBase and <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> used the same stand-alone index files (.idx) that dBase used. Later VFP added both non-structural and structural compound index files (.cdx). Both of these combine all indexes for a single table in one file. The former requires manual updating; the latter updates automatically with changes to the table. These index files are separate from the table files. Also, VFP tables have a "memo" data type, a text field whose width is "unlimited" (except by the rest of the table structure and the 2 GB single-file-size limit). Memo data for a table is stored in a separate file named for the table but with an .fpt extension; the table contains a pointer to the field in the .fpt file that stores the actual contents of the field.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        "Console"-style interfaces can still be (more or less) implemented in Visual Foxpro. The default, though, is a Windows GUI, implemented using visual control classes internal to VFP rather than the Windows native controls. (Many, many businesses are still using console-style interfaces though, regardless of what it is said that users like. In fact, purchasers of custom, or "bespoke", software still often demand that the interface at least look like an old-style console, even if it has to be faked using modern GUI controls. Nor is <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> dead; thousands of business applications developed in very old versions of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> languages are still in constant use around the world, and still being maintained and extended. This is because these applications work very well and continue to meet the needs for which they were designed, in some cases decades after they were created. To suggest otherwise is to demonstrate parochial ignorance. Er... :-) )
      </p>
      <p>
        [ As a former <a href="VisualFoxPro.html">VisualFoxPro</a> developer, VFP came with an interactive console interface that was used by developers. The program produced .EXE programs that end users ran which provided a modern multi-window, menu, mouseable Windows interface for clients.  --- <a href="DavidClarkd.html">DavidClarkd</a> ]
      </p>
      <p>
        Procedural and object-oriented programming are both supported by VFP. The OO system is pretty elegant and mostly complete. Missing pieces that I'd like to have are the ability to create one's own base classes not based on a member of the VFP baseclass library, and multiple inheritance. On the other hand, VFP OO does not suffer from the runaway "everything-is-an-object" cancer found in some other languages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh..and VFP is still formally supported by Microsoft, and will be until 2015. -- <a href="KenDibble.html">KenDibble</a>

        <strong>CRUD God</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> products were not well-suited for "fancy" or "dazzling" UI's. However, I grew well versed in CUI techniques (character or command-based interfaces) over time and was often thanked by the users for streamlining their work. They were more efficient in them than modern GUI's for most CRUD I'd argue. Know the tool, users, and domain well, the strength and weaknesses of each, and you master productivity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        They had standard list-style menus for newbies, but I also included various keyboard short-cut techniques for the most common operations and used consistent conventions to improve "finger reuse". Often they <strong>didn't even have to look at the damned screen</strong> to get what they wanted because they memorized the keyboard shortcuts. Thus, it was straight-forward to newbies with the conventional menus, yet had a second-tier command/keyboard interface for experienced users that became second-nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that if you are selling products to multiple clients, which some of the above detractors seemed to have been doing, then the ugliness of such interfaces probably would produce "anti-sell" vibes.  But my apps were mostly in-house apps and <strong>I made them hum like nobody's mother</strong> and was loved by the users so much that one introduced me to her daughter, <em>despite</em> my clunky personal skills. When some of it was replaced via a mandate from PHB's, they had to hire extra staff (users) to do the same job; there was a noticeable profit dip on the charts. The CEO even sent out a memo to every department that we re-interpreted as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Dear staff, quit complaining about the new software. I don't want to hear about it anymore. I realize it seems difficult now, but trust us that it will </em>eventually<em> pay off by allowing us to centralize productivity auditing in order to more quickly and easily verify[1] that the new software is fucking up the company. -Your Friendly CEO</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I miss being a CRUD God. The new shit is too bloated and consists of too many <strong>poorly-integrated languages/conventions/APIs</strong> etc. to crank out and tune stuff quickly and cheaply. And get off my xLawn!

        <strong>Tools versus Tool User Confusion</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe your team were top-end C++ coders (assuming your story is true). Top-end C++ coders of course are going to flatten average <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> coders in the market-place (especially areas drifting away from <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>'s advantages). Top-end X-ers will almost always beat average Y-ers (if their products compete in the same market more or less). I've seen C++ teams struggle to match the productivity of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> coders myself. Perhaps they were low-end C++ coders competing with medium or top-level <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> coders. It's hard to know without wider detailed surveys. I believe you are <strong>over-extrapolating</strong> a limited situation. -t
      </p>

        <em>I only related an anecdote, so I'm not sure what you think I was "over-extrapolating" given I made no extrapolations at all.</em>

      <p>
        "...hordes of...[<a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>]..."programmers" (I use the term loosely), uninformed in computer science, descended on the developer world like noisy, opinionated, ill-informed, irrational, illogical lemmings..." If that's not extrapolation, then I don't know what is.

        If you happen to be a C++ whiz (for the sake of argument) and you run circles around average xBasers, you may conclude that all xBasers and/or all of xBase is crap, as the anti-xBase rant implies. But what you are failing to consider is sub-par C++ coders out there. (Like I said above, I've seen xBase teams clearly out-produce C++ teams.) Thus, it appears you are extrapolating your <strong>own</strong> C++ whizness to all of C++ land. Is that clearer? Further, you seem to be extrapolating <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>'s weakness in machine-level and fine-tuned graphics control to the entire worth of the tool. It's a form of , "X is bad at A and B, and therefore X is bad in general". That is a form of (poor) extrapolation. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My only claim on </em><a href="IfFooIsSoGreatHowComeYouAreNotRich.html">IfFooIsSoGreatHowComeYouAreNotRich</a> was that with a good tool, you can blow your competition out of the water. I made no claims as to why that is the case -- other than that we specifically sought to address the limitations we recognised in <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> -- so any extrapolations are your own.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As for </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> being bad, it was bad in every possible area: The language was badly designed and badly implemented.  I had no issue with its "weakness in machine-level and fine-tuned graphics control" -- I'm not even sure what that means.  I had a problem with its modal behaviour, its poor performance, its file-sharing concurrency model, its verbosity, its awkward syntax that resulted in an almost perverse obstruction to re-use, etc.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It depends on what kind of reuse we are talking about. If you want to re-write all the lower-level interfaces to your or the customer's whims, then I agree with you 100%. However, I've seen nothing in it that hindered business-logic-level reuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What hindered business-logic-level reuse was the inability to parametrise table references or make them generic in any but the most awkward (and slow) ways, and the modality of the language required that modes be preserved at the entry to a routine and restored at the exit.  This was awkward, failure-prone (forgetting a 'preserve' or 'restore' was easy), and slow.  I'm sure there were other roadblocks, but I forget them now.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Macros allowed one to parametrise just about anything. Such would not typically be in a "tight" loop such that I don't know why it would make the app "slow". I agree that "modality" was a problem, but if you establish conventions you minimize them. C++ has its own gotcha's.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It did, but we had no problems with those.  We all agreed that </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> was dire, for many reasons.  I'm sure I've forgotten most of them, but I do remember that dropping <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> was not a decision made lightly -- we were well aware of what it might mean in terms of leaving a well-known, accepted platform for an unknown approach.  Fortunately, it worked.<em></em>

        <strong>Meta Analysis</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this topic is interesting on a level beyond just <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> itself. C++ and <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> are very different languages and tools with very different design philosophies. <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> is a semi-dynamic <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> intended for smaller custom CRUD-centric projects. If you stick with its conventions and "flavor", you can achieve a lot of functionality with little code, typing, and library preparation. Whether C++ can compete in that arena is hard to say. To me it appears it couldn't based on my observations, at least at the <strong>hands of average coders</strong>. I suspect one could make a nice C++ library to compete in xBase's core niche, but coders coming in from the outside would have to learn that library before they become productive. By packaging the DSL into a widely-known language (set), xBase made <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a> possible. If that C++ library became popular, perhaps it too could achieve the same swappability, but the reality is that it didn't during xBase's hay-day. Some of it is <a href="QwertySyndrome.html">QwertySyndrome</a>. (One could argue that xBase was <em>too</em> specifically tuned to domain/style, and that's why it shrank in popularity during the GUI era, while C++ retained about the same market share.) -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>One of the reasons I think we were successful with C and C++ libraries and tools was that we could specifically target limitations in </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>.  <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> was essentially static.  Fixing its limitations required either a new version of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> (rare) or in-house and/or third-party tools and libraries.  However, the <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> language itself made building generic add-ons so difficult that constructing good quality tools or libraries was a dire effort (and the results tended to be painfully slow) and good third-party tools were rare.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Our C and C++ libraries and tools had no such limitation.  The built-in </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> report facilities were too limiting, and coding reports from scratch was too slow and error-prone, so we built C++ tools and libraries that made complex reports easy to create.  Creating complex forms in <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> was also too slow and painful, so we created an event-driven forms library, a C++-based forms painter, and a forms sublanguage.  Creating drop-down menus and popup windows was slow and awkward in the <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> clone we were using, so we defined menu-and-dialog routines in C++ to make it easier.  The locking-based concurrency approach used by <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> proved too failure-prone and complex, so we built a new database engine in C++ that sheltered the developer from the complexities of handling concurrency.  And so on.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In short, the advantage of C/C++ was that it was easily extensible, so we could continuously improve our tools.  In </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, the language itself fought back against tool-based continuous improvement.  Whilst we could make our tools better, our <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>-using competitors were essentially stuck with whatever their <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> implementations gave them.  It made a significant difference, to the point that even our weakest C++ programmer -- using our libraries and tools -- could outperform a strong <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> programmer.  Using raw C++ and a typical project development timeframe, I'm sure a good <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> programmer would run circles around even an expert C++ programmer.  However, using carefully honed C++ libraries that were iteratively developed specifically to address <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>'s limitations, we gained a competitive advantage that even the best <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> programmers couldn't beat.<em></em>

        In short, you were "using it wrong". It facilitated <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a> per above. Your approach does not (outside of your org or staff). You gain finer-grain fiddle-ability AT THE EXPENSE OF <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a>.

        <em>I don't recall there being a "Use only for ..." on the dBaseIII box.  Our clients didn't care whether we used </em><a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a> or not.  They only cared whether or not we delivered high quality software on time and under budget.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reasonably experienced IT shops did consider maintainability per staffing. C/C++ coders typically didn't work on small or narrow-niche custom biz apps, period, but rather packaged commercial apps.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I'm sure that was typical.  As C/C++ programmers, we thought we could gain a competitive advantage using C/C++ for custom business applications, and we did.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As far as pop-up menus/dialogs, I agree earlier versions often made pop-up dialogs difficult; but in the earlier DOS & CUI days you were not expected to make pop-ups, and users were often confused by them if you gave them one. They were used to keyboards, not GUI's. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There were different ways to go about pop-up equivalents, depending on the typical work-flow. (I'd generally learn the work-flow of the customer (user) before designing an interface.) For example, take this typical form:
      </p>
      <code>

        For more involved lookup lists, such as Store City and Issue Category, the best approach typically depends on how often they change (on an instance form). Here is one approach:
      </p>
      <p>
        On the main menu(s) you'd typically have something like "A - Add new record" and "C - Change record". If the user selects "A" for Add, then the lookup lists would come up first and would typically look like:
      </p>
      <code>
        STORE (CITY) SELECTION MENU<br/>
        CH - Chicago<br/>
        HO - Houston<br/>
        LA - Los Angeles<br/>
        NY - New York  <br/>
        PH - Philadelphia<br/>
        SA - San Antonio<br/>
        SD - San Diego // etc...<br/>
        ------------------<br/>
        UN - Unknown<br/>
        NA - Not Applicable (Ex: operations or admin)<br/>
        HE - Help & Search Tips<br/>
        (Blank for Back)<br/>
        ------------------<br/>
        Enter Code: _<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Each list would be presented in a sequence for such new records before taking the user to the "regular" field form. Thus, when the user is done entering city, the Issue Category menu comes up, and then the general form (Form 7a above).
      </p>
      <p>
        Longer lists that don't fit on one screen would typically have some kind of pattern matching or partial lookup. For example, if the user enters one letter instead of 2, then a list of all cities starting with that letter would be given. Maybe typing "\TEN" would show every city containing the sub-string "TEN".
      </p>
      <p>
        To change existing records, the original menu above may be expanded to resemble:
      </p>
      <code>
        ISSUE TRACKER MENU<br/>
        A - Add a ticket<br/>
        C - Change or delete a ticket<br/>
        Y - change store citY code<br/>
        I - change Issue category<br/>
        F - Find existing issue tickets<br/>
        R - Reports<br/>
        (Blank for Back)<br/>
        Enter Code: _<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A prompt for the Ticket ID may come up for some of these choices. Typically it would be pre-populated with the prior entered ID so that one didn't have to keep re-entering it if working on the same record via multiple menu options.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also on the regular form, they could optionally go ahead and enter the abbreviation codes directly without going through the selection screen(s). Experienced users memorized the codes. (This would be for changing an existing code. For new tickets, going through the code menus doesn't cost extra key-strokes anyhow.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Another or additional approach to look-up lists is to have a "Menu?" prompt after each code field. If "Y" (Yes) is given, then the menu list is displayed after they save the form.
      </p>
      <code>
        Issue Category: [__] Menu? Y/N [N]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A variation on this is to show the code menus (afterwards) if an asterisk(s) is entered. This reduces having another field to tab through (Enter-through back then):
      </p>
      <code>
        Issue Category: [__] (* for later menu)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>I had no trouble making a library of routines to handle (reuse) these kinds of conventions.</strong> Most of my time was spent fiddling with very domain-specific processing and reporting requirements, not UI's such as above. Often I'd bang out the general menus and base entity screens in a couple of days, and the weeks that followed were spent on specialized needs and iterative customer feedback.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you make it so single-letter menus don't need to press Enter, then many users are <strong>quite productive</strong> with such CUI interfaces, often even better than with GUI's. (If they didn't have a slow PC.) GUI's are not really optimized for productivity, but rather ease of learning for newbies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We won contracts by demonstrating that our interfaces were far slicker than the above, which were typical of </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> applications.  It doesn't matter whether our interfaces were actually faster/easier/etc. or not -- just being able to pop up a list of options without changing screen or requiring code books was often sufficient to make a sale.<em></em>

        Well, I saw no evidence that swarms of C++ programmers were doing that on a wide scale for a <strong>decent price</strong>. That your particular team was able to pull it off is great, but apparently it was something other C/C++ contractors were not able to re-create. Your personal experience does not scale. (And finding maintenance programmers who can navigate your custom libraries is still an open issue.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It wasn't done on a wide scale.  We were computer scientists with a keen interest in programming, which we genuinely loved for its own sake.  Most of our competitors were accountants and former middle managers or ex-mainframe coders with a deep loathing of programming.  They did it because management thought it was a source of easy revenue.  As for navigating custom libraries, we had connections with the local university and our libraries were used for the practical portion of a course.  That provided us with a steady stream of developers pre-trained to use our tools.</em>

        How would that work in a non-university town?

      <p>
        <em>I have no idea.  That's not my problem.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's pretty obvious from that statement that you do not wish to look at the issue of tool selection from a general business perspective. "Let me play with my fancy bits, for financing and finding future maintenance programmers are <a href="SomebodyElsesProblem.html">SomebodyElsesProblem</a>."
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I rest my case.</strong> --top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How do you infer that from my statement?  We were in a university town. We had contacts in the university, and leveraged them to our business advantage.  It was of advantage to the students, too, because they got to work for us and learned a lot.  I can't speak for non-university towns, because I didn't live in one.  How does that generalise to some arbitrary statement about maintenance programmers?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't generalize, and that's the problem. You appear to admit that your observations/experience about programmer knowledge and availability may not apply to non-university towns per "I can't speak for non-university towns...". That's <strong>important info</strong> for anybody considering recreating your (alleged) situation and/or selecting contractors and programming stacks. Plus, if every contractor did it, it may dry up the supply of students and/or recent graduates. There are <strong>staff scalability questions</strong> both in a U town and out. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, that particular issue doesn't generalise.  What generalises is using a better tool than the one your competitor uses to beat your competitor.  The definition of "better tool" may vary.  In our case, at that time, it was C/C++.  Under a different time and set of circumstances, it might have been something different.</em>

           Also note that the managers making the final decisions mostly cared about what's on their <strong>printed reports</strong>. They themselves often didn't do the screen-work, but rather lower-level staff (this balance has since changed to a large degree). If you wanted to <strong>dazzle that level</strong>, then give them the fancy reports they want. That's often where I spent most of my UI work, not screens. I made loved reports, not loved screens.

           I don't see how xBase was weak on report customization; most of it was string fiddling; other than maybe being a bit slow.

           <em>Really?  It was terrible.  For example, how do you create a report that nests other reports?  How do you create a mixed columnar and free-format report?  More than the default (two?) nested grouping levels?  Dynamic headers and footers?  Grid reports (e.g., calendars)?  Etc.</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As far as 3-or-more-level nested reports, typically I'd create a work-table with character columns for the visible report columns (cells formatted by another process), and have hidden "level control" and "sort control" columns. I'd pre-generate all the summary rows with the appropriate level control codes, add in the detail rows (if applicable), and then sort the work table on the level- and sorting- control columns to make it appear in the proper order in the output report. <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a>. I had subroutine libraries for such, using the all the nice table-oriented features of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> to do most of the <a href="DatabaseVerbs.html">DatabaseVerbs</a>-related grunt work. I even got a <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a> to handle most of the column formatting (width, format template strings, summary handling codes, key grouping participation, etc.) such that I use BROWSE at the command line to fill in the <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a> for a given report. -t

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's not complex; I bet the alternative is more lines of code. Note that commercial report writing software already existed and read DBF files such that it was often not economical to re-invent the report writing wheel. Typically xBase was used where the requirement were one-off fidgety-fudgety to a particular company or department. Excessive abstraction is often a waste for such because the chance of reuse is low.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>We looked at the commercial report-writing software available at the time, and it was either inadequate or involved costly run-time licenses.

           How would a <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a> be worse? You are telling me it's easier to enter report column specifications as C++ code instead of filling in a table via a <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> grid? (It was also easy to turn an existing table schema into column-to-row-based table so that one can pre-fill the table based on an existing table as a starting point.)

           I never claimed it did everything for every kind of report (although I haven't tested the limits). For a typical multi-nested report (totals, sub-totals, sub-sub-totals..., detail) it's generally easier to specify column info via a <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> input grid than via application code. (At least for my eyes.) Typical info put into the DD may be source table row-name/source/formula, column title, format type/category, max width (or fill width), zero/blank/null handling method, overflow handling method (truncate, warning footnote, error-stop, scoot right, multi-line, etc.), summary usage (none, total, count, average, weighted average, etc.) -t

           There may have been a fair amount of projects, shops, or management personalities that wanted or needed more sophisticated or snappier screen UI's. Being that <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> was overall weak in that area, there indeed may have been a solid niche in screen-centric development. HOWEVER, that does not mean that C/C++ is a replacement for ALL of xBASE's ninche(s). For example, a good leather shop, say Bob's Upholstery, may be able to take away a lot of customization biz away from nearby car dealers. However, that does not mean Bob's Upholstery can take over all the functions of a car dealer. The car dealer may still do better on integrated service, one-stop servicing, and bundled deals. For customers in which upholstery matters more than the other factors, Bob's Upholstery is the way to go. Your viewpoint appears to be rather narrow.

        This would mean that you don't incur the costs of analysis because somebody already did it. Getting the customer's requirements right is often the bottleneck, not technology. Customers are not IT experts and often either don't know what to ask for, or ask for something they don't really need because they saw an ad but don't know better. It takes <strong>experience</strong> and often some trial and error to tease out the requirements and ask the right questions via a kind of <a href="SocraticMethod.html">SocraticMethod</a>.

        I doubt your "army of students/graduates" would be decent analysts; they'd be too green. Thus, if one was starting from scratch, they'd need to hire an analyst also, not JUST coder. For smaller projects this would mean hiring an analyst and a separate coder since somebody adept in both is relatively rare. xBase is easier for an analyst to pick up so that an org is less likely to have hire two people.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefor, I doubt your approach would be effective for new projects. But it may also suggest that it's <strong>not an either/or situation</strong>: the best approach may be to prototype the project in xBase, tune it to fit requirements, and then later convert it to C/C++ to get speed and visual dazzle (if a co wants to pay for dazzle).

        Being you discovered the off-the-shelf PC report writers didn't provide very good choices, why didn't you go into that business instead?

        [1] One of the alleged selling points of the new software was that it would integrate and centralize CEO-level reporting of general operations to get a better big picture. Before, each division had their own systems. While it may have been true that the CEO-level reporting may have been improved, it came at the cost of lost productivity at the staff level. Is the more timely summary info really worth staff-level productivity dips? This is why we started joking that the new system allowed them to better verify that they screwed up by picking the new system. Suckage Recursion. I'd estimate it would have taken about 10 extra clerk-level people to match the productivity of the <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> software. However, the company only hired about 5 new, meaning productivity slumped AND they had a bigger staff than before. I suspect they did this because they would have to admit they really screwed up big-time if they hired 10, so 5 was their ugly ego compromise. Two yellow flags "looks better" than one red flag.
