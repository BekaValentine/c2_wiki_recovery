        Coffee Talk

      <p>
        A subset of the C3 <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s, run before code release.  It runs a bit too long to wait for, so we go out for coffee.  We changed our process to require this when we went to production, because we wanted to be sure we didn't break the production system.  Since we push code to production only about weekly, the <a href="CoffeeTalk.html">CoffeeTalk</a> suite gives us an early warning, when we know what has changed to cause the problem.  We run the full suite of <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s, in <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>, before code push. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Someone touched this page, drawing my attention back to it. I wonder whether we need to find a better way to be sure the system works perfectly than running lots of paychecks. How could we do that, I wonder ...

        <em>Isn't the Xp way "one wonder at a time"?</em> :) :)

        <em>"run before code release"</em> - does that mean at task integration time?

        Could you please explain a bit more about <a href="CoffeeTalk.html">CoffeeTalk</a> please. Is it like JUnit? What can/not it do? Where can I get a copy to try? Is the world round?!
