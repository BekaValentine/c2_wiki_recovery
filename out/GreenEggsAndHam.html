        Green Eggs And Ham
      </h1>
      <p>
        A classic children's book by my favorite poet: <a href="TheodorGeisel.html">TheodorGeisel</a> aka <a href="DoctorSeuss.html">DoctorSeuss</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Published by Random House, <em>Green Eggs and Ham</em> [1] [ISBN 0394800168], is well worth the 5 minutes required to read it, and provides a wonderful lesson about trying things before condemnation.

        <em>Of course, the adult in me chuckles at the pictures of a locomotive (with an automobile perched on top) running off the end of a railroad track which goes nowhere, and falling into a river and landing smack dab on top of a boat--and none of the occupants of any of the aforementioned vehicles seem to notice at all that this has occurred...</em>
