        Xml Abuse
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are countless examples of XML abuse out there. Many of these examples seem to motivate people to come here and argue that <a href="XmlSucks.html">XmlSucks</a>, when what they are really arguing is that <em>that</em> particular use of XML sucks. Clearly, those examples do not belong in a discussion on whether or not XML sucks, but they are interesting nonetheless, and this page is a good place to discuss them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common abuses:

           Failure to <a href="GroupRelatedData.html">GroupRelatedData</a>.

           Using XML where a database would be more suited.

           Using XML as a data format when it's a document format.

      <p>
        This page ended up more or less empty after refactoring the problems into patterns; should we keep it nonetheless?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, please. We are still seeing plenty of folk (primarily Lispers, but there are others) who are arguing that XML is a bad technology because it doesn't do this or it doesn't do that or because the hype is harmful or because it is difficult to parse or because of some other characteristic. In point of fact, almost all of the objections to XML - as well as most technologies that draw fire on this Wiki - are based either on a lack of understanding of the proper use of XML or because some Wikizen has had a bad experience in the application of the technology. It's good to have a central clearinghouse to debunk some of this noise.</em>

        <strong>Using XML where a database would be more suited</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One hint that you may be better off with a relational database is that there is no obvious hierarchy to your data. In particular, XML does not lend itself very well to represent many-to-many relationships. It can be done, of course, but prepare to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           get jiggy with the old ID and IDREF
        </li>
        <li>
           think of your document as just a giant stew of tags with labels on them
        </li>
        <li>
           change your opinion about XSLT from "sexy as hell" to "messy as well".
        </li>
      </ul>

        Using XML as a procedural language, the way Ant does, strikes me as <a href="XmlAbuse.html">XmlAbuse</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree, first of all because Ant is ideally meant to be declarative, not procedural. A build file is a collection of named actions with parameters and possible sub-actions and/or sub-parameters. Coming up with a new syntax (like, one that requires a tab as the first character, for example) for this when XML is perfectly applicable would be silly.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that ant is not yet smart enough to figure out what you want it to do. Also, often you just want to <strong>do</strong> something, like copying files. And a declarative approach is, at best, unintuitive here. The XML gets shoehorned into some poor <em>make</em> imitation. I think this example <strong>is</strong> abuse of XML. ~~ Jan Seeger

        Rendering datafiles human-readable helps no human read them because for even trivial datasets no human can keep track of all the complexity in the file.

        XML is certainly more readable to humans, and displayable by more tools than windows registry binary format. Nor is any special-purpose tool necessary, see <a href="PowerOfPlainText.html">PowerOfPlainText</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That simply depends on the tool you use to read it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Doesn't everything? You have to use a tool to do anything with a computer; why is that a problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And with XML (or plain text) I don't need a different tool per format</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'm afraid this is missing the point. Yes, of course, you can read text with any tool. The trouble is the text doesn't mean any more to you than the original binary did. No one ever pages through an XML text file trying to understand what's in it. You don't, I don't, your customers don't - no one does.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the data may as well be a binary standard. XML is hyped as some kind of universal data language, but it doesn't do anything for the data but formalize its' alphabet a little. The ontologies represented by the data are still hidden, implicit in the combinatorial relationships between each element.
      </p>
      <p>
        And for this imaginary benefit of "readable data" we're going to retool everything yet another time? What's the bloody point?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I think that's an underestimation of the final users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways you can't expect XML (or any other input method) to do all the work itself, if you want users to be able to use it just describe them how your file's elements and attributes work, just a reference specification file would help.

           Bad example. A table is always easier to read than XML and you can run SQL on it. And there are a bajillion tools to make it even more readable/queryable. I can look at one table and read 30 of those books in seconds. To do the same in XML I'd have to scroll vertically down 15 pages of text littered with tags that I must mentally block. And god forbid trying to quickly get a list of authors from XML (compared to the 10 second: select distinct author from booktable)

        This is readable, parseable, and weighs substantially less than XML.
      </p>
      <p>
        We currently face a bandwidth crisis in an embedded context, and "the word" from the top is that XML <em>shall</em> be used. The <a href="ConventionalWisdom.html">ConventionalWisdom</a> (current ManagementFad) is that XML is a "standard" and that therefore there are plentiful tools and lots of industry support, and somehow the fact that this will more than triple the load on the wire as well as stress the embedded resources is lost in the <a href="HypeStorm.html">HypeStorm</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It gets better: it's not <em>one</em> embedded device, it's a <em>group</em> of related devices that have to talk to one another as well as upstream to a larger system that houses the bulk of the business processes and data. The big iron has no problem with the extra load - hey, it's just more memory and disk - and the CPU loading is incremental.
      </p>
      <p>
        We currently use a protocol with carefully optimized <em>binary</em> structures, whose processing times are well defined, and the system is acceptably deterministic. Converting our protocols to an XML transport will pretty much - by definition, actually - destroy determinism.
      </p>
      <p>
        It occurs to me that I'm ranting, so I'll let it be for now.  There's probably a better page for this. <a href="XmlSucks.html">XmlSucks</a>, perhaps?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There isn't any reason to switch to XML if you have a protocol that works much better for your purposes, granted besides of the problem of XML being a language that takes much more space than it should is only the half of the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other half is the lack of initiatives to actually beat it. And that it is seriously becoming a standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        About that alternative: it seems awful, mostly because of those : It also seems that there is not any noticeable difference between an element or attribute.

        "	Elements can't have contents, just attributes and child elements (unless they are elements whose tags end with />) you can use any character between \" \" of attributes besides \" ,  \" , and \\, no other quote kind is allowed for attributes (for example '). Every character inside \" \" counts and is considered when parsing
      </p>
      <p>
        Info can only be considered if it is inside < and > (you can freely use them for attribute text though and they are ignored because they are between \" \" )  Characters that are not inside < and > (for example indent spaces and tabs) are considered comments . No other way to consider comments exits. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Inside element openning tags white space is ignore unless it is inside \" \" (things inside \" and \" are the attributes' values and are handled in different ways
      </p>
      <p>
        No, no ending tag is specific for the element, it is a non sense to have those in XML anyways ( <s><a></s></a> is not allowed, there is no reason to specify which tag you are closing because it is always the more deeply nested one)
      </p>
      <p>
        And let's specify a difference between elements and attributes: elements may have attributes and child elements, attributes are value containers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is just a dream although I would like to make a parser for this, XML is the standard and there is little the \"little ones\" can do to stop it
