        When you can't deduplicate, at least you can put duplication near its partner(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes it easier to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Remember the duplication is there (thus, potentially, to deduplicate it in the future)
        </li>
        <li>
           Remember to update the duplicated pieces
        </li>
        <li>
           Actually do the updates, because you're not scampering all over the place
        </li>
      </ul>
