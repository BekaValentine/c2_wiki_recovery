        Rational Purify
      </h1>
      <p>
        Purify, from Rational Software Corporation (now part of IBM).  A tool which when used with C/C++ catches memory leaks, stray pointers, and all other sorts of nastiness in C/C++.

        Essentially, it's a tracing garbage collector used in debug mode--it never frees anything; it just notes when an object is garbage or not.  If an object ever becomes garbage (without being deleted first), that's a memory leak.  If the tracer find pointers pointing to things which have been freed--there's a wild pointer.

      <p>
        Quite a useful little tool....
