        <strong>PL/I</strong>: <strong>Programming Language One</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Descendants of PL/I (<a href="PliLanguage.html">PliLanguage</a>), arguably including SQL.
      </p>
      <p>
        PL/I derivatives include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           PL.8 (<a href="PlDotEight.html">PlDotEight</a>): PL/I subset for the IBM 801 research RISC microprocessor.
        </li>
        <li>
           PL/AS: reportedly the successor to PL/S (<a href="PlsLanguage.html">PlsLanguage</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           PL/C: a PL/I subset designed at Cornell University specifically for students (S. Worona &al.: <em>User's Guide to PL/C</em>, Cornell U., June 1974; H.L. Morgan &al.: "PL/C: A High Performance Compiler". <em>Proceedings of the SJCC</em>, AFIPS 38:503-510 (1971)).
        </li>
        <li>
           PL/M (Programming Language/Microcomputers): a PL/I subset for Intel microprocessors.
        </li>
        <li>
           PL/S (<a href="PlsLanguage.html">PlsLanguage</a>): the IBM programming Language [for] Systems, but only for IBM internal use, which was customarily used with its interleaved generated S/370 assembly code.
        </li>
        <li>
           PL/SQL (<a href="PlSql.html">PlSql</a>). <em></em><a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>: Is it really PL/I derived, or is just the name so (making it PL/I deprived)?<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           PLUM: teaching & research subset of PL/I for the Univac 1100 at U. of Maryland (M[arvin] V. Zelkowitz: <em>PL/I Programming with PLUM</em>, Paladin House, 1978).
        </li>
        <li>
           PL/X: reportedly the successor to PL/S (<a href="PlsLanguage.html">PlsLanguage</a>) and PL/AS, still officially only for IBM internal use, but with the distinction of being <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           PL/Z: a PL/I subset for Zilog microprocessors, most intriguingly for the Z8000.
        </li>
        <li>
           Rexx (<a href="RexxLanguage.html">RexxLanguage</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I first heard of Rexx in 1988, but I never heard that it was derived from PL/I, and I really think I would remember if I had heard that. Can this be confirmed? <em>Sorry, I don't see much relationship between PL/I and Rexx - Rexx was designed as a much more powerful replacement for a scripting language in common use on IBM mainframes called EXEC2 language.  It was later extended to other platforms.  It does share the convention for comment statements with PL/I, but that's about all!</em>
