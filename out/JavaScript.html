      <p>
        <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is a scripting language created by <a href="BrendanEich.html">BrendanEich</a> at Netscape that supports <a href="PrototypeBasedProgramming.html">PrototypeBasedProgramming</a>, Object OrientedProgramming, and <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>. It was originally called <a href="LiveScript.html">LiveScript</a>, but the name was changed to <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> for marketing reasons. Microsoft calls their version JScript. There is now a standardized version, <a href="EcmaScript.html">EcmaScript</a> [<a href="http://www.ecma-international.org/].">http://www.ecma-international.org/].</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some have claimed it is Lisp in C's clothing - <a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/classic/message8778.html">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/classic/message8778.html</a> - but being a dynamically-typed functional language is not enough to make something Lisp. <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> lacks many features that are crucial to Lisp; macros perhaps being at the top of the list. (Are macros crucial to Lisp? Or, just a great CLOS feature? (Macros *are not* a CLOS feature, they have little to do with CLOS, and actually, the other way round, quite a lot of CLOS would usually be expressed in terms of various macros.)) Perhaps <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is a "dialect of Lisp" in Java's clothing. Or, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is Scheme in Java's clothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is commonly found in <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>s and servers. It can be embedded in HTML for both client-side and server-side processing. Recently, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> has gained renewed interest for its RPC capabilities. See <a href="AjaxWebApplications.html">AjaxWebApplications</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Windows systems, it can be used (along with VBScript) with the Microsoft <a href="WindowsScriptingHost.html">WindowsScriptingHost</a> as a system scripting language.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Macs, it can be used as an <a href="OpenScriptingArchitecture.html">OpenScriptingArchitecture</a> language alongside <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> through the use of a plug-in (based on <a href="SpiderMonkey.html">SpiderMonkey</a>, see below).
      </p>
      <p>
        Mozilla.org has two open-source implementations of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> engines, one in Java (<a href="RhinoInterpreter.html">RhinoInterpreter</a>, see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/rhino)">http://www.mozilla.org/rhino)</a> and one in C (<a href="SpiderMonkey.html">SpiderMonkey</a>, see <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey).">http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey).</a> Both engines are embedded in a lot of products and also available for the command line.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's also the basis for DynaScript, the server-side scripting language for Sybase Dynamo (their answer to ASP).

        <strong>Language Features</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Java's inheritance model, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is prototype and slot based - sorta like <a href="NewtonScript.html">NewtonScript</a> and <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a>. It is really quite neat! -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Unfortunately, this is going to change with the forthcoming version 2.0, where </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> will have a more traditional class-based approach.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               (Oh thank you Jesus! -- <a href="PaulMurray.html">PaulMurray</a>)
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>um.. Paul, that's not a good thing, the class based approach is less powerful and less dynamic. Prototypes give you everything classes do and more.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Fortunately for us, prototypes aren't going away.  You still can have prototypes.  Classes, as it turns out, are just a way of writing constructors, a feature which prototype-languages typically lack.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think some definitions of "object-oriented" are limited due to the nature of popular OO languages. I haven't used <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> directly, but I have used a prototypical language. The prototype is really just a delegate, which from a certain perspective is all that inheritance is, except that delegation is a run-time association between objects, while inheritance is compile time, therefore delegation is more flexible. Polymorphism can exist without inheritance. As a matter of fact, delegation promotes composition, which in turn promotes polymorphism. -- <a href="GregVaughn.html">GregVaughn</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't tried this in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, but if it's truly Self-like, then you don't need to do name-mangling to accomplish inheritance. Instead, you adopt a Smalltalk-style metastructure as a matter of convention, including a process and method execution model. Then, by convention, every "prototype" delegates every method to its "class", which looks in its metaclass to see how to interpret it. Since delegation *is* inheritance, you'll get what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> supports true <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s via function literals. A closure (also known as <a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a>s after LISP - where they probably originated) is simply an anonymous sub-routine that closes over the namespace of lexical variables within the scope of the block that defines the function body.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some interesting use of closure-like behavior for <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> event callbacks, see BeyondJS [<a href="http://w3future.com/html/stories/callbacks.xml].">http://w3future.com/html/stories/callbacks.xml].</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is an interesting language. Arrays, objects, maps (<a href="AssociativeArray.html">AssociativeArray</a>) are all unified. Members seem to be rather like slots in the <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a>. The way objects can inherit from one another is very dynamic. I think you could do quite a slick UI framework for <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. <em>Yes, you could, and you might end up with something like </em><a href="MozillaXul.html">MozillaXul</a>.<em></em>

        <strong>Cross-platform compatibility</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="AchillesHeel.html">AchillesHeel</a> of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is its inconsistent behavior across the various platform/browser combinations. As a result, it is virtually impossible to use it to do anything robust on the client side. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, a big problem with writing <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> for the browser is the inconsistencies of its implementation across the various browsers. Take a look at my <a href="JsUnit.html">JsUnit</a>. It's a unit testing framework for running <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s inside the target browser. A nice side-effect of this is that you could run your tests in your target browsers. -- <a href="EdwardHieatt.html">EdwardHieatt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I can't agree at all. Ok, due to differences between the Explorer and Netscape versions there is some confusion. But I always try to write in unicode: one single version of a homepage for both. Period. Try looking at my page on French verbs conjugations - <a href="http://verbes.eduinfo.com">http://verbes.eduinfo.com</a> -- <a href="PieterJansegers.html">PieterJansegers</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I disagree with the points about inconsistencies in implementation. If you say that about <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> then you must say the same thing about HTML. Netscape provides very good documentation on its <a href="DevEdge.html">DevEdge</a> website and if you follow their guidelines then you will be able to write script that works in version 3 & 4 browsers (<a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> 1.2) and version 5 browsers (<a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> 1.5) with very very few problems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The inconsistency problem manifests itself significantly in implementation of DHTML and DOM - particularly in version 4 browsers - but this can be overcome by writing an abstract API that either uses switching or the <a href="BridgePattern.html">BridgePattern</a>. <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is actually a lot more flexible than is commonly believed. -- <a href="WalterRumsby.html">WalterRumsby</a>

        It is quite possible to write compatible code as long as you do not use the <a href="DocumentObjectModel.html">DocumentObjectModel</a> (which is not part of the language definition anyway). Take a look at my <a href="JsUnit.html">JsUnit</a>, which is available for a big number of environments as long as their engine is based on the ECMA standard. -- Jörg Schaible

        I only found out about Wiki yesterday, but I have been using a guestbook which stores the updates in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> function calls. My Web pages include these and I provide the code to be called.
      </p>
      <p>
        This makes <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> really useful, as you can update the data on a page.

      <p>
        From my limited knowledge of the PHP/MySQL solution, your database query gives you an array of the data from the database search. My idea gives you an array of data, it's just all the data that the guestbook users post in the order that they post the data.

        It is similar to Wiki.

        Some <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> oddities and bugaboos:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Variable declarations are optional (much like <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a>); though if you read an undeclared variable before writing to it you'll get an error. (Writing to an undeclared variable declares it - <em>in the global scope</em>.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Language is <a href="WeaklyTyped.html">WeaklyTyped</a>, and the automatic coercions that it does can produce surprising results. "2" + "3" is "23" (+, when applied to two strings, performs concatenation); "2" * "3" is 6. (Multiplication not defined for strings; so the language tries converting them to numerals, succeeds, and multiplies those). This can be surprising. <em>Is it? It's the same behaviour as other languages, e.g. python. -- Greg Bowyer</em> Nope. Python says "2"+"3" is "23", "2" * 3 is "222", and "2" * "3" and "2"+3 are type errors.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Rather annoying gotcha in array constructor. new Array() returns a newly created empty array; new Array(2,3) returns a newly-created array with 2 and 3 as its two elements. new Array(5) does <em>not</em> return a newly-created array with 5 as its single element; instead, it returns a 5-element array! <em>Use new Array(length) to create a sized array, use var myArray = [2, 3, 4, 5] to define an array</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

           Whereas most languages have one universal singular value (null/nil/Void/whatever); <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> has two - "null" and "undefined". With somewhat interesting and irregular semantics.

           No integral types - the only numeric type supported is an IEEE754 double-precision float. For a scripting language, this limitation is probably less obnoxious than it would be elsewhere.

           Language has <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>, but with an interesting twist. Unlike <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>s brethen C/C++/Java/C#/etc, where variables introduced in an anonymous block within a function are only valid within that block; in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> such variables are valid for the entire function. In other words:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        if (a == b)<br/>
        {<br/>
        var c = "Equal!";<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        if (c == "Equal!") {<br/>
        // do something<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        is legal <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. If the first condition is not true, c will evaluate to "undefined". 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Semicolons are optional in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>; if the parser sees a line break, it will try and interpret the two lines as separate statements (if it can't, it then tries to interpret them as a single statement). This too can produce surprising results.
          <ul>
            <li>
               It is not precisely true that semicolons are optional. The syntax actually requires them, and the rules for inserting them automatically are almost the exact opposite (it is only tried if it is a syntax error without one and if other additional conditions are met). There are plenty of situations where a newline is not sufficient, semicolon insertion won't take place, and it won't do what you expect. For this reason pretty much every serious javascript programmer considers it a misfeature.

        Some of the claims here may overstate the power of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. While the language itself may, given an ideal engine in an ideal environment, provide everything mentioned, there are still important shortcomings that need to be addressed before a <a href="JavaScriptIde.html">JavaScriptIde</a> can be competitive with Smalltalk (my benchmark).
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, what if any execution model is implied by the language, and how much of that model can be surfaced in the environment? Can I get at things comparable to stack frames, activation records, and so on? Is there a real process model (real in the sense that I can do multi-threaded things)?
      </p>
      <p>
        How hard would it be to support a basic Smalltalk-style debugger/inspector? I note, for example, that the <a href="VenkmanDebugger.html">VenkmanDebugger</a> cuts several corners, and appears to dramatically slow the execution while running. Is Venkman the best there is? Is Venkman itself written in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, so that I can change it on the fly?
      </p>
      <p>
        [The short answer is no. The <a href="EcmaScript.html">EcmaScript</a> language standard itself is minimal and doesn't specify anything about threading or processes or even an execution model. It is intended to be extended, though, so an implementation of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> with these features certainly would be possible. Venkman, as with all XUL applications, is implemented in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> but I believe the JS engine that powers the application is separate from the JS engine that executes the code Venkman looks at (and the JS code that runs on web pages).]

        <strong>Q</strong> Serverside Javascripts on Microsoft IIS. Any benefits to using it instead of <a href="VbScript.html">VbScript</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes, you can share function and code snippets that can be used on both the server and client side, like form validation, error checking (but not handling), or other more complex algorithms, like regex's.
      </p>
      <p>
        That, and <a href="VbScript.html">VbScript</a> sucks in comparison. It doesn't have exception handling, anonymous functions, prototypes, or a good culture in general.

        <strong>Question:</strong> Any recomendations on books? Something like JavaScriptForProgrammers, not JavaScriptForTotalMorons, please.
      </p>

        <strong>Question:</strong> Is there any mechanism for <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> to communicate information between frames and windows in a browser? (e.g. like 'cookies' for <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, but NOT delivered as part of the HTTP request header? - i.e. kept purely client-side?)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> Yes. When a frame named frame1 wants to access a frame named frame2, it can do so via parent.frame2. See, e.g., the "Writing to Other Frames and Windows" section of <em></em>DynamicHtmlTheDefinitiveReference<em> from </em><a href="OreillyAndAssociates.html">OreillyAndAssociates</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Question:</strong> That does not seem very cookie-like, since the communication requires knowing ahead of time (by name) <em>exactly</em> which other frames and windows will be involved in the communication. Is there a way to do this Can one do it <em>without</em> knowing the 'names' of these other windows and frames? (My goal is <a href="HmacUserAuthentication.html">HmacUserAuthentication</a> for <a href="WikiIde.html">WikiIde</a>, and this would just make it <em>convenient</em> by automatically logging in on all pages by entering username and password on one page.)
