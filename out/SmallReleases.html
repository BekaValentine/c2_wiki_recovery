        Small Releases
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SmallReleases.html">SmallReleases</a> are a core practice of Xp. Each cycle is very short and you only provide the code for a very small set of functionality (e.g. you only implement a few <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> each cycle).
      </p>
      <p>
        Could the XP Experts expand on this <a href="XpXtude.html">XpXtude</a>? Elsewhere there is mention of integration cycles (which seems closely related.)  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Are these released on time, or when N stories are done?
        </li>
        <li>
           Do they contain half-implemented <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>. ("We're releasing tomorrow, so don't start another feature today.")
        </li>
        <li>
           Do the cycles need to be the same length? ("These N stories work well together and add a lot of value. We'll release when they're done, even though this cycle will be half as long as the last one.")
        </li>
      </ul>
