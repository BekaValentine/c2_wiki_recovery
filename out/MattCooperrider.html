        I am a student interested in what I am calling, for now, CollaborativeKnowledgeCommunities on the web.  Wiki is an obvious place to start.  I want to both research and participate in such communities, and also run experiments that test their scope and power.  For now, I just want to absorb as much information as possible, and then become more active in the future.
