        There are a set of related pages linked through the <a href="DreyfusModel.html">DreyfusModel</a> and <a href="ShuHaRi.html">ShuHaRi</a> which discuss the stages of learning by an individual. I have found more than I first thought by following some links. I have also widened it to includs some pages on expertise as that is a product of learning. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        There are some related categories e.g. <a href="CategoryCommunication.html">CategoryCommunication</a>, <a href="CategoryEducation.html">CategoryEducation</a>.

        There are also some pages from way back with interesting reflections which have never had a category.
