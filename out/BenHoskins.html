        Hey,
      </p>
      <p>
        I've finally got off my lazy ass (after working at WDS for four years or so with the likes of <a href="DafyddRees.html">DafyddRees</a>, <a href="RichardEmerson.html">RichardEmerson</a>, <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>, <a href="JosephPelrine.html">JosephPelrine</a> [and <a href="OliBye.html">OliBye</a> for about 2 seconds]) and finally put up a page here - pretty shocking really due to the fact that I've been using and linking to this wiki from our company one for a while...

        <strong>Background</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I started life as an artist, doing a Fine Art degree.  
      </p>
      <p>
        So my move into software programming goes something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Photography > Commercial design (print and web) > web site development > web app development > fully fledged software programming.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been making and using object type code for a few years now, and been working with the XP/scrum hybridised agile methodology they use in WDS for about 3 years, and am currently looking after the team in Singapore, carrying on the good work <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>, TimJoyce, and MonicaYap have been doing with the 24x5 follow the sun development teams we have been establishing over the last 3 years
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been through a few different languages as in my programming career, and seem to be mostly using Java and C# nowadays, which seems to answer most of the problems I have (though not always gracefully I must say...), and am currently in the guts of a quasi-MVP type system
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="http://www.itstherules.co.uk]">http://www.itstherules.co.uk]</a> hosts a html portfolio site for the likes of my photography and writing.  Its been published into flat files from dynamic content creation using a mixture of O/R mapping and templating in Java.  I built the templates after being inspired by Rails...

        Not that many people will be interested but the main technologies I'm using right now are:
        MacOSX and all that cocoa stuff, using Java
        <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a>, Hibernate, MS Sql Server, <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a>, Oracle
        Tomcat 5.5, Orion Server, JBoss, Apache 2 (trying to get v2 to serve <a href="SubVersion.html">SubVersion</a> from my mac right now), Mongrel, Webrick
        <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>, Mono (C#), Java 1.4.2 & 5, Ruby
      </p>
      <p>
        Things that bug me right now that shouldn't:
        There is a lot of baffling terminology thrown at design patterns to describe what they are and how to refactor to them, when in fact most concepts within design patterns are simple.  I want to refactor most descriptions to simplify how to convey them easier

        No longer at WDS: working for a company called Exoftware, doing Agile Enablement
