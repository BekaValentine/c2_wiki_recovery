        Pre Compiler
      </h1>
      <p>
        A compiler that creates source for another compiler, usually to extend the language understood by the latter as in <a href="MetaProgramming.html">MetaProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>: How do you do <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing for a precompiler? Obviously, you need some parser for the generated program, assuming you generate source, not binaries. But checking an <a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a> in a unit test is tedious. So what are good strategies/tools? -- <a href="HaskoHeinecke.html">HaskoHeinecke</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Same way as most other things; your </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s generate text output, which you compare (e.g. with diff) against "golden" output. If there's ever any difference, then the regression unit test failed.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are often complications in practice due to timestamps, trivial changes in the generated text like added/removed white space or comments, etc, but it's usually not too hard to figure that out on a case by case basis. Even if the output is binary, you at least still have the two-way still-the-same-as-before, versus not, comparison.</em>
