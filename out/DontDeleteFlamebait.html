        Dont Delete Flamebait

        On wiki, signal comes from the <a href="RefinementOfNoise.html">RefinementOfNoise</a>, not from the deletion of it. Delete flames, but let their subjects live long enough to reduce to signal.

           If we leave flamebait and insults around then it <em>may</em> discourage the individuals to repeat their behavior too often. No normal person wants to have a reputation of being rude all the time.
