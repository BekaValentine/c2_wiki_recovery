        Nobody forces you to write doc comments like that. I usually just leave out the information that's obvious from the method signature. Yes, it makes the generated pages look very sparse, but they're just as helpful (sometimes more so) for a programmer trying to use the library in question. Sometimes, just having the <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> output with no comments is helpful, as it quickly lets you view the interface and browse through the available methods.

Msg could be renamed to "explanation", eliminating the need for a comment to it, and there's <a href="NullConsideredHarmful.html">NullConsideredHarmful</a>. Then the method name might be renamed to indicate what it returns.

           Why document that parameters can't be null? Instead of simply documenting that parameters can't be null, you should throw meaningful exceptions which should be handled at appropriate places.

        I think [<em></em><a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a><em>] is actually a good thing if you </em>'need<strong> to publish developer documentation for a widely used API. Unfortunately, many people abuse this type of stuff for documentation heavy methodologies. At least the documentation is closer to the source. But, even with developer documentation, less is </strong>more<strong>. </strong>

        If the parameters are more obviously named some of the need for this type of stuff should decrease. For example, there's no need to state that the Message parameter is indeed a message. Yes, it's a clear violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. Furthermore, if the message parameter were something other than a message, don't document that either.

      <p>
        I think that putting documentation in source code is a terrible thing. Developers can get most of what they want from the sourcecode itself (especially with well-written code) and the things they can't get are NEVER in the comments, whether Javadoc or otherwise. Meanwhile, genuinely useful technical documentation is almost always better created by technical writers - NOT developers. Javadoc is technical documentation, and in my opinion, should be created by professional technical writers using tools designed for technical documentation. As a related note, changes to embedded Javadoc often confuse source code control systems, because such systems can't or don't distinguish javadoc changes from code changes. All in all, this kind of embedded doc is a terrible idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        A better approach is to embed, in the source code, comments that expand to references (such as URLS) to companion documentation. This documentation should have corresponding references back into the source code. This lets the documentation be created and maintained by technical writers using appropriate tools.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Javadoc supports links to external documentation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Even more importantly, it allows the documentation to be customizable to the audience of the documentation. The same fragment of code can have several different documentation "webs" associated with it, each web targeted at a specific audience.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> is perhaps a poor choice for architectural documentation, tutorials, or lengthy descriptions of technical details, but it is a simple, convenient way to generate and maintain API reference docs in a way that encourages developers to keep them synchronised with the source code. Maintaining separate companion docs for API information - i.e., brief descriptions of method purposes, parameters, caveats, bugs, usage information, and so forth that normally <em>should</em> be documented in the code - is awkward.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And what about projects that do not have the funding or justification to pay a technical writer, or packages where the code is under development and subject to frequent changes?  </em><a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> may not be perfect, but for the job it's meant to do, I'm not aware of any alternative that has the same benefits without introducing unacceptable problems.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A programmer can surely write whatever documentation he or she wants in a companion file linked to the source code, if no technical writer is available. It is code "under development and subject to frequent changes" for which this sort of comment is completely useless -- no developer has time to both work on the code and also update the documentation. I think it's better to have no comments at all than to have stale text that has long since fallen behind the code it allegedly describes. Meanwhile, when somebody or other DOES start to catch up, putting the documentation in the source code begins to trigger useless builds - does ANT or any other build system understand how to NOT trigger builds based on purely documentation changes? I don't think so.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Embedding API reference information in source code - for sharing with the rest of the development team - is something I've been using to useful effect for the past twenty years in everything from JCL and TSO CLISTs, to 80x86 assembly language, to SAS and </em><a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, to C, C++, PHP and Java. It is a technique that works, and it works well. There is nothing more convenient than putting key information - warnings, brief summaries of purpose, pitfalls, limitations, and so forth - immediately above each method or function where your colleagues will see it when they're making use of your classes, methods, and routines.  It is a potent tool in the development communication chain, and far more effective than maintaining separate documents - which are awkwardly distant from the code they refer to and inevitably get neglected and out of sync with the code - or, obviously, not documenting at all. Changing a source file merely to update documentation is rare; one soon gets into an easy habit of making a change to a function or method and immediately making corresponding changes to the relevant docs above it.  Obviously, this causes no extra builds. Occasionally, source documentation does get changed on its own, and indeed this triggers a build, but the cost of that is negligible compared to the value of having handy documentation in the source code where you need it most.  <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> adds value to the practice of embedding useful information in the source by enforcing consistency, and by automatically generating Web pages which frequently save having to plow through the source code when looking for information about the API.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      <p>
        Sorry, Dave. My experience differs from yours. For example, when you write "There is nothing more convenient than putting key information - warnings, brief summaries of purpose, pitfalls, limitations, and so forth - immediately above each method or function where your colleagues will see it when they're making use of your classes, methods, and routines", you recall memories of countless projects where my teams and I have had to pore through and ultimately ignore paragraph after paragraph of obsolete random junk -- tidbits that were no doubt insightful and important in April of 1993 and were completely useless by July of that year, and that still remain in the "code". Such stuff is yesterday's news. My teams have found that, for example, companion wikis are far more helpful than embedded blocks of javadoc. The comments you describe are NOT code. They aren't source code, and they aren't documentation. Helpful, yes of course, but helpful in the way that yellow post-its are helpful. My own experience with "automatically generated" documentation is that "plowing through the source code" is the <strong>only</strong> reliable way to gain information about the API for anything that isn't literally generated automatically from the source code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Excuse me for given vent to a spleen, but you're simply demonstrating that you and your teams are pathologically undisciplined. If you are generating "paragraph after paragraph of obsolete random junk," and more importantly, are </em>'maintaining<strong> "obsolete random junk" </strong>anywhere<strong>, then something has gone horribly wrong with your development process. "Obsolete random junk" is "obsolete random junk" no matter where you maintain it. How, exactly, are "companion wikis" - which presumably contain useful API documentation - more convenient or inherently more up-to-date than maintaining </strong>exactly the same text<strong> a mere cursor movement or two above the function or method declaration? Furthermore, see </strong><a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>'s comment below, which aside from anything else, is a valuable reason for maintaining <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> documentation. Not only that, but if you're going through the laborious and slow process of reading someone else's source code in order to divine information that could simply be <strong>read</strong> from a snippet of documentation, then you're burning your client's money in a manner that is nigh unto fraudulent.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

Companion wikis, a companion free-text, or - perish the thought - even an MSWord document are, in my experience, more convenient because they use tools optimized for editing text, as opposed to source code. No "/**", " *", or "**/" characters are necessary at linebreaks. Editors have had variable-width windows and proportional fonts for more than twenty years, yet the javadoc documentation standard embeds an implicit assumption about both the width of the window (because of the line decorators) along with an assumption of a mono-spaced font. Applying these constraints to source code is, in my opinion, dubious at best. Requiring them of documentation strikes me as indefensibly archaic.</dd>

I'm not trying to be cantankerous, I'm asking a genuine question. If we each agree that meta-information about the code needs to be conveyed to a variety of audiences, surely we can discuss various techniques for accomplishing that - a discussion that will inevitably include a description of the shortcomings of current approaches and how they might be avoided.</dd>

        I further suggest that y'all explore points of agreement first, skip the moral judgements and name-calling, and find a middle position where no-one is evil, and then state your personal <strong>preferences</strong> (there is no absolute truth on these things) that go beyond/are opposed to that middle position.

        For instance: it is an infamously well-known problem that documentation and code tend to get out of sync. That much is simply objective, IMHO.

        <a href="JavaDoc.html">JavaDoc</a> contains some information that are not immediately readable from the method signature -- for example, if a method just takes (string, string, string) that's hardly useful without some comment, and it has a deprecation feature which is great when you RefactorGently. The problem is that it <em>does</em> contain information that <em>is</em> immediately readable from the method signature or the source; and programs that generate ApiDocumentation would do better to rely on this instead of on a flimsy comment. Suggestion for designers of future languages and source documentation systems: allow comments for <em>extra</em> information, but avoid redundancy please.
