        Wiki, for me, has been a major <a href="AhHa.html">AhHa</a> experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was addicted to Wiki immediately upon discovering it in August 2000, but amazed that it took me so long to find it. I'm a long-time software engineer, currently acting as Director of Streaming Applications at <a href="SorensonMedia.html">SorensonMedia</a>.

        I started coding in 1977 by writing printer-drivers for <a href="RadioShack.html">RadioShack</a> TRS-80 Model I computers. I also spent a bunch of time on timeshared machines running PDP-11, MVS, and similar abominations, but microcomputers were my first and on-going love.

        I've worked at a lot of great companies (including <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a>, <a href="NovellCorporation.html">NovellCorporation</a>, <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a>, and <a href="SorensonMedia.html">SorensonMedia</a>), in really great places (<a href="LosAngeles.html">LosAngeles</a>, Utah, and Munich), and on great technologies (<a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a>, <a href="CyberDog.html">CyberDog</a>, <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a>, among many others). I've also occasionally flirted with being useful in a handful of <a href="InternetEngineeringTaskForce.html">InternetEngineeringTaskForce</a> (IETF) WorkingGroups. I prefer to work for places that strive to and believe they are improving humanity.

        I knew Wiki was going to get deep into my blood when, at least once a day for several months after discovering <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, I came up with another great topic around which I would like to start one of my own Wikis. I've installed <a href="TwikiClone.html">TwikiClone</a>, but haven't moved much farther than playing around yet. I'm impressed with <a href="RandyKramer.html">RandyKramer</a>'s work in compiling a <a href="WikiEngineReview.html">WikiEngineReview</a>. I'll add my comments to it soon.

        My most passionate current project is developing adaptive therapy software for children with autism and other <a href="PervasiveDevelopmentalDisorder.html">PervasiveDevelopmentalDisorder</a>s. This is still a hobby for me until I get farther along with my project.
