        <em>Surely you mean "if it doesn't rise then don't have bought it."?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (Will Rogers, giving advice on buying stock.)

        In Douglas Adams' <a href="TimeTravelGrammar.html">TimeTravelGrammar</a>, I think it's "Iffate it not rising, boughten it,"
      </p>
      <p>
        Which book is <em>that</em> from?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dr Dan Streetmentioner's Time Traveller's Handbook of 1001 Tense Formations</strong>

        We hear about it in the Hitch-Hiker's Guide to the Galaxy universe (I'm spotty on the exact book) - I was just making the previous example up, using some of the syntax I remembered.  Then again, since he probably made up the words on the spot himself as he typed it, this is all a complete waste of time.  Is-being-forthwithenate.

        Heinlein postulated a similar convoluted grammar in GloryRoad (early 60s).
