        <dd><em>"Correct-by-construction approaches treat software development as a true form of engineering. [...] Similarly, a true software engineer constructs a mathematical model of his design before any code is produced. The model is used to reason about the proposed solution, ensuring that all required functionality will be delivered and the correct behavior exhibited. Testing is still performed, but its role is to validate the correct-by-construction process rather than to find bugs."</em></dd>
