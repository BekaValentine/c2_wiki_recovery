        Don thanks for your interest in this subject. I agree with you the term is commonly used and merit its own page. May I suggest you to link it to the main page of <a href="InformationSecurity.html">InformationSecurity</a> at some stage.

        Also currently a lot of information that supposedly belong to <a href="InformationSecurity.html">InformationSecurity</a> (a broader subject) is actually located in <a href="SecurityManagement.html">SecurityManagement</a>, which is extremely important but it does not represent all of <a href="InfoSec.html">InfoSec</a>. I would love to see someone with initiatives to help improve security related pages, and maybe you are the one :) -- dl
