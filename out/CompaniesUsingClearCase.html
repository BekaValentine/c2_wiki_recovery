        Companies Using Clear Case
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>I'm consulting to HP right now, and although I can't speak for the organization it seems to me that </em><a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> is not heavily used here. <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> and other MS tools seem to be most common. I have heard that the need for a fulltime <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> administrator is one of the reasons for this.<em> -- </em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        Well, if you frequent the <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> users mailing list, it is quite clear that <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> is indeed <em>very heavily</em> used at HP. That doesn't mean every conceivable nook and cranny of HP uses it, or even uses it exclusively. But I personally know of at least a dozen shops (some pretty large) inside of HP that use <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a>, and have heard these folks speak of still other HP groups that do as well. --<a href="BradAppleton.html">BradAppleton</a>

        LockheedMartin uses it, because many government clients demand its use. I've never heard a good reason why. I suspect it's JobProtection at the GovernmentScale. We have several full-time <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> admins.  -- <a href="DaveFayram.html">DaveFayram</a>
