        Has anyone else entered the <a href="WikiTimeWarp.html">WikiTimeWarp</a>?

        By this I mean that I have set out to search <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> on some topic and keep on encountering entries I made myself several years ago and had forgotten about. In some cases I can see that I misunderstood then and can correct my old self. In others I can make a new connection and go to sleep satisfied.

        I have this, while reading some posts made some time ago, I noticed that what was posted is no longer a current practice or approach, or in another case, was just missing the point of the page, and did not contribute to "Flow of Meaning" so essential in good dialogue. Removing the portion I posted before improved the overall value of the page. Time also warps meanings. Because TimeChangesThings.

        Does reading something on Wiki and wondering "did I write that?" count? It's happened to me several times.

        I think that the <a href="WikiTimeWarp.html">WikiTimeWarp</a> also works on short timescales. When things are changing quickly the sequence of events is not recorded, unlike on an Email, so that a reader cannot see easily <em>in what order</em> things appeared on any particular page. This can lead to misunderstandings. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <em>On short timescale - i.e. a day - </em><a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> (or in worse cases the page history) can help.<em></em>
