        An <a href="IniFile.html">IniFile</a> is a very useful tool which possibly reinvents the database, but is much simpler than a database. They are easier to read than XML files, and smaller than a full fledged database. They are useful for storing settings and useful for persistence of data.

        They are also known as config files and usually have the file extension <em>.ini</em> or <em>.conf</em>
