      </h1>
      <p>
        Thomas W. Anderson <twic@urchin.earth.li>. He wishes his middle initial was 'A', like in <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a>. He likes <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> (<<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/quickChanges?days=1">http://c2.com/cgi/quickChanges?days=1</a>>) and feels that it reflects wiki's immanent TurboRealism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tom was formerly a student of biochemistry at OxfordUniversity, then a ResearchAssistant at the university's <a href="WeatherallInstituteOfMolecularMedicine.html">WeatherallInstituteOfMolecularMedicine</a>, and now is neither: at the end of September 2003, he became a PhD student in the MRC Laboratory for Molecular Cell Biology, at UniversityCollegeLondon.
      </p>
      <p>
        He thought he was just passing through the wiki, but has been here long enough that he might be around forever. However, he doesn't have a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie set, as he doesn't believe in them; he will be <a href="UsingSignatures.html">UsingSignatures</a> when appropriate and avoid signatures the rest of the time (after all, these are <a href="OurWordsNotYours.html">OurWordsNotYours</a>, and, indeed, <a href="OurWordsNotMine.html">OurWordsNotMine</a>). He was happy to learn that <a href="LinksAreContent.html">LinksAreContent</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is not the same as any of the professors of computer science with the same name (there are several), although he is an amateur hacker - raised on the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, increasingly digging <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> and the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, and now mostly hacking in the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>. He believes firmly that <a href="ExceptionsAreOurFriends.html">ExceptionsAreOurFriends</a>, and hopes fervently that software can be built well with <a href="NoProcess.html">NoProcess</a>. He thinks he invented the <a href="ConstructorObject.html">ConstructorObject</a> idiom. He is a <a href="SecondGenerationProgrammer.html">SecondGenerationProgrammer</a>, being the son of <a href="BruceAnderson.html">BruceAnderson</a>; he has occasionally mown <a href="WayneCool.html">WayneCool</a>'s lawn (but never got paid).
      </p>
      <p>
        He uses <a href="UnixOperatingSystems.html">UnixOperatingSystems</a> (and <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> in particular) whenever he can; when he can't, he has some <a href="MicrosoftWordComplaints.html">MicrosoftWordComplaints</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He had an idea for a sort of <a href="DecoratorWiki.html">DecoratorWiki</a>.
      </p>

        Tom - Please visit <a href="ImmunityDesignPrinciples.html">ImmunityDesignPrinciples</a> and then delete this line.  --<a href="JamesCrook.html">JamesCrook</a> <em>Visited, read, not deleted. Ha! -- ta</em>

        Interesting. On a tangent, i occasionally think about how the idea of design patterns might be applied to biology; it would be analytical, like <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s, rather than constructive, but it might be really interesting. Plus, someone might get to write a book called 'The Order of Nature':).

        Tom, when you find a good algorithm for the <a href="StridingAcrossSteppingStones.html">StridingAcrossSteppingStones</a> problem, please post the details there. I'd like to see it. It's a nice chewy problem. -- MarkIrons
