        Well I'm a Vincent van Gentevoort, I've just arrived and wondering why and how this system could and could not work, be useful and whatever. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway my first opinion is that it's fun, overly interesting, it has a GREAT name but surely somehow seems wicked.

        I myself work on a content management web system where people can easily add and change content but there we spend a lot of time on an user system instead of giving everybody free access ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        So later on someone will come over and change this page, changing who I am (--thrilling, isn't it ?--), what I mean (--or what we collectively mean ?--) or whatever.. That is the thing that sounds so wicked!
        Apart from the fact that if the ugly masses come they will probably kill this Wiki Wiki land. Just like when nasty people arrive at a beach with nice <a href="SandCastles.html">SandCastles</a>.
