        Former <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a> CTO.

      <p>
        Al is no longer with Rogue Wave, he now
        works for amazon.com!  Not sure what his
        new email address is though.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm Al! My Amazon.com email address is alv at amazon.com.
        I'm CTO here at Amazon.com, just like I used to be way back when
        at Rogue Wave.

        Al is an awesome computer scientist who can teach you complex things with amazing simplicity. He explained Paxos Algorithm (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_algorithm)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_algorithm)</a> by dramatizing it, convergence in a distributed system by hand drawn diagrams and rate estimation by creating an OpenGL visualization. I wish I get more opportunities to learn from him.
