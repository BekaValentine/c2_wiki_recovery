        I went to see this movie with a gang from work. When Peter comes to work after being hypnotized, they all commented that he had turned into me. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        When I saw this movie, I could name each real person in this movie I work with - scary. -- <a href="MichaelSutherland.html">MichaelSutherland</a>

        A <a href="CowOrker.html">CowOrker</a> of mine assures me that if you watch the movies <a href="OfficeSpace.html">OfficeSpace</a>, FightClub, and <a href="AmericanBeauty.html">AmericanBeauty</a> all in a row, in that order, and you are a strong person, you will have a life-altering epiphany. Otherwise your head will explode. (He has done it, but I've been afraid to make the experiment.) -- <a href="CameronSmith.html">CameronSmith</a>
