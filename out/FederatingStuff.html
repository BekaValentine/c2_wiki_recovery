        It seems that there is a developing society of people who are moving about with small, palm-top-devices, to which they pay great attention, and can not seem to be without or actively using, <em>'all the time</em>. This has nearly become an obsession with some. Friends have become who you can get in touch with by flicking your finger on the face of this device and then with index finger or thumb, contact is or is not made. If not, then the process is repeated.
      </p>
      <p>
        For some strange reason, this does not seem to be what I want to do and is not what I want to become.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would rather do something else, <a href="TheOtherThings.html">TheOtherThings</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is, Why not get involved in the same way? 
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it may simply boil down to - what-i-need, instead of what-i-want.
      </p>
      <p>
        right or wrong, this seems to be it

        I am involved in button-pushing, and contacts, and developing new-stuff, which for the past year has been in ways to collect-store-and-recover stuff from wherever about neat-interesting-or-useful-things-and-people, as well as ways significant and meaningful information can be seen. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been experimenting with Ward's latest thing, The <a href="SmallestFederatedWiki.html">SmallestFederatedWiki</a>, and have composed and collected several thousand pages in the process. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am interested not only in the process, but in the way the stuff can-be, or should-be presented. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So for now-and-little-while-longer I will continue, until discovering what-it-wants-to-be.  I think it is neat to be <a href="FederatingStuff.html">FederatingStuff</a>, not only via web-applications, but with applications-that-use-the-web.
