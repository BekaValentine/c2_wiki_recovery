        Hello. I am a software engineer and project manager. I program in Lisp -- I would rate myself only partially a <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>. I play Old-Time music on the mandolin and have a graduate degree in statistics. I feed the birds at my house, I have a digital camera, I drive a 1979 Volvo with 266k miles on it, I'm a Mac person, I'm married with two grown daughters, one married; no grandkids.

        I'm interested in the kind of information needed to do stuff, like what-all you'd need to know to make coffee. I don't think of this as <a href="CommonSense.html">CommonSense</a>-type knowledge but rather as programming and representation in areas that one doesn't usually think of as being programmable.
