        Tests Too Slow
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>When TTS is Their Fault</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have worked in LAMP for >8 years now. Every year the tests are slow; every year the community promises to do something about it, and the next year the tests are slower.
      </p>
      <p>
        The community responds via <a href="CargoCult.html">CargoCult</a> TDD. Instead of pressing OneTestButton, you Alt+Tab to a View showing a test runner, and click on the tests you want to run.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the tests are usually slow because of some ambitious crud in the test rig - NOT any systemic problem.

        <strong>When TTS is Our Fault</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AutomatedTesting.html">AutomatedTesting</a> mean that we should have an extensive suite of <a href="UnitTests.html">UnitTests</a> to ensure our project is working as expected. However <a href="RapidFeedback.html">RapidFeedback</a> implies that the tests must run quickly. <em>My tests are slow.</em> What are some techniques for balancing these two together?
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently I have a fairly small suite of <a href="UnitTests.html">UnitTests</a> yet easily takes 10-20 minutes to run through them all (<a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s won't help). As a result, while I develop, I can only really run subsets of the tests that I think may be affected to get <a href="RapidFeedback.html">RapidFeedback</a>. Before I commit to <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a>, I try to execute the entire test suite, but often get lazy (especially for possibly trivial changes).
      </p>

        This feels way too hacky and cumbersome. One solution may be <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> of the tests on a separate <a href="BuildSystem.html">BuildSystem</a>. Any other ideas? -- JevonWright

        <em>10-20 minutes for unit tests is a VERY long time. I'd expect 10-20 seconds at the max when there are thousands of unit tests. Why do they take so long? Why won't </em><a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s help?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why are they slow? What kinds of things is the processor spending most of the time on?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Answer:</strong> The application is following ModelDrivenEngineering. Each unit test is testing a particular model instance for an expected runtime result. Most of the time is spent in compiling and generating the runtime code from the initial model instance (although the time spent to test the runtime model is not insignificant). Essentially I have an <a href="ExpensiveSetUpSmell.html">ExpensiveSetUpSmell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After reviewing above, <em>I suppose these particular tests are actually </em><a href="IntegrationTest.html">IntegrationTest</a>s and not <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s<em>, but that doesn't help that they are still too slow. I suppose </em><a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s could help if they were used to cache compilation results (but even this isn't ideal, tests should be <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>-free).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OptimizingUnitTests.html">OptimizingUnitTests</a> also points out 10-20 minutes is far too long. Is an answer exploding the <a href="IntegrationTest.html">IntegrationTest</a>s into hundreds of smaller <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s? Has anyone got experience with this? -- JevonWright
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, but it sounds like a caching problem. The time spent "compiling and generating the runtime code" should only happen when your "initial model instance" changes. That would appear to be the bottleneck - and never forget you are really using </em><a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> where your source is these "initial model" instances...<em></em>

        After applying engineering fixes to slow tests, use <a href="IncrementalTesting.html">IncrementalTesting</a> to spread their cost out and still integrate quickly. As a last resort (or maybe a first resort;), apply the ultimate hack, the <a href="InVivoTestPattern.html">InVivoTestPattern</a>.

        Thanks for all the suggestions. After working further with my environment, I took the plunge and started using caching for my setUp code, improving speed, but most importantly, allowing me to break up LargeUnitTests into many SmallUnitTests. Each test class has its own cache. I moved common GeneratedCode into a separate RuntimeLibrary, and am splitting up tests to focus on particular areas of the system, rather than complete <a href="IntegrationTest.html">IntegrationTest</a>s. <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s will probably help as well, but I haven't worked out how to integrate them yet into the environment. -- JevonWright
