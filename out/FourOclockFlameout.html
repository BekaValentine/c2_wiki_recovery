        Four Oclock Flameout
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some have noticed that the flames/deletionwars tend to simmer down around four o'clock central time(<a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>). Some have pointed out that this highlights that those on the eastern side of the Atlantic are more placid than those on the western side. Westerners dishonored by that statement may challenge the easterners in mortal combat.

        The pattern tends to follow these times:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           flame-up : Mornings, around 10 o'clock(arriving at work)
        </li>
        <li>
           flame-dn : Around 4-5 o'clock
        </li>
        <li>
           flame-up : Around 7-8 o'clock(after dinner)
        </li>
        <li>
           flame-dn : Around 11 o'clock(people going to sleep)
        </li>
        <li>
           flame-up : Burning the midnight oil(people up all night)
        </li>
        <li>
           flame-dn : Around 4 in the morning
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>It's baaaaaack.</em>

      <p>
        Indeed. Once more and it's officially a pattern. . . might have to wait until Monday though.

        <em>Sigh. Dinner's over.</em>

        Two of the parties involved reside on your side of the Atlantic.
