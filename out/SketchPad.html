        <a href="SketchPad.html">SketchPad</a> was the first interactive drawing program, written in 1963 by <a href="IvanSutherland.html">IvanSutherland</a> as the basis of his tour-de-force thesis.  It included visual constraints, character recognition, freehand drawing with smoothing, and animation.

           <em>It also featured instances of master drawings, which would instantly update to match any changes to the master. (I suppose this is another kind of visual constraint too).</em>

        <a href="AlanBlackwell.html">AlanBlackwell</a> of the University of Cambridge is working with <a href="IvanSutherland.html">IvanSutherland</a> to make a new electronic edition of the thesis available online, in late 2003.  In the meantime, the original can be viewed at <a href="http://theses.mit.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/Describe/0018.mit.theses/1963-10">http://theses.mit.edu/Dienst/UI/2.0/Describe/0018.mit.theses/1963-10</a>

        <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> insists that all of user interface design for the last 30 years was done in <a href="SketchPad.html">SketchPad</a> first (and then some). He has the videos to prove it. -- <em>He also credits it as the first </em><a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> system and an important influence on <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>.<em></em>
