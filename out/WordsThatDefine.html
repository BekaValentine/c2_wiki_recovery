        Words That Define
      </h1>
      <p>
        At times, I am at a loss to find <a href="WordsThatDefine.html">WordsThatDefine</a> a concept. In some ways it is not dissimilar to naming a new pattern for programming practices. I can get obsessed in that undertaking. Other people I talk to are quite empathetic about that urge as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose this page name without "a concept" subfix as I support <a href="LinksAreContent.html">LinksAreContent</a>, and there can be wider applications for linking this page. For example, someone can be looking for <em>"</em><a href="WordsThatDefine.html">WordsThatDefine</a>aGeneration that ....", and LostGeneration can be that word that coined an aspect of the prevailing behavior of these people<em>.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another example, the <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a> is an excellent page name for a pattern on productivity. And the person who coined this term did us a big favor. We can quickly establish the accepted boundaries for that term, then move on to searching for opportunities to create/maintain the <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a> situation.
      </p>

        <a href="LetEveryWordTell.html">LetEveryWordTell</a>, that's the spirit of the search for <a href="WordsThatDefine.html">WordsThatDefine</a>.

        At this moment, as a student in <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a>, I am seeking the <a href="WordsThatDefine.html">WordsThatDefine</a> the concept of:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           unusually high level (typically out of character) of collaboration between people. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Just shooting in the dark here: MutualSurvival, CoNecessity (MutualNecessity), CommonEnemy, CommonCause, or (on a lighter note) JumpTogetherOrDie (I'm sure there was a movie of some kind), BTW - <a href="SharedUrgency.html">SharedUrgency</a> would actually be a good term; here are some more random shots: CongruentMotive, ThreeLeggedRace, DesperateAlliance, MutuallyAssuredSuccess. Any of these can be seen to be a manifestation of <a href="EnlightenedSelfInterest.html">EnlightenedSelfInterest</a>.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I find in my experiences mid and senior management are often very careful about their turf, at the expense of the organization they are charged to manage (an <a href="AgencyProblem.html">AgencyProblem</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        But from time to time, due to reasons unknown, people who are unlikely to work together seem to have collaboration that left others wonder in awe. They have a <a href="SharedUrgency.html">SharedUrgency</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what are the <a href="WordsThatDefine.html">WordsThatDefine</a> this "infrequent" moments of generosity towards others, against self-interests at times?

        I can understand the urge to find a fitting word (especially on wiki, see <a href="WikiWordsAreConcepts.html">WikiWordsAreConcepts</a> and <a href="ArchitectingWord.html">ArchitectingWord</a>). After all <a href="NameAndConquer.html">NameAndConquer</a>.

        <em>So far, no </em><a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a> for this Page; the Visible<a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> is too small at the moment.<em></em>

        Ehh... what's the word for ..... (fill in your description)
      </p>
      <p>
        A fun way to resolve this is to visit Wordnet (<a href="http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn">http://www.cogsci.princeton.edu/cgi-bin/webwn</a> (<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 20110920)) and type in a similar word. Then click on Search, then click on the "S" in front of the definition, and then click on "full hyponym". If that doesn't get you headed in the right direction then nothing will ...
