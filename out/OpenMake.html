        Openmake is a next generation application build management tool designed to automate the creation of reliable applications through the implementation of a standard and repeatable software build process without the need to code makefiles, ANT scripts or special Java Classes. Openmake delivers a single build process for Enterprise applications regardless of IDE, programming language or operating system. Openmake ensures that executables are created the same way every time.

        Openmake is a complete replacement for traditional make and ANT.
