        Mock Randomizer
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MockRandomizer.html">MockRandomizer</a> means using a random number generator which you have modified or overridden to make its output predictable. It might always return the same value, or a predictable sequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        A mock randomizer helps when <a href="UnitTestingNonDeterministicCode.html">UnitTestingNonDeterministicCode</a> by making it deterministic. (Caveat: Must be "randomizer-driven", i.e. the non-nondeterminism isn't a consequence of a physical process, OS scheduling, etc). It allows: if (if get this random result) then assert(this state should hold). Accordingly, the test should predictably pass or fail.
      </p>
      <p>
        An alternative stochastic approach is to repeat a test many times, and verify that the statistically expected result occurs on average within a stated tolerance. Naturally, sometimes such a test will fail or pass when it shouldn't have. The advantages of <a href="MockRandomizer.html">MockRandomizer</a>s over stochastic approaches are that they're less work to setup, and don't ever false positives or negatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple Java <a href="MockRandomizer.html">MockRandomizer</a> example:
      </p>
      <code>
        Deck = new Deck();<br/>
        deck.setRandom(new Random() {<br/>
        public void nextDouble() {<br/>
        return 0.0;<br/>
        }<br/>
        });<br/>
        deck.shuffle();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We can mechanically work out what state a shuffled deck should be in, when all random call are zero, and assert it in the usual fashion. In my experience this does usefully exercise the code I want to test, though you may need several different MockRandomizers to cover your cases.
