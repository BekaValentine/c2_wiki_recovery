        <a href="ProcessPatterns.html">ProcessPatterns</a> are to the architecture of a social organization as <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> are to software architecture and design.

        <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> believes that <a href="ProcessPatterns.html">ProcessPatterns</a> are closer to the spirit of <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>'s patterns even than <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> are, because they deal with more basic daily social needs of people, as Alexander was trying to do with his architectural patterns. Social structures are to the social well-being of the workplace resident as architectural structures are to the social well-being of the home dweller.

        <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> founded a research program at AT&T to study organizations using techniques borrowed from object-oriented analysis. Sociometric data were gathered from an organization using <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>s; the data were visualized as a social network, with each card being a node in the network, using techniques similar to those pioneered by WimDePauw, <a href="RichardHelm.html">RichardHelm</a>, DougKimelman, and <a href="JohnVlissides.html">JohnVlissides</a>. These visualizations helped highlight a wide variety of social patterns in these organizations: the tools helped us act as organizational anthropologists. (Anthropology is the study of patterns of relationships in a social structure.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Coplien took this work forward with collaborators such as BrendanCain, <a href="NeilHarrison.html">NeilHarrison</a>, and others. Neil in particular did some amazing statistical analyses on properties of the social networks; these will be published in Volume 2 of the AnnalsOfSoftwareEngineering (<a href="http://manta.cs.vt.edu/ase/)">http://manta.cs.vt.edu/ase/)</a> and have appeared in the Summer 1996 issue of the BellLabsTechnicalJournal (<a href="http://www.lucent.com/ideas2/perspectives/bltj/summer_96/paper11/).">http://www.lucent.com/ideas2/perspectives/bltj/summer_96/paper11/).</a> In the mean time, the patterns were captured in Alexandrian form:  instead of just looking at the patterns in an organization, we designed the patterns to be <em>installed</em> in an organization to fix organizational problems. These patterns can be found in <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/~cope/Patterns/Process/.">http://www.bell-labs.com/~cope/Patterns/Process/.</a>

      <p>
        In 1993, DavidWeiss and <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> devised taxonomies of ProcessArchitecture at AT&T.

        <a href="NormKerth.html">NormKerth</a> and <a href="BruceWhitenack.html">BruceWhitenack</a> have also built substantial <a href="ProcessPattern.html">ProcessPattern</a> languages;  see [2] and [3], respectively. <a href="BrianFoote.html">BrianFoote</a> and <a href="BillOpdyke.html">BillOpdyke</a> have a pattern language that also has a strong process component; see [4]. <a href="SteveBerczuk.html">SteveBerczuk</a> has some great organizational in their own right, but is a master at weaving organizational and design patterns together into a unified language.

        Running through all of these is the thread that software construction, research, and most of the really interesting work activities are fundamentally <em>social</em> activities. For a good guide to the different cultures one has to deal with, including executives, operators, and engineers (in the general sense -- I'd suggest the more general term <em>quants</em>), I'd suggest Edgar Schein's working paper [<a href="http://learning.mit.edu/res/wp/10011.html]">http://learning.mit.edu/res/wp/10011.html]</a> at MIT's Center for Organizational Learning.

        I agree with Cope that process and <a href="ProjectManagementPatterns.html">ProjectManagementPatterns</a> fit the pattern form extremely well - project management consists of little else than resolving forces.  Also agree with Ken about software development as a social activity.  References are to <a href="KristenNygaard.html">KristenNygaard</a> in a 1986 paper "Program Development as a Social Activity" (<a href="http://www.ifi.uio.no/~kristen/PDF_MAPPE/F_PDF_MAPPE/F_IFIP_86.pdf),">http://www.ifi.uio.no/~kristen/PDF_MAPPE/F_PDF_MAPPE/F_IFIP_86.pdf),</a> and <a href="PeterNaur.html">PeterNaur</a>'s wonderful paper, "<a href="ProgrammingAsTheoryBuilding.html">ProgrammingAsTheoryBuilding</a>", <a href="http://www.naur.com/comp/default.html,">http://www.naur.com/comp/default.html,</a> which is the best analogy I have yet seen.
