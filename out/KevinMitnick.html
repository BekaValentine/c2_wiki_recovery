      <p>
        A truly malicious person. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By contrast with a falsely malicious person?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By contrast with hyperbole.

        With more than twenty years of experience in exploring computer security, Kevin Mitnick is a largely self-taught expert in exposing the vulnerabilities of complex operating systems and telecommunications devices, using both technical and non-technical means. In building this body of knowledge, Kevin gained unauthorized access to computer systems at some of the largest corporations on the planet and penetrated some of the most resilient computer systems ever developed. As retribution for his unauthorized access, Kevin served five years in a Federal correctional institution before being released in January 2000.
