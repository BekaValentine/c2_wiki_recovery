        Large Problems Are Community Problems
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Large problems unlikely to be the works of one or two individuals.</strong>

      <ul>

           Its probably a result of the complex interactions amongst several relevant sources of <a href="CommunityProblems.html">CommunityProblems</a>. I advise interested persons to consult our sister site <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> (first-timers start at <a href="http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballForCtwoPeople),">http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?MeatballForCtwoPeople),</a> which has special interest in the <a href="SocialDynamics.html">SocialDynamics</a> of online communities.

        When we accept the assertion above as a "possibility" we are in a better position to prevent future recurrence, or to contain future recurrences earlier and more effectively.

        The <a href="SelfDeceit.html">SelfDeceit</a> / <a href="ApathyCalcified.html">ApathyCalcified</a> pages were born during the height of the <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s. So was the remodelling of the old <a href="FiveStagesOfGrief.html">FiveStagesOfGrief</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        We need to recognize and acknowledge our tendency to accept quick-blame and quick-fix solutions. Part of that recognition is to bring the "annoying possibilities" into our conscious mind, more importantly to do so when it is "inconvenient".

        In 2005 I noticed the Edit wars which got carried over from earlier <?"2004 Spring Cleaning"> got into a unmanageable state.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even now, mid Mar05, with edit controls in place, there are some change/revert stuff still going on.
      </p>
      <p>
        So it should not all be the problem of the easy BlameTarget, Robert. He has a significant role in the discomforts, but he has also good points, see his posts at SpookyDistance re: <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> deletes. I do not know the downsides of slowing down deletes. But perhaps it need more exploration.

        <em>See also on </em><a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a>, the page on LynchMob. Severe attacks initiated via <a href="IpUsername.html">IpUsername</a> bear some resemblance to the description. It appeared this kind of thing happened with <a href="SamGentle.html">SamGentle</a> times, and will probably repeat if this community does not device a mechanism to discourage that.<em> -- dl</em>

        I shared the following statement with a C2 VIP in email very recently, hope to get some comments from community as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I hope people who have suffered most in the recent chaos do not take a hardened view as victors. Peace lasted much longer after WW2 (compared to WW1) due to compassion and generosity towards the losers.</strong>
