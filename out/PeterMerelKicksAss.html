        PM's understated yet stunning performance in "Ice Age 3" as "Buck" does to the dinosaurs of yesteryear what PM's software career does to the dinosaurs of today:

        <em>Damnit, now I'm going to have to go watch Ice Age 3. Thanks a lot!</em> -- Pete, who's not certain what a software career is, but thinks it's probably a sub-group of XA-Certified on <a href="LinkedIn.html">LinkedIn</a>.

        That's right. I admit it. I'm a fan of <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>. Every time I see his signature, I make sure I read whatever he wrote. Why? Peter is one of the most delightful <a href="WikiCelebrities.html">WikiCelebrities</a>. His contributions are insightful, well-written, and sometimes downright <em>funny</em>. Witness:

        Um, perhaps you should go pour a nice cup of tea and read <a href="TheSecretOfPower.html">TheSecretOfPower</a> a few times. I'm actually rather shabby. I have good friends who will never speak to me again after what I've done to them. And others with whom I don't keep in touch despite their regular letters. I have bad hair and no fashion sense. My wife has a vastly superior sense of humor. <a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a> attests that I know <a href="HowToPissOffYourPair.html">HowToPissOffYourPair</a>. And that whole seats thing is highly overrated - try it and see for yourself. -- Pete.

        Here is an example of the power of Pete. Pete is what brought me here and eventually who led to me to the larger world of XP and wiki. I read chapter two of the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExamined.html">ExtremeProgrammingExamined</a> . I then read the bibliography which made a reference to this site. Here I discovered wiki. I eventually installed a wiki at my place of work to help track changes to everything in our IT department. I visit this site every day. Here I have read things that have really made me think. I re-discovered the <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> here. I discovered <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> here. What a fantastic place Pete has led me with a chapter about TheTaoOfExtremeProgramming. Hail Pete ! -- <a href="TobyFarley.html">TobyFarley</a>

        <em>On the other hand, Pete then emits misdirection like </em><a href="ZenoBuddhism.html">ZenoBuddhism</a> as if it were somehow deep & profound. -- the TRULY deep & profound <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em></em>

        On the gripping hand, life is tough enough as it is without a bunch of sarcastic no-goodnicks accusing your fossilized crap of smelling like petunias. Enough - cut it out - y'all go do mighty works like you oughta so I can give you this treatment and make you sound sillier than you are. Oh, and I'd like to thank my Mum. -- Pete considering about <a href="ObnoxiousThingsToDoWithAnOscar.html">ObnoxiousThingsToDoWithAnOscar</a>.

        Nonsense, that's only a Niven second-hand reference. It's a greencheese first-hand reference.
