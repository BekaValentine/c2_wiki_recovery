        Inputs Vs Outputs
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems like when management can't measure outputs, they tend to micromanage inputs.  This puts them in conflict with <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> in at least two cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> means the team looks like it's half as productive.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="NoOvertime.html">NoOvertime</a> mean the team isn't putting in the physical hours typically expected on a <a href="DeathMarch.html">DeathMarch</a> project.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's as if mangement were being rewarded on the basis of keystrokes and overtime hours, instead of code developed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps with XP's focus on constant tangible progress, management can shift its focus away from inputs, and onto outputs.

        It's worse than that.  In many places, they don't allow you to record more than 40 hours a week, but expect you to work as many as necessary (read >= 40, never < 40).  So they don't even have accurate data for the inputs! --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        They may not have quantitative measures, but they definitely have qualitative ones:

        <em>My measurement will be the parking lot: it should be substantially full at 7:30 AM and 6:30 PM.  The pizza man should show up at 7:30 PM to feed the starving teams working late.  The lot should be half full on Saturday mornings.</em> [Broken link removed]

        I hope that exec is not puzzled by why his company is mentioned on that website...
