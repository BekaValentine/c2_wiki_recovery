        I've abandoned the notion of <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s. This was introduced when <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a> undertook the awesome task of reading every wiki page, found a lot of little typos along the way and didn't want to pollute <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> with their correction. It is not saving us from pollution and just adds complexity when trying to understand posting activity. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

      <ul>
        <li>
           To get the functionality of <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s, you can now use <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>.

        <em>That's probably not a good idea in relation to those who introduce commercial spam. It was convenient to remove such spam using a minor edit. The spammer's ip address then remained in </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Also, from time to time, someone changes the name of a page and can change all the references to it using minor edits, instead of clogging up <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Removing minor edits will simply lead to more editing of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> to alter/remove entries there. A similar point applies when a spelling error is corrected - such corrections can easily affect 20 - 100 pages at a time. I don't recall anyone complaining about the minor edits feature, and it is present in many other wikis and has been requested as a feature on some wikis which do not have it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some points:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What other wikis do must not necessarily imply what is good for this wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           What is the current use of <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s? Is it used much or seldom? <em>When </em><a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s are used properly, <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> is made more useful.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s are often forgotten to check (I forget it very often).
        </li>
        <li>
           Spammers might use it to hide their spam from <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s who look at <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> only (like me, ahem). <em>Possible in theory, but very rare in practice.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm not sure how "pollution" is defined, but minor edits certainly help reduce "clutter" when edits are trivial in nature.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Then again, the pollution on RecentChanges is temporary, and of limited extent. Is it really that hard to ignore a block of edits? It's not like it's a permanent addition to the list.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Possible feature however: could one include the number of changed lines or the size of the largest changed block for each entry on the recent changes? <em>Good idea. I put it on </em><a href="WikiWikiSuggestionsSimple.html">WikiWikiSuggestionsSimple</a>.<em></em></dd>
      </dl>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Could minor edits be indicated on </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> somehow, perhaps something like the way <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> does it?<em></em>

        I've been using minor edits a lot lately to remove spam. I figured that this would minimize noise on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, and make it less obvious to a spammer that his work had just been undone. However, I realize that the feature might cause problems in other areas. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

        Thanks for disabling <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s. I think this is definitely a good thing. By the way: using an edit to remove spam is not a good idea, since one cannot see who edited the page last. If you want to check the changes for reasonableness, you soon gets a list of "trusted" ip addresses which you don't have to check. -- ThomasHolenstein

        I want to know what other pages the spammer edited, not who edited a page last. Minor editing to remove spam made that easier.

        Maybe there should be support for automatic refactorings? Some of the typical uses of <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s are good candidates for automatic refactoring support. (page renames are a good example)
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Automating "page renames" is a bad idea. In order to properly rename a page, each reference to it must be checked in context.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        With built-in support, the refactoring could display as a single entry in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>, instead of the potentially many under the current system.

        I just peeked at <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> and found it usable... but hardly friendly. I think the functionality on <a href="http:RecentChanges">http:RecentChanges</a> and <a href="http:quickChanges?days=1">http:quickChanges?days=1</a> should be made more accessible. -- <a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a>

        Ward, can you reintroduce <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>, now that wiki is under supervision? In absence of that, wiki is pretty much unreadable these days (or readable but with a lot of wasted effort). -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Won't </em><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/RecentChanges?days=1&min=100">http://c2.com/cgi/RecentChanges?days=1&min=100</a> work for you? I find it pretty easy to spot the minor edits, there, and it doesn't require the editor to remember to check the box.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Really? Can anyone explain the differences that using "min=100" causes?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>See the explanation on the </em><a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> page. If a page doesn't have any edits with > 100 characters size delta in the queried time range (given with the 'days' parameter), then the entire history for that page is hidden. If there is one qualifying edit in the given time range, then the entire history for that page is displayed.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've read the theory, but the results don't seem to be in accord with it. For example, why does page order change? Also, how on earth does hiding edits as described allow one to spot minor edits?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It looks like the results are sorted based on the timestamp of the most recent edit that has > min characters delta, which is not necessarily the most recent edit overall for each page. To verify this, look at the filtered output and go through each listing in sequence. Find the most recent edit for each page that has > min characters delta. Look at the timestamp for each of those edits. Verify that those timestamps are in decreasing order.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> doesn't allow one to spot <em>only</em> minor edits. Can you confirm that is what you want to do? If so, why? If you want to go back and check the minor edits for possible acts of vandalism, then surely you will want to check the major edits as well. The <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s feature mainly served the purpose of hiding minor edits from users who weren't concerned with them. <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> still meets that need.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/RecentChanges?days=1">http://c2.com/cgi/RecentChanges?days=1</a> is relatively a pain and an unnecessary usability hurdle. I think <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a> was a very good feature for both readers and gnomes and Ward had to disable only because of abuse. Now if abuse is relatively under control I was hoping we can get it back, but it's just a suggestion.

        <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s is an outdated tool. <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> shows each and every change whether minor or not, and one can choose to ignore changes they feel are minor. <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s was a way to hide small edit changes, both good and bad. The only use I see for <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s now, is for those who want to sneak by changes without others noticing, and this is perhaps not a good thing. Really, in my opinion, even <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> would be now outdated if it wasn't needed for archive history. Of course, <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> was much more useful before it was hack edited.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and the old <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s are not outdated in comparison with <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>. What is significant about each is what patterns the user can spot <strong>at a glance</strong>, without mouse hovers and clicks.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Ah, I'm assuming that you are referring to IP that did the last edit, but... all users make some bad edits, even those on one's trusted list. Really, every edit ought be checked regardless of whom made it.
