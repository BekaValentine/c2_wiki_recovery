        A <a href="QuickChangesJunkie.html">QuickChangesJunkie</a> who prefers to click on the <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> links on <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>, just to see what's new. The page itself is read only if necessary to provide context to the diffs, or if it is suspected that multiple changes have occurred since the page was last read, or if it's been a long time since the junkie last read the page (or he's never read it.)
