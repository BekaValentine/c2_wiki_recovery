        Shop Smith
      </h1>
      <p>
        The most popular multipurpose woodworking tool.  The company survives by providing excellent support for almost any machine they've ever produced (in the last 40 or 50 years), upgrades to the latest and greatest version, etc.

        An interesting model for building a business based on products that rarely wear out before the owner does.  (I bought mine via eBay; it had been sold by the original owner's widow; it had only been used for one project before his death.  Apparently this is the most common source of barely-used machines.)

        "My father bought a shop smith "tool" in 1973 for $3,000. All of the tools, and devices for it have worked great ever since. It is a very reliable, and versatile machine. Their fine craftsmanship is greatly appreciated." -Shortman

        Shopsmith's product line is generally made using the designs, jigs and patterns of the old Magna Line tools that were made in the early 1950's.  I wish there were places I could get other newly made 1950 items.  The stuff lasts and lasts.  Designed for performance, not economy, it is top shelf.  The drawback is that it is expensive.  While the rest of the world is buying from China, American stuff like Shop Smith makes can still be had at a price.

        As far as tools are concerned, there is no such thing as a bargain.  Shopsmith tools do what they are supposed to, do it well and last forever.  ANd if you need a part for that 1954 jointer, Shopsmith still makes it and sells it economically.

        Nice stuff.  Nice people, great service.  If you are a first class guy who wants first class tools and service, Shopsmith is your kind of company.
