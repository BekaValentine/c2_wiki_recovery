        Xml Meta Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        What does it mean when people say "Xml is a meta-language"?
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that once I have an xml document, even though I have a tool to help me pull elements off a stream and ensure they are well formed, I still have to parse the xml document, using elements and attributes as tokens.  Is xml just a commone lexical specification for languages?
