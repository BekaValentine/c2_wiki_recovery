        Grief Observed
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Correct name of the book is <em>A Grief Observed</em> by C.S. (Clive Staples) Lewis, noted Christian apologist and the author of the beloved children's fantasy series "The Chronicles of Narnia". [ISBN 0060652845]
      </p>

        The book is a series of his thoughts (recorded more or less chronologically) on the death of his wife, Joy Gresham Lewis from cancer. It's a powerful and moving book; I recommend it to anyone.

        For a better understanding of the life of C.S. Lewis and especially his relationship with his wife, I recommend renting the movie "Shadowlands". C.S. Lewis is portrayed by oscar winner Anthony Hopkins, and Joy Gresham Lewis is portrayed by Debra Winger. An excellent film. [<em>The original version, with Joss Ackland and Claire Bloom, was also fine.</em>] For more on C.S. Lewis, see <a href="http://cslewis.DrZeus.net/.">http://cslewis.DrZeus.net/.</a>
