        Key principle and Critical Successfactor in a <a href="BrainStorm.html">BrainStorm</a> session.

      <p>
        Defer all evaluation of ideas during idea generation. 
        Separate the evaluation from the generation.
        Most groups don't follow this principle and are less productive. The principle increases the odds that we end up with at least one good idea and don't spend all time in criticizing every idea as we think of it.
        Besides it helps the group spirit.

        I could argue 
        <strong>Here 's why this works</strong> 
        or even <strong>Here's why you want to be doing this</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Here's what to do</strong> is too strong but I think <a href="AlexOsborn.html">AlexOsborn</a> called <a href="PostponeJudgment.html">PostponeJudgment</a> his most important rule for a good <a href="BrainStorm.html">BrainStorm</a>.

        It might be fun to write these "things" in <a href="PatternForm.html">PatternForm</a> but there are good books about these good practices (or common sense ? of good habits ?).

        Sir Karl Popper, following the Dialectic of Socrates and attacking what he called Verificationism, asserted that in science, hypotheses begin from unfounded conjecture, to be subjected to Critical Preference and then Reality Testing thereafter, never a'priori.
