        Reminder Card
      </h1>
      <p>
        Another form of a <a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a> card which calls, not so much for action, but for remembering.

        A card that marks an upcoming event you may be interested in attending, but without knowing about some uncertainties which might interfere, you put off making any decisions about carrying out an action which enables attendance, like registration, etc. It might merely be to remember the latest date when you can make arrangements.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are things which you want to be reminded of, but which may not require any action, other than noticing.
