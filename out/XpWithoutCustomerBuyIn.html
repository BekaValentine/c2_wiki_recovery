        Xp Without Customer Buy In
      </h1>
      <p>
        A lot of developers who have worked on <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> projects or strongly believe in XP principles end up finding themselves on projects where the customer or other team members don't really want to do XP.  The developers find themselves doing a lot of XP things without really "telling" the others.

        Some things that you can always do (and nobody really needs to know):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a>

        </li>
        <li>
           OptimizeLate
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s (based on customer specs)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some things that you can do if other developers are willing:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> (mainly <a href="IterationPlanning.html">IterationPlanning</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="StandupMeeting.html">StandupMeeting</a>
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some things you probably can't do (correct me if I'm wrong):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           CustomerIsAlwaysAvailable
        </li>
        <li>
           No <a href="OverTime.html">OverTime</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ReleasePlanning.html">ReleasePlanning</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        -- <a href="JavidJamae.html">JavidJamae</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        You can often get the customer to do a <a href="ReleasePlanning.html">ReleasePlanning</a> by just asking them to prioritize things. But without both sides committing to it, they can at any time appear with a different (the "official") release plan, or something else that renders your planning useless.
