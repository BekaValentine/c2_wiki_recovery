        Memory Cards Had Bugs
      </h1>
      <p>
        I worked on 8 and 16-bit multi-microprocessor systems
        at <a href="TekLabs.html">TekLabs</a> in the late '70s.  We
        assemble computers out of standard boards.  Much to my
        amazement all our <a href="MemoryCardsHadBugs.html">MemoryCardsHadBugs</a>, the same bugs,
        SynchronizerFailure.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's true.  Every memory card we tried had bugs.
        These were commercial products from big name 
        memory manufacturers.  The cards all used dynamic ram
        which has to be refreshed.  If you don't refresh, 
        the ram forgets.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever our multi-processor was acting a little flaky
        I'd ask JeffBradford to take a look.  Jeff would hook
        up his MissingEventTrigger to the memory card's refresh
        circuit.  We'd wait a few seconds and then, FLASH, we'd 
        catch it failing to refresh memory.
        With a solid trigger we could then see what led up to 
        the failure with a <a href="LogicAnalyzer.html">LogicAnalyzer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        They always turned out to have poorly designed 
        <a href="SynchronizationMechanism.html">SynchronizationMechanism</a>s.  These are
        the circuits that judge the race between a processor's
        access to memory and the refresh circuit's access.
        With one processor in the system it would tend to work.
        Plug in two or three and you'd have SynchronizerFailure.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why every card?  They all used different circuits.
        They all had the same bug.  Jeff guessed that a semiconductor
        company would always put a beginning engineer on a ram 
        card design -- someone who didn't know what to watch out 
        for.  I figured they just didn't have a MissingEventTrigger.
