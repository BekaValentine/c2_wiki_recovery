        The Urban Monk
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Urban Monk is an attempt at finding the essence of modern techno urban living in worldwide major cities.

        Currently, <a href="http://urbanmonk.blogspot.com">http://urbanmonk.blogspot.com</a> is a blog made of free resources and  webware kept by a Montreal-based ecommerce consultant. It features some personal stuff but tries to illustrate the contemporary urban reality and thinking of a late generation X "urban world citizen" through news and critics, links, images and other multimedia content.

        So far I have no idea how the Wikiwiki concept can contribute to <a href="TheUrbanMonk.html">TheUrbanMonk</a>, but I believe there is some potential.

        I decided to try the wikiwikiweb as a public space for discussions and reactions related to <a href="TheUrbanMonk.html">TheUrbanMonk</a> weblog.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The first page is DiscussNews page where <a href="TheUrbanMonk.html">TheUrbanMonk</a> readers can add or discuss any news item of interest.
        </li>
        <li>
           Another page is the AddBlog page where you can add a link to other weblogs.
        </li>
      </ul>
