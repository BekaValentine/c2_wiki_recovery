        Causal Chain Crossings
      </h1>
      <p>
        Maybe <a href="CausalChainCrossings.html">CausalChainCrossings</a> can explain the seemingly unscientific occurrences of the <a href="LatticeOfCoincidence.html">LatticeOfCoincidence</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I once heard it said (sorry, no references), that coincidences were nothing else but crossings over of causal chains.
      </p>
      <p>
        E.g.
      </p>
      <p>
        A => B => C
      </p>
      <p>
        A' => B' => C'
      </p>
      <p>
        where A and A' are not related and neither are C and C', but B and B' are.
      </p>
      <p>
        Independently, these chains are quite normal. But the huge number of dependencies in everyday life will probably inevitably lead to quite a lot of these crossovers, which we regard as 'coincidences'.
