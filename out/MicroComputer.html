        Micro Computer
      </h1>
      <p>
        Before the IBM PC, 8-bit computers were called microcomputers. After the introduction of the IBM PC, the term fell into disuse. <strong>No it didn't. -- </strong><a href="JasonGrossman.html">JasonGrossman</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The term applies to any computer that doesn't take up a whole room. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Really? I thought it was pretty well limited to all computers built around a CPU that is implemented using </em>MicroProcessors, usually no more than two (a main CPU and a floating-point coprocessor). Recall that the PdpEight, always held up as an example in these discussions, could fit on a desktop, although extras like DiskDrives and RAM (I think) were separate components and a whole kit might do a good job of filling a small room.<em></em>

        This was an unusual thing when the first microcomputers, the AltairComputer, ImsaiComputer, and Apple's AppleOne and <a href="AppleTwo.html">AppleTwo</a> were sold.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Commodore 64 (<a href="CommodoreSixtyFour.html">CommodoreSixtyFour</a>) was the best selling microcomputer, with over 6 million sold in the US and twice that worldwide.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other computers of that era include the AtariComputer, the <a href="RadioShack.html">RadioShack</a> <a href="TrashEighty.html">TrashEighty</a> (TRS-80), the low-end <a href="CommodoreVicTwenty.html">CommodoreVicTwenty</a>, and the even lower-end <a href="SinclairZxEightyOne.html">SinclairZxEightyOne</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once computers like the IBM <a href="PeeCee.html">PeeCee</a>, the <a href="AmigaComputer.html">AmigaComputer</a>, and the <a href="AppleMacintosh.html">AppleMacintosh</a> came out, people started calling them HomeComputers and <a href="PersonalComputer.html">PersonalComputer</a>s.
