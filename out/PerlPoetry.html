        Perl can bend steel bars and move mountains. <br/>
        Perl can turn back the hands of time. <br/>
        Perl is good for the goose and for the gander. <br/>
        Perl can beat up Mike Tyson with one hand <br/>

        Perl can make a rock so heavy it can't lift it. <br/>

        Perl has saved the rainforests, <br/>
        It has been to the moon <br/>
        And it has cured all major diseases. <br/>
        It has exceeded all known bounds. <br/>
        It has mapped the universe and created an <br/>

        The old london.pm.org site had this nice poem.  Unfortunately,
        the new one did away with it, but thanks to the <a href="GoogleCache.html">GoogleCache</a>,
        I was able to find it again, and save it here for posterity.

        Yes, you mention that perl can do all those things in the poem. However, can you use it to write coherent code? :)

        Of course, my friend.  <a href="ThereIsNothingPerlCannotDo.html">ThereIsNothingPerlCannotDo</a>.

        <em>Wasn't it about three years ago, at a website hosting company in North Carolina (running Apache and mod_perl), that someone used </em><a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> to write coherent code?  Of course, it was strictly a proof-of-concept project which never made it into production.  I'm sure <a href="CiteSeer.html">CiteSeer</a> has the resulting paper somewhere...<em></em>
