        Feature Let
      </h1>
      <p>
        A featurelet is the smallest increment in the construction of a feature, and is a useful concept when dealing with separate testing teams (<a href="AgileBridge.html">AgileBridge</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        (Back-formation using nominally unproductive suffix "-let", meaning "little" in a few words such as "droplet" or "starlet", and as such it should be expected to require explanation to non-native speakers of English.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FeatureLet.html">FeatureLet</a>s allow for:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Work to be delivered in smaller units to the tester.
        </li>
        <li>
           Work to be delivered sooner after it becomes available
        </li>
        <li>
           Quicker and more timely feedback to the developer
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A <a href="FeatureLet.html">FeatureLet</a> is usually surrounded by incomplete functionality.  There could be menu items and buttons that open an empty dialog.  The dialog could just be a dummy because the real one has not been implemented yet.  The buttons and menu items would be a featurelet, a small part of the feature.  A tester would want to know about this if it affects any scripts he has written.  A developer could let him know through a <a href="DeveloperStory.html">DeveloperStory</a>.
