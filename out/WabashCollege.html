        Wabash College, in Crawfordsville, Indiana, is one of few remaining all-male colleges in the United States.  The diplomas are still in Latin, on sheepskin, and the average class size is less than ten, taught by a faculty composed mostly (95%) of PhDs  Famous alumni include Vice President Thomas Marshall ("What this country needs is a good five-cent cigar.")   The school is well endowed ($350M/800men) and offers 21 majors in fundamental sciences and liberal arts.
