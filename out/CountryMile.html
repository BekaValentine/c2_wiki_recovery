        : In the UK rural folk wouldn't know about kilometers...chain, furlong, mile, league. Don't forget the UK still uses acres which at a chain by a furlong (22 yards by 220 yards) isn't even square

        As in: "Boy, he can hit that baseball a country mile".

        A <a href="CountryMile.html">CountryMile</a> was originally defined as the distance you have to walk to get help if your truck or vehicle breaks down.  However with the introduction of the new revised rural system and improved traceability the country mile was redefined as 6/11 of a real long ways, or 2.59 'fair piece'.

        A mile is the distance covered by 1000 paces. As this varies between countries, the Country Mile varies accordingly. For example, the Romans, inventors of the unit, covered 1480 meters with that many paces; the Irish, with their Ceili leaping steps cover a whopping 2048 meters; and the Norwegians manage 10 kilometers gliding along on telemark skis.
