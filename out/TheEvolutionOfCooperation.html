        "This book has information for military theorists, biologists exploring gene regulation, antitrust policy-makers, and Miss Manners. It is a wonderfully clear explanation of how almost any two entities, interacting over time, develop a mutualism more profitable than greed." -- Amazon review

        <em>This should however be balanced with an understanding of how EvolutionarilyStableStrategies nonetheless allows for PopulationNiches within a species for different strategies, which has implications just as broad.</em>

        Very true, importantly true. The classic "<a href="TheSelfishGene.html">TheSelfishGene</a>" discusses that very clearly (although the concept was invented earlier by JohnMaynardSmith). Briefly, cooperation tends to evolve and become the dominant and stable strategy for the majority of a population, but the game-theoretic payoffs mean that there is almost always room for a sub-population of non-cooperators. For any given set of game-theoretic payoffs, there is typically a fixed ratio of cooperators to non-cooperators that is stable over time.

        This applies to game-theoretic systems in general (i.e. a vast number of kinds of systems), such as economics, not just to natural and artificial biology.
