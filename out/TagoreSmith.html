        I'm a programmer, currently living in NYC. I recently took a position with a Virginia based company, building web applications, and handling the tech side of things. Before that I did a lot of contract work. One thing I did recently that I'm proud of was to help Anzovin Studios write their Maya plugin, the Setup Machine: <a href="http://www.anzovin.com/setupmachine/.">http://www.anzovin.com/setupmachine/.</a>

        Right now I'm doing a lot of programming in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>. I've also done a fair bit of programming in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, and some others. About a year ago I started getting pretty serious about <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, Common Lisp to be precise. I really enjoyed programming in Lisp when I was in school, and at this point I'd rather program in Lisp than anything else. I haven't found a lot of opportunities to do Lisp programming commercially yet, but I do write utilities in Lisp for myself, and I believe that it's a language with a bright future.

        I used to play the <a href="GameOfGo.html">GameOfGo</a> and the <a href="GameOfChess.html">GameOfChess</a> a lot, but in recent years I haven't had much time for them, limiting myself to a bit of play on the internet.
