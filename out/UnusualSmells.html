        Unusual Smells
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was looking at legacy code with an eye (nose?) for code smells and saw several things that didn't seem to be covered by The Usual Smells.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Liar- a class/method that doesn't do what its name suggests
        </li>
        <li>
           Changling- a child class that doesn't resemble its parent class
        </li>
        <li>
           Impurity- methods that look like pure functions but have side effects
        </li>
      </ul>

        Changling might be has-a built in terms of implemented-in-terms-of-a.
