        Karen worked for <a href="RetailAspect.html">RetailAspect</a>. I believe she is from Ireland. Yes she really is from Ireland.

        Some years ago, it appears she was part of a company that was being coached by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>. I don't know whether she is still at Retail Aspects. Karen later worked for Charles Schwab until May 2011, when, like a Boojum, she softly and silently vanished away.

        Retail Aspects is now part of or has become <a href="EvantSolutions.html">EvantSolutions</a>.
