        Graph Sink Detection
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>This page needs to be tidied, and that will require some attention from the original contributors. In particular, what are the definitions being used here? As a </em>PhD in graph theory, to me a sink in a directed graph (not necessarily complete) is a vertex with no outgoing edges. I refer you to <a href="http://www.eli.sdsu.edu/courses/fall95/cs660/notes/Graph/Graph.html#RTFToC23">http://www.eli.sdsu.edu/courses/fall95/cs660/notes/Graph/Graph.html#RTFToC23</a> which claims the same.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the confusion may be between the definition of a sink and a universal sink. According to Introduction to Algorithms (Cormen et al), a universal sink for G = (V, E) is "a vertex with in-degree |V|-1 and out-degree 0."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you are dealing with complete digraphs then clearly there is at most one sink, and there is a linear time algorithm that will find it.</em>

        How to find a sink (if there is one) in a directed graph represented as an adjacency matrix?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Note: A graph "sink" is _____, and the "->" notation below means _____. Find out more about stuff like this at <a href="http://_____.)">http://_____.)</a>
      </p>
      <code>
        for each vertex <em>v</em>:<br/>
        <em>v.might_be_sink</em> := true<br/>
        for each vertex <em>v</em>:<br/>
        if <em>v.might_be_sink</em>:<br/>
        for each other vertex <em>w</em>:<br/>
        if <em>v</em> -> <em>w</em>:<br/>
        give up on <em>v</em> and try next candidate<br/>
        else:<br/>
        <em>w.might_be_sink</em> := false<br/>
        if <em>w</em> -> <em>v</em>:<br/>
        <em>w.might_be_sink</em> := false<br/>
        else:<br/>
        give up on <em>v</em> and try next candidate<br/>
        hooray! <em>v</em> is a sink.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Each time around the inner loop, at least one vertex is discovered not to be a sink. (Sometimes two might be.) Therefore, the whole thing takes time at most proportional to the number of vertices in the graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nice try, but in the worst case, for general vertex 2n-1, the inner loop may execute n times before vertices 2n-1 and 2n are found not to be sinks, so the time-complexity is of order v^2, where v is the number of vertices.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>The following was written with the assumption that a "sink" = "a vertex with no outgoing branches". Apparently a different definition was meant.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Any algorithm which inspects each entry in the adjacency matrix at least once
        will have complexity v^2. Consider the alternative question: give an algorithm which answers the question if the graph has at least 1 sink. This is equivalent to asking if there is a row in the matrix with only 0's. The worst-case running scenario of an algorithm that solves this problem must be v^2; there is no short-cut for inspecting every entry.

        A clever graph creator/loader will update sink status as it goes i.e. do the v^2 bit once only :). This is the equivalent of a denormalized aggregate in a database table updated by tuple triggers.

        The algorithm above is indeed broken, but Stephan's analysis of why it <em>must</em>' be broken is wrong. (A sink isn't equivalent to a row of all 0s; it's equivalent to a row of all 0s <em>whose corresponding column has no 0s</em>. We're ignoring the diagonal elements, of course.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an algorithm that either finds a sink, or reports that there is no sink, in linear time.

        (Thanks to the original questioner for pointing out a thinko in the definition of <em>find-possible-sink</em> and another in the proof of theorem 1. Both now fixed.)
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>def</strong> find-possible-sink(<em>vertices</em>):<br/>
        <strong>if</strong> there's only one vertex, <strong>return</strong> it<br/>
        <em>good-vertices</em> := empty-set<br/>
        pair <em>vertices</em> into at most n/2 pairs<br/>
        add any left-over vertex to <em>good-vertices</em><br/>
        <strong>for</strong> each pair (<em>v</em>,<em>w</em>):<br/>
        <strong>if</strong> <em>v</em> -> <em>w</em>:<br/>
        add <em>w</em> to <em>good-vertices</em><br/>

      <code>
        <strong>def</strong> find-sink(<em>vertices</em>):<br/>
        <em>v</em> := find-possible-sink(<em>vertices</em>)<br/>

        <strong>return</strong> "there is no spoon^H^H^H^Hink"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Theorem 1</strong> <em>The algorithm above takes linear time.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Proof</strong> The time taken by <em>find-possible-sink</em> satisfies <em>T</em>(<em>n</em>) <= <em>T</em>(<em>n</em>/2) + <em>K.n</em> + <em>L</em> for some constants <em>K</em>, <em>L</em>. Therefore, by induction, it satisfies <em>T</em>(<em>n</em>) <= constant.<em>n</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The time taken by <em>find-sink</em> is linear, because checking a single vertex for sinkitude takes linear time. []
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Theorem 2</strong> <em>The algorithm above never returns a non-sink.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Proof</strong> We never return a vertex without checking it first. []
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Theorem 3</strong> <em>If there is a sink, the algorithm above returns it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Proof</strong> Suppose <em>v</em> is a sink. It suffices to prove that <em>find-possible-sink</em> returns <em>v</em>, since it will pass the test in <em>find-sink</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <em>v</em> is the only vertex in <em>vertices</em> when <em>find-possible-sink</em> is called, then of course it will be returned. So suppose that <em>vertices</em> has more than one element, and includes <em>v</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <em>v</em> is unpaired, then it will automatically be entered in <em>good-vertices</em>. If it is paired (say, with <em>w</em>), then since we have 
        <em>w</em> -> <em>v</em> and not <em>v</em> -> <em>w</em>, <em>v</em> will be entered in <em>good-vertices</em> whichever way around the vertices appear in the pair.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, <em>v</em> will be entered in <em>good-vertices</em> and passed to the recursive invocation of <em>find-possible-sink</em>. By induction on the number of elements in <em>vertices</em>, it will be returned from this invocation. []
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusion: this algorithm finds a sink if there is one, in linear time. Corollary: there is at most one sink. (This is, of course, trivial anyway.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When I last looked at this, I concluded that the code and proof required a minor tweak to be completely correct (i.e., work in the worst case).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well done!  Would you like to share your minor tweak, or is reading your mind left as an exercise for reader?

        Wonderful work.I had tortured my brain a lot for this algo.
      </p>
      <p>
        This algorithm works only if the graph is complete, in a sense that either <em>v</em> -> <em>w</em> or <em>w</em> -> <em>v</em>for all <em>v</em> and <em>w</em>. Then, it is of course also impossible to have more than one sink.
      </p>
      <p>
        False. Nothing in the proof above assumes that the graph is complete. However, the existence of a sink implies that the graph is complete. Or are you defining "sink" as "vertex with edges from <em>some</em> other vertices but not to any others"? Indeed, the algorithm won't find those. But I don't think that's the usual definition of "sink".
      </p>
      <p>
        You are right, my definition differs from yours. Thanks for clarifying.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes that answers my question too, but it also suggests that the definition isn't very useful. Still, no-one said it had to be useful :).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've never heard of a sink in a digraph being defined as anything other than a node with outdegree zero. And from a quick search on google, I'd conclude that no other definition is in common use.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I did various google searches before creating this page, and am satisfied the more restrictive definition of a sink is currently standard. The question appears as an exercise on various university sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since there seems to be such disagreement, it's obviously not standard :-). I found three definitions myself: a node with no outgoing edges; a node reachable (via some path) from all nodes and with no outgoing edges; and a node with no outgoing edges that is reachable in one step from every other node.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Strictly speaking, the question asks for efficient detection of a (standard definition) sink if there is one. If there is no sink and the graph is not 'complete', reporting there is no sink is merely a bonus.
      </p>
      <p>
        In theorem 1, <em>n</em>/2 should be annotated as rounded up to next integer if fractional. The proof still works.
      </p>

      <p>
        BTW, this problem is in some circles known as the "Celebrity Problem", and is more colourful formulated as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        At a party, there is one celebrity. The celebrity has the following properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Everybody else knows the celebrity
        </li>
        <li>
           The celebrity knows nobody.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now, the task is to identify the celebrity by only asking questions to people of the form: "Do you know him/her?"
      </p>
      <p>
        The trick is that if you do it right, you can with <em>every</em> question eliminate some person as the celebrity. Say you ask A: "Do you know B?" If A answers yes, then A is not the celebrity. If A answers no, then B is not the celebrity. So you continue eliminating candidates until you have one left. This takes N-1 questions max. Of course, if you are not sure a celebrity exists, you will have to check explicitly. This takes another few questions.
