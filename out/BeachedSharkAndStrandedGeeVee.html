        Beached Shark And Stranded Gee Vee
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Shark will be Beached, and the Grammar Vandal will have no boat (pages) he/she/it(bot) may edit/create/modify/delete/reverse-edit. This will occur if C2 ceases to be maintained in its present, freely editable and log-in-less, bot-allowing form. This would of course be a sad, albeit perhaps necessary development if both continue as they have in the past into the near future. Should this happen, neither will be able to claim anything more than that they have held to their positions and approaches to the end!
