        Wait Free Synchronization
      </h1>
      <p>
        A wait-free implementation of a concurrent data object is one that guarantees that any process can complete any operation in a finite number of steps of finite time, regardless of the execution speeds of the other processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wait-free algorithms are always lock-free algorithms. Whenever one process locks an object, other objects are forced to wait an unbounded amount of time until the first process releases that object. This causes many well-known problems (indeterministic <a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a> and <a href="LiveLock.html">LiveLock</a>) that are completely avoided by wait-free algorithms.

        Someone changed "<a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a>" to "indeterministic <a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a>". What's the difference ?

        <dd>Deterministic deadlock/livelock will happen consistently and predictably (i.e., you could program it to happen if you wanted to, although I'm not quite sure why you would).</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>  </dt>
        <dd>Indeterministic deadlock/livelock is unpredictable. Even if you wanted to you could only cause it to occur probabilistically (i.e., run a couple hundred threads together knowing that the odd's of them escaping deadlock are about the same as you winning the lottery). </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>  </dt>
        <dd>The reason for the distinction is that you can in theory program your way back into deadlocks; wait-free synchronization demonstrates that it is never necessary. </dd>

      <p>
        Are there any ACID database with WaitFree reads and reasonable updates ?
        The closest I can get is:
      </p>
      <p>
        :read - open("cur"); read(); close("cur")
      </p>
      <p>
        :write - lock("lock"); copy("cur", "tmp"); modify("tmp"); rename("tmp", "cur"); unlock("lock");
      </p>
      <p>
        Reads are fine and virtually waitfree this way, but writes are not.
      </p>
