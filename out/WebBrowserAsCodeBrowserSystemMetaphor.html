        Web Browser As Code Browser System Metaphor
      </h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
           I want to make a code browser for <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           I want it to include most of the good features of the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> code browser.
        </li>
        <li>
           I want the code browser to be <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>-based (i.e., to use a web browser as its <a href="WindowingSystems.html">WindowingSystems</a> [singular]).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        So what is the big deal?  Well, in addition to the above, I want to discover a simple building block, or <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>, that allows me to construct the browser using a bunch of similar, simple pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why don't I just start doing <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, and <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>?  Well, I am confused.  I am my own customer, and the (researchy) customer part of me wants the browser to emerge from loosely-coupled pieces.  No central logic (although perhaps a central dispatcher).
      </p>
      <p>
        Given this constraint, I want to do XP.

        Code browser metaphors I have seen used in the past:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Each pane registers for events from, and sends events to, a central event processor
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        principles / patterns / concepts that may be of use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Headless application - the application should work without its interface - in other words the application should be able to be run from the interpreter window
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="StateMachine.html">StateMachine</a> - the response to events depends on the current state
        </li>
        <li>
           Ping Pong processing - two, three, or more objects act together to determine the response to an event - usually by sending gradually more specific messages back and forth to each other like a multi-person Ping Pong volley.  AKA <a href="DoubleDispatch.html">DoubleDispatch</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Explicit object ranking - give objects rank, and have the higher ranking object do the processing (used with <a href="VisualWorksSmalltalk.html">VisualWorksSmalltalk</a> <a href="DoubleDispatch.html">DoubleDispatch</a>) 
        </li>
        <li>
           Blackboard - agents work independently (either asynchronously, or one at a time) on a common data structure.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I just went to the couch to think about this for ten minutes.  Here is my current candidate <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>: <a href="CollectionPlateState.html">CollectionPlateState</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        This sounds like <a href="BrowserAbuseSyndrome.html">BrowserAbuseSyndrome</a>. What about complex text features such as auto-indent, auto-fill, hiliting keywords, etc? And web browsers lack standardized widgets such as tree browsers, grids, tabs, etc.
