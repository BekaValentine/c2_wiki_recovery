        Commercial Lisp Applications
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Lisp in "Real Life"</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Are there any examples of commercial applications written in Lisp that one can buy off the shelf these days? Perhaps something built for the Windows platform, since that <em>is</em> the single most popular desktop on the planet. Would there perchance be some kind of downloadable demo available for any of this good stuff? This is presuming that the applications in question have been compiled for Wintel boxes, of course.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[Note, as of 6 Nov 10: Is this list up to date? Have there been any more advances of Lisp into the commercial application marketplace? Are some of these old applications still around, and are they still using Lisp?]</em>

        Keeping in mind that not everything is shrinkwrap development, here are some examples:

        This seems an exceptionally strange page. There are tens of thousands of commercial projects in lisp, hundreds alone in a company I was recently contracting for and dozens in my own company. They might not all be ShrinkwrapSoftware (and therefore don't all sport universally famous trademarks or public web presences), but then again <em>most</em> software in the world isn't of that form. I don't see any pages on CommercialCApplications or CommercialJavaApplications. Is this page the result of InsecureLispWeenies trying to demonstrate that Lisp is indeed useful and respected by industry? A lack of meaningless press buzz and litany of deliberately vague <a href="BuzzWords.html">BuzzWords</a> does not indicate a lack of well-regard; it indicates a lack of a singular, super-rich industry champion and conniving MarketingDepartment (which, over the long term, is probably a good thing). --CraigEverett
