        Systemantics is what I thought was a funny book written by a medical doctor in New England called Gall. I was in Britain at the time. Since I moved to the states, I've realized that he was not exaggerating. It is all about how systems fail to work. Here are some of the ideas - from memory.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A complex working system will be found to have evolved from a small working system.
        </li>
        <li>
           To make a complex system, start with a small one and grow it. (kinda familiar?)
        </li>
        <li>
           If you want to get something done - do not create a system.
        </li>
        <li>
           No system ever does what its name says it does. (this comes from <a href="GeneralSemantics.html">GeneralSemantics</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           Any sufficiently complex system exhibits antics. (Hence the name: system-antics),
        </li>
        <li>
           When a large system goes wrong, its makers usually try to do the same thing only bigger next time. (The titanic effect)
        </li>
        <li>
           All systems encroach.
        </li>
        <li>
           The file is the reality.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        there are a couple dozen more.... rules to live by... IMHO
