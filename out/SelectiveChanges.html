        ... the workshop is done, the author
        has received <a href="SuggestionsForImprovement.html">SuggestionsForImprovement</a>, and
        is working on the next iteration of the
        pattern or <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>.
        How should the author proceed?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Authors may receive diverse, even contradictory,</strong>
        <strong>feedback on their work.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's an advantage to have a diverse collection of
        reviewers, since chances are good that they'll think
        of something you didn't think of.  On the other hand,
        such a broad group of reviewers may not provide a
        consensus view.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Indeed, there is nothing about the </strong><a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a><strong></strong>
        <strong>format that drives toward consensus.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This leaves the author with a dilemma:  which reviewers'
        opinions should the author act on?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Furthermore, the author may disagree even with</strong>
        <strong>unambiguous opinions that come out of the writers' </strong>
        <strong>workshop.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Should the author be bound to take the advice of
        the workshop?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The author is not bound to the verbatim advice</strong>
        <strong>of the </strong><a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a>.  Rather, the experience<strong></strong>
        <strong>might help the author develop a new perspective,</strong>
        <strong>which in turn inspires the author to change the</strong>
        <strong>work.  There may be simple changes that the</strong>
        <strong>author chooses to make if convinced they are</strong>
        <strong>worthwhile.  But, in all cases, changes are at</strong>
        <strong>author discretion:  the results of the </strong><a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a><strong></strong>
        <strong>are the property of the author.</strong>
