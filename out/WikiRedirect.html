        Wiki Redirect
      </h1>
      <p>
        If all a page says is "See <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>", load <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> instead of the originally requested page. That way, synonyms, alternative spellings and singular-vs-plural issues are easily dealt with.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But the original page becomes impossible to edit in the case that the redirect was wrong or needs updating.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [This is not a problem.  Either someone can edit the url and insert edit=<a href="PageName.html">PageName</a>, or the script could just do a sleep(0.5), keeping an edit link that a user can stop and then click.]
      </p>
      <p>
        {What script is that? If it's <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, it will not be updated for the foreseeable future.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, there should be ways to provide for that.
      </p>
      <code>
        For example::	The page CategoryHomepage ('wrong' capitalization) says "See <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a>". If readers follow the link to CategoryHomepage, they get redirected to <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a>. That page displays a header saying "Redirected from CategoryHomepage". Readers following that link would get to the actual CategoryHomepage, which would then be editable in the usual way.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Also, we should check for circular redirecting; the easiest way to avoid that would probably be to not redirect as result of a redirect. In the example above, that would mean that if the page <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a> would say "See <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>" in turn, you wouldn't get redirected again, but just see those two words. Another solution would be redirecting away, stacking all redirection headers as we go along, detecting circles (it's not RocketScience) and displaying the page that would 'close the circle', including all the headers. That way, a reader could try to resolve it by editing any of the redirecting pages. -- <a href="AalbertTorsius.html">AalbertTorsius</a>

      <p>
        [Circular redirects shouldn't be a problem, either the load will stay low until the user clicks the stop button, or the system might notice and flag the unusual activity -- when it even happens at all.]
      </p>
      <p>
        {Resolving circular references would be technically trivial, but as this Wiki is considered a legacy application, implementation of <a href="WikiRedirect.html">WikiRedirect</a> as described above will not happen.}
