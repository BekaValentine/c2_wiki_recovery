        The best teacher I ever had was Morris Dansky at Creighton University. A math professor, he opened in me the delight I still feel in creative solution of problems with orderly methods. Could he have been "doing" math, whatever that means? I have no doubt, and he'd surely have made more money. But he wouldn't have made me.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Same for me with 'Laz' Newbold, head of math at Haileybury in Hertfordshire.  Laz's concern was always in identifying with slowest in the class, joking as if he didn't understand the silly stuff either.  Forty years at the same school, yet his was the infectious joy, the ever lively mind, and at his insistence and instruction we first had the opportunity to program.  (He later said that I was probably his second best student in the latter.  The other guy is now a farmer!) --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        I had one additional math teacher who like to give us 20 sums to do everyday. Well... when we asked him to explain certain questions, his favorite words would be, "Don't know, don't do"... Wow... that was 25 years ago. Wonder how I became a maths teacher -- Ezan
