        A common way of saying "not done". Common response to an inquiry on a task's status; can mean anything from "I've started" to "I truly am Almost Done; I just have to fix one more <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> and then I can check in."

        Often an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, when it is a sign that someone wishes to <a href="DelayBadNews.html">DelayBadNews</a>. The underlying assumption is that "if they think I'm just a day late, they'll leave me alone.
