        Aggregation On The Client

        <strong>Problem</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
          It's difficult for readers to follow up on many potentially interesting on-line forums. Even if <a href="InformationOverload.html">InformationOverload</a> is not the problem (you won't get too much daily updates from forums like <a href="LambdaTheUltimate.html">LambdaTheUltimate</a> or <a href="HaskellWiki.html">HaskellWiki</a>, but they're too many potentially useful places to keep track of.
        </li>
        <li>
          It's difficult for contributors to participate in all seriousness to more than one on-line forum.

          One kind of solution would be for aggregation of content to be done on the server by content createors through a "federation of wiki" schemes -- a proposed one is <a href="InterWikiCharter.html">InterWikiCharter</a>. Some contributors would not like that. One sends an article to publication X and it ends up being in publication Y, under a set of circumstances maybe altogether unacceptable for the author. To illustrate this, most people that contribute quality content to C2 do it based on the fact that <strong>for them</strong> <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> is an absolutely <strong>trustworthy</strong> person. If that content would then end up on a site run by say, RA, that would not be quite what people would want.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Aggregation should be done on the <strong>client-side</strong>. This would allow a contributor or a reader to be able to follow say advocacy of atheism AtheismWiki_, and <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> on CLiki. Because it's one's private space this would not impact negatively any of the online forums, and it would not suffer the potential problems of the <a href="InterWikiCharter.html">InterWikiCharter</a>. People would opt-in to whatever they feel like it is useful for them.
      </p>
      <p>
        This approach has not quite been implemented yet, although RSS <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> are a step in this direction. I am currently using this in <a href="MozillaThunderbird.html">MozillaThunderbird</a> and it's some approximation of where this should go in the future. For most of the sites (including C2) the content of the updates is unsatisfactory, a notable exception being <a href="LambdaTheUltimate.html">LambdaTheUltimate</a>.
