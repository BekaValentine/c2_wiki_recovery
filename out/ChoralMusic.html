        Choral Music
      </h1>
      <p>
        Probably the type of music done with a chorus of people. Maybe the most usual type is the 4 mixed voices (soprano, contralto, tenor and bass, 2 of women and 2 of men) but may have the full spectrum (mezzos, baritones, &c...).
      </p>
      <p>
        Music is usually 'a capella' (ie. without any instruments, but with the voice) or maybe some organ, piano...

        Pretty nice and relaxing, certainly... -- <a href="DavidDeLis.html">DavidDeLis</a>

        In my idiolect it doesn't need to be so light on accompaniment. For instance, GustavMahler's 8th symphony wants an orchestra of 250 players or thereabouts, but it's still <a href="ChoralMusic.html">ChoralMusic</a> because it makes a lot of use of a chorus.

        <a href="ChoralMusic.html">ChoralMusic</a> with more than 4 parts usually has more than one instance of each of the usual parts, rather than having separate parts for mezzo-sopranos or baritones or whatever. --<a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>
        The CanonicalExample is Tallis's SpemInAllium, which uses forty separate voices, each of one or two singers.

        The choirs I sing with (e.g. <a href="http://biv2000.aicsa.org.au/)">http://biv2000.aicsa.org.au/)</a> seem to have an unsually high number of computer people.  Some people  think this is because <a href="ChoralMusic.html">ChoralMusic</a> in some way complements the parts of the brain exercised in technical work. -- <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>
