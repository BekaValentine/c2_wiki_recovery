        Artificial Intelligence Paradigm
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are many simple structures that go into ArtificialIntelligenceAlgorithms.  For example, the <a href="ThreeLawsOfRobotics.html">ThreeLawsOfRobotics</a> could be implemented by integrating a SearchAlgorithm and a <a href="SubsumptionNetwork.html">SubsumptionNetwork</a> for input and output.  The <a href="SubsumptionNetwork.html">SubsumptionNetwork</a> could offer multiple possible routes to take, and the SearchAlgorithm would gauge which one would score the highest against the <a href="ThreeLawsOfRobotics.html">ThreeLawsOfRobotics</a>.

      <p>
        Put some other <a href="ArtificialIntelligenceParadigm.html">ArtificialIntelligenceParadigm</a>s up too... they're kind of handy if you're looking for advanced concepts with funny names.

        According to an article by Pui-Wing Tam in TheWallStreetJournal -- the authors hypothesize that the brain works by AnticipatingAndCompletingPatterns more than it does through input and output of information.  It seemed quite appropriate for <a href="ThisWiki.html">ThisWiki</a>.  Hawkins thinks his theory could reorient the AI research community toward developing methods of completing patterns rather than responding to specific sets of complete instructions.
