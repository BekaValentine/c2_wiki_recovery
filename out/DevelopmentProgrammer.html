        Development Programmer
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DevelopmentProgrammer.html">DevelopmentProgrammer</a> is a programmer who is working on developing a given tool, such as a library, compiler, or database. This contrasts with <a href="ClientProgrammer.html">ClientProgrammer</a>, which is a programmer who uses a tool but is not working on creating or changing it. The two are not exclusive: a database programmer may be using a database which they are themselves maintaining as part of a larger project, for example.
