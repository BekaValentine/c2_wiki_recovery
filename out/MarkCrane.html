      <p>
        Mark Crane is trying to get a PhD in Composition and Rhetoric at the University of Louisville.  He is planning to astound and amaze his colleagues by installing the <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> for his students to use to write collaboratively.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, the cgi-bin directory on my main account is hammered, so I took Austin's Kwiki-clone and installed it in another account.  Now, like most Perl scripts, I've got to tweak the stuffing out of it and beg a bunch of strangers for help until it works!
      </p>
      <p>
        The clone installation attempt (Kwiki) can be found at:

      <p>
        We're not using Wiki/Kwiki anymore.  Instead, due to the installation of new computers, we're doing more straight-up web publishing.  But Kwiki/Wiki is still the coolest and I will miss it.

        [update: Mark received his Ph.D. in 2004 and is currently teaching at <a href="http://uvu.edu">http://uvu.edu</a>  He misses the good old days when a simple wiki was an amazing thing. -9/25/2012]

        [update: the planet is a smoking nuclear wasteland.  I live in a bunker that used to be a genealogical archive, carved into the granite of the mountains outside SLC.  Amazed that C2 is still working -12/25/2056]

        April 2nd, 2008: I am amazed and delighted that my page here still exists.  I think, but am not sure, that it was first created around 1996 or so.  Twelve years.  Now I am wistful. I am running <a href="PmWiki.html">PmWiki</a> at <a href="http://textomatic.org/ecc">http://textomatic.org/ecc</a>
