      <p>
        He hasn't written any books or articles, he doesn't give seminars. 
      </p>
      <p>
        He does build superb software and is a pleasure to work for. A scholar and a gentleman, as we say, he combines technical acumen with a deep insight into the psychology of software development.

        Rob was my team leader for two years some time ago and defined, for me, what it means to be a good software engineer.
