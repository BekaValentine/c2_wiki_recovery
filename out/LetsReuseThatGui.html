        Lets Reuse That Gui
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is another piece of the amazing proliferating 
        <a href="TooMuchGuiCode.html">TooMuchGuiCode</a> problem. It occurs after one or
        more projects embodying the first two aspects have 
        already appeared.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project manager looks around and sees a whole bunch
        of GUI widgets. Scads of them just littering the ground.
        A slogan pops into her head: "Objects promote reuse."
      </p>
      <p>
        At the next design meeting, the suggestion is made
        that the current project could reuse parts of the 
        last one. In particular, aren't those widgets *just like*
        the ones needed for the current project?
      </p>
      <p>
        Note, since we're early on in the <a href="SimultaneousDevelopment.html">SimultaneousDevelopment</a>
        process, it's not clear just what the GUI ought to be. 
        So, yes, those widgets are probably similar to what we 
        need, but -no- please don't make us reuse them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it's rude to overtly say "that code was bad,"
        reticence gets interpreted as a desire to express your
        individuality ("it's not my code, I don't want to 
        use it") and the firm suggestion is made -- reuse those
        old components.
      </p>
      <p>
        So now, in your new application, you're going to wind
        up with bad gui objects that weren't thought out
        being placed willy-nilly in the GUI. And you can't 
        go back and redesign them correctly because your 
        project manager remembers (see <a href="SimultaneousDevelopment.html">SimultaneousDevelopment</a>) 
        that projects always run out of time and so you definitely
        don't have time to go do a correct redesign of already 
        working code.
      </p>
      <p>
        E.g. you now need another layer of translation code. 
        Congrats-- you've achieved object reuse <em>and</em> a 4 tier
        architecture. How ultimately buzzwordish.

        See <a href="ModelFirst.html">ModelFirst</a> and <a href="SpartanUserInterface.html">SpartanUserInterface</a>. Reused or not, GUIs will bury you and your team. Besides, it's easier to negotiate about them when the customer is hot to get things released. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
