        Most plenary sessions present ideas new to the whole
        industry.  These ideas must be experientially or
        theoretically verified, but need not pass the test
        of broad applicability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideas mature over the years through practice, and the
        first large-scale application of an idea is as significant
        as the first presentation of the idea itself.
        Practitioners often have trouble distinguishing the
        value and phenomena of new ideas from those of first
        adoption, or they misunderstand the intent of plenary
        sessions.  This means the program committee often receives
        experience reports that are outside the intent of the
        program committee.  The program committee could send these
        to the ExperienceReportsCommittee, but that puts the
        ExperienceReportsChair at a time disadvantage relative to
        the program schedule.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>, invite the ExperienceReportsChair to
        sit on the ProgramCommittee.
        This allows free flow between these two committees,
        exchanging papers that authors have sent to the
        inappropriate forum.
        You might consider doing the same for the PosterChair
        and DemosChair.
