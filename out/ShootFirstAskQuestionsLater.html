        The <a href="ShootFirstAskQuestionsLater.html">ShootFirstAskQuestionsLater</a> <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> is practiced during <a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a> in order to get a working prototype done before <a href="DesignByCommittee.html">DesignByCommittee</a> bureaucrats can bloat the code with all their stupid features.

        I have often encountered the situation where our business analysts say we need a veeblefetzer.
        OK, tell me what this veeblefetzer look like?
        Umm, we don't know, we never had one before.
        So how am I supposed to write one?
        Well, you're the programmer.
        How about I make one up, and you tell me what's wrong with it?
        Yeah, let's do that.

        How is this common combined coding and analysis prototyping pattern different from <a href="ShootFirstAskQuestionsLater.html">ShootFirstAskQuestionsLater</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The above example is not </em><a href="ShootFirstAskQuestionsLater.html">ShootFirstAskQuestionsLater</a> because you asked them the question first, or you communicated assertively.  If you had just seen veeblefetzer on a document and said, "Oh, he doesn't know what he wants anyway, I'll just code it up and see what he thinks," then you are practicing <a href="ShootFirstAskQuestionsLater.html">ShootFirstAskQuestionsLater</a>.  You might get it correct or you might shoot the good guy.  --<a href="TimBurns.html">TimBurns</a><em></em>

          Sometimes that's a good pattern (AntiAntiPattern?).  If I don't understand something, I'll implement what I think it is and compare with what the other person thinks it should be.  This only works for small things, though.  --<a href="JimmyCerra.html">JimmyCerra</a>
