      <p>
        <a href="WashesWhiter.html">WashesWhiter</a> is a spurious product feature used to justify the development of a new product or internal tool, or to argue for the replacement (or retention) of some tool that the speaker is particularly keen on.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feature makes no contribution to the way the tool or product will be used, but its absence from the competing products is claimed to be a reason for rejecting them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WashesWhiter.html">WashesWhiter</a> because the phrase occurred in well known detergent adverts in the UK (at least). US readers may prefer TastesGreatLessFilling, or does that have other connotations?

        Don't forget LemonScented either. <em>That is best for the U.S.A. as meaning "this is a fluffy feel-good claim".</em>

        In Germany the slogan was "Washes whiter than white". That was in the 1970ies.
