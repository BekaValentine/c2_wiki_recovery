        Cape Town, one of South Africa's three capital cities (the others are Pretoria and Bloemfontein), and capital of the Western Cape Province, is most famous for its mountain, aptly named Table Mountain because of its flat top. The agglomeration is estimated to have a population of about 2.7 million (estimate from 1996 census).
