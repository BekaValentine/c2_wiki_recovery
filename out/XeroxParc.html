        <a href="XeroxCorporation.html">XeroxCorporation</a>, about the time they acquired ScientificDataSystems,
        founded a research laboratory in the hills above Palo Alto, the Palo Alto Research Center.
        It was only after an elite staff of scientists and
        engineers had been recruited and assembled at the dedication
        of the facilities that they were to hear of their mission:
        invent the <em>paperless office</em> of the future. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a good mission, though many thought it off the wall
        at the time.  The group really did invent the office of
        the future.  It just didn't turn out to be paperless.
