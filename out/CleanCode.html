        Clean Code

      <p>
        <strong>What do we mean - Clean Code ?</strong>
        Writing clean code is what you must do in order to call yourself a professional. There is no reasonable excuse for doing anything less than your best.

           <em>Neither architecture nor clean code insist on perfection, only on honesty and doing the best we can. To err is human; to forgive, divine.</em>

           <em> ... code is never perfect ... Neither architecture nor clean code insist on perfection, only on honesty and doing the best we can. To err is human; to forgive, divine.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em> In our profession, we desperately need all the help we can get. If a clean shop floor reduces accidents, and well-organized shop tools increase productivity, then I’m all for them. </em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em> Learning to write clean code is hard work. It requires more than just the knowledge of principles and patterns. You must sweat over it. You must practice it yourself, and watch yourself fail. You must watch others practice it and fail. You must see them stumble and retrace their steps. You must see them agonize over decisions and see the price they pay for making those decisions the wrong way.</em>

      <p>
        Clean Code is divided into three parts. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The first describes the principles, patterns, and practices of writing clean code. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The second part consists of several case studies of increasing complexity. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Each case study is an exercise in cleaning up code—of transforming a code base that has some problems into one that is sound and efficient. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The third part is the payoff: a single chapter containing a list of heuristics and “smells” gathered while creating the case studies. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               The result is a knowledge base that describes the way we think when we write, read, and clean code.
