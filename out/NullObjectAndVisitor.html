        Null Object And Visitor
      </h1>
      <p>
        While writing the <a href="SceneBeans.html">SceneBeans</a> animation toolkit, I've just discovered a neat fit between the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern and the <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a>.  For example, taking the following  class hierarchy, and visitor interface:
      </p>
      <code>
        interface Visitor {<br/>
        void visitRectangle( Rectangle r );<br/>
        void visitCircle( Circle c );<br/>
        void visitPolygon( Polygon p );<br/>
        void visitCompositeShape( Composite_Shape cs );<br/>
        void visitTransformation( Transformation t );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        abstract class Shape {<br/>
        void draw( Graphics2D g2d );<br/>
        void accept( Visitor v );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Rectangle extends Shape {<br/>
        public void draw( Graphics2D g ) { ... draw rectangle onto <em>g</em> ... }<br/>
        public void accept( Visitor v ) { v.visitRectangle(this); }<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
        ... other shapes are implemented the same way ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        One can implement a <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Null_Shape extends Shape {<br/>
        public void draw( Graphics2D g ) { /* Don't draw anything */ }<br/>
        public void accept( Visitor v ) { /* Don't double-dispatch */ }<br/>
        ....<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The visitor does not even have to know about the use of the <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> pattern!  Therefore, concrete visitors do not need to handle special cases that might be caused by the presence of <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> shapes in the scene graph, such as empty areas or zero-length paths.
      </p>
      <p>
        I find this rather elegant.  However, have I missed any drawbacks to this way of combining the two patterns?

        <em>Looks fine to me.  If you had a "visitNullShape" function in your Visitor interface, would any of the Visitor subclases provide a meaningful implementation for it?  (I didn't think so -- so what you did must be right.  ;-)</em> -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        I have recently discovered a drawback with this design.  However, the drawback was not caused by the combination of <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> and <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a>, but in a refactoring that caused <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><strong>'s to represent concepts in the system, </strong>
        and so no longer be true <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a><strong>'s.  See </strong><a href="NullObjectAndRefactoring.html">NullObjectAndRefactoring</a> for details. --<a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>

        This is just an optimisation, right? What harm would it do if null objects double-dispatched as normal? At worst, there would be a visitNullShape method that nobody overrode.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose we want a visitor that counts all the nodes. Does "all" include null objects? Would it be clearest if we overrode visitNullShape and then either counted, or had an empty implementation (perhaps with a comment) to show we had at least thought about it? --
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't think it is an optimisation -- in any case, I never originally used it for that reason.  My thinking was: "How do you double-dispatch to a null reference?  You can't.  Therefore you shouldn't double-dispatch to a </em><a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> either."  Also, I found the fit between the two patterns particularly aesthetically pleasing!<em> --</em><a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree visitor goes well with null object. Null object is about replacing tests against null with polymorphism. Usually with polymorphism, single-dispatch is enough, but sometimes you need double-dispatch, and visitor is a general way to achieve that. This line of reasoning leads me to think it is natural to double-dispatch on null objects. It's as natural as sending isEmpty() to them (which you also can't do with null references).
      </p>
      <p>
        Put it this way. If after applying the NullObject pattern you still have some tests of the form p.isNull(), you can replace them with type-tests like (p instanceof NullObjectCLass). And then you can replace the type-test with a visitor. --
