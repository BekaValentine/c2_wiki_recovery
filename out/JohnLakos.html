      <p>
        John Lakos Chief Software Architect with Bloomberg LP; previously he was with Bear Stearns and <a href="MentorGraphics.html">MentorGraphics</a>.  While at <a href="MentorGraphics.html">MentorGraphics</a>, he wrote the book "Large-Scale C++ Software Design" (<a href="LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign.html">LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign</a>) from the Addison-Wesley Professional Computing Series.  It quickly became a widely touted and respected treatise on solving many of the problems of physical software design that arise when developing large C++ software projects. This book (and others) are mentioned in the <a href="GreatBooksList.html">GreatBooksList</a> elsewhere on this site.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is reportedly working on a second book, titled <em>Scalable C++: Component-based Development.</em>
