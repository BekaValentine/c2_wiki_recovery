        Development Tasks
      </h1>
      <p>
        Development Tasks come in two forms:.
      </p>
      <code>
        Problems for developers to solve.<br/>
        Acts which simply need to be performed.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There is some good advice to found about how you should <a href="AssignProblemsNotTasks.html">AssignProblemsNotTasks</a> and if you're interested in problems head there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sounds a bit rude, it's not what is meant, it's good advice, seriously. Check it out. I for one couldn't agree more.
      </p>
      <p>
        But Acts just don't get enough airplay I feel, so here it is, a rant in E minor as they say.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reality is that often developers need to perform simple acts like porting tables to divs, getting some exception handling around methods or changing a datatype in the database and then debugging all the code, procs and feeds that hook on to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple acts like putting a button on a screen that exports to PDF.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple acts like writing the method that powers the button.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can dance around the topic and say that the problem is "the user can't export to PDF", but really, that's a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, not a task.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> as in "As a user, I want to be able to export to PDF, so that I can conquer the universe".
      </p>
      <p>
        The task in this case isn't a problem, it's the act of implementing a solution that is obvious to all.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task is to sit down, shut up, tell your pairing partner to get another machine, start pasting and get typing.
      </p>
      <p>
        And you know... this is rarely popular project management, but how else can I put it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's pretend we're a rock band shall we?
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, we've written the songs, that was fun wasn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Lots of creative juices flowing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lovely.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now someone needs to play the bassline for 3 minutes while we make a recording.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any volunteers?
