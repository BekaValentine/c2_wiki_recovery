        Blame Tracking
      </h1>
      <p>
        Describe <a href="BlameTracking.html">BlameTracking</a> here. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One can not get into <a href="BlameTracking.html">BlameTracking</a> without first having the proper BAP in place. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Blame Allocation Procedures are critical for all projects requiring more than one person or one group
        to complete. Without proper BAP, considerably time is wasted allocating blame after project changes or problems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The only way to implement a BAP with the appropriate CMM level is to use a BAM (Blame Allocation Manager), a piece of software that allows one to assign blame, reassign blame, enter blame levels, and so on.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [A CMM-compliant BAM must allow different rules for allocating blame and "negative blame" (in other words, credit when something goes right).  Necessary to insure that the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> receives the credit for a successful project; but an appropriate <a href="ScapeGoat.html">ScapeGoat</a> receives the blame for one which is not successful.]
