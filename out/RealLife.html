        There's an argument to be made that nothing is real. And nothing to get hung about. Strawberry fields forever. But the technology of clay and water gives rise to the biology of algae and amoebae. Biological forces refine these beasts until they start to invent new technologies. Biology and technology ceaselessly give rise to one another. Real life then is a myth; the blue room and the blue screen are inextricably ensorceled.

        And yet there's that feeling of having one's face pressed against the gears. Most of us recall a time when we didn't just sit and type, but played and ran and lay in the long grass like tigers. We miss that, hunched over these keyboards in our darkened cubicles. Wasn't that the real stuff? Isn't that why we do this? The weekend barbeque, the wine-smoked dinner with friends, the occasional pool-party where we schmooze with future employers and employees ... that's not the same thing, is it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps when we're old and too faded to make the grade any more, when the ceaseless one-upmanship of marketing and tinkering finally passes us by, we hope, we'll lay in the long grass again. But like tigers? Perhaps real life is something only children can truly enjoy.

        Then again, who says you have to grow up? If you can drop the facade of earnest endeavor and throw yourself down a beach, you're a kid then. Taxes and mortgages have no power over you. Development? What development? -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        Last weekend there was a huge flotilla of geese on the lake behind my house. They cruised around, trying to look important. Sometimes they would fly off somewhere and then come soaring back in in a flock and do that half-land-half-crash thing they do. A Great Blue Heron was walking around the neighbor's dock, spearing down and grabbing something from under the water every now and then. Squirrels came to the bird feeder and stole seeds. We even had snow on the deck for a while. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Certainly sounds like <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> to me. Except for the geese. Where I live (Atlanta), the Canada geese "migrate" in the fall. Several times a day they take flight and fly in a big circle in the classic V formation and land where they started. Actually, on second thought, they are each living their own <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> in spite of what I or anyone else thinks they ought to do! -- <a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> is experiencing things versus rationalizing them. When you experience things, life is moving forward into the future. When you interrupt that sense of experiencing things as they come - you are pushing them into the past, no matter how unquantifiably short the present moment actually is. And as you say, it's all illusory anyhow. -- <a href="AnthonyLander.html">AnthonyLander</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The present is as much illusion as the past. Think about it; the real moment is a Planck moment, so vanishingly fleet that you can't experience it. "Now" is the process of memory and anticipation, which can be grown or shrunk as you like, consuming years or decades on either side of what you're sensing. Ignoring this is zen, sure, but no more real than anything else.

        For programmers, <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> can refer to programming done at work, rather than to programming done for fun or education.  As in, "I enjoy playing around with <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> and <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> in my spare time, but in <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> I do everything in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>."  Or "The formal relational model is powerful, but in <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> most programmers treat a relational database as a fancy sort of flat-file system."  Or "That process model looks good on paper, but would never work in <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a>."

        Real Life is the intersection of whatever makes you "you" with the things that are not you, particularly those things agreed to exist by "you" and the other participants in the "game".  It follows that any set of circumstances wherein you have no intersect isn't "real life" to you.  It also follows that "real life" (being the intersection of two or more sets) can be arbitrarily small or large in scope.  -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

        <strong>real life:</strong>that endless blur of interaction, cause and effect experienced between our birth and our death, that in moments of melancholy or loneliness we see as a disjointed montage. This montage although self-realising and personally important, is of no real consequence in the overall scheme of things. -- BenMinton

        <li>
           Things imagined

        <li>
           Things hypothisized (<a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> could be a subset, though)
