        "The AWK Programming Language" by <a href="AlfredAho.html">AlfredAho</a>, <a href="BrianKernighan.html">BrianKernighan</a>, and <a href="PeterWeinberger.html">PeterWeinberger</a> is the complete reference for the <a href="AwkLanguage.html">AwkLanguage</a>, and includes a brief chapter on programming style, one on program design, and one on testing.  
      </p>
      <p>
        It's almost a complete primer on programming for beginners.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was written in 1988, and although the language and the interpreter has been improved over time, the grammar and the examples remain unchanged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who read this years ago, and still writes a bit of AWK now and then should reread the middle chapters again.  Then wait a few years and read the latter ones.  What programming gems!

        After rereading, <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a> has decided to abandon <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> -- it has major problems for me:

      <ol>
        <li>
           sysadmins put it anywhere at their whim, how do I 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        #!/.../perl <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        portably?
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>#!/usr/bin/env perl, of course.</em> (suggestive rather than perfect)<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
           it isn't on as many systems as AWK is -- awk is usually /bin/awk, and it may even be in the <a href="PosixStandard.html">PosixStandard</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>awk is in /usr/bin on the systems I've used it. so's perl.</em>
