        There Is Space For Diversity

        I believe that <a href="ThereIsSpaceForDiversity.html">ThereIsSpaceForDiversity</a> on this wiki. There are plenty of examples of that. Also there are discussions and people attempting to put forward a viewpoint and others asking them questions.

        I think myself that when I am writing here I should be thinking of the reader and making it easy for someone to understand my train of thought. When I have finished writing I look around for other places where my thoughts will link in. Or I just look around and add links which make sense to me. I often find richness here of things that I might have found some other way, but have not. Then I add that to my collection of things known.

        One reason for patience on this wiki is that the index of backlinks is only done once a day, so that it is not possible to see the full effect of changes without waiting for that to happen. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
