        Single Point Of Failure
      </h1>
      <p>
        A point in a system where, if a failure occurs, there is no redundancy to compensate for it: <img src="http://oit.utk.edu/macvolplace/graphics/Dilbert_boss.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to be confused with a system that can fail at one point only.

        The power supply failed in <a href="TeleHouse.html">TeleHouse</a> a year or so back, taking down most of the UK Internet for half a day. This wasn't supposed to be possible. Telehouse has 2 independent external power supplies, plus its own generator. It's highly unlikely they would all fail at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't believe the exact cause of the incident was ever made public, but apparently there was a switch which changed over to a new power supply when the current supply went broke. This switch acted as a <a href="SinglePointOfFailure.html">SinglePointOfFailure</a>. I tell the story to illustrate how hard it can be to truly eliminate these things.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Of course, the Telehouse guys were aware of the potential problem and tested the change-over switch carefully. According to rumor, an engineer was engaged in testing the switch at the very time the incident happened...)

        <em>Is this a good example of a </em><a href="SinglePointOfFailure.html">SinglePointOfFailure</a>? If there are protective redundancies built into a system, but both (or all) of them fail at once (or concurrently), then <strong>multiple points</strong> have failed. I think that we often mistakenly join together multiple points into a <a href="SinglePointOfFailure.html">SinglePointOfFailure</a>. -- <a href="JeremyCromwell.html">JeremyCromwell</a><em></em>

        The <a href="TeleHouse.html">TeleHouse</a> event wasn't due to two power supplies failing at the same time. It was due to the switch which selected the power supply failing. There was only one switch. So I think the switch failure is a good example.

        <em>A better example might be the end of Star Wars Episode I.</em>

        (It can be argued, with regard to the end of Star Wars Episode I, that all those robots had intentional self-destruction logic built in, so as not to be captured by the enemy. After all, the loss of a command center is a rather grave reason for some panic: robots breaking down can be thought of as a panic-consequence-minimization measure. As to the command center itself, I recall that it was hit somewhat hard, in a <em>force majeure</em> manner: this failure had much sooner occurred due to flawed combat tactics than to an engineering mistake, no?)

           More likely, the end of SW1 was a convenient plot device, with little thought given (by the screenwriters) to whether or not this made any sense.

        <em>Actually, the comparison is between a chain and a mesh. A chain is a sequence of single points of failure, whereas a mesh is a highly redundant set of links.</em>

        Interesting. This fits the security aspect of the cliche quite nicely too: "your system is only as secure as the largest hole in the mesh", or something. 8-)
