        A former <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> (NOTE: Jerry D Heddon wrote me: "Incorrect.  It's not open source." ) Wiki application for the Palm created by Jerry D Heddon <a href="mailto:jdhedden@yahoo.com">mailto:jdhedden@yahoo.com</a> (forked from <a href="PalmWiki.html">PalmWiki</a>, the original wiki-on-Palm hack), now a shareware product.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> hack (requires <a href="HackMaster.html">HackMaster</a>) provides the ultimate in Palm application linking. Jumping to and between desired records in the Memo Pad, Date Book, To Do List, Address Book and others applications from just about anywhere is now as easy as just touching your stylus to the screen. Put a name on a To Do List item, and then just tap to jump to the Address Book entry for that name. Manage a project from a memo page with links to bunches of To Do items. Have a list of important dates? Just tap one to go to that date in the Date Book. 'Web-ify' all those important notes in Memo Pad. <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> links work just like web hyperlinks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also create links to items in applications other than the Palm basic 4 as well as use <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> as a general application launcher (in conjunction with the Piki DA that is included).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> is a fast and simple solution that ties nearly all of your Palm's databases and applications together so that you can access your data quickly and easily from just about anywhere.

        <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> (a supercharged <a href="CodeFork.html">CodeFork</a> of <a href="PalmWiki.html">PalmWiki</a>) is exploding as of late Decmber 2001, check it out at <a href="http://www.palmgear.com/software/showsoftware.cfm?prodID=36156">http://www.palmgear.com/software/showsoftware.cfm?prodID=36156</a> or <a href="http://www.freewarepalm.com/utilities/megawiki.shtml">http://www.freewarepalm.com/utilities/megawiki.shtml</a>

        Allows links to many apps, highly customizable, pretty solid, reasonably well documented, mailing list active.  Includes helper apps for McPhling-like functionality.

        <em></em><a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> is very cool, thanks for the pointer.  Quick summary is that it lets you link from any application to any other, e.g. from TinySheet spreadsheet into the Memo Pad, or from Memo Pad into your address book or calendar, by creating <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> type links, with extra characters to delimit the links.  Really requires some additional DAs (desktop accessories) such as BracesDA or Liki, to make it easy to create links.  Very powerful, and could potentially be used to sync intranet/Internet based Wiki content down to and from the Palm device - however, it currently doesn't have any syncing features.

        Update: The recently created <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> web site is phpwiki based: <a href="http://www.megawiki.co.uk">http://www.megawiki.co.uk</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> can link using wikiwords (amongst a slew of linking methods) if one could suck down the pages of a wiki as individual memo-pad entries, <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> would turn it into a Palm-based wiki - nice. -- <a href="JohnKershaw.html">JohnKershaw</a>

        I tried out <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> but had to disable it - at least on my Palm device, an early Handspring Visor, it tended to cause too many crashes.  It's possible that one of the associated <a href="HackMaster.html">HackMaster</a> hacks were the reason for this, but I decided it was too much of a pain...  Nice idea though, e.g. you can put <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> links into virtually any application. -- <a href="RichardDonkin.html">RichardDonkin</a>

        Maybe you should try <a href="PalmWiki.html">PalmWiki</a>. It never crashed on me, except for when i went 'back' and there was nowhere to go back to. --<a href="JohnAbbe.html">JohnAbbe</a>

        I haven't used <a href="MegaWiki.html">MegaWiki</a> extensively, but I know that lots of hack-related crashes on my <a href="HandspringVisor.html">HandspringVisor</a> I had were because I used <a href="HackMaster.html">HackMaster</a> instead of X-Master.  Using the latter has resulted in a nice zero-crash environment.  --<a href="MattBehrens.html">MattBehrens</a>

        I wonder whether some day soon there will be a version for a Tungsten T (PalmOS 5). It sounds like a very interesting thing to link between different applications. <a href="WikiWorld.html">WikiWorld</a> for the Palm only supports a <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> in itself. -- Cyril Moli√©re

        <a href="HyperNote.html">HyperNote</a> was yet another wiki for <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a>; however, it appears to be defunct.
