        Window Shade
      </h1>
      <p>
        Originally an extension for <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a>, and later built in to the system: the windowing behaviour whereby clicking a widget built into the title bar of a window, or double-clicking the main part of the title bar, causes the window to "collapse" and display just the title bar on-screen. The window can still be focussed and brought to front by the normal rules, independantly of the collapsed state: clicking a title bar of a collapsed window focusses and brings to front, and clicking elsewhere unfocusses it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare/contrast with the "minimize" behaviour of Windows or "iconify" behaviour of some Linux-based window managers.
