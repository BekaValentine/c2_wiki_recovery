        Signals come from the outside world. Send 'em to a whole bunch of machines that share no disk, memory, cpu, nothing. Serve your responses without resource contention between machines with the possible exception of <a href="MemCached.html">MemCached</a> style caching. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you need to combine some of those signals together to generate a <a href="SourceOfTruth.html">SourceOfTruth</a>, replicate 'em in your switches and send 'em to a machine that does that. When you need to, stage round-robin downloading new back ends to your server farm.
