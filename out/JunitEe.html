        Junit Ee
      </h1>
      <p>
        JUnitEE is free software for unit testing in a J2EE ( <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> ) environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.junitee.org">http://www.junitee.org</a> includes a tutorial.

        You might also want to look at <a href="http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/.">http://jakarta.apache.org/cactus/.</a> It's significantly more complicated, but it makes the HTTP servlet objects available to your test case.

        <a href="JakartaCactus.html">JakartaCactus</a> is useful for automated testing during the builds and JUnitEE is useful for manual testing.  I think both are good to have in your J2EE development toolkit.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the <a href="JakartaCactus.html">JakartaCactus</a> web page, Cactus is for Integration Unit Testing.

        JUnitEE allows you to run your unit tests from a servlet on an app server.  To put it simply, it adds an additional <a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a> (HTML or XML) to the AWT, Swing, and command line test available with JUnit.  Thus it is similar, to <a href="JakartaCactus.html">JakartaCactus</a> in that it provides Integration Unit Testing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="HttpUnit.html">HttpUnit</a>, available at <a href="http://www.httpunit.org,">http://www.httpunit.org,</a> is more complicated, and provides support for testing the View layer.  According to the <a href="JakartaCactus.html">JakartaCactus</a> web site it is considered "functional unit testing".  Like JUnitEE, it can be integrated with <a href="JakartaCactus.html">JakartaCactus</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        See the <a href="JakartaCactus.html">JakartaCactus</a> web page for some good diagrams and detail on the differences between JUnitEe , <a href="HttpUnit.html">HttpUnit</a>, and <a href="JakartaCactus.html">JakartaCactus</a>.

        Should JUnitEE be considered obsolete software? In other words, does it work with Java EE 5 and support its new features? And is it still being developed? / Kent

      <p>
        Somehow there is nothing more annoying than an is it obsolete question, as in <a href="IsJavaDead.html">IsJavaDead</a> ?  Besides the issue that the question to me is not very relevant as you should really be asking if your tests are obsolete.  JUnitEE is simply a thin wrapper around JUnit that allows you to execute your unit tests in a container.  Anyway, to answer your question, taking a look at the project page, there is a recent release that adds support for JUnit 4.x.
