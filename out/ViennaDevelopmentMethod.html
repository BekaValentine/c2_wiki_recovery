        VDM is a generic term indicating different dialects and methodologies originated in the work of HeinzZemanek in the ViennaIbmLaboratory
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, VDM-SL (VDM specification language) is the ISO and BSI standard.

      <p>
        A VDM specification is built upon two models. The representational abstraction, equivalent to a data model, and the operational abstraction, equivalent to a program, that can be done in a declarative of in a imperative way.
