        Bus Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        At our place, a project or implementation is said to "fail the bus test" if its <a href="BusNumber.html">BusNumber</a> is one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having seen what the rest of the world calls the <a href="BusTest.html">BusTest</a> idea, I now see that we didn't get very far along with the <a href="ZeroOneInfinityRule.html">ZeroOneInfinityRule</a> ideology - and so you will see that many of our systems have a <a href="BusNumber.html">BusNumber</a> of one.  It is not explicit that "<a href="BusNumber.html">BusNumber</a> > 1" constitutes passing the <a href="BusTest.html">BusTest</a>, perhaps that makes it OK.
      </p>
      <p>
        Endless hours of amusement available when talking about people "getting bussed", especially since many of us cycle to work. Confusion ensues when this is mis-heard as "getting bust".
