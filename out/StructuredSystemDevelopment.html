        In building systems for use, we involve at least these four processes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Anaylyzing and establishment of Required Features
        </li>
        <li>
           Planning the System
        </li>
        <li>
           Designing and Programming the Systems
        </li>
        <li>
           Implementing Ease of Use and Change Management
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For Dynamic-Systems, the processes listed above may be repeated due to changing environments and <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Generation of deliverables in each of the processes require cooperative collaboration between planners and implementers with continual feedback from the using community.
