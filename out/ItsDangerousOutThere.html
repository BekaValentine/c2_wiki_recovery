        If I can make the environment dangerous for you, you will be less likely to go there and discover the way things actually are, how people really are, what truths are really out there.  So I tell you <a href="ItsDangerousOutThere.html">ItsDangerousOutThere</a>.

        I dread to contemplate where I would be today if my parents and teachers of 4 decades ago had "protected" me from the world.  Get out there.  Do something dangerous.  Go someplace mysterious.  Talk to the strangers.  If you don't live through it, do better next time around.

        People seek thrills (a pleasant state of heightened senses) and get themselves into dangerous situations. They only want to stay away from danger if they think the danger will be too much to handle, or they are preoccupied with other priorities.
