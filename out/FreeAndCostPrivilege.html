        This is a popular and successful means by which <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> attract paying customers.

        It is a model which is believed to be here to stay. In order to remain visible and widely used, such sites will necessarily require third party involvement. How? by the creation of a <a href="UserFriendlyMegaSite.html">UserFriendlyMegaSite</a> which supplies a directory and search facility to do so. It will have to be one which requires one or just a few touches to navigate (preferably one to no more than six). Why? most people will remember sequences that short, and because that many touches can be made with a matter of 1 to 3 seconds. (That is my definition of InAnInstant)
