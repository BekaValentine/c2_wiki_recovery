        Monolithic Kernel
      </h1>
      <p>
        The architecture used in the design of an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> where one big kernel provides almost all necessary services for other user programs running. Most <a href="UnixOperatingSystems.html">UnixOperatingSystems</a>, including <a href="LinuxOperatingSystem.html">LinuxOperatingSystem</a>, and other classic <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a> use <a href="MonolithicKernel.html">MonolithicKernel</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given the criticism that <a href="MonolithicKernel.html">MonolithicKernel</a> is less flexible, less portable, and is error-prone, <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a> has become popular, mostly in academic circles. <a href="MonolithicKernel.html">MonolithicKernel</a>, though, is much easier to implement and shows better runtime performance than <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a> based on <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a>. That's why many working <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a> today still use classic <a href="MonolithicKernel.html">MonolithicKernel</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Correct me if I'm wrong, but I've read somewhere that </em><a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a> performs slower only because on x86 the ContextSwitch is so expensive. On a PowerPC it's cheap (something to do with the amount of registers and rename registers, etc?) so <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a> works much better on it. <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a> is more dynamic (think upgrading some service without rebooting), has better error tolerance (restart a crashed service), and reduces system-wide stalls (things that don't <strong>have to</strong> be in the kernel are in multitasking processes), so speed on x86 is the only reason for the success of <a href="MonolithicKernel.html">MonolithicKernel</a>. AFAIK?<em></em>
