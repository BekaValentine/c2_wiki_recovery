        Best Alternative To Negotiated Agreement
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the key concepts in the book <a href="GettingToYes.html">GettingToYes</a> is the "BATNA" or <a href="BestAlternativeToNegotiatedAgreement.html">BestAlternativeToNegotiatedAgreement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An extreme example of a BATNA comes from Carl Hiassen's novel Native Tongue.  A mob informant is just about to effect his escape with a suitcase full of cash, when he meets up with the hit man the mob has sent to kill him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Informant: "See this suitcase full of cash?  If you let me go, it's yours."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hit Man: "It's mine if I don't."
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, shooting the informant and taking the money is the <a href="BestAlternativeToNegotiatedAgreement.html">BestAlternativeToNegotiatedAgreement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the best ways to improve the outcome of negotiations is improve your BATNA.  For example, if the informant also had a gun, the hit man might be willing to negotiate to avoid getting killed himself.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the job hunting world, ways to improve your BATNA include improving your skills, making your resume more <a href="BuzzwordCompliant.html">BuzzwordCompliant</a>, and finally having <a href="MoreThanOneOffer.html">MoreThanOneOffer</a>.

        Only having multiple offers fits as BATNA.  BATNA is your "walk-away" alternative.  Improving your skills and adding buzzwords improve your trading, but offer nothing in the case of walking away.  Having a second offer does.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="MoreThanOneOffer.html">MoreThanOneOffer</a> is the result (a better BATNA).  Improving your skills is one of many ways to reach that better BATNA. -- JB<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Being reasonably content with your current position is also a BATNA. You don't have to job search when you don't <em>need</em> a job. That way, if the offer you get isn't good enough, you just stay put.
