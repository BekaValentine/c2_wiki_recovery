        An employee of <a href="GeneralPhysics.html">GeneralPhysics</a> (as opposed to GeneralDynamics or GeneralTsosChicken).
      </p>
      <p>
        I mostly work with <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> development tools, including <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>, <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, <a href="ActiveServerPages.html">ActiveServerPages</a>, and <a href="VisualBasicDotNet.html">VisualBasicDotNet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had much success applying <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> to these tools, but still run into a bind applying unit testing to GUI's.  Putting everything into objects helps (Forms in both <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> and <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> are a flavor of class module), but there are some quirks that makes doing this difficult.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have a testing framework for VBA (i.e. Access) I'm dying to integrate it into my development efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Working with <a href="VisualStudioDotNet.html">VisualStudioDotNet</a> is such a joy; things like inheritance, more consistent syntax, and the fact that it's much more of an object-oriented language than the old Visual Basic make it a great pleasure to work with.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that there are very good unit test frameworks for it are a point in its favor too.
