        Orders Of Ignorance
      </h1>
      <p>
        From Communications of the ACM - October 2000, Volume 43, Issue 10:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           0th Order Ignorance: Lack of Ignorance. I have 0OI when I (probably) know something.
        </li>
        <li>
           1st Order Ignorance: Lack of Knowledge. I have 1OI when I don't know something. With 1OI we have the question in a well-factored form.
        </li>
        <li>
           2nd Order Ignorance: Lack of Awareness. I have 2OI when I don't know that I don't know something.
        </li>
        <li>
           3rd Order Ignorance: Lack of Process. I have 3OI when I don't know a suitably efficient way to find out I don't know that I don't know something.
        </li>
        <li>
           4th Order Ignorance: Meta-ignorance. I have 4OI when I don't know about the Five Orders of Ignorance.
        </li>

        The various orders of ignorance can be seen as increasing levels of Risk. Various techniques of knowledge acquisition can be categorized as targeted toward reducing Nth order ignorance to N-1 for some fixed number N. For example, some might regard <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s as a way of reducing 1st order ignorance to 0th order ignorance. A successful test shows you something that you didn't know about either the code you wrote, or what that code was supposed to do (or where). <em>(I would be inclined to regard </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s as a way of reducing 1st order ignorance to knowledge. Or is 0th order supposed to be 'you know something'?)<em></em>

        <a href="TomDeMarco.html">TomDeMarco</a> says something like (paraphrasing): it isn't what you don't know that causes trouble, it is what you are absolutely sure is true (but isn't) that you have to worry about. I think this is a variation on the 4th order.

        Is Ignorance really this orderly? ;) Let's separate being ignorant from our attitudes about ignorance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Attitudes fall into a continuum with:
      </p>
      <p>
        At one end, "I am not ignorant!" (I can't accept being ignorant).
      </p>
      <p>
        And at the other, "I understand ignorance is part of the human condition" (I accept that no one person can know everything-even about a single topic!).
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the "orders" are more like a process.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You want to solve a problem but are unaware that there is knowledge that would help.
        </li>
        <li>
           You have a sense that there must be something that will help, but you are unaware of where to find it.
        </li>
        <li>
           You know where it is, but you do not have access to it.
        </li>
        <li>
           You have access to it, but do not understand how to make it work.
        </li>
        <li>
           You get it to work, but find out that it is not what you thought.
        </li>
      </ul>

        One positive aspect of ignorance is expressed in the quote:
        <em>Ignorance is fixable, stupidity is forever</em>

        This all reminds me of the <a href="CapabilityMaturityModel.html">CapabilityMaturityModel</a> somehow...

        "If knowledge is the contrary of ignorance... and knowledge is power... then ignorance is lack of power?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Simplified yes. But knowledge 'is' not power (i.e. a synonym or identity). But more like knowledge 'leads-to' power. And 'not' or 'contrary' doesn't distribute over 'leads-to' I guess.
