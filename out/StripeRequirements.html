        Stripe Requirements
      </h1>
      <p>
        You're mucking out a <a href="CodeSewer.html">CodeSewer</a> by <a href="TestInjection.html">TestInjection</a>. And the reason you're there is they want you to add new functionality to the sewer! They hand you a phone-book-sized functional spec and say, "there you go, boy/girl, just tack that on the side the same as usual". You realize this is how the <a href="CodeSewer.html">CodeSewer</a> was generated in the first place ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="StripeRequirements.html">StripeRequirements</a>. Require the requirement originators to enable high quality by either generating <a href="FitTest.html">FitTest</a>s themselves, or paying analysts to do it. Make 'em understand that YouDontPayForQuality - which is to say, it'll be quicker and cost less to do it this way. If there's <a href="OldGuardDeveloper.html">OldGuardDeveloper</a>s hanging around objecting, challenge 'em to a CodeRace against the <a href="NewGuardDeveloper.html">NewGuardDeveloper</a>s for some <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>. That'll shut 'em up. This is especially good fun when the old guard are DBAs ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Have the analysts cover the spec with these tests referring to whatever big-ass models they like. Wikify this if they'll cooperate. Ignore the big-ass models completely except as a generator of disambiguating questions and further <a href="FitTest.html">FitTest</a>s. Now engage the <a href="GoalDonor.html">GoalDonor</a>s in the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> and away you go.
