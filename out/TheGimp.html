        The Gimp is more than good enough if you do RGB work.

        <em>For web imaging, </em><a href="TheGimp.html">TheGimp</a> for windows runs <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> for real work on a Pentium 200mmx with 64megs of ram.  Despite being even more beta than the rest of <a href="TheGimp.html">TheGimp</a>, stability of the windows port hasn't been an issue with me.  <a href="TheGimp.html">TheGimp</a> is also nice at handling really large images.  I do wish it did CMYK though.<em></em>

        <strong>Discussion about Version 2.0 -- including scripting and plugins</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of <a href="TheGimp.html">TheGimp</a>'s functionality is implemented as scripts written in <a href="GuileScheme.html">GuileScheme</a>.  <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> scripts are also supported now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> support is different.  <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> are for doing plugin type scripts, not for general functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scheme is just used for plugin bindings also. Not much of the Gimp is really written in Scheme.  As of version 1.2, most of the really useful parts of the Gimp weren't plugins, and I doubt that they had anything to do with <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In version 2.0, there were several changes.  The first is more flexibility with color spaces.  Specifically, it handles 8, 16, 24 and 32 bit images, using both logarithmic and linear sampling, in multiple colors spaces like CMYK, RGB, and YUV.   
      </p>
      <p>
        Another v2.0 change was interactive tools (like new brushes, etc) being able to be added as plugins.  This means less work in adding any brush that you think is missing.
