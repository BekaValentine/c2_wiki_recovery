        Boy, I'm certainly not one.  My parents were certainly very un-geeky.

        I'm one.  My dad is and has been a Systems Analyst on various platforms, currently VMS and Oracle for a major Houston hospital chain.  I grew up going to work with dad and playing on the keypunch machines and coding BASIC on a CDC Cyber 170.  Once in a while dad would bring home the 300baud acoustic-coupled thermal paper terminal and we'd play <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a>.  Hmm, I'll bet if I looked I could find some long reams of old games, if they haven't fallen apart.

        My wife is a <a href="SecondGenerationGeek.html">SecondGenerationGeek</a>. Her father is a software engineer and her mother is a chemistry professor. Sometimes it's difficult being only a a FirstGenerationGeek (and a <a href="LateBloomer.html">LateBloomer</a> at that). Anyway, those who know us find it highly likely that when we have children, they will be <a href="ThirdGenerationGeeks.html">ThirdGenerationGeeks</a>.
