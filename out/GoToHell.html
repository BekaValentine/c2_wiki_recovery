        A tag used by Top to indicate things aren't going his way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, I can think of many good uses for this tag myself, and I'm sure that it is the same for others.  As for creating pages just to irritate Top, now I think that is pre-pubescent behavior.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And your point is...?  Actually, Top created the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>, I merely clicked on it. :)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          "pre-pubescent behavior"
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>At least playful rude is a break from rude rude sometimes. -t</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Yes, yes, I got that.  Your problem with it is...?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>If everyone behaved in this way, what would become of Wiki?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          It would become like the rest of the Internet.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>If I were human, I believe my response would be, </em><a href="GoToHell.html">GoToHell</a>.<em> -- Spock, </em>Star Trek: The Undiscovered Country.<em></em>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        It wouldn't be a bad alternative tag to <a href="SpaghettiCode.html">SpaghettiCode</a> or <a href="GotoConsideredHarmful.html">GotoConsideredHarmful</a>... right up there with <a href="DllHell.html">DllHell</a>, <a href="RpmHell.html">RpmHell</a>, <a href="ClasspathHell.html">ClasspathHell</a>
