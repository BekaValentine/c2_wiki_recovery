        How To Annoy Users
      </h1>
      <p>
        Beginning with "Evil DUG's Top Ten Ways to Annoy Users". Remember to reverse the slant of the helpful stuff here. The goal is to <em>annoy</em> the users, not let them out of our trap...

      <ul>
        <li>
           Lose the user's work
          <ul>
            <li>
               Crashing or quiting loses all open pages, no <a href="TransparentPersistence.html">TransparentPersistence</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               Accidental deletes can't be reversed
            </li>
            <li>
               Incompatible data formats across versions, without a converter between formats
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Put text on the screen (e.g. in an error message) which the user can't copy to the clipboard as text (to paste it elsewhere)
        </li>
        <li>
           Make copy & paste not work
        </li>
        <li>
           Lose custom settings when upgrading versions.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Bonus points for hiding the file that remembers the settings or putting them in binary, so I can't just copy from it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Lose plugins when upgrading versions.  Bonus points if the plug-ns are compatible with the new version, but the application didn't re-install them for the user.  Other bonus points if the current plug-ins aren't compatible.  More bonus points if the user has to re-download the plugins even when they are compatible.
        </li>
        <li>
           Have multiple different mechanisms for "loading" code/applications. Only track changes from <em>some</em> of them.
          <ul>
            <li>
               For example, <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> doesn't keep track of parcels loaded the same way it keeps track of filed in or manually changed code. Good luck remembering which parcels you had loaded in your last image. And the reason why it doesn't keep track of loaded parcels is because code changes due to them would overwhelm manual code changes. And the reason why is because it doesn't aggregate code changes to the natural "one explicit user action triggered all this" granularity. Yuck.

            <li>
               Lose all forward information when the user explores an alternate path from a previous page (ie, implement history as a stack instead of as a <a href="CactusStack.html">CactusStack</a>)

      <ul>
        <li>
           Add a lot of confirmation dialogs everywhere (instead of undo functionality)
          <ul>
            <li>
               Make the most critical ones <em>backwards</em> from the rest, so that when I am in a hurry and realize that I've made a mistake, I accidentally confirm the critical operation that I wanted to cancel.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Incompatible data formats across versions, <em>with</em> a converter between formats
          <ul>
            <li>
               Extra points if it most be invoked separately by the user.  Even more if it's an expensive add-on.  Even more if it's only one-way (to your format).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Deviate from established standards and conventions
          <ul>
            <li>
               Use fancy widgets instead of native widgets for no good reason
            </li>
            <li>
               Don't use command-line parameters to set options
            </li>
            <li>
               Extra points if you're deviating from the standard you're establishing!
              <ul>
                <li>
                   for example, Smalltalk's add: doesn't return the receiver but the argument of the message
                </li>
                <li>
                   similarly, OrderedCollections don't automatically copy over instance variables when they grow (breaking the "carefree extensibility" standard which ST users know and love)
                </li>

            </li>
          </ul>

        <li>
           Have the user confirm or explicitly perform automatic operations
          <ul>
            <li>
               "saving" a file; no <a href="TransparentPersistence.html">TransparentPersistence</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               in Smalltalk, adding a new>>^super new initialize everywhere instead of having a single such method in Object and an empty initialize there
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Make sure you have to re-install the application via the GUI-based installer on every computer I want to use it on, even if it's a simple application that shouldn't need to monkey around with system settings.  Don't let me just copy the installation directory to another computer (or, god forbid, just share the installation directory over a network).
          <ul>
            <li>
               Of course, on many systems there <em>is</em> no such thing as an app-specific installation directory--executables go in /usr/bin, libraries go in /usr/lib, etc.  And in the Windows world; dang near <em>everything</em> that could be considered configuration information goes in the registry--whether it affects the OS or not.  This is an example of the <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a> at work, as we have two separation classification criteria for files (what application, and what type of file) which should be given equal weight, but one is given preference because the hierarchical filesystem forces a choice.
            </li>
            <li>
               On my Linux box, I often put applications /usr/local/<app> (e.g. perl in /usr/local/perl), then create a link from the "standard" location (/usr/local/bin/perl) to my chosen location (/usr/local/perl/bin/perl).
            </li>
            <li>
               Yeah, see Create More Work For Users.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Require the user to resolve dependencies between shared libraries and other third-party software components/frameworks/tools/etc.  Especially on an OS which handles the task poorly.  (See <a href="DllHell.html">DllHell</a>, <a href="RpmHell.html">RpmHell</a>)

        <li>
           No uninstaller for the application
        </li>
        <li>
           Permit complex actions without undo or a reversing path
          <ul>
            <li>
               Let the user close a browser window with 10 open pages, but not unclose it
            </li>
            <li>
               Use confirmation dialogs instead of undo commands.  If the user clicked "Okay" even for the 500th time, he must really mean it.  He can fix it if he got it wrong.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Do something irreversible based on part of the parameters given to an operation, then fail when another parameter causes a problem.  Bonus points if it's simply a number that's too large for the program to handle.

            </li>
            <li>
               prevent the user from closing the application (other than via brute force methods like "End Task" in Windows Task Manager, or "kill -9" in Unix)

        <li>
           Make sure your dialog box jumps out in front of the window I am typing into.  Bonus points if you can do it just before I hit Enter, and your dialog OKs something destructive by default.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make windows that have widgets that could reasonably be stretched (such as text entries), and allow the main window to be stretched, but don't actually stretch the widgets.  (In other words, the "background" of the window grows)

                   Acceptable if it is clear that it is a possibility:  a combination of computing from task complete + growing bars + clear notice that it is unbounded would be quite appropriate.  An exponential decay is not.

                <li>
                   Yes, but that's kind of excusable because they are file / directory names -- the server doesn't know that they are supposed to be numeric.  I was thinking about applications that auto-number things (or require you to enter numeric data), but then in the GUI they are sorted alphabetically.  That's inexcusable.

        <li>
           Use of 2nd and higher mouse buttons for anything other than what the system prescribes (i.e context-sensitive menus)
        </li>
        <li>
           Loud, annoying alert tones, espcially for conditions that do not require a user's attention.
        </li>
        <li>
           Flashing messages--or flashing anything (other than games or places where flashing is appropriate).
        </li>
        <li>
           Similar commands or gestures associated with radically different actions
          <ul>

               bonus points if one is common and the other is irreversibly destructive
              <ul>
                <li>
                   for example, refresh page vs close page in <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a>.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Picklist widgets for long lists that:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Don't let you type-ahead to jump to the entry you want
            </li>
            <li>
               Are badly presented (see Bad Presentation)
            </li>
            <li>
               Do something obnoxious if the list is longer than the application window (early X apps were nasty about this).
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Numeric entry widgets, especially for potentially large quantities, which consist only of an up/down control rather than a text-entry window.
        </li>
        <li>
           Requiring the user enter numbers (or other codes) for quantities which aren't numbers.  Many PointOfSale systems are infamous for this.  (Function key shortcuts are OK)
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Do not use databases</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Oh, no, you shouldn't. You should save your data all over the place in carefully crafted ad-hoc file formats, accessed by your stupid libraries (let alone object serialization). So that if your application crashes, not only that it may loose current work, but it may not be able to restart at all, and the user can't do too much about it either. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LotusNotes.html">LotusNotes</a> message to user after crashing, on the next attempt to start the program: "Unable to open desktop file. Notes may have terminated abnormally in an earlier session. Please log off or shutdwon the operating system nefore running Notes again." This is the amongst most insulting message I've experienced as a user.

        <strong>Miscellaneous</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Solve the wrong problem. (Sorting features in order of technical risk, and infrequent releases, help this one).
        </li>
        <li>
           Rely on marketing to advertise your wares to their <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a>es.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make sure there are a lot of automatic operations, especially if they introduce gaping security holes.
        </li>
        <li>
           Do not match the user's workflow (especially true of custom business software, where the <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> should be able to make sure that it does).
        </li>
        <li>
           Put arbitrary limits on numbers of things, e.g. 256 columns of data in a spreadsheet.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Bonus points if the limit is there to get you to spend $$$ to make it go away.
            </li>
          </ul>

        This page is getting pretty big and reorganizing it only made it easier for people to add even more stuff to it. I'd like to split it up into smaller pages. Personally, I like HowToWasteUsersTime and HowToInflictPainToUsers.

        <em>I don't think it's that big yet.  The re-organization just prompted 3 or so people to add a lot of things all at once.  Maybe it has died down now.</em>
