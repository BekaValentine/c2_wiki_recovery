        Also a Unix <a href="MagicNumber.html">MagicNumber</a>. The first line of most perl scripts reads
      </p>
      <p>
        #!/bin/perl

        and likewise for scripts written for bash, Python, and so on.

        The <strong>#!</strong> (pronounced <a href="SheBang.html">SheBang</a> which is short for sharp-bang) tells the kernel what kind of executable program this is; the text up to the next newline specify the interpreter program to be executed, with the filename of the script as the next commandline argument. Since # begins a comment in many scripting languages (the Unix shells, tcl, Perl, Python, ...), the magic number line will be ignored by the interpreter program.

        Well, I guess that is the whole shebang! :-)

        My theory about the <strong>whole </strong><a href="SheBang.html">SheBang</a><strong> is that it tries to reference the </strong><a href="WholeShillelagh.html">WholeShillelagh</a>; Google can find the word out there at <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=shillelagh">http://www.google.com/search?q=shillelagh</a> and can define the word in three ways: <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Ashillelagh.">http://www.google.com/search?q=define%3Ashillelagh.</a>

        I have enough trouble trying to spell it - there may be many variations, so I might have just written the Whole <a href="SheBang.html">SheBang</a> after having given up. -- <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a> <a href="HappyNewYear.html">HappyNewYear</a> <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a>

        Hash-pling - I will need to remember this for when I need to give someone an interview. Although I should change it to "octo-pling", short for "octothorpe"-pling. "What does the octopling do at the start of a script?" The answer is irrelevant of course; only their reaction to an unfamiliar term would be. -- SamuelFalvo
