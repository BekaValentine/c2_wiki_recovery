        I code. I code in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> and PostscriptLanguage and many others, too. I detest languages (like <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>) which encourage overloading what appear to be cheap primitives with very expensive operations.

        After reading <a href="ProgrammingIsMoreThanCoding.html">ProgrammingIsMoreThanCoding</a>, I would like to say that I am not just a coder. I actually enjoy design more than I enjoy the mechanics of coding. Having said that, I also will say that I am a <a href="LanguageLawyer.html">LanguageLawyer</a>, ala Brooks' <a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a>... although lately I've been acting as a team lead responsible for delegating designs to other coders, too. There's just not enough time in the day for me to be a <a href="LoneRanger.html">LoneRanger</a>.

        I'm more inclined to <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> than XP. That's probably due to my background in computational theory and compilers.

        I live near Seattle.

        I semi-organize weekly movie viewings at one of a set of local (eastside) theaters, each Monday night around 7:00. As a result, I've started contributing to <a href="MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts.html">MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts</a>. If you're near Kirkland, and are interested in seeing a selection of movies leaning towards the action/thriller side of the offerings (though the occasional drama or other oddity creeps in), feel free to contact me (popiel@wolfskeep.com) and I'll put you on the mailing list.

        My latest bit of fun has been with a MigratoryMemoryManager for PennMUSH which takes advantage of some of PennMUSH's behavioral quirks to drastically reduce the amount of storage overhead. Whee!

        Following the examples of some other people, I think I'll be stopping by here on my way to <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> or <a href="http:quickChanges?days=1.">http:quickChanges?days=1.</a> If you have comments or question for me, feel free to put them here, and I'll likely answer on my way to other reading. ;-)
