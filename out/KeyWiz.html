        Key Wiz
      </h1>
      <p>
        I also found a fantastic Emacs game today, called keywiz. It's a quiz game that prints a function name and its documentation, and challenges you to enter a key sequence that's bound to it. You answer as many questions as you can within a time limit, and each time you get one wrong it prints what the binding is. I've been playing with it this morning and already learned a whole lot of new and useful commands that I'd never heard of before!
