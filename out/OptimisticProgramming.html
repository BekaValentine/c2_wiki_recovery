        XP is human-centered and takes advantage of the intelligence and responsibility of programmers in ways that heavyweight methodologies, with their emphasis on an archaic <a href="ImpressionOfControl.html">ImpressionOfControl</a>, can't. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OptimisticProgramming.html">OptimisticProgramming</a> pushes this human-centering to an extreme.

        Imagine an equilibrium situation: a happy company that is a leader in its field, that has no dissatisfied internal or external users demanding new products/tools or competitors breathing down its neck. Such an equilibrium has a half-life of picoseconds. Something always comes along - a competitive product, a new <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> - that disturbs the calm. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of <a href="OptimisticProgramming.html">OptimisticProgramming</a> is to restore the calm. It adds a new role - bodhisattva. The bodhisattva's responsibilities are the union of those of the Chinese <a href="SonOfHeaven.html">SonOfHeaven</a> (be the still center) and the princess of <a href="ThePrincessAndThePea.html">ThePrincessAndThePea</a> (detect the slightest disturbance).

        Wow - it's been more than six weeks since I've seen this page. And I know who LazyGnome is, thanks to the last edit thingy. Thanks - I did link. But this page deserves massive refactoring by an older and wiser (not sadder, though) programmer with more XP experience under my belt.

      </p>
      <p>
        Your bodhisattva should have all the qualifications for a good <a href="ExtremeProgrammer.html">ExtremeProgrammer</a>. I believe that would screen out the unenlightened slob. And remember - it's a role, not a person, so rotation within the team is a reasonable approach.

      <p>
        Something has slipped a cog here ... if you are a great <a href="ExtremeProgrammer.html">ExtremeProgrammer</a>, you are engaged in bodhisattva activity, no ifs and or buts. As for "being" or "not being" a bodhisattva, what can I say except "noun-centric language sucks". Bodhisattvahood is all about a mode or way or attitude or orientation or intention. When I believe that my benefit will be maximized (remember "pursuit of happiness") by the well being of those around me, e.g. the project unfolds well, intelligently, giving rise to more realistic self-esteem and more grounded understanding, then I'll be oriented in a way that will move me to adopt <strong>whatever</strong> methodology with diligent engagement and in a co-operative mood.

        Ben - yeah. I'll have more to say about competition vs. teamwork soon in the skunkworks. Thanks to Social Darwinism, people confuse competition with progress. Progress based on teamwork is exemplified not only in meme exchange among "higher" animals, but plasmid exchange among bacteria. Bodhisattvation (closer to a verb?) is the simplest thing that could possibly work. -- tr

        Ouch! This page is about the details of a particular kind of "compromise."  It's not reinventing the general concept of compromising. Please elaborate.

        I read your comment to mean that compromise is bad and that MP is a dilution of XP - and unoriginal to boot.  I don't believe that compromise is bad, nor that the term applies to this page, nor that MP is a dilution of XP.

        For me, what's original and shockingly brilliant about XP is that it is human-centered, which in its first cut means client- and developer-centered.

        One goal of OP is to extend the concept of "human" in XP to include managers. The word <strong>Extreme</strong> is great marketing - to developers! - but I'm sure it frightens off management. Hence <strong>Optimistic</strong>. -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a>

        <em>Tom, you say that you want to extend the concept of "human" in XP to include managers.  That's a worthwhile goal: I feel that XP breaks down at the borders of the programming team.

        Jim - it's a fair cop, but society's to blame (<a href="http://wuzzle.org/python/bishop.html).">http://wuzzle.org/python/bishop.html).</a> I don't have experience with XP (except for some <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>-disguised-as-mentoring and JUnit on my own personal projects). And I may never get it if I don't figure out a way to introduce it on a project like the one I'm on now, where nobody has any knowledge of it and RUP is the coming thing. I've looked at some of the ... compromises?/adaptations? ... of XP to RUP (suggested to me on my homepage, q.v.), but they don't fit my situation.

        This page started out as a wannabe Olympian theoretical synthesis. That was ridiculous, and it deserves not only the NIH epithet, but  a charge of arrogance. Right now I'm creeping along low to the ground. But I stand by the term "moderate". If all I have to offer is the claim that the name itself reflects a snubbing of management, so be it. There will always be XP projects when gurus like Ward and Kent and Ron hook up with extraordinary managers. I just don't expect to find them.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be a long time before I can make a claim to having anything provably useful. Meanwhile, if the Wiki decides this page should go for whatever reason, it will, and I won't complain. -- tr

        Tom, what are your thoughts on why you decided to change the name from moderate to optimistic? -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Optimism seems to me to be intrinsic to XP. Kent and other XP proponents talk about various practices of traditional methodologies as based on fear [if you find the links, put 'em here]. Optimism is the opposite of fear: we believe we'll be able to solve tomorrow's problems tomorrow.  An action taken without faith that it will be successful is like a pulled punch - it loses its energy. Optimism is the natural mental state for action.

        <strong>Moderate</strong> was simply a kneejerk reaction to <strong>extreme</strong>. -- tr
