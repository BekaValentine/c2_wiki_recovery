        I run a server that is a little like storybase. To keep things simple I made it completely open. That is,
        anyone can modify any page any time. I figured it would last a few months before someone came in
        and trashed it.

        Well it hasn't happened yet. In fact an interesting conversational style has evolved. One asks a
        question by stating part of an answer. Someone will notice the omission and fill in the rest. A third
        party may not even notice that a dialog is in progress.

        It takes visitors a while to overcome their shyness and self doubt. Then they find themselves looking
        at a well known author's grammatical mistake and they think: gee I could fix that; yea, I'll just fix that;
        there, I fixed it; it reads much better now; I have value too.
      </p>

        There lies the hook. Closed pages may convince the reader that the writer is smart. But open pages
        can convince the reader that he himself is smart.

        And a reader who is smart, may discover the book has been open along. She/he never realized that
        the value in smartness lies in the ability to recognize openness.

        I've seen a comment on the net to the effect that "The best way to get good information from the
        net is to post bad information -- you'll get corrected, vehemently, even abusively, but if you can
        put that aside, you've got the information you wanted far more effectively than just asking a
        question." Maybe it's something about the way we're schooled, that encourages us to make such
        corrections...

        In the spirit of this pattern,
        I've tried to repair the misspelling
        of the title
        and a few other spelling mistakes.
        The <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> makes it easy to know
        what words are misspelled,
        but doesn't make the mistakes easy to find!

        The fear of falling into the abyss keeps us from recognizing the value of openness. I admire this little program for challenging us to fill the void.  It has a fresh IHaventThoughtThroughAllTheProblemsYet feel to it. All power to it.  AStoryAStory roared the crowd . . . well maybe later . . .

        What a wonderfully odd thing, this Wikiweb.  So sprawling and hard to understand.  I wonder if it could be used by writing students.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a doubt. In fact the use of the Wiki in Education could be the next really big thing in WikiEvolution.

        <em>used by writing students</em> -- yes, poetry and fiction writers are already using the <a href="http://WriteHere.net/">http://WriteHere.net/</a> wiki.
