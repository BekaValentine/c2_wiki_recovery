        Composed Method

      <p>
        This is a pattern from <a href="SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns.html">SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns</a> by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Divide your program into methods that perform one identifiable task.  Keep all of the operations in a method at the same level of abstraction.  This will naturally result in programs with many small methods, each a few lines long.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        When you use <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a> a bunch of times on a method the original method becomes a <a href="ComposedMethod.html">ComposedMethod</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="ComposedMethod.html">ComposedMethod</a> is NOT a synonym for <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So the key difference is keeping all the operations in a method at the same level of abstraction? I can see where that might involve more than just a simple method refactoring. You might even generate whole new classes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ComposedMethod.html">ComposedMethod</a> then would be what you have after the code has been refactored mercilessly, whether the refactorings are <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a>, <a href="ExtractClass.html">ExtractClass</a>, something else or some combination thereof.
      </p>

      <p>
        On loose rule of thumb I've heard regarding this is that: If your description of what the method does uses the word "and" [at the top level], then it's doing two things (the two clauses the "and" links) and ought to be decomposed.
