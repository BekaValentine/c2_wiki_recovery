        Fear Of The Unknown
      </h1>
      <p>
        Rather than addressing the unknown, <a href="FearOfTheUnknown.html">FearOfTheUnknown</a> is often the result of focusing on the fear.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is normal to question new practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        In software development, often a quick experiment would change the fear into a solvable known quantity almost immediately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes the fear is rational, sometimes not. <a href="FearOfTheUnknown.html">FearOfTheUnknown</a> often manifests as paralysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than taking a look at what is actually causing the fear, <a href="FearOfTheUnknown.html">FearOfTheUnknown</a> often results in <a href="IfItIsWorkingDontChange.html">IfItIsWorkingDontChange</a> (See also <a href="IfItAintBrokeDontFixIt.html">IfItAintBrokeDontFixIt</a>).

        This is a TriteExpression.
