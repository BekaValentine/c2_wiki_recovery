If bad (<em>or good</em>) things are said (or done) to you, you say (or do) bad (<em>or good</em>) things in return. <a href="PrisonersDilemma.html">PrisonersDilemma</a> explores the <a href="GameTheory.html">GameTheory</a> involved. This page is about the bad things to say, when such are needed.

               High time to change that ...
            </li>
            <li>
               How horrible!
            </li>
            <li>
               So when did you stop beating your wife?
