        <strong>Introduction</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I just read a good interview with Matz <em>(</em><a href="YukihiroMatsumoto.html">YukihiroMatsumoto</a>)<em>, and found a paragraph to keep in mind when discussing </em><a href="PythonVsRuby.html">PythonVsRuby</a> and other language <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Instead of emphasizing the what, I want to emphasize the how part: how we feel while programming. That's Ruby's main difference from other language designs. I emphasize the feeling, in particular, how I feel using Ruby. I didn't work hard to make Ruby perfect for everyone, because you feel differently from me. No language can be perfect for everyone. I tried to make Ruby perfect for me, but maybe it's not perfect for you. The perfect language for <a href="GuidoVanRossum.html">GuidoVanRossum</a> is probably Python. -- <a href="YukihiroMatsumoto.html">YukihiroMatsumoto</a> [<a href="http://www.artima.com/intv/ruby.html]">http://www.artima.com/intv/ruby.html]</a></dd>

      <p>
        <strong>Overview</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Both languages are <a href="HighLevel.html">HighLevel</a>, <a href="GarbageCollected.html">GarbageCollected</a>, and <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a>. Both provide an interactive shell, standard libraries, and persistence support.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reader should be warned that many comments on this page come from people who know only one of the two languages - not both.
      </p>
      <p>
        So far Pythonistas have emphasized their language's <em>ease through consistency</em>, extensive libraries, docs, etc, and argued that Ruby's advantages in elegance are overstated or nonexistent. Rubyists have stressed their language's <em>ease through conceptual elegance</em>, slightly greater depth of OO, the power of <a href="BlocksInRuby.html">BlocksInRuby</a>, and the nice feeling you get from doing things the <a href="RubyWay.html">RubyWay</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few others have objected that the whole idea of being a "fan" or "-ist" of a language is very silly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Interestingly, those who raise this objection tend to come down on the </em><a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> side. Perhaps this indicates a fundamental difference in the philosophy and target audience of the two languages?<em> -- </em><a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is a very silly assumption, which is indeed incorrect based on arbitrary perception. I like Ruby, have never in person talked to someone who codes solely in python, and personally do not code in Python because I needed an OOP approach finally - but being a fan or ist for anything is really stupid.  You go for something because you like this or that way, BUT the ultimate way is how YOU think, not how any language thinks about a particular problem</em> -- Shev
      </p>
      <p>
        How could a such a non-partisan be on the "<a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> side"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Probably because Python came first for them and they feel that Python is practical enough to not warrant switching sides.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For an excellent discussion of the issues by <a href="AlexMartelli.html">AlexMartelli</a>, one of the big lights in the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> community, see:  <a href="http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bhqr78021hp%40enews1.newsguy.com">http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=bhqr78021hp%40enews1.newsguy.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't agree that that's an "excellent" discussion by any means.  Being quite deeply into Ruby myself, it's easy to see that Martelli doesn't know what he's talking about.  The key point is when he's talking about method call syntax in both languages, and complains that Ruby allows "implicit" calls to methods (that is, calling a nullary method doesn't require parentheses).  There is a very good reason why Ruby's syntax works the way it does: all external access to objects is done through methods.  Ruby doesn't have distinct attribute reference and method call syntaxes.  foo.bar always means "send the message bar to the object that's the value of foo.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I believe that you missed the point: he was arguing that having foo.bar always send message bar to object foo is in his opinion a misfeature, but that he can see that others disagree.  I happen to agree: having foo.bar mean a reference to the message bar and foo.bar() mean calling bar is useful, rather than needing to use the extra syntax Ruby requires.  Reasonable folks can disagree, of course.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think you are reading way too much into what Martelli actually says in that paragraph.  He calls this a "syntax" issue, and compares it to minor syntactic differences between C and Pascal or VB.  It is in fact a really fundamental difference in the </em>'semantics<strong> of objects in the languages: Ruby uses </strong>UniformityOfAccess to enforce encapsulation of object state.  If you want a "public instance variable" called bar, you define a private variable @bar, a getter method bar(), and a setter bar=().  foo.bar = 5 means foo.bar=(5).  If you want trivial, Ruby can define them for you.  If you change your mind later and want to make bar a computed property, you just define the methods explicitly.  In short, public instance variables are a misfeature.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As to first-classness of methods, you and Martelli are overestimating the syntactic overhead.  Ruby does have anonymous closures in the form of code blocks, so passing around bits of code is frankly much more convenient to do in Ruby than in Python.  If you spend some time writing and reading idiomatic Ruby, you'll find that there is hardly ever a need to refer to a method; almost every situation where you'd want to do that in Python, in Ruby you use a block.</em>

        <strong>Heritage and Philosophy</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> inherits from <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>. Therefore it believes in both <a href="EverythingIsAnObject.html">EverythingIsAnObject</a> and <a href="ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt.html">ThereIsMoreThanOneWayToDoIt</a>. <a href="BlocksInRuby.html">BlocksInRuby</a> allow the user a certain amount of flexibility in adding new control structure to the language, but not as much Smalltalk, let alone <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> and <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>. Like Smalltalk, lots of methods return self. Like Perl, it provides shortcuts.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> inherits from the <a href="AlgolFamily.html">AlgolFamily</a>, specifically the <a href="AbcLanguage.html">AbcLanguage</a> (a teaching language) and <a href="ModulaThree.html">ModulaThree</a>. It provides for objects and free functions and allows users to code without using objects if you want. It provides a fair number of features from the <a href="LispFamily.html">LispFamily</a>, especially for applying functions to lists. Modern Python <em>does</em> support <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s. Most recently Python has added iterators and generators (from <a href="IconLanguage.html">IconLanguage</a>), and <a href="ListComprehension.html">ListComprehension</a>s (from <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>). Python's core philosophy is that "There should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it." It's not an absolute restriction by any means. While there are always more than one way to write code, in Python it's usually (but not always) clear which one is the most idiomatic or "Pythonic."
      </p>
      <p>
        On the statement "Ruby tends to make more sense if you're from a <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> or <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> background":
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In Ruby, many methods return <em>self</em>, or a mutation thereof.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ruby supports the idea of method calls as messages. You can even do <em>object.send("methodname")</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           In Ruby, you've always been able to superclass [<em>you mean subclass?</em>--ErikRose] built-in types like strings and lists. Though today you can do that in Python, too.
          <ul>
            <li>
               No, actually he means superclass, although it's not strictly accurate. You can insert <em>modules</em> into classes (which are always open, so you can tinker with them at any time) which places a class-like-entity in the object's list of immediate parents. You cannot add Class-type parents to them. You can also open up instances of a class with a construct known as a metaclass. (Although that's a misnomer; the ruby community is currently working on naming those classes. "Eigenclass" is a popular term.)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Everything is a class.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ruby supports closures as a first-class data type with well-integrated syntax.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the statement "Python makes more sense if your background is in Algol68 derived languages (Java, C, etc.) and functional languages like Scheme":
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ListComprehension.html">ListComprehension</a>s [str(item) for item in myList] -> ['2', '4', '53']
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In ruby this is the map function:
      </p>
      <code>
        my_list.map{|item| item.to_s} => ['2', '4', '53']<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or more simply
      </p>
      <code>
        [2, 4, 53].map &:to_s #=> ["2", "4", "53"]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Python also supports the map function:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        map(str, myList) -> ['2', '4', '53']<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>However, list comprehensions are far more powerful, allowing "if" clauses and multiple for loops:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        [(x,y) for x in xrange(3) for y in xrange(3) if x != y] -> [(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You can do the same as above so:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = []<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          upto 2 do |i|
          <ol>
            <li>
              upto 2 do |j|
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        a << [i,j] if i != j<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (a different approach is discussed on <a href="PythonVsRubyCodeExamples.html">PythonVsRubyCodeExamples</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        or with a fewer chars:
      </p>
      <code>
        a=[];0.upto(2){|i|0.upto(2){|j|a<<[i,j] if i!=j}}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or even more simply:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = []<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          times{|x| 3.times{|y| a << [x,y] if x != y }}
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In every case, a = [[0, 1], [0, 2], [1, 0], [1, 2], [2, 0], [2, 1]]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Here's Python's equivalent:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        a = []<br/>
        for x in range(3):<br/>
        for y in range(3):<br/>
        if x != y: <br/>
        a += [(x,y)]	<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>List comprehensions are clearly better for this kind of thing, however.  Removing useful whitespace and jamming a bunch of code points together to save space is no saving if the result is unreadable.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Be as it may, the python code above is not very communicative of it's intent, that is, it does not clearly indicate that it is generating the permutations of digits from 0 to 2, ignoring permutations where both elements are equal. Contrast with following ruby code.
      </p>
      <p>
        a = (0..2).to_a.permutation(2).reject { |x| x[0] == x[1] }
      </p>
      <p>
        --Saager
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Python has a permutation function as well.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>a = filter(lambda x:x[0]!=x[1], permutations(range(2)))</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Could be even simplier.</em>
        <em>a=permutations(range(3),2)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>>>> print list(a)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[(0, 1), (0, 2), (1, 0), (1, 2), (2, 0), (2, 1)]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A notable difference is that the Ruby code needs to use ".to_a", because .permutation is a method on array objects, and range objects don't have an equivalent method.  In contrast, the Python functions work on any iterable -- including user-defined ones.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruby philosopy is also the OO idea of telling the object to do something, instead of doing something with the object. So you don't do string(10) but 10.to_s. -- Brian
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not quite sure what this is meant to prove... Python's "str" is a class, so str(9) instantiates an object of class str, which determines what to do with the integer parameter "9".  Even if str were a function, would it matter?  [Yes, I realise that in ruby to_s is a method of object, but...] There are advantages to using foo(blah) over blah.to_foo(), namely that if blah is missing to_foo(), you have to go and add one in, whereas foo(blah) can easily provide default behaviour without having to modify your parent class.  Python objects have hooks (for example, 1.4.__str__()) for object conversion/behaviour, and heavily discourage on-the-fly modification without subclassing.  It's one of those schisms that keeps Python Python and Ruby Ruby, despite any talk that </em><a href="PythonAndRubyAreConverging.html">PythonAndRubyAreConverging</a> ;-).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As the previous paragraph says, str(object) calls the __str__() method of object. "str" is really a class, and "object" is the argument of its constructor. I realized how handy subclassing str (or the other builtins) is for tweaking how an object acts. For example, I recently needed to change the behavior of the dict (Python's hash type) to return False when a given key wasn't present in the dictionary. I just subclassed it and changed the behavior of its __getitem__(self, key) method. The resulting class acted exactly like a dictionary, except for the one difference I wanted. According to this article, Ruby also allows subclassing of builtins. Does it allow changing of the behavior of the objects, as opposed to just overriding regular methods?
      </p>
      <p>
        To the previous paragraph: since objects are only interacted with via methods, overriding any methods WILL change the behavior of those objects.  Also, in Ruby, you can change the behavior of an object without having to subclass it.  For example, if you wanted to modify the behavior of all hashes in your code, without going through and changing every hash instantiation using hash literals to use a subclass instead, you could instead modify the Hash class itself.
      </p>
      <code>
        class Hash<br/>
        alias get []<br/>
        def [] param<br/>
        get param or false<br/>
        end<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>

        On the other hand, note that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Nearly everything in Python is an object/class instance -- including classes and the primitive types (ints, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
           You can inherit from Python's built-in types (which now include a Smalltalk-type root Object) 
        </li>
        <li>
           Lambdas are avoided in modern Python. In most contexts they provide no gain over named functions. <em>This is the heart of the disagreement.  Ruby calls lambdas "blocks" (like Smalltalk), and considers them just about the most important feature of a language; it's these that let us create new control stuctures, instead of only being able to hook existing ones, as in Python.</em> -- Note that Python simply doesn't use closures for things like loops, and many "novel" control structures can be phrased in terms of loops.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="BlocksInRuby.html">BlocksInRuby</a> also provide support for <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Python distinguishes between statements and expressions, and it does not automatically return the last expressions evaluated in a method/function, which makes it slightly more awkward for <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>.  <em>A None (null) return value is generally intended to indicate that the function/method has a side effect; avoiding implicitly returned values makes it explicit what the programmer intended to return from the function.</em> (Which is perfectly in line with Zen of Python's, "Explicit is better than Implicit")
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Python provides for objects and free functions and allows users to code without using objects.</em> Not really. The truth is far more interesting: in Python everything is an object, but a good deal of cleverness has gone into making it so that you don't need to care that this is true, depending on what you're doing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe, but I don't see what this buys you. The Python language reference (</em><a href="http://www.python.org/doc/current/ref/ref.html)">http://www.python.org/doc/current/ref/ref.html)</a> devotes a whole sub-chapter to "Emulating container types", "Emulating callable Objects", "Emulating numeric types", "Emulating sequences" etc. -- only because arrays, sequences etc. are "special" in Python. In Ruby, you just derive from the respective base classes (or extend them directly). So, Ruby's type system is much simpler and cleaner and allows a smaller and simpler language core. And, you write scripts that don't look like OOP in Ruby just as easily because the default "global" namespace is the body of a default "main" object, which just implements all the usual imperative functions like print, gets, eval, etc.<em>  -- </em><a href="OlafKlischat.html">OlafKlischat</a>

For me it can become hard to keep track of end's in nested structures.  Glyphs are also relevant.  Pythonists seem to loathe the @'s in Ruby, but then again I __can't stand__ Python's underscores.

      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone is having problems keeping track of "nested end's" then they are not
        using a smart (bloated?) enough editor. In Emacs, all you do is use Ruby
        mode and let the auto-indent magic work. When viewing less complex Python and
        Ruby samples side by side, it is interesting to note how they are usually both
        formatted nearly identically. Just take out the "end" constructs, adjust the
        indent level, and a Ruby snippet might even fool an unobservant Python
        programmer when quickly scrolling through a webpage. The biggest thing I enjoy
        about the Ruby syntax over the Python syntax is being able to refactor code and
        have Emacs figure out how to properly indent it for me--I'm pretty lazy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surprisingly, while some Ruby proponents claim it doesn't enforce indentation
        the way Python does, the parser is sensitive to whitespace. From the Ruby FAQ

        <dd>Ruby works hard to distinguish method calls from operators, and variable names from method names. Unfortunately, there's no way it can get it right all the time. In this case, "a +b" is parsed as "a(+b)". Remove the space to the left of "+" or add a space to the right of "+," and it will be parsed as an addition.  <em>This has nothing to do with indentation.  And for what it's worth, Ruby now parses "a +b" the way you'd expect.</em> <strong>Which way is that?</strong></dd>

        <em>When I heard about Python's use of whitespace for structure, I too was horrified, and I wrote the language off altogether.

Half an hour later, I was hacking like mad, I'd completely forgotten about the whitespace, and I was in love with Python; I shouldn't have been surprised, but I internalized the new syntax, and after that, I didn't think about it, any more than I think about the braces in Java or the commas in English.

        I didn't actually notice that whitespace was signifigant for structure in
        Python for quite a while. Considering that I would normally indent something in
        C++ regardless, the indenting seemed quite natural. The only surprise is when
        you try not to do it, and that is often because you're making something quick.
        The fact that Python won't let you do that will make that "quick code" look
        better in the long run. You really don't notice it after 10 minutes of code,
        and indenting everything will become quite natural (if you are lazy and don't
        already), especially when you start coding in another language again. --

        Note that IDLE - the IDE that comes with python (and is built with Python)

        text as a whole - making refactoring easy compared to using an text editor
        without equivalent support.  That one factor alone made any hesitation
        regarding indention moot. There is also a python lisp module for emacs, that

        I think there is difference in readability philosophy between Ruby and Python.
        Python tends to restrict the amount of <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a>. Ruby tends to bend over
        backwards to make its sweet stuff as elegant as possible, in the hope that
        given good choices you'll make them.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: In Ruby, <em>for</em> loops are ugly and bug-prone. <a href="BlocksInRuby.html">BlocksInRuby</a>, through
        keywords like .times, .each, and .each_index are simpler to use. Thus, in
        practice, <em>for</em> loops are uncommon. In my opinion, all except possibly
        .each_index are more readable.  -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        On a related note to <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a>, there sometimes comes a point where doing
        things the <em>canonical</em> way becomes just plain verbose, tedious, and ugly.  An
        example pertinent to me is Python's treatment of regular expressions.  I
        migrated to Python from Perl due to the data structures.  But the fact that
        regular expressions are not part of the Python language proper (save as a
        module), and don't have some of the sugary operator syntax of Perl, has
        really been a thorn in my side for what I do.  Perl's treatment may seem more
        cryptic, but its compactness makes it much more readable in the context of
        scripts than Python's verboseness.  I am new to Ruby but I immediately see its
        adoption of Perl-style regular expressions in addition to the data structures I
        appreciate from Python as ultimately enticing.  I in fact first considered Ruby
        as a combination of the best of Python and Perl (though I've since learned
        there's more to it).  Removal of the strict indentation dependence is a bonus
        for me as well. (I don't like to be chained to an editor, especially for quick
        on-the-fly edits, and I don't like that I can't <em>if(0)</em> out large blocks of
        code without marking large blocks and indenting.) -- milesh
      </p>
      <p>
        That's why I still use Perl for small text processing jobs.  Python, however, is marvelous for larger programs, where I find that regular expressions aren't nearly as important as I would have thought.  On occasion the extra effort required to use them at all has made me notice that simple string replacement would be both simpler and faster. -- Eric

        thoroughly unsearchable names ("Restricted Python", "Python Methods",
        Script(Python)) - so it's very hard to find as a separate platform.  Ruby's

        One important fact that I haven't seen mentioned is that Python has a mission to be simple for beginners.

        Odd. I think the best way to break in a new programmer/coder is to let him grind his teeth on C++ for a while. Provided he doesn't become obsessed with it, it is IMO the best introduction to programming. There are so many details that the programmer has to take care of himself, the language constructs are so rich that they force many low-level decisions, interaction between code and compiler is intense, and there's the macro engine on top of it, which is quite useful at obfuscating code. Whereas high level, garbage collected languages leave it all to the programmer. Thus not forcing too much "training" to happen for the programmer. Only after some C++ hell is a programmer able to properly use a high level, garbage collected, puerly OO language properly. Just my off topic opinion. -- flj

        One advantage Ruby has is that you don't need to 'import' external things to do
        simple tasks.  Say getting commandline arguments.  In Ruby they're just there,
        as ARGV.  In Python, you have to import sys, then use sys.argv.  It's not super
        difficult, but it's not as obvious either.  Same goes with most of what's in
        the "os" package in Python.  In Ruby, most of those functions are available
        everywhere as part of Kernel.  As for Ruby's ability to redefine fundamental
        behaviour, *shrug*, in practice, that doesn't often happen, especially not in a
        destructive or dangerous way.  I wouldn't consider it a serious concern.

        <em>"There are many Ruby users who voluntarily converted from Python and would tend to disagree with the assertion that there are no killer feature differences. The Ruby closure syntax alone is one, for example."</em>
      </p>
      <p>

        "<em>...once you are experienced in Ruby you will find blocks to be essential.</em>"
      </p>
      <p>
        This goes to the heart of the the major difference between Ruby and Python. In Python, you're stuck with the control statements provided by the language and have to write classes that work with those statements (by implementing methods with lots of underscores in them). In contrast, a Ruby programmer uses blocks to <em>extend the language</em> with application-specific control statements. Therefore programming becomes a matter of building application-specific languages in terms of primitives provided by the base language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree only partly. Python's attitude is towards using uniform language constructions, but you </em>can<em> quite easily add new ones, because the difference between a block and a lambda is quite small. (You can have more than one lambda, while blocks, on the other hand, have closures. Nested scopes were implemented in Python 2.x)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I think this is what programming is all about, but we have become
        stuck with languages that are far too inflexible and syntax-heavy to allow us
        to program in this way. Even Ruby isn't as good for this style of programming
        as <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> or <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>. Still, it's good to see

        <em></em>ApplesToOranges.  We're talking human-readable languages here - Python is considered executable pseudocode to many.  Meanwhile, Lisp languages are really just text representations of a parse tree - easier for the computer to read than for me.  I think it is impossible to overstate the advantage blocks provide to Ruby.  Yes, Python has closures and lambdas - hell, C++ does too if you push a code generator hard enough.  The point is that Ruby has them in a pleasant, legible manner.  To see why this is important, look at the horrible mess that the Decorators debate was in the Python world.  Also look at how much of a pain it is to work with metaclasses in Python.  These debates would never have been started in Ruby - the syntax is already there for such things; only the conventions would remain.  If Python had the block feature of Ruby (which is functionally just a really smooth syntax of lambdas) then I'd never touch Ruby again.  I hope Guido learns this lesson before Python 3.0.  Bragging about feature X over feature Y makes about as bunch as much sense as Gentoo users talking about "use" flags - it doesn't matter how much you can tweak your system and personalize it if nobody else wants to touch the whole platform with a ten-foot pole.  Ruby's blocks are a pragmatic, intelligent concept that I'm continually annoyed is so rare in legible languages.  Too bad the rest of the language is so frustrating.  Still, it's better than trying to explain to a newbie what car and cdr mean any day.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference between Python lambdas and Ruby blocks is that Ruby blocks have
        access to the variables in the scope in which they were defined.
        <em>(</em><a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s. These were added in Python 2.2.)<em> This allows blocks</em>
        to be used in a more expressive manner, such as those described above.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, your class uses the "for .. in" statement to iterate over the
        private list of elements. If you want to be able to use instances of
        MyList in "for...in" statements, you have to add special support to your
        class to work with the built-in interpreter; namely, the __iter__ method. In
        Ruby, iteration over collections is just a method that passes each element to a
        block. Implementing the "each" method for a new collection (and importing the
        Enumerable module to mix in useful higher-order functions such as collect)
        makes it indistinguishable from all other collections. 
        <em>So both languages require you to write an iterator function rather than using magic.</em>

        <strong>Community and Documentation</strong>

      <p>
        There's just not as big a community surrounding Ruby. Fewer books, wizards,
        tools, and libraries makes it less appealing than Python for real work.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, the Ruby community is the friendliest and most helpful you will ever meet. I think that Ruby's community is one of the big selling points of the language.</em>  (However, the same has also been said of the Python community.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Funny. The few people I have met from the Ruby community and especially the RoR community have all been rather arrogant and exhibited strong language bias, elitist attitude und unreasonable fanboyism. Now that is completely subjective, but there must be a reason for charts like this <a href="http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=401640.">http://forums.macrumors.com/showthread.php?t=401640.</a> The Python guys have all been nice so far.

        <strong>Libraries</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think that this discussion so far misses many practicalities. For instance, what about </em><a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a>. More and more software depends on Unicode. Python has rich Unicode support built-in (for example, Unicode literals, Unicode regular expressions, Unicode readers and writers). Ruby 2.0 is supposed to have something even more general than Unicode, but in the meantime it doesn't have anything built in.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Python has a much greater range of libraries available to it, and most of those libraries are more mature and better documented than their Ruby counterparts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ruby, however, can take advantage of Python libraries through the use of Ruby/Python (<a href="http://www.goto.info.waseda.ac.jp/%7Efukusima/ruby/python/doc/index.html)">http://www.goto.info.waseda.ac.jp/%7Efukusima/ruby/python/doc/index.html)</a> - there are, however, probably performance concerns in doing so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, there is a perception out there that the Ruby standard library is smaller but better organized than the Python one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if the size of the libraries/communities/bookshelves was <em>that</em>
        important to use a language, then nobody would discuss why programming
        languages beyond <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> or, indeed, <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> were
        ever needed or wished. Nothing compares to CPAN (in my opinion).  <strong>But</strong>
        there's obviously more to this than these things: it's not about how many
        books, but if there are enough good books; not how many people, but if there
        are enough friendly people, and so on... I'd say both Python and Ruby match
        these requirements fairly well, as Perl and many other languages do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In general Python's libraries are more plentiful and more mature, so it wins, in my opinion, for COM/CORBA, XML, and networking. They're both kind of awkward for making binaries, but, um, why do you want to make binaries? Both are extremely portable. Ruby's API for C integration is much, much cleaner than Python's. Python C modules have a lot of boilerplate.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In either Ruby or Python, a poorly written extension module can block all
        threads. But in Ruby, it may not be possible to make a C library that does
        blocking calls give up its time slice at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I haven't done much with Python C extension modules, I think the main
        cause of the extra boilerplate is Python's use of reference counts* (with cycle
        detection) for garbage collection. Apparently, if you have a situation where
        the code you're interfacing to Ruby does anything tricky with the pointers to
        the wrapped objects (like storing them away for later), Ruby's mark-and-sweep
        GC needs to be told about them - which can cause problems sometimes. I think
        this is a tie again - Ruby's C interface is simpler, whereas the Python
        interface is potentially more flexible.
      </p>
      <p>
        (*) specifically CPython, rather than the Java implementation, Jython
      </p>
      <p>
        One way of wrapping C or C++ is to use the
        <a href="SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator.html">SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator</a>.  This can generate interface code for
        many languages, including both Python and Ruby.

        Python has ctypes which lets you bind to DLLs at runtime
        (<a href="http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/),">http://starship.python.net/crew/theller/ctypes/),</a> which means you can write
        extensions in python.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is pysoftwire which allows you to write python functions in x86 asm at runtime.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can write C like extensions with Pyrex, a hybrid Python/C-like language.

        <strong>Platforms</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Python and Ruby are both available for UNIX, DOS, Windows 95/98/NT/2000, Mac OS X, BeOS, Amiga, Acorn Risc OS, and OS/2.
      </p>
      <p>
        Python is also available under Apple, AS400, QNX, VMS, OS390, AROS, Windows CE. (<em>Anybody know if Ruby supports any of those platforms?</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Python has a single, nice Windows distribution, but it has a slightly different
        subset of functionality than the Unix version. Some of the POSIXy functions of
        the os module, in particular, are not supported in Windows.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the Apple and Windows Pythons offer unique functionality for their
        platforms too - COM, for example. There's no working around the fact that most
        of POSIX is Unix-specific. But all the stuff you <em>need</em> to run on all
        platforms - regexps and threads and sockets - does. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Windows Ruby installation includes the Win32Api library which allows access
        to windows DLL calls. Code to call from and to COM is also available. <a href="RubyCocoa.html">RubyCocoa</a>
        offers very good support for <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a>.

        <dd>Zope has ubiquitous undo support, provides a unified user interface and API to multiple data sources including its own database (storable inside a RDBMS by using a DA), and the filesystem.  It can be managed through DAV.  <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> is still evolving, although it's close to version 1.0 as of Feb 2005. It's lower-level than Zope and uses generators to flesh in some support, like authentication. Version 0.10 no longer requires mod_rewrite and permits easy use of <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> with alternate servers like lighttpd. Unlike Zope which some have called un-Pythonic, <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> is more like a souped-up Ruby that helps you build web applications. As such, it doesn't come with undos and a full-blown security model.</dd>

      <p>
        But on the other hand, <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> encourages you to <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>, which is pleasant. It also lets you get a full-featured project up and running in much less code than Zope. It does discourage some things, and it does lack some features (lack of undo is a legitimate complaint).  But you named some features that Rails has no business providing or is just plain wrong:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No multiple database support <strong>:</strong> Using multiple databases is almost always bad. Yes, there are legitimate reasons to do it. No, they don't come up very often at all. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Filesystem serialization <strong>:</strong> Ruby's standard library provides very natural and powerful ways of doing this already, and because of Ruby's reliance on <a href="DuckTyping.html">DuckTyping</a>, you can sneak these items in where <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a> would normally be expected.
        </li>
        <li>
           Security Model <strong>:</strong> Ruby gives you this with $SAFE if you're talking about code-level injection-style attacks. It also cleans SQL statements for you. If you're talking about authentication, Rails does indeed give you an easy way to do this (there is even a generator command just for it!). 
        </li>
        <li>
           Requiring Apache & mod_rewrite <strong>:</strong> It most certainly does <em>not</em> require either of these things. The rails project generator gives you setup for these things for free, but you can feel free to use whatever you want. Indeed, it comes with a built-in web server of its own c.o. Webrick (which is awesome for testing/development purposes). <em>Update:</em> The beta of rails now has built-in routes support, which lets you get those pretty URLs without the complexity of mod_rewrite. All you need is to be able to turn all URLs to the web app from <a href="http://domain/path/(fancy">http://domain/path/(fancy</a> app path) to <a href="http://domain/path/dispatch.cgi?(fancy">http://domain/path/dispatch.cgi?(fancy</a> app path) . This is trivial and supported by many web servers, further divorcing rails from apache without feature loss.

        I think there are probably more Python programmers than Ruby. Before
        <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a>, Ruby wasn't getting nearly as much attention. I'm not being
        entirely facetious when I suggest that it's because Ruby inspires a high level
        of zealotry, akin to Macs and Amigas. (Those of us who <em>are</em> Mac users also
        get agitated to use a commercial text editor written by a Rails developer,

        The whole notion that Ruby could be considered in any way comparable to Python is ridiculous.

After a little while, the Yugo is going to break down, but the Mercedes is going to keep going. So even the idea that you can make a serious comparison is heavily biased towards Ruby.

        <em>Yes, though not in the same way that Smalltalk does it (with the ^ operator). Ruby has a </em><a href="CallWithCurrentContinuation.html">CallWithCurrentContinuation</a> method.

        <em>Nope. Not out of the box. Ruby's exceptions are a lot like Java's or Python's and aren't as rich as Smalltalk's at this point.

      <p>
        In my opinion, these are the two foundation stones upon which most other things can be constructed -- in Perl, Python and apparently also Ruby.

        I am newbie for both Python and Ruby.  I started from Python and like its style very much, especially its indentation.  But the name of "Python" and snake pictures/icons (e.g., on official Python Tutorial page) made me feel sick.  From this perspective, ruby has a better name than python. So I searched and found ruby and so far am very happy with it.  Plus it has some features like open classes, which people can modify the class anytime.

        Names are important and said to carry universal energy messages in ancient cultures.  That's why parents usually give their children positive names.  Suggest Python changes its name to something else, like Pyson, pysong, or pysung, etc.  Names like Java (good smell), Fortran (good fortune), Perl (good looking) are some other good examples. -- fr
