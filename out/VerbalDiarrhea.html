        <strong>Introduction</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As well as providing a quick and handy reference for spelling that tricky word <strong>Diarrhea</strong> ("diarrhoea" in some places!), this phrase refers to a chronic inability to say something in less than a page when one sentence would suffice. (Also known as <em>logorrhea</em>, but that doesn't make a nice <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>.)

        The page title also nicely describes the behaviour of just having to add a comment to every page, or even to every comment on a page, whether or not one has something worthwhile to contribute. This comment might be a self-referential example.

        <strong>The shortest exchange of letters</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        After publishing "Les Miserables" and awaiting the public's reaction to his book, Victor Hugo went on vacation and he sent a letter to his publisher: the letter contained a single symbol: a question mark ("?") (in other words, "how did the public react?"); the publisher answered with an exclamation mark ("!") (in other words the public's reaction was amazingly positive!).

        <strong>The shortest answer to an exam question</strong>
        The question in the philosophy exam was: "What is guts? Discuss.". The student's essay in response: "This." (<a href="UrbanLegend.html">UrbanLegend</a>)
      </p>

        <em>Not an </em><a href="UrbanLegend.html">UrbanLegend</a>: My friend's PhD exam for anthropology was one question: "What about time?"<em></em>
