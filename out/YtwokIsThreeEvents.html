        Ytwok Is Three Events
      </h1>
      <ol>
        <li>
           A global run on the banks and y2k-fear led market crash beginning some time in 1999 and ending no-one knows when.
        </li>
        <li>
           progressive manufacturing/distribution/utility infrastructure failures beginning 8/26/99 leading up to near-total shutdown at 1/1/2000, with further date-based hiccups and ripples of unknown frequency and magnitude throughout the next year. 
        </li>
        <li>
           An energy crisis due to the above hitting oil availability and possibly electricity availability too. Severity and duration unknown, probably worst at mid July 2000 (peak demand).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        What are the effects of these events? Opinions differ widely. Roll up, roll up, place yer bets on <a href="YtwokUpdate.html">YtwokUpdate</a>. Every one's a winner!

        It occurs to me that there would be a "near-total" shutdown on 1/1/2000 even if programmers never used two-digit years. I personally expect to be shut down for the better part of the day; the new millennium is certainly adequate cause for 
        celebration. (As for anyone who maintains that the millennium actually begins 1/1/2001, I strongly disagree. But I reserve the right to change my mind before

        <em>Good point, phantom stranger; so long as the utilities don't go down it'll be at least 1/3 before anyone notices. Panic buying should empty all the shops and ATMs around that period anyway, so, utilities surviving, it'll be a good week before there's any material effect of real live y2k bugs. Whether 1/1/00 has any particularly dire significance mostly seems to hinge on whether there are prolonged power outages in the cities.</em> -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
