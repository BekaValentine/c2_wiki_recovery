        Harry is a friend of <a href="KaiCarver.html">KaiCarver</a> (the person who started this page).
      </p>
      <p>
        Like me he seems interested in the topic of <a href="VirtualCommunity.html">VirtualCommunity</a>.
        He's not a programmer though, so he might not be interested in a lot of stuff in this community.
      </p>
      <p>
        He's a Spanish professor and a poet, and a web guy.
        Here's very elegant proof of all three: <a href="http://www.ups.edu/community/mellon/velez/Orfeo/home.htm">http://www.ups.edu/community/mellon/velez/Orfeo/home.htm</a>

        We met at Harvard University a long time ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now he lives in Seattle which is a long way away.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is what he looks like: <img src="http://www.ups.edu/faculty/velez/mug.jpg" /> (slightly scary photo, but cool).

        Harry -who now presents himself by way of a different narrator, himself,- is pretty amused by this Tiki-Tiki-Ding-A-Ling.  It is a yummy thing and it makes him want to be a Borg or at least a bitchin' programmer like his friend Kai.  Kai, if you do not know it by now, is dope!
