        This pattern is the idea that even <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> is too complex... especially the lengthy page title.

        <a href="AhSimple.html">AhSimple</a> is the simplest way of saying "simple" on this wiki since it uses a short simple to the point title, allowing simple <em>and</em> the point of simplicity to remain in the page title, still with the shortest characters.

        <em>Ahhh.. thank goodness this API is simple and easy to use.</em>

        Sometimes, simple thoughts come to us while going to the washroom.

        Why can't we do do things the simple way first?
