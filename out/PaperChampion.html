        Paper Champion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Once the <a href="OopslaProgramCommitteeMeeting.html">OopslaProgramCommitteeMeeting</a> has made its decisions, responsibility
        for those decisions is anonymous (although the program
        chair gets all the hassles). In the committee meeting,
        though, it is important to have personal responsibility.
        Otherwise, you will get half hour debates that will end
        with all the participants saying, "Well, I don't think
        the paper should be accepted either, I just thought we
        should talk about it." Near as I can tell, if nobody thinks
        the paper should be accepted, it shouldn't be accepted,
        and no amount of discussion will change that.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, for each paper to be discussed, open by asking
        someone to champion the paper, explaining in a minute or
        less why it should be accepted. If no one speaks up, the 
        paper gets put in the reject pile (from which it can be
        revisited during PaperResurrection. )
