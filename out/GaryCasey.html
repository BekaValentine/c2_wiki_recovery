        People sometimes give me jobs with the word "architect" somewhere in the job description or title. This causes me some pain, because I believe <a href="EveryoneIsAnArchitect.html">EveryoneIsAnArchitect</a>.

        My favourite work activity is improvement. I always want to deliver better software, software that can successfully evolve... I would like to see a world where our software can constantly evolve rather than constantly reaching evolutionary dead ends (i.e. becoming "legacy" software). <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> is a revolution which has recently changed my life.

        Outside work I love being at home in Scotland, reading (pretty much anything, and as much as I can) and lots of other stuff (like ChattingForHoursInPubsWithFriends), and spending time with my family, beside which everything else is insignificant.

        For some reason I have recently started to get very chatty. I'm kind of enjoying it.
