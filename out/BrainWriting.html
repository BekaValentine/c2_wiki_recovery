        Brain Writing
      </h1>
      <p>
        is the silent, written generation of ideas in a group.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> A group meets to BrainWrite about a product.  To begin, each participant silently writes down ideas on cards.  After some time has passed, the group reads through all the cards and discusses them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Research indicates that brainwriting <strong>always</strong> results in <strong>more ideas</strong> than <a href="BrainStorm.html">BrainStorm</a><strong>'ing, given the same size group and time period.</strong>

        <em>This is a variation on brainstorming, of which there are a huge number of varieties. Each has pluses and minuses. My personal favorite is </em>SuperHeroBrainStorming. Many are discussed in "Techniques of Structured Problem Solving" ISBN 0442212232<em> </em>

        IBM Canada hosted a process they called a DelphiConference in the late 1980s.  A Moderator and a dozen or so people in a room, each with a computer connected to via a LAN.  The moderator would chair the session introducing an initial, provocative issue that required resolution.  Everyone could see the responses of all others during those periods when a specific facet of the issue was being assessed.  This process generated a lot of documentation very quickly, the worth of which was a function of the skill levels of the moderator as well as the participants. -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>
