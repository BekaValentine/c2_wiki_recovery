        Abuse On Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        Abuse of specific people on wiki, not of "the wiki" or "the community". Now, obviously we don't mean physical abuse, so
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           stalking a wiki citizen
        </li>
        <li>
           verbally abusing them
        </li>
        <li>
           trying to impose one's opinion through dishonest tactics. Trying to make wiki a personal soapbox.
        </li>
        <li>
           anything else?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The obvious question is, how do you discourage abuse on wiki?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There are no ways to discourage WikiAbuse, not any way to prevent it, without either becoming an abuser, or changing the way Wiki works (adding security etc..).

        <em>On the other hand, vigilant </em><a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s summarily delete or defang abuse more often than you might think.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, that's "never". I submit the hypothesis that gnomes only "defang" abuse that has no fangs. Abuse made by casual abusers who ultimately simply don't care about the issue or the target. It's a far different thing when the abuser is persistent in their persecution.

        [They may clean up months or years later, if a war is too hot to clean up short term, so future generations will be less discomfited. I think that's small comfort, but it doesn't contradict the guy's point above, exactly.]
