        Unified Software Development Process
      </h1>
      <p>
        The software development process developed largely by the <a href="ThreeAmigos.html">ThreeAmigos</a> (<a href="IvarJacobson.html">IvarJacobson</a>, <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a> and <a href="JimRumbaugh.html">JimRumbaugh</a>) through their collaborative work at <a href="RationalCompany.html">RationalCompany</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cornerstones of the process are that it is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use-case driven
        </li>
        <li>
           Architecture-centric
        </li>
        <li>
           Iterative and incremental
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a> is the implemented and branded version of this, with fancy tools and the rest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The process consists of four main phases: inception, elaboration, construction and transition.  Each of these contains one or more iterations across five core workflows: requirements, analysis, design, implementation and test.  (RUP adds other flows like project management, documentation etc.).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="UsdpBook.html">UsdpBook</a> describes the process in lots of detail, down to roles, activities and artifacts in each phase and iteration.  It it however intended to only be an abstract process.  Any process implementation (such as RUP) will only use whichever bits are needed, and add whatever else is required.
