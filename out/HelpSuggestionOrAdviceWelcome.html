        Hi.  Small challenge.  I have a data stream that I need to animate to the screen under Linux (SuSE 10.3 or above).  I'm getting effectively video data, and I need to put it in a window in real time.  Previous systems I've worked on have allowed me to memory-map the screen, and then I simply write the data there.  Currently I'm writing the data to a PGM format file, then looking at that with a web page that refreshes every few seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where should I start?  What system should I be using to create a window and write data into it?  Would people recommend <a href="WxWidgets.html">WxWidgets</a>, tk/tcl, or something else?
      </p>
      <p>
        All suggestions welcome.  If I get something working well/nicely, would anyone want a copy?
      </p>
      <p>
        TIA.
      </p>

        Google for SDL library -- it is one of the best "emulated framebuffer" libraries I've ever used, and if your hardware supports it, it will take care of memory mapping relevant regions of the framebuffer for you.  You can request hardware or software-emulated video "modes", which SDL will render in a window or full-screen, depending on how your application configures its SDL screen settings.

           Sounds ideal.  At the moment I write a file, fire up a browser window on it, then use dcop to send a message to reload the window whenever I update the file.  That works, but SDL looks to do what I want.

           Any other suggestions?
