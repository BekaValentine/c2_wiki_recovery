        Towards Empirical Computer Science
      </h1>
      <p>
        The most fascinating paper I've read in ages deals with this idea that computer science is not mathematics.  It is rather academic, but a real page-turner nonetheless.  It is called <em>Towards Empirical Computer Science</em>
        by <a href="PeterWegner.html">PeterWegner</a>, and it is at <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~pw/.">http://www.cs.brown.edu/~pw/.</a> -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>most fascinating...in ages</em> sounds like a strong claim for you, Michael!  Must be quite the paper.

        In some ways I don't get this paper. There are some things I understand and some things I don't, and of the things I understand, or think I understand, there are some I agree with and some I disagree with.

        While it is true that Turing machines don't have a continuous stream of external input, there is also the ancestor of the Turing machine, the finite state machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finite state machines (FSMs) have input and change state according to their input. There is no requirement that the <em>input</em> to an FSM be finite; only the number of states in the machine must be finite.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can make a Moore or a Mealy machine, which is a finite state machine which produces output. (A Moore machine produces output as a function of its state; a Mealy machine produces output as a function of its state <em>and</em> the input which is going to govern its next state change.)
      </p>
      <p>
        You can even feed a Moore machine's output back through a complicated system to its input. Suppose we make a black box and label it "the Universe" and feed the output into that. Feed the Universe's output back into the state machine. This is of course the <a href="FourProcessesOfConsciousness.html">FourProcessesOfConsciousness</a> but applied to a machine instead of a consciousness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you <em>really</em> want to do something fun, you can take a finite state machine and equip it with an infinitely long piece of memory tape. Let it change states and move the tape based on the content of the tape <em>and</em> its external input. If the machine has been running for a finite amount of time, only a finite amount of the tape will have been used.
      </p>
      <p>
        How does the machine's connection to the Universe make it or its behavior non-amenable to logic? Am I missing something?

        At the same time, though, this paper says something tantalizingly similar to what is said on <a href="InterpretersAreForTesting.html">InterpretersAreForTesting</a>: that an unchanging <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> cannot test or demonstrate an <em>abstract</em> characteristic of a function, such as the idea that it sorts data. Just because a function transforms 2 1 3 into 1 2 3 doesn't mean it sorts.
