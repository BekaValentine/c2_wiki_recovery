        Management <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> where the boss is perceived to have a chosen successor, who often makes their status publicly known.  Effectively lowers the glass ceiling by one floor.  Stimulates career progression by others through leaving the work group.  <a href="SuccessionPlanning.html">SuccessionPlanning</a> is susceptible to this antipattern because it is smart to prepare a potential successor.  Avoid by having an open succession process which provides for a choice between multiple candidates.
