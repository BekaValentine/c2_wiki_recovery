        <a href="MarvinMinsky.html">MarvinMinsky</a>'s "Society of Mind" theory presents the idea that a mind is built from many small processes, called agents, each mindless by itself..
        According to Minsky, the interaction of these mental agents in societies, in analogy to human society, leads to true intelligence.

He thought that one could "communicate" with it (after having put enough bits of information into it). What he says about his system holds even more of the wiki, as the information and the ideas put into it come from many <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a>.
