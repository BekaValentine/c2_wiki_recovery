        Angle Between Clock Hands
      </h1>
      <dl>
        <dt>On <a href="ProgrammingChallengesForInterview.html">ProgrammingChallengesForInterview</a>, one of the problems suggested is</dt>
        <dd>Write a program that given the time of the day (hours, minutes) return the angle between the hands on a clock.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt>The warning given when the problem was initially stated was</dt>
        <dd>Be on the lookout for them asking if they should return just the smaller angle, and the "clever" solution that just outputs 0 because the hands are parallel.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Then someone said:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The angle represented by (hours * 30) - (minutes * 6)?</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>That's not programming, that's an arithmetic problem.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        There are a few things to notice about this.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           If you use integer hours and minutes, as some people will naturally expect, then it's wrong.
        </li>
        <li>
           Probably programmers should be able to derive formulae like this.
        </li>
        <li>
           The next suggestion - (hours * 30 + minutes / 2.0) - is also wrong.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Then came the first question:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Does the hour hand on your clock <em>snap</em> from hour to hour?</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Ah.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this question is used in an interview, perhaps what we're looking for includes, among other things, the interviewee asking questions about the requirement.
