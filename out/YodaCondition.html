        A <a href="YodaCondition.html">YodaCondition</a> is a binary comparison expression, typically found in conditional statements such as if and while statements, where the value on the left of the operator is the expectation and the value on the right is the actual. Simple examples include:
      </p>
      <code>
        if(0==variable) ...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        while(false == endingCondition) ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        These statements sound odd when read left to right; "while false equals the ending condition" sounds much better as "while the ending condition equals false" which would be the natural way of reading the statement with the operands reversed:
      </p>
      <code>
        while(endingCondition == false) ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A <a href="YodaCondition.html">YodaCondition</a> can reduce readability of code, however it can also be a safety feature in languages where the assignment operator is "=" while the equality operator is "=="; see <a href="CompareConstantsFromTheLeft.html">CompareConstantsFromTheLeft</a>.
