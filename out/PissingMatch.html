        Pissing Match
      </h1>
      <p>
        A pissing match: two or more men compete by urinating. The person who manages to force out a jet of urine over the longest distance wins. <em>I thought it was the greatest height.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a metaphorical sense, it is a discussion of two competing philosophies or schools of thought.

        <em>Medical students are rumoured to play a similar game called "bladder tennis", which required two catheters and a length of hose.</em>

        I've always felt strange hearing this phrase, being without the equipment to carry out such a match and (thankfully) having never witnessed such a thing. There just isn't an analogous experience for women/girls, far as I can tell. By the way, is this what the sinister-looking Calvin decal is doing on the back of pickup trucks--challenging other drivers to a match?

        <em>I think the decal is just a depiction of a small form of vandalism.  I've never engaged in or seen a (literal) </em><a href="PissingMatch.html">PissingMatch</a>, and certainly never saw the decal that way.  --A Male Wiki'er<em></em>

        The Calvin decal is used to show dislike/disapproval for whatever subject is under the urine stream.  EG: Drivers of one brand name pickup truck applying a version with the truck maker's competition.  I've always thought that a version with "Copyright Infringers" would be the most appropriate, as the image is an unapproved ripoff of the Bill Watterson's <a href="CalvinAndHobbes.html">CalvinAndHobbes</a> work.

        The Idea of a <a href="PissingMatch.html">PissingMatch</a> goes at least as far back as Eighteenth Century.  It appears in a poem called "The Dunciad" by Alexander Pope.  Different literary critics try to see who can outmatch the other.  --Imlac

        <em>The Idea of a </em><a href="PissingMatch.html">PissingMatch</a> is based on the age-old connection between sexual imagery and dominance.  This is shared widely across primates.  See Shadows of Forgotten Ancestors [ISBN 0345384725] by Carl Sagan and Ann Druyan for more.  --Tilly<em></em>

        {It might be based more on wolves that define their territories using urine as markers. I don't think it is necessarily sexual when a wolf pisses on another pissy area to define his territory and dominate the other wolf that pissed before him.}
