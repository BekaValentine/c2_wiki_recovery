        See his latest, well received title: <a href="PracticesOfAnAgileDeveloper.html">PracticesOfAnAgileDeveloper</a> : Working in the Real World

        We've been real busy here at the Pragmatic Bookshelf getting new titles out the door, but I'm pleased to see the most recent book I co-authored, <a href="PracticesOfAnAgileDeveloper.html">PracticesOfAnAgileDeveloper</a>, is getting great reviews around the web, including a 9-horseshoe (out of 10) rating at Java Ranch.

        It's especially great to see that programmers are enthusiastic about something other than the latest, greatest API or IDE.  Languages and frameworks come and go, but your habits--your practices--stay with you for your whole career.

        I hope to announce my next book this summer: it's about the <a href="DreyfusModel.html">DreyfusModel</a>, fine-tuning your thinking, and managing your ideas and insights. Stay tuned here for details, or check our my blog at <a href="http://toolshed.com/blog">http://toolshed.com/blog</a> for my upcoming appearances, forthcoming books, and the occasional rant.
