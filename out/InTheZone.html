        In The Zone
      </h1>
      <p>
        A phrase used to describe when one has entered a state of mind that is optimal for whatever he or she may be doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The phrase is most often associated with sports when a player seems to be doing everything right and appears unstoppable.

        In the general context of programming I would say one is <a href="InTheZone.html">InTheZone</a> when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Code flows from your finger tips to the keyboard as if you were <a href="OneWithTheComputer.html">OneWithTheComputer</a> <em></em>OneWithTheUniverse<em>?).</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Every time you encounter a bug it takes you less than a second to determine the problem and fix it (without breaking anything else of course) <em>and you don't remember how you fixed it once you're done</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          Everything that you thought of the night before when you were trying to fall asleep works flawlessly when you try it the next day
        </li>
        <li>
          The Compact Disc you are listening to finishes and you don't remember hearing any of the songs
        </li>
        <li>
          You write functions that mysteriously work first time and never need to be re-written
        </li>
        <li>
          You're sleepy. A little hungry. You decide to go home, and realize the sun is coming up. You realize you've just left the zone.
        </li>
        <li>
          Variant if you are already at home (and probably have been <a href="InTheZone.html">InTheZone</a> for several hours):  You leave the zone when your alarm (from whatever device wakes you up in the morning) rings and you realize you simply didn't go to bed.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
