        Limits Of Hierarchies
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hierarchical taxonomies of just about anything are usually problematic, except for the trivial perhaps. I think software engineering has gotten carried away with trees. Even in the life sciences taxonomies tend to be somewhat arbitrary because bacteria and other organisms can grab DNA and stick them in a far-off organism, busting the tree.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hierarchies can give way to <strong>folksonomies</strong> -- <a href="CrowdSource.html">CrowdSource</a>d organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think hierarchies are good for front-end navigation, but should not serve as the only organization mechanism, especially internally (except for the trivial).

        Product catalogs, company org charts, and book grouping (Dewey Decimal) are also considered a hierarchy. However, I found situations where something can belong to two or more groups such that they make lousy leafs. I found (overlapping) sets more fitting than hierarchies.

        <em>Re: "sets are more fitting" - sets are rather general; they always fit. Hierarchies (i.e. trees, right?) are sets, but too specific (==restrictive) ones, because they lack orthogonality support.

        I have before tried to use org hierarchies in applications, and it did not go over very well. Managers wanted it "tweaked" for different needs. Also, "matrix organizations" are not uncommon, which means you have 2 bosses.

        <strong>Level-Per-Attribute Anti-Pattern</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing that really ticks me off is the creation of trees where each orthogonal feature becomes a level. Example hierarchy:
      </p>
      <code>
        DRINKS<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Coke<br/>
        --Diet<br/>
        ----Caffeinated<br/>
        ----No Caffeine<br/>
        --Regular<br/>
        ----Caffeinated<br/>
        ----No Caffeine<br/>
        Lemon-Lime soda<br/>
        --Diet<br/>
        ----Caffeinated<br/>
        ----No Caffeine<br/>
        --Regular<br/>
        ----Caffeinated<br/>
        ----No Caffeine<br/>
        Iced Tea<br/>
        --Diet<br/>
        ----Caffeinated<br/>
        ----No Caffeine<br/>
        --Regular<br/>
        ----Caffeinated<br/>
        ----No Caffeine<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (I added dashes because the spacing keeps getting messed up by a rogue browser somewhere.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the problems with this approach are that adding new attributes balloons up the leaf count, and the levels arbitrarily rank some factors higher than another. For example, if your doctor insisted that you avoid caffeine, then you would probably want that at the highest level to more easily see which flavors don't have a non-caffeine version. But somebody watching their calories may want the Diet attribute moved higher. Level-per-factor can easily grow into an <a href="AddingEpicycles.html">AddingEpicycles</a> kind of mess.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unfortunately, XML and hierarchical file systems require that kind of kluge. Is something like the following any better?</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Data<br/>
        Coke-Diet<br/>
        Coke-Regular<br/>
        Lemonlime-Diet<br/>

        Coke -> /Data/Coke-Diet<br/>
        Lemonlime -> /Data/Lemonlime-Diet<br/>
        Regular<br/>
        Coke -> /Data/Coke-Regular<br/>
        Lemonlime -> /Data/Lemonlime-Regular<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>This has even more leaves, but a script can be written to automate their generation, and all of the actual data is in the /Data directory.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This problem can (most times) be resolved in OO programming by using has-a relationships instead of strict is-a relationships.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But then you lose what is "special" about OO, and start rolling your own </em><a href="NetworkDatabase.html">NetworkDatabase</a> of sorts.<em> </em>'This is utterly false. Replacing inheritance with composition is a very powerful OO 'move', and as mentioned below, features in many design patterns.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I must say that some of the cooler things I've learned about OO are <em>enabled</em> by this, and yet have no analogue in databases of any kind. Many patterns are good examples of this.

      <p>
        <em>Could you select one for analysis here?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What about the whole Facet/Tag approach?
      </p>
      <code>
        Facets = { "cola", "lemon-lime soda", "iced tea", "diet", "regular", "caffeinated", "caffeine free" }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And then each item in the system has <em>0-n</em> tags?
      </p>
      <p>
        If we wanted stronger typing, we could define each of those as a different dimension with valid values, and every object has to exist at an intersection of those dimensions (but not every point has to correspond to an item).
      </p>
      <p>
        "Caffeine-free diet cola" being "caffeine-free" within one dimension, "diet" within another dimension, and "cola" within another. We can, of course, implement an arbitrary number of dimensions into the system, each with its own 'points' and constraints. And not all dimensions need to be considered. Sort of how a two-dimensional shape becomes an infinite prism when you add the 3rd dimension.

        I maintain that like "a tree falling in the forest", classification hierarchies exist only when there is an observer to classify things. Long ago when conducting manufacturing seminars, I would point out that there are only piece parts - all other levels in a bill of material are organizing artifacts, as evidenced by differences between the "manufacturing" and the "engineering" bills of material or how the manufacturing BOM needs to change as the manufacturing process changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fact that the same observation seems to hold for most hierarchies, suggests to me, that from a systems perspective, there should be multiple, independent organizational structures available to access separately stored entity data at the lowest level. In the example above, the attributes of coke/lemon-lime, diet/non-diet, caffeine/caffeine free can be inserted into the hierarchy at any arbitrary level, yielding multiple classification structures that, based on needs of the observer, have varying utility. Or consider structuring footwear products: multiple sizes, men's/women's, casual/formal, loafers/boots/pumps/slippers/sandals, etc. Again, of the combinatorial possible structures, the suitability of each is a function of the seeker of the shoe data, rather than any inherent value in a single arbitrary ordering of the attributes in the hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would think that the XML structure problem is best solved by not encoding an arbitrary hierarchy in the XML structure, but by including only the end products, and including with each the attributes (diet-caffeine-flavor-packaging size, etc.) that might later be used to organize one or several externally defined classifications.
      </p>
      <p>
        But there are classification grouping that are independent of, or at least need to be derived from, item level attributes. An example for soft drinks might include sales rank (perhaps by territory or route salesman - invoking other hierarchies), for library classifications, an era - using externally defined groupings based on publication date - or significance based on citations in other publications.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems important to keep item attributes at the lowest level, without reflecting any external (perhaps transient) structure. For example, keeping geographic coordinates of plants and sales offices, would enable external conversion/classification of derived attributes like zip, area and dialing codes, political subdivisions, time zone, continent, hemisphere, national holidays, work weeks, sales/value added tax rates, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've not been able to find any taxonomy or classification theory (that reaches beyond biology) that would help me better understand the problem, although I keep thinking there should be some 101 level course that explains it all. -- <a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While I cannot seem to formulate as good an example as you Jim, the one thing that concerns me is your focus on Data. Taxonomy doesn't necessarily mean all we are looking at is what is different between the attributes of one taxonomical member to another. At the same time I agree that depending on the observer of a system, the classifications have different meanings. Using your coke example, if the system simply sold soft drinks, then coke would not be a type. However, if the system modelled the different types of soft drink for some analysis perhaps, some taxonomy might be required. Maybe I am missing something here, but I myself have never really seen over-complicated hierarchies at the implementation stage. In analysis they offer a perspective on the problem domain, but at design there are ways to deal with a lot of taxonomy problems. I would concur that there are situations were one classification is classified by different things at different times, and a rigid hierarchy is not an enabler for this situation. I try to stay away from thinking about my classifications as just data.</em>

        Behavioral classification is even more trickier than data classification IMO. Orthogonal influencers are especially tricky on such taxonomies.

      </p>
      <p>
        The process of division that leads from [a single] fertilized egg to [a single] multi-cellular organism creates a concrete hierarchy of cells.

      <p>
        I'm talking about ontogeny (of a single organism), not taxonomies (classifying many organisms). <em>In which case, it's not a counter example, as Jim's assertion says "classification hierarchies" (it may have been edited since you wrote this; please refactor if so).

      </p>
      <p>
        Not that I don't share your interest in the example, but I just wanted to point out that seeing this "as a hierarchy" is still dependent on the observer - IOW <a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>'s position is still valid: that the "existence" of the hierarchy is because the observer (a person) interprets what is happening that way. -- <a href="BillCaputo.html">BillCaputo</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In what way does the existence of this hierarchy depend on an observer? A single cell divides. Those cells divide. Etc. An external observer isn't imposing tree structure on them in any way I can see. That structure is a result of how they reproduce.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is not the mere existence, but the importance given to it. A given observer may perhaps not give a honk about the cell's ancestry for their particular study.

If they had </em><a href="GodsGoogle.html">GodsGoogle</a>, perhaps they could find the actual hierarchy, but they are just human.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Further, isn't accidental cross-mixing of cellular material and/or some DNA still fairly likely over the longer term? Thus, there are no "pure" trees in biology. Again, this is an issue for </em><a href="LimitsOfHierarchiesInBiology.html">LimitsOfHierarchiesInBiology</a> IMO.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The claim was "classification hierarchies exist only when there is an observer to classify things". I provided an exception to that claim. It doesn't matter if a given observer doesn't care about a cell's ancestry. The hierarchy exists independently of the observer. It doesn't matter if the cell is separated from the hierarchy. The hierarchy existed before the cell was separated. A virus might move DNA between cells, but that's an exceptional case. My original exception stands.
      </p>
      <p>
        But you don't [provide an exception to that claim]. Where is the original zygote in full-grown organism? Chances are it's not even there, together with many of its descendants, and the full perfect tree exists only in your imagination. Also, is there a way to establish a unique ancestoral path between any two cells in the body? I seriously doubt that... So, your tree exists only in some abstract/historical sense. Also, the analogy is all wrong, you are trying to explain simpler things (cars, geometric shapes, etc.) by referring to _very_ complex ones, like life. Every cell has in its DNA all the information necessary to build an entire organism (and probably much more), so even if it's a tree, it's surely an unusual one, with every node as complex as the whole tree. Another fallacy is that you presuppose that there is a classification of all cells in the body other than that of an observer. I'm not sure this is true, like there are N well-defined classes of cells and an unambiguous way to establish the class of cell X, i.e., the same for any observer. There are, as we now know, stem cells, that transform themselves into other kinds of cells and probably many other strange things, otherwise it's difficult to explain how from a single cell all the different cell types develop. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously there are trees/hierarchies in nature, like genealogical trees (or kinship systems if you want to avoid historicality), rivers/tributaries, mountain systems, etc., but these are mainly value-sorted aggregates of uniform objects, and when you try to put some qualitative difference (like in oceans/seas/bays/etc.), you necessarily introduce subjectivity. Main problem is typology, not structure.

(And to the other responder, relational databases for sure are one of the tools that could be used to maintain independent classification structures - but too often the designers mix the classifications in with the data. When used with junction tables (the MS name) to maintain many-to-many relationships, they would be ideal in that classification hierarchies can come and g[r]o[w] independently of the primary data being stored.

        Classification is not necessarily just data, though a classification may have attributes that shape the classification. I could classify a keyboard as a type of computer input device. It has some keys, but its classification embodies more than just its keys. It sends messages to the computer, and even receives signals back. But it is an input device - a special kind of input device. There should be other things other than attributes that apply to one's reasoning when engaging in the process of finding classifications/abstractions.

        XFML looks okay, but is simplistic. In another life, I built a document query system (impenetrably described in <a href="DocQueryInSql.html">DocQueryInSql</a>) which required structured categories (structured facets?) among other things. The point is that we want an associative lookup on attributed facts.
      </p>
      <p>
        XML is a little overinvolved with its hierarchical structures, and thus is very limiting. Any structuring can always be described using a semi-ordered 'key' tuple which describes the (relational) attributes of some data.
      </p>
      <p>
        These attributes may be meaningful (as in a relational database), or may be artificial (as in an explicitly structured approach e.g. objects). Often a mixture.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meaningful approach is less constrained, thus the (potentially) greater power of relational set theory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nevertheless, the most powerful approach is to use a system which supports an arbitrary association of attributes at a single point of observation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, this is the most natural approach when people compose queries, since there is no inhuman structure to deal with.

        <em>If relational can indeed provide "taxonomies on demand", then why is it not more commonly recommended to solve classification debates by making them user-defined or local based on existing attributes? Is it perceived to lack built-in tree-friendly operations for those who want a tree view? Do developers prefer to see the "shape" of their classification in code in order to relate to it better?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Relational can express any taxonomy, since it basically ties things together. It doesn't produce anything as such, it is just an abstraction of knowledge into two basic entities 'things' and 'relationships'. This is my approach anyway. Implementing such systems is surprisingly difficult in relational databases (go figure) as they have loads of added constraints that have no place in the abstract scheme.

(A key is info about the entity, not really a "relationship", although that is probably a matter of semantics.

        Question: Are "types" inherently bound to hierarchies? Is there such thing as set-based types? IOW, are types bound by IS-A, or can they also be HAS-A? Is this off-topic? -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not off-topic, IMHO. Start trying to define types, properties, classes, sets, in terms of each other and you get in a mess. But yes, this gets near to the area of philosophy where ontology and epistemology intersect, which is pretty interesting territory, and difficult; and also easy to argue that it has nothing to do with the history of programming ideas. But databases and file systems have to get organized somehow, and its usually hierarchical in some sense, and usually runs into some limitation or other ...

        A Network is a Graph, a Graph is a set {Nodes,Arcs}, where Nodes is a also set (of nodes) and Arcs a set of tuples, possibly with labels. So representing operating system objects as a network still lets you traverse that network using set-based tools. The question is what are we trying to represent? OS objects? An application? A form in an application? A general domain which many Applications reference (ie Biological objects for a system such as <a href="BlueGene.html">BlueGene</a>?).

        I will agree that membership-based sets don't have very good visual representations (that I have seen). However, this does not limit their usefulness. I suppose we could convert sets into graphs, but the result for non-trivial things is often messy as a visual. That is why I tend to focus on query-ability rather than following pointers around: look at a specific aspect(s) rather than the whole structure.

        What alternative is there to a hierarchy? The only one that I can identify is to have to work with every discriminator simultaneously, whether that discriminator is applicable or not.

        This argument, however, also applies to hierarchies. One does not need to provide every possible categorization with trees, hence the "limit" is no longer valid. Trees exist in database tables as well; linkages between tables can only exist where they are explicitly defined. Linkages between dissimilar columns is possible, though meaningless.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sometimes there is a key(s) or factor(s) that provides a unique result, and sometimes there is not. If a table has a 'parentID' column, clearly there is either zero or one parents (zero if record is already the top-most parent). One may have to deal with the potential of multiple results in some cases. Whether this choice is generally required by the problem domain or is a result of the usage of the wrong structure or paradigm needs further exploring, perhaps on a case-by-case basis. The issue of multiple results is also explored in </em><a href="SetsAndPolymorphism.html">SetsAndPolymorphism</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How does this relate to the limits of hierarchy? Returning 0, 1, or more record sets is the result of a specific operation and does not say anything about the general relationships.

        <em>Doesn't the definition of the keys in a particular table define a hierarchy? Don't the keys defined within a table create a tree?</em>

        Are you talking about implementation of indexes? Perhaps they do, but that is an implementation detail that the developer should not have to concern themselves with. In the future, B-trees may be replaced by a superior indexing technology, for example, and the database should still work with existing code.

        I think Bob Dylan says it all in the title of "You Gotta Serve Somebody". Everything can be viewed as a member of a hierarchy, starting with time or things (or a deity or two). When you feel you are taking a non-hierarchical view of something, you are just ignoring the assumed superset. When we build a room in a house, that is a hierarchy.

        I am a fellow "set" fan. I try to find clean hierarchies that fit the domain, but I just cannot. Exceptions to trees come along and ruin the simplicity of the original hierarchy. Throwing branch layers at the problem only makes it into a sprawling weed, often with duplicate children or at least parts of children. Sets seem more forgiving and don't require one to get it right up front. Until somebody can give specific techniques to find the right hierarchies that don't get beat up by unexpected variations down the road, I cannot bring myself to like them. The people who dictate all the goofy business rules don't seem to respect lasting tree-ness. They want what they want when they want it regardless of whether it troubles our dear trees. Sets do have the drawback of not being easy make a chart of, but I can learn to live with that. One just has to build up tools for set inspection and create nice set conventions. Sets can still emulate trees if by chance you do encounter a pure, lasting tree.

        The advantage of databases, although they don't make full use of set operations), is that they don't impose a world view on data. Any hierarchy instantly limits your world view to something subjective. Let's say I have set of data in tables showing each country and the official languages. Obviously they overlap since Switzerland has 4 official languages. If I put this into a hierarchy, it would impose me to choose country as the top or language. Problem is, for querying, the user may want their own view of the data (and your code may want a view). In some cases, you only want to know which countries speak English, and in others you want to know which languages a country speaks. This becomes worse with more tiers. Say you have a set of countries like the E.U. The more levels/relationships/sets, the more restrictive a hierarchy gets. Objects don't solve this problem either because they create hierarchies that force nouns to be superior over verbs. I.E. try adding a parameter to a method shared by 20 classes. That takes 20 changes instead of 1.

        [That's not a good question. By analogy: if the "solution" can be expressed in a small bit of SQL, then why bother with the complexities of relational? Perhaps it is the complexities of relational that keep the solution small. You should first question to which degree the language's OO nature influences whether the image is 'small and local'.]

        <strong>Hierarchies As Views Of "Flat" Data</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        My perspective on using hierarchies to organize some data is this: a particular hierarchical model is a useful view into a set of data. But the hierarchy should not be the primary way of storing the data. If the data storage is separate from the hierarchical model, and the hierarchy references the data from that separate store, then you can have multiple hierarchical models (either trees or DAGs or whatever) looking at the same data.

        In these examples type (flavor), caffeination and diet are properties of the data members. The data members are referred to in the tree views, but the real data is in the separate Drinks Data area. The views all "share" that data. The hierarchical views can be constructed by hand, or by an automatic query, or whatever. Each of (Diet Data, Caffeine View, Diet View, Types View) happen to be hierarchies, and so you could represent each of those in an XML file or whatever (similar to the bullet lists I wrote above). (But it would work if they were not strict trees, too.)

        I guess this is similar in concept to <a href="NetworkDatabase.html">NetworkDatabase</a> or <a href="ObjectOrientedDatabase.html">ObjectOrientedDatabase</a>, except that the core data store (Drinks Data) is effectively a relational table of properties, so you can search that with the power and efficiency of relational databases.

        <em>One could say that you want a tree-based report writer or browser that can project selected factors into a tree for exploration purposes. I see nothing wrong with such a concept because it is only a temporary view and is not imposing a tree as the native structure of the info. The "banded" kind of report writers can do this by allowing you to select which factor goes on which level. However, it often requires extra preprocessing in practice to get data into a form that the report writer likes. As far as what view the user wants, a tree of the above would be a bit awkward in my opinion. Some kind of </em><a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> with pull-down lists with an "any" option (or radio buttons) for each choice may be more appropriate.<em></em>

        (Actually, check-boxes could be used instead of radio buttons for even more flexibility, because we are allowing multiple potential matches.)
