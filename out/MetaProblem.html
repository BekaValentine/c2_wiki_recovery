        Meta Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MetaProblem.html">MetaProblem</a>:  The set of all problems that make up a single problem-- the one you have to solve.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="MetaProblem.html">MetaProblem</a>, for instance, could be "Allow any arbitrary script in any language(<a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, &c) to execute and be executed by the ObjectiveCeeRuntime as <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> code".  Big!  But... this problem is easily factored into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Implement a generic interface to the runtime.
        </li>
        <li>
           Implement a parser to read in scripts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first of which can be factored into:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Implement an API for calling of methods of <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> objects
        </li>
        <li>
           Implement an API for addition of new methods to the runtime
        </li>
        <li>
           Implement an API for addition of classes to the runtime
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        None of these new problems is especially daunting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, a scary <a href="MetaProblem.html">MetaProblem</a> is reduced into tiny little problems that can be easily solved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the foundation, I would argue, of all applied learning.  We don't learn how to solve new <a href="MetaProblem.html">MetaProblem</a>s:  we learn how to break <a href="MetaProblem.html">MetaProblem</a>s into known problems, and fix them.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was helping to teach little kids(1st-4th grade) at an accelerated math course, I was constantly harping on how the "new" material was really just old material put together--especially with fractions arithmetic.  Similarly to how compositions of simple objects or combinations of simple rules can produce interesting results, any non-primitive mathematical or algorithmic problem is just a bunch of smaller problems in disguise.  "Prove that the sum of the lengths of the two legs of a right triangle squared is equal to the length of the hypoteneuse squared" is a collection of problems solved by the individual lines of the proof.  The only "new" knowledge needed is how to break the <a href="MetaProblem.html">MetaProblem</a> into normal problems.  The tools and heuristics for gaining that knowledge, then, are the ones that we develop as we program.  What's a good name for the <a href="MetaProblem.html">MetaProblem</a>-solving skill?
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what I think, at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        This sort of thing is common sense, one might say, but it's good to take note of.
      </p>

        Contrast with MeatProblem(A joke, but if someone wants to carry it on...).

        This sounds like a <a href="TopDown.html">TopDown</a> approach, but perhaps the <a href="MetaProblem.html">MetaProblem</a> is more interesting than (an) approach used to solve it? -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>

        This isn't really a <em>meta</em> problem - that would be a problem about problems. It's really a <em>super</em>problem. Maybe.

        <em>You caught me.  The metaproblem might be 'how do we solve problems?'.  Agreed?--</em><a href="JoeOsborn.html">JoeOsborn</a><em></em>
