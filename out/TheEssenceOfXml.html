        The Essence Of Xml
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the seminal papers on XML, by <a href="PhilipWadler.html">PhilipWadler</a> and Jerome Simeon. <a href="http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/xml-essence/xml-essence.pdf">http://homepages.inf.ed.ac.uk/wadler/papers/xml-essence/xml-essence.pdf</a>
      </p>

        Because many people discuss XML related issues here without much awareness of what's in this paper is worth giving it a wiki name, a short summary and maybe some discussions.

        <strong>The main ideas from the paper.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        What is XML ? XML is an "external" format for representing data. It is external in the sense that it is not particular to any programming language or software system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper asserts that 2 keys property are required of any such format :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>self describing</strong>. The xml document should be enough to unambiguously get the data.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>round tripping</strong>. Converting the data from internal representation in a software system (such as an object inside a Java application server, structures within C runtime, rows within Oracle tables, etc) to XML and back again, should yield the same data. In other words : 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        data == DecodeFromXML(EncodeToXML(data))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        An example of a data format with these 2 properties is Lisp <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a>. Although XML comes close to having these properties it fails on both account. So According to Wadler, Simeon (and many many others) the essence of xml is this:
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>the problem it solves is not hard and it does not solve the problem well.</strong><br/>
      </code>
