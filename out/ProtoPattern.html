        Proto Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> is a "wanna-be" pattern.  It is something documented in a pattern form, but lacks supporting known uses. (Also see:
        <a href="SafeLoop.html">SafeLoop</a>, <a href="BuckStopsHere.html">BuckStopsHere</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Finding those gems of "good" code, "good" design, or "good" whatever (see the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>) is what <a href="PatternMining.html">PatternMining</a> is all about.  Sometimes you think you have discovered a "new" pattern, which really means that it is so-far undocumented.  According to the <a href="RuleOfThree.html">RuleOfThree</a>, a pattern must be <a href="UsedThreeTimes.html">UsedThreeTimes</a> before it can really be called a "pattern". (ValidationThroughImplementation)
      </p>
      <p>
        With a <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> you can document a concept in a pattern form, and be awaiting the blessing of at least two other uses before being canonized as a Pattern.  These <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s may be published (like here on Wiki), where others may say "Yeah!  I've done that before!" and thus provide the much needed use case support the <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s, submitted for review in such a way, provide people not only with a means of documentation, but a channel for validation.  Many simply don't have the depth of experience or time for supporting research to find those other known uses of the pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        The catch is that <strong>everyone</strong> must agree that they are <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s.  Some safeguard must be in place so that the readers do not believe that they are <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a> before they really are <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a>. I believe that this means that we must label <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s as such, clearly and unambiguously.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pattern that has not been <a href="UsedThreeTimes.html">UsedThreeTimes</a>, or does not have any <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a>, should always be labeled and called a <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>.

        I am starting to think that most of what we call <strong>Patterns</strong> are really <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s. Some software patterns may have been used dozens of times, but are still suspect.  I tend to have more faith in organizational patterns (and programming idioms) than in software architecture/design patterns.  Do we have enough success stories in our software architecture and design efforts to catalog them as Patterns, teach them as <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a> and then move on?
      </p>
      <p>
        What if the <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a> is really <a href="BadProvenPractice.html">BadProvenPractice</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a> (not trying to start another argument).
      </p>
      <p>
        No argument here!  I agree that there are probably many patterns out there documenting current <a href="BadProvenPractice.html">BadProvenPractice</a>.  However, that is <strong>still</strong> a pattern.  Maybe this is another thing patterns can be used for: documenting current practice, not just to teach solutions, but to <em>re-evaluate</em> the solutions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s can serve as a first-step.  Since there is no <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a>, good or bad, it can go either way for the pattern.  But at least there is a wider audience that can review or try the <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> <em>before</em> it gets set in stone as a "good thing."  This could cut down on the amount of "new" patterns that actually provide bad solutions.

        Sometimes it can help merely to identify potential <a href="PatternComponent.html">PatternComponent</a>s.

      <p>
        My reading of <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> (and <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a>) suggests that any putative pattern makes sense only in the context of another pattern. Could it be that when we use evaluative words like "good" and "bad", or debate "proven" versus "proto", we could be identifying differences in the <em>context</em> of the alleged pattern in question?
      </p>
      <p>
        In that spirit, let me offer a heuristic (perhaps someone can make it into a pattern...), as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Each pattern is a kind of AbstractPattern.
        </li>
        <li>
           Each AbstractPattern has an attribute called its <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a> that contains an AbstractPattern.
        </li>
        <li>
           A LivePattern is an AbstractPattern that has the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           A DeadPattern is an AbstractPattern that lacks the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           A ComposedPattern is an AbstractPattern that is comprised of AbstractPatterns (though I purposely leave the meaning of "comprised of" vague).
        </li>
        <li>
           A <a href="PrimitivePattern.html">PrimitivePattern</a> is an AbstractPattern for which no component patterns have been identified.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a> of a LivePattern is always a LivePattern. This means that an AbstractPattern can only become a LivePattern if its <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a> is also a LivePattern.
        </li>
        <li>
           There exists some PatternContextContext, whose <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a> is itself, and which is a LivePattern (by construction). My intent here is to mirror the loop at the top of the Smalltalk metaclass hierarchy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the context of this heuristic, I would describe a related family of AbstractPattern descendents:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           PatternPractice: An AbstractPattern together with its <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           NeoPractice: A PatternPractice that has been UsedNoTimes.
        </li>
        <li>
           ProtoPractice: A PatternPractice that has been UsedOneTime.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a>: A PatternPractice that has been UsedManyTimes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Since every PatternPractice includes both the pattern and its <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a>, any <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a> with Pattern A and <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a> B becomes a NeoPractice when either A or B is changed to C.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within this framework, any PatternPractice (whether Neo, Proto, or Proven) can be described as bad if it fails to work and good if it works. I leave the definition of "work" as an exercise for the reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, as described by <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> (and referenced above by <a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>), might be a PatternPractice that can be shown not to work with ANY <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I chose UsedManyTimes instead of <a href="UsedThreeTimes.html">UsedThreeTimes</a> because I'm not sure that there's any magic in "three"...there's another pattern here in Wiki [(<a href="TwoIsAnImpossibleNumber.html">TwoIsAnImpossibleNumber</a>)] that talks about counting as "zero, one, many".
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope I've captured the spirit of <a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a>'s point here: A <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a> that has been demonstrated to work a large number of times <em>in certain contexts</em> might still not work at all in other contexts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, since a <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a> is itself an AbstractPattern (either composed or primitive), a <a href="PatternContext.html">PatternContext</a> of an existing good <a href="ProvenPractice.html">ProvenPractice</a> might change if someone discovers a subpattern of one of its <a href="PrimitivePattern.html">PrimitivePattern</a> components (and every AbstractPattern must have at least ONE <a href="PrimitivePattern.html">PrimitivePattern</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        My intent in this last point is to emphasize that the good- or bad- ness of EVERY pattern can change, no matter how many times its been used, when someone identifies or discovers additional structure within itself or its context.
      </p>
      <p>
        I hope this helps...

      </p>
      <p>
        Some Patterns in <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> have been described as 
        <em>sometimes an </em><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a><em>.</em>
        (<a href="CargoCult.html">CargoCult</a> is an example.) I think I prefer that something be one or the other or neither, but not both! --<a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        Can the <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s concept be used more then just as a PatternWannaBe? 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the great advantages of using the patterns form has been certain parts of our designs now have a well explained rationale.  We know what the "forces" are and how they affect the "particular solution". In short we know and write down much of the "why" of the design. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The comparison between building architecture and software architecture has also led to comparisons between blueprints and software modeling languages such as the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a>. However UML, like blueprints, does not in my opinion capture the rationale or the "why" aspect of things. Maybe the <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> concept can be used to supplement the "blue prints" we use to create software. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s do not have the same form as patterns. Perhaps relevant additions and subtractions must be made to the <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s concept? In fact, the concept itself may be a pattern --<a href="UmarSyyid.html">UmarSyyid</a>
