        Arabic Folk Tales
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of my children's favourite <a href="ArabicFolkTales.html">ArabicFolkTales</a> is this short story from Iraq.
        i
        Bahlul is one of the well known 'fools' of Arabic folklore, the prototype of the 'learned idiot'.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bahlul and the Sweetmeats</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Once Bahlul was included among the guests at a sumptuous banquet in the house of a wealthy merchant. Among the delicacies that were offered was a dish of Damascene nougat. <em>What is this?</em> asked a fellow diner.
        <em>I don't know</em>, said Bahlul, <em>but I have heard people say that the most exquisite thing on earth is a bath. This, I think, must be a bath!</em>
