        The idea is to code your intentions into printf statements and observe the dynamic behaviour before writing bunches of code.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can start with some pseudo code in comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once some of it is ready to run you can wrap the comments in printf statements.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you see is messages telling you whats going to happen when its all working !
      </p>
      <p>
        you can also embellish the printf comments with messages to yourself like "NOT IMPLEMENTED", "UNDER CONSTRUCTION", "UNDER TEST" etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its like building a model of the code you intend to write, and testing the model beforehand.

        This is a useful pattern, but it it does not work when the code is supposed
        to compute some value. You can <em>print</em> that you want to return the 
        LU-factorisation of some matrix, but you cannot return it until you
        actually wrote the code. For these cases, you can use <a href="BottomUpProgramming.html">BottomUpProgramming</a>.
