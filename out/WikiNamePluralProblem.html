        Wiki Name Plural Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        I create the topic <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> and its associated page. Then somewhere I refer to <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> and discover that this doesn't refer to the page I thought it did. -- Stefan Kapusniak
      </p>
      <p>
        The two pages are different because they have different names. The general convention is to name pages in the singular unless the plural form is all that would normally be used. Sometimes, the flow of a sentence would lead one to prefer a plural name. In this case, one can revise the sentence, omit the link, or use an adulterated plural such as a parenthesized or italicized ending. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        The <a href="WikiNamePluralProblem.html">WikiNamePluralProblem</a> is that the Wiki engine generates separate pages for

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One day, someone may refactor the <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a>, MindMaps and <a href="MindMapping.html">MindMapping</a> pages into just the <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a> page, and apply this solution to all links to MindMaps and <a href="MindMapping.html">MindMapping</a>. But don't hold your breath...
      </p>
      <p>
        Make plural names link to singular page names by putting <a href="SixSingleQuotes.html">SixSingleQuotes</a> in between the name and the <em>s</em>, like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s
        </li>

           <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a>s
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a>ping
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Some Possessive Discussion</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Regrettably, <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>'s shadows <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>'s possessive form. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, no. It makes sense. Just like the "80's" has an apostrophe - <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> is an atomic symbol (as a link) and not a word (as long as you squint at it). So using an apostrophe fits with the whole concept. And it works. -- <a href="IanBicking.html">IanBicking</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to be a pedant, but the <year>'s was initially used to refer to the <year>'s music, or whatever.
        The "80's" is possessive. It's just used improperly by so many people these days. -- <a href="EdGrimm.html">EdGrimm</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Untrue on the <year>'s issue. Look up the letter "A" in your dictionary. One of the plural forms will be "A's". As I understand it, this is one of the <a href="EnglishLanguage.html">EnglishLanguage</a>'s  better attempts at a <a href="UseMention.html">UseMention</a> distinction: numbers, letters, and anything else that appears not to be <em>used</em> to signify something else (There were 80 houses on the street), but as a <em>mention</em> of the signifier itself (Due to an error, there were two number 75's on the corner) takes on an apostrophe before the s. -- <a href="DavidSaff.html">DavidSaff</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is "the eighties" an example of this kind of usage, though? I suppose one could argue that it is. In Spanish, they sometimes say <em>los ochenta</em>: a plural article with a singular noun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree about <a href="UseMention.html">UseMention</a>. But still <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>'s seems ungrammatical/misleading/incorrect to my personal in-built parser, but on the other hand so does <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>.

        Everyone should read <a href="EatsShootsAndLeaves.html">EatsShootsAndLeaves</a> before fretting over this too much. There is a lot of good information in there, and if you care enough to edit this page, you'll care enough to read the book. The biggest thing I took from it is this: The most important goal of punctuation is to clarify the language for the reader. There are some rules that do not make sense, but are accepted as correct. I always choose the clearer, more straightforward version of the rule instead. This is one of those cases. Despite being 'acceptable', and listed in books as such, the excess use of apostrophes in English (especially American English) is an abomination. In most cases, it doesn't clarify anything. Anyway, read the book for more general punctuation ranting. As far as the topic at hand goes, <a href="SixSingleQuotes.html">SixSingleQuotes</a> is awkward syntax, but the trimming of the 's' is what needs to be done. -- PhilipMaynard

        What about the converse problem? I created a page with a plural name, and there's no way to refer to it in the singular. I expect the answer is to never use plural names. I don't recall coming across a recommendation of this when I was learning the system. I'll check again, and add it somewhere if I can't find it. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        Dictum: "Consider using the singular form attributively."
      </p>
      <p>
        Exegesis: By this I mean that when a plural sense is desired, it is normally possible to use the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> attributively, (like an adjective). In English, this eliminates the need for weird punctuation or inflections, and is often more precise, anyway. Maybe English is the only language in which attributive use of nouns, and substantive use of adjectives is practically a built-in feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: My grandfather, an avid reader of The New York Times, saved every issue. When writing to a dealer in ephemera, I might be tempted to describe the collection as "a pile of old Timeses". Following the above dictum, I can more precisely state, "There is at least one copy of every issue of the Times."

My <a href="SolutionOfTheWikiNamePluralProblem.html">SolutionOfTheWikiNamePluralProblem</a> also takes into account the cases of SecurityPolicies linking to SecurityPolicy, and StateTaxes linking to StateTax.

        WikiChild and WikiChildren isn't a problem. However, WildGoose and WildGeese can be mistaken.

      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. Then we can use RonJeffrie or RonJeffri if we want to refer to you in the singular form. Or was that RonJeffry? *smile*  -- <a href="MarnixKlooster.html">MarnixKlooster</a>

        Actually, I had in mind that it would prefer the plural if it existed, something like this:

        | page singular |<br/>
        page  := self<br/>

        ifAbsent: [nil].<br/>
        page isNil ifFalse: [^page].<br/>
        aString last = $s ifFalse: [^page].<br/>
        singular := aString<br/>
        copyFrom: 1<br/>

        What about writing a synonym flag into a wiki page, which points to the canonical version.

        I propose we auto direct bad names to good names by adding a rule that says if a page consists of nothing but whitespace, punctuation, the word "see", and a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, the Wiki engine automatically jumps to the target.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the page contains anything else, it lives. For example, UnitTests talks about the philosophy, and <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> talks about the technology of one test. <em>(Well, it did until its content was refactored into </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My rule would cure all the pages that currently only say "see". And if you then want to upgrade that page itself, you'd type the "?Edit=" URL by hand. The Editor would not invoke the "see" rule.

        What about adding markup functionality for synomymes like: LoveChildren=LoveChild or LoveChildren{LoveChild}?

Maybe it could be possible to define pages from one-word <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s by writing {Microsoft} (instead of <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> or the incorrect <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>).

        BTW: I think the idea of the server guessing plural form from singular (or vice versa) is totally ludicrous. This would lock Wiki to the English language forever.

      <p>
        What insanity... <a href="UseMod.html">UseMod</a> has forwards, and JSPWiki can map plurals to singulars. Ward is apparently running an experiment in how long a wholly unmaintained codebase can remain viable, because technical solutions to this problem exist that are far better than manually chasing down every link and changing them.

      </p>
      <p>
        The wiki we use here at work has forwarding, and that completely emasculates searches. Mapping plurals to singulars is also implemented and suffers the same problem. We have now made a company-wide decision specifically not to use the technical solutions and instead to get people to do what people are good at - making decisions. Fixing the original reference ensures that searches work the way they ought, and recycles pages into the attention span of the company.

        Imho, this shows a problem in the searching more than the forwarding.

        It would seem to me that if there is anybody who is bothered by the <a href="WikiNamePluralProblem.html">WikiNamePluralProblem</a> (as in <a href="AlarmBellPhrase.html">AlarmBellPhrase</a> vs <a href="AlarmBellPhrases.html">AlarmBellPhrases</a>) that it would not be those who fashion themselves to be programmers.

        <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> programmers can easily discern the difference between a class and an instantiation of that class, an have little trouble in using both, and to extend that use by building structure on structure and employing morphing techniques to shape related usages.

        An <a href="AlarmBellPhrase.html">AlarmBellPhrase</a> page should in my opinion the definition of what it is that identifies a phrase as causing an Alarm bell to sound in the discerner's ears.

      <p>
        If one is to allow for it, an <a href="AlarmBellPhrases.html">AlarmBellPhrases</a> page should contain a collection of phrases meeting the definition and criteria of an <a href="AlarmBellPhrase.html">AlarmBellPhrase</a>.

        One might also point out that programming conventions such as overloading, overriding, and scope, violate the OnceOnly principle in general programming. It seems that in actual usage, even among <a href="ExtremeProgrammer.html">ExtremeProgrammer</a>s it is UseAsManyTimeAsYouNeedTo, and ItDoesntReferToTheSameThingEvenThoughItUsesTheSameName. The actual practice of reuse (of names such as i, j, k, x, y, z, m, n, args, int, float, string, and so forth make one cry out "What do you mean once?" Object? Instance? Method? Module? Program? I'm afraid this one is just a buzzword which crys out <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> on context and the reply to which is not often more than a nod of the head, which may mean IAgree, IUnderstand, or IHaveThatPattern, but which most often only means, IhearYouContinue. To me OnceOnly has no singular,concrete, and definitive meaning. If you mean "RemoveDuplication", or "ReduceComplexity", or TheWheelAlreadyExists, say so!
