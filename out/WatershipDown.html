        Hardback: ISBN 068483605X, paperback: ISBN 0380002930 or ISBN 0060935456] Adams' comfort zone, in a whispery fluffy-wuffy language, revolves around epic sagas of primitive spiritual folks. This, his most popular work, reveals the Exodus of a group of pilgrims who flee their ancestral home after receiving a vision of its destruction. They endure the rigors of crossing a land remade by humans, seeking a new home in a safe place. Along this road they lose their innocence encountering the horrors of lapine capitalism, and of lapine communism. But they win thru by learning from their experiences & reusing these in new combinations, and by forging mutually beneficial alliances with other creatures along their way.

        <em>Interesting how this review never mentions that the pilgrims are anthropomorphic rabbits (the cover should make it a bit obvious </em>as does "lapine", like hares and rabbits<em>).   The political interpretations of this book are fairly obvious to many, and it became something of an intelligensia hit for that reason... The book has become something of a favorite of Libertarians, with the societies they encounter tending more to extremes of decadence and passivity to rigid and authoritarian, rather than along socio-economic lines.</em>

        Adams also performs the Tolkienian feat of introducing a new language, so well that towards the end we understand what the curse <em>silflay hraka u embleer rah</em> means without even realizing it. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        Made into a not-half-bad animated movie, and a not-detestable cartoon series.

        The sequel to this book, _Tales From Watership Down_ is pure treacle, and not worthy of the original book (and frankly not worth the space on the shelf either).
