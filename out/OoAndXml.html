        Oo And Xml

        <strong>Question:</strong> Several remarks on the <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a> page lump together <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> and <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a>.  Is there a natural fit between the two?  Have the relational guys identified a pattern?
      </p>

        <em>They are both non-relational, A.K.A. "navigational" (a combination of graphs and trees/nesting) in relational-speak. Whether that is enough to lump them together probably depends on your world viewpoint. It would probably be easier to map XML structures one-to-one to objects than to relational tables. In that sense, they are somewhat similar.</em>

        Well, to state the obvious, the <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> and <a href="ObjectOrientedProgrammingLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedProgrammingLanguage</a>s are similar in that both are capable of expressing the structure (and state) of an object model.  But, the complement of the <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> with respect to <a href="ObjectOrientedProgrammingLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedProgrammingLanguage</a>s is executable behavior encapsulated with that structure and state into classes or hierarchies thereof.  Therefore it feels mistaken to me to equate them.  XML is a markup language.  OOPLs are programming languages.  I'm sure somebody has already invented a schema for expressing the logic and invocation of object methods in XML, and a machine for executing programs encoded as documents in that schema.  But isn't that just inventing a new OOPL using XML syntax?  --<a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>

        <em>On the other hand, I have seen a columnist who writes about XML supporting views that OO is less suited than functional languages in processing XML data</em> --<a href="MicrosoftSlave.html">MicrosoftSlave</a>

      <p>
        True, but on the argument that <a href="XmlIsaPoorCopyOfEssExpressions.html">XmlIsaPoorCopyOfEssExpressions</a> then if you've got <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, why bother using XML at all?  Based on that line, OO would be a natural fit for XML precisely because it's only okay at handling it.  There's some stuff about this at the bottom of <a href="SymbioticLanguages.html">SymbioticLanguages</a>.

        You have ObjectXmlMapping s similar to <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> s (with all the attendant controversy) see <a href="XmlAcceptorPattern.html">XmlAcceptorPattern</a>, <a href="OpenAdaptorXml.html">OpenAdaptorXml</a> etc. Sometimes you need all together ie a web application that presents different views to different devices:
      </p>
      <code>
        [<a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>]-->[<a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a>]-->[<a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> <a href="BusinessLogic.html">BusinessLogic</a>]<br/>
        |<br/>
        [Desktop,PDA,Mobile Phone]<--[XSLT]<--[ObjectXmlMapping]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        XML in my opinion just makes information easier to share between organizations and/or devices by having a standard (better than EDI anyway) but processing should be done by <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> code (C++, Java etc). You can have <a href="XmlDatabase.html">XmlDatabase</a> or <a href="ObjectOrientedDatabase.html">ObjectOrientedDatabase</a> at the back end but most of what is deployed is still relational (feel free to offer statistics as to how fast this is changing). So you need these bridges between technologies. Hopefully in the future this will converge to something simpler. See also <a href="MultiTierArchitecture.html">MultiTierArchitecture</a>.

        Yes, it's called SOAP or <a href="SimpleObjectAccessProtocol.html">SimpleObjectAccessProtocol</a>.

        <em>SOAP doesn't support the expression of the </em>'logic<em>' of object methods, does it?  Only their invocation.</em>
