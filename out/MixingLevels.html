        Mixing Levels
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MixingLevels.html">MixingLevels</a> is applying a part of a <a href="LevelOfAbstraction.html">LevelOfAbstraction</a> to a part of another <a href="LevelOfAbstraction.html">LevelOfAbstraction</a>.
        Using <a href="ConceptsOutOfContext.html">ConceptsOutOfContext</a> or a <a href="LevelCategoryError.html">LevelCategoryError</a> is usually the consequence of doing so.

        <dd>I was thinking of writing this up as a pattern, but <a href="PrinciplesAreNotPatterns.html">PrinciplesAreNotPatterns</a>. That is, this phenonemon is too abstract to be pattern, it's probably an AntiPrinciple.</dd>

        <dd>On the <a href="FreeWill.html">FreeWill</a> page, Michael Brazier made the claim <em>"if reality is totally mechanical at one level of abstraction, it must be equally mechanical at all higher levels of abstraction too."</em>. For a compatibilist, this is another example of <a href="MixingLevels.html">MixingLevels</a> (and the first one I encountered, while reading <a href="GoedelEscherBach.html">GoedelEscherBach</a>). (Is <a href="http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014SECT1">http://www.rep.routledge.com/article/V014SECT1</a> a good explanation of compatibilism ?)</dd>

        <dd>On the <a href="AlgorithmsThatDemandGarbageCollection.html">AlgorithmsThatDemandGarbageCollection</a> page, <a href="CurtisBartley.html">CurtisBartley</a> claimed that <em>"Perl and Python both use ref-counting to do memory management, without requiring any special work on the part of the programmer.</em>". He was mixing the C and Perl/Python levels here.</dd>

        <dd>Just because individual dogs are alive, that doesn't mean that the entire Canine species, considered as a single thing, is a living thing. (<a href="SelfReplication.html">SelfReplication</a>)</dd>

        <dd>Just because a source file cannot hold another copy of the source file inside itself does not mean that self-printing programs are impossible.</dd>

        I could come up with some more, but I think these adequately demonstrate this is a pretty common phenonemon. However, I do not understand why this is the case. Any thoughts?
