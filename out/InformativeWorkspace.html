        Informative Workspace
      </h1>
      <p>
        Your workspace should be about your team and your project.  A person should be able to walk into your project space and get a very clear sense of what you are working on and where you are up to.  Big Visible Charts, a story wall, vision statements all help to get across your message to others. It also keeps the team focused on what they are they to do
