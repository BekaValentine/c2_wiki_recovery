        <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is about doing, and watching as you do.  It can only be examined effectively if you are at the same time experiencing it.
      </p>

        I've been immersed in XP for the past two years, in a very real sense more than any of the [other] <a href="ExtremeProgrammingMaster.html">ExtremeProgrammingMaster</a>s.  XP is not about reason, it is not about methodology, it is not about science.  It is about getting in touch with what the universe tells you about how things are going.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had to unlearn a lot in order to do XP.  I still know too much.

        You will see this material again.  This is the best I can do, for now, at expressing the truth.
