        Observe and follow <a href="HigherPrinciples.html">HigherPrinciples</a> would be a good start in choosing <a href="LifePatterns.html">LifePatterns</a>.

        As noted in the quote in <a href="SelfManagement.html">SelfManagement</a>, we choose our habits, and then the habits form us. So make sure the <a href="HigherPrinciples.html">HigherPrinciples</a> we choose are indeed valid and more valuable then others.

        Often we are embroiled in <a href="NarcissismOfSmallDifferences.html">NarcissismOfSmallDifferences</a> without being too conscious of it. It can be argued that <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s started out that way.

        Maybe <a href="MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds.html">MaslowsHierarchyOfNeeds</a> is a place to look for ideas? A later section pertaining to "Wiki <a href="HigherPrinciples.html">HigherPrinciples</a>" may be of more practical and immediate utility.

        <strong>A scary thought</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have seen lots of material with "listen to the heart" type of slant. Books like "<a href="SoulOfAnOrganization.html">SoulOfAnOrganization</a>", "<a href="TheHeartOfChange.html">TheHeartOfChange</a>", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Came across to me these <em>might</em> work if we have been immersed in education of virtuous <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> when we were young. But the younger generation is taught <em>"</em><a href="AnythingGoes.html">AnythingGoes</a>"<em> instead.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When a 38yo CEO of a large company starts to listen to his heart, what will his heart tell him?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>I am scared.</strong>
