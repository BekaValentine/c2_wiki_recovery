        Liaison Economy
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is the theory that cheap overseas educated labor will eventually turn the US, or at least IT, into a "liaison economy". Our work will no longer be "heads down" coding or face-in-the-machine technical fiddling. We'll be the liaison between the heads-down overseas laborer and internal or external "customers" local to your organization. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this theory, labor-intensive thinking and analysis is most economically done by less expensive overseas labor, and IT experts in the US will be the liaison contact point between end-users of the technology and the overseas coder/techie. This liaison work will include bug tracking, feature requests, QA, clarification, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        This change will require a wider skill set, including "soft skills" such as social interaction, and domain knowledge.
