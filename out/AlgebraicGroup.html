        Algebraic Group
      </h1>
      <p>
        A group in modern algebra is a set G combined with a <a href="BinaryOperator.html">BinaryOperator</a>, "*", often called the "group multiplication" where the following four axioms are satisfied -
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Closure - if g, h are in G then g*h is in G. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Associative - if g*(h*j) = (g*h)*j for any g,h,j in G. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Identity - There is an element, e in G such that g*e = e*g = g for all g in G. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Inverse - For any g in G, there exists g^-1 in G such that g*(g^-1) = (g^-1)*g = e. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Examples include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The set of integers with the operation of addition.
        </li>
        <li>
           The set of positive rational numbers with the operation of multiplication.
        </li>
        <li>
           The set with the single element <strong>1</strong> and the operation * defined so that <strong>1</strong>*<strong>1</strong>=<strong>1</strong>  (The <em>trivial group</em>)
        </li>
        <li>
           The set of all rigid movements of a square:
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Flip the square vertically
        </li>
        <li>
           Flop the square horizontally
        </li>
        <li>
           Flip the square across the northeast-southwest diagonal
        </li>
        <li>
           Flip the square across the northwest-southeast diagonal
        </li>
        <li>
           Rotate the square 90 degrees clockwise
        </li>
        <li>
           Rotate the square 180 degrees
        </li>
        <li>
           Rotate the square 90 degrees counterclockwise
        </li>
        <li>
           Leave the square alone
        </li>
      </ol>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>and the operation 'and then'. For example, combining items 5 and 2, we get 'rotate the square ninety degrees clockwise, and then flip it over horizontally'; the result of this operation is the same as item 3.)</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Some non-examples include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The set of positive integers with the operation of subtraction. (The operation is not closed, because 7-12 is not a positive integer.)
        </li>
        <li>
           The set of all integers with the operation of subtraction.  (The operation is not associative, since 7-(5-1) is not the same as (7-5)-1.)
        </li>
        <li>
           The set of positive integers with the operation of addition. (There is no identity element)
        </li>
        <li>
           The set of integers with the operation of multiplication.  (The identity is 1, but the element 0 has no inverse.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note that the property <em>g</em>*<em>h</em> = <em>h</em>*<em>g</em> is <em>not</em> required. If this property holds for all <em>g</em> and <em>h</em>, the operation is said to be <em>commutative</em> and the group is an <a href="AbelianGroup.html">AbelianGroup</a>.  The rigid-movements-of-a-square example above is an example of a non-abelian group. All groups with 5 or fewer elements are Abelian.
