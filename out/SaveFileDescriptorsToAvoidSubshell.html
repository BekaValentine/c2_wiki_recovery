        Save File Descriptors To Avoid Subshell
      </h1>
      <p>
        The encapsulation of subshell processes makes it difficult for them to communicate through <a href="ShellVariables.html">ShellVariables</a> with the rest of the system. Consider the following fragment of Shell code:
      </p>
      <code>
        while<br/>
        read line<br/>
        do<br/>
        lastline=$line;<br/>
        done < $TMPFILE<br/>
        echo "Last line is $lastline"<br/>
        read stdinline<br/>
        echo "Next Line of stdin is $stdinline"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In this case, the variable <em>$lastline</em> is lost through the creation of a subshell to perform the I/O redirection for the while loop. Yet, at the same time, the conditions associated with Use Exec To Avoid Sub Shell are not met, since the <strong>read stdinline</strong> references standard input after the I/O redirection had taken place.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Save file descriptors to avoid a subshell. The following code saves the stdin file descriptor in file descriptor 3, and restores it after the <em>exec</em>.
      </p>
      <code>
        exec 3<&0 <$TMPFILE<br/>
        while<br/>
        read line<br/>
        do<br/>
        lastline=$line;<br/>
        done<br/>
        echo "Last line is $lastline"<br/>
        exec 0<&3 3<&-<br/>
        read stdinline<br/>
        echo "Next Line of stdin is $stdinline"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Notes</strong>:
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a variant of <a href="UseExecToAvoidSubshell.html">UseExecToAvoidSubshell</a> that works for the case that the <strong>stdin/stdout/stderr</strong> that is being redirected will be needed again. This is the technique the Korn shell uses to avoid the problems associated with creating subshells to perform I/O redirection.
      </p>
      <p>
        there are subtle differences between different unix shells: the above example does not fail to set the lastline variable in bash, because bash executes the last command in a pipeline within the process of the shell itself. the variable would be lost if the while-loop is redirected to another command, though.
