        Schools have a colossal need for collaborative text editing.  The immediate need here in Maine is curriculum edit due to standards based initiatives.  Everything is changing so rapidly. How do we keep track of it all?  <a href="FreeWikisForSchools.html">FreeWikisForSchools</a> seems like a good answer - post all the curriculum here, and turn the whole staff loose on it.
