        Fish Shell
      </h1>
      <p>
        A very nice POSIX shell with its own simple programming language.  It emphasises:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) orthogonality ... one aspect of which is that the fish shell is configured using small programs written in itself, as much as possible
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) making it easy to get help
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) making good defaults and sticking to them unless specifically overwritten by a user's code ... hence its motto <a href="ConfigurabilityIsTheRootOfAllEvil.html">ConfigurabilityIsTheRootOfAllEvil</a>.
