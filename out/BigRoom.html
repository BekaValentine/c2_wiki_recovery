        Big Room
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Big Room is the extremely large room with the blue ceiling and intensely bright light during the day, and the black ceiling with lots of tiny night-lights during the night. It is found outside all computer installations. (From the <a href="JargonFile.html">JargonFile</a>.) It is one aspect of the <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a>.

        That's the normal definition. I live in Scotland, where the big room has a grey ceiling and fairly bright light during the day. -- <a href="NeilGall.html">NeilGall</a>

        Reminds me of that Billy Connolly joke in which he takes his (LA-reared) kids on a visit home to Glasgow - "Daddy, why's the sky so low?"
