        Entity Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        The relationship between two or more distinct elements (Entities) in a System. For example, one could say that a particular job Function is carried out according to a specific Procedure. Therefore Function and Procedure have a defined relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well...  they may have a relationship.  Whether it is or should be 'defined' is another question.  Is it not odd that an </em><a href="EntityModel.html">EntityModel</a> should 'be' a relationship?  A relationship implies two or more entities (in an <a href="EntityRelationshipModel.html">EntityRelationshipModel</a>, that is). So an <a href="EntityModel.html">EntityModel</a> may be:<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A representation of two or more entities and the relationships between them.  The entities will typically have unique names and the relationships will typically have defined for them, as a minimum, optionality and cardinality.</em>
