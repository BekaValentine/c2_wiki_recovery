        Much has changed since Feb02 when the page was created. For example, in late 04 a product called "GlobeTrotter Fusion" has capabilities to connect to various <a href="WirelessNetwork.html">WirelessNetwork</a>s, <a href="ThirdGeneration.html">ThirdGeneration</a> (3G), <a href="GeneralPacketRadioService.html">GeneralPacketRadioService</a> (GSM/GPRS), <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a>, etc. Give it another couple years and one can expect affordable <a href="BroadbandWirelessAccess.html">BroadbandWirelessAccess</a> addons to emerge. See <a href="http://www.wirelessdevnet.com/news/2005/jun/30/news6.html">http://www.wirelessdevnet.com/news/2005/jun/30/news6.html</a>

        In mid 05, the above is already superseded by another product; see <a href="http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2005/06/13/sony_ericsson_gc99/.">http://www.channelregister.co.uk/2005/06/13/sony_ericsson_gc99/.</a>
