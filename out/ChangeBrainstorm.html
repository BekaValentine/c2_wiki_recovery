      <p>
        Spotting smells is valuable, but tough.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, each programmer learns to spot certain kinds of smells. (For example, someone who has had to change a nasty, many-duplicated glob of HTML will be on guard against duplicating globs of HTML again. Instead of copy & pasting, they'll consider adding a method or an object to generate it for them.)
      </p>
      <p>
        However, each programmer has developed undesirable tolerances.
      </p>
      <p>
        To sharpen your sense of <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, try the <a href="ChangeBrainstorm.html">ChangeBrainstorm</a>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Assess your current assumptions
        </li>
        <li>
           Pick one, and imagine changing it
        </li>
        <li>
           Determine if the code would easily permit this change
          <ul>
            <li>
               If not, figure out why not. Is the code <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>'d? Is it clear? Does it have enough tests? Are the tests too tied to the current design? In short: is the code simple enough?
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Determine if you want to eliminate these obstacles or to say <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Repeat.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The point is:  Through this exercise, you'll learn to spot more duplication, complexity, and other hindrances to agility.  What you do with smells once you smell them is a more intricate topic.

        Many of the rules that people have in addition to the <a href="XpSimplicityRules.html">XpSimplicityRules</a> are really <a href="ChangeBrainstorm.html">ChangeBrainstorm</a>'s that they carry around with them. Try looking at some code, and asking: "What would happen if I... ?".

      <ul>
        <li>
           separated model and view?
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>combined</em> model and view?
        </li>
        <li>
           decoupled these two classes?

           coupled those two classes?

        <li>
           made it "data-driven"?

        <li>
           threw away some part that was data-driven?
        </li>
        <li>
           had to internationalize all of this?

        <li>
           split this class by virtue of the <a href="OneResponsibilityRule.html">OneResponsibilityRule</a>?

        <li>
           were to comment this code? (See: <a href="CommentBrainstorm.html">CommentBrainstorm</a>)
