        Definition in progress: <strong>When facing a decision, attempt to minimize your long-term stress.</strong>  This does not mean to minimize your future <em>work</em> -- just to do the thing that will make you feel most calm in the long run.

        If you can <a href="BeMindful.html">BeMindful</a>, you can find out what needs to be done first by following your feelings.  This is the human-centered (as opposed to heavyweight-methodology-centered) approach to deciding what's right for <a href="DoTheRightThing.html">DoTheRightThing</a> or what's worst for <a href="WorstThingsFirst.html">WorstThingsFirst</a>.

Create tension artificially, then resolve it. in <a href="OptimisticProgramming.html">OptimisticProgramming</a>, the assumption is that if you are bored, if you think you and/or the project are in stasis or equilibrium, you aren't <a href="BeMindful.html">BeMindful</a>ing. -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a> <em>et al.</em>
