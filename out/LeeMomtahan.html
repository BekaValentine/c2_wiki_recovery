        I'm feeling I'm no longer a <a href="WikiNewbie.html">WikiNewbie</a>, but progressing. Sometimes I have a feeling the Wiki is not TheyWayWikiWas in the sense the community is too large. Other times I should perhaps try to start my own communities.

        I'm trying to get something going at <a href="http://www.appropriatesoftwarefoundation.org">http://www.appropriatesoftwarefoundation.org</a>

        Lee, since you last visited Wiki, the situation is changed. <a href="BalancingReadersWritersAndEditors.html">BalancingReadersWritersAndEditors</a> has become static, the wiki has become a <a href="OnePileFilingSystem.html">OnePileFilingSystem</a> in that everytime someone adds a page or two, someone else deletes a page or two. The wiki has in essence become static as far as growth is concerned, and the number of new pages added has decreased from over 10 a day to about one or less a day. It has hovered at just above 32000 pages for some time now. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20071005
