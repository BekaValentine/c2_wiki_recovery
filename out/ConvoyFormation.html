        Convoy Formation
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is another name for <a href="ResourceContention.html">ResourceContention</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The important aspect here is not that there is a share resource that acts as a <a href="ResourceContention.html">ResourceContention</a>, but that there is a convoy of processes or threads waiting to execute. ConvoyContentions may form even if there are no ResourceFormations. The reason is simple: If there are several resources and there is risk for <a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a>, one common way to avoid it is to get the locks in an specific order. Of course that order means that there are always big <a href="ConvoyFormation.html">ConvoyFormation</a>s, because processes or threads are always waiting for almost the same resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        So you see, avoiding DeadLocks is an easy way to get into <a href="ConvoyFormation.html">ConvoyFormation</a>s. One way to get out of all this is to use <a href="LockFreeSynchronization.html">LockFreeSynchronization</a> instead of <a href="LockBasedSynchronization.html">LockBasedSynchronization</a>.
