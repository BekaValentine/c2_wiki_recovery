        Reformed Weenie
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page was inspired by Ward's declaration that he was a reformed weenie, and also by my occasional question "What does one do when one realizes one's been an *sshole?" My answer to the second part is "Start a Blog" but a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> is the best I can do between debugging sessions at work.

It's a reference to </em><a href="SmugSmalltalkWeenie.html">SmugSmalltalkWeenie</a>. -- <a href="JasonGrossman.html">JasonGrossman</a>] It would be nice to hear some stories of reformed weenies. There may be lessons for those of us who defend our pets with heavy vigor.<em></em>

        It is my hope that this page will foster SelfAwareness and result in more reformed weenies.
