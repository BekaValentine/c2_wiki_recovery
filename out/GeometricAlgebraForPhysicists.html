        Geometric Algebra research group at Cambridge University says "The most complete introduction to the subject" (one would hope they think so, since the authors are members of that group :-)

        This is a very good text to get to grips with <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a> and explains the connection to <a href="ComplexNumbers.html">ComplexNumbers</a> and <a href="QuaternionMathematics.html">QuaternionMathematics</a>. Don't let the title put you off. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        There is a section in this book (Chapter 12) which makes a connection to the Lagrange and Hamiltonian formulation of mechanics and goes on to generalise it. The Euler-Lagrange equations are shown to apply not only to vector variables but multivector variables as well. This is also known as the Calculus of Variations.  -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
