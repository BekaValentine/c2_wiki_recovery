        SuseTheCompany (really SuSE) started with sending out 40-floppy-sets of <a href="SlackwareLinux.html">SlackwareLinux</a>. Soon they made modifications to it and by that based their first own <a href="LinuxDistribution.html">LinuxDistribution</a> on Slackware. Later they switched to the lesser known Jurix distribution by Florian LaRoche as base for their distribution, before creating one totally on their own.

        Even though they use RPM packages nowadays, their distribution is not based on <a href="RedHatLinux.html">RedHatLinux</a>.

        The best selling <a href="LinuxDistribution.html">LinuxDistribution</a> in Europe. German based. Comes with a whopping 6 CDs of software. Usually close to the edge but well controlled. -- sg

        This is my favorite Linux distribution. It comes with loads of software and is very easy to install. Moreover, it advises you to "Have fun!" every time you log on. -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

        By far the easiest distribution that I have tried. I prefer it to JAMD, <a href="RedHatLinux.html">RedHatLinux</a>, <a href="MandrakeLinux.html">MandrakeLinux</a> and <a href="DebianLinux.html">DebianLinux</a> (I'm going to try <a href="SlackwareLinux.html">SlackwareLinux</a> soon) -- Adam Bagnall

        My favorite distribution too, but all releases have their peculiarities that require your attention! -- Chris de Boer
