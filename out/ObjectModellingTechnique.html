        Object Modelling Technique
      </h1>
      <p>
        AKA OMT. Developed by <a href="JimRumbaugh.html">JimRumbaugh</a> and others. The notation of OMT and much of its philosophy lie behind a lot of the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a> and (to a lesser extent) the <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        OMT was the leading OOA/D method for a long time because it emphasised a structural approach to modelling that fitted well with the EntityRelationalModelling techniques that were already well known, and so provided an easy transition to OO for many organizations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At one time OMT also included "object-oriented DataflowDiagram". Ouch
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the big ideas in OMT is that OO development is <em>seamless</em>. The idea is that you model the problem in classes at some notional <em>high level</em>, and then uniformly add more and more <em>detail</em> until eventually you get some code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea seems to be one root of the <a href="RoundTripEngineering.html">RoundTripEngineering</a> myth. And the more I think about it there is strong smell of <a href="ScientificManagement.html">ScientificManagement</a> about it, too.
