        Extreme Programming Twelve Step Program

        My apologies to any that this may offend.  My intention only is humour!

        Twelve steps to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           We admitted we were powerless over heavy processes - that our projects had become unmanageable.
        </li>
        <li>
           We came to believe that an <a href="AgileProcess.html">AgileProcess</a> could restore us to sanity.
        </li>
        <li>
           Made a decision to turn our will and our lives over to the care of code as we understood it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Made a searching and fearless refactoring of our code.
        </li>
        <li>
           Admitted to our manager, to ourselves and to our pairing partner the exact nature of our wrongs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Were entirely ready to not integrate until our defects of code were removed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Humbly asked our <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> partner to <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> our code.
        </li>
        <li>
           Made a list of all the objects we had written, and became willing to refactor them all.
        </li>
        <li>
           Made direct refactoring of such code wherever possible, except when to do so would injure it or others.
        </li>
        <li>
           Continued to write <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and when we were wrong promptly admitted it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sought through testing and listening to improve our conscious contact with our code, praying only for a green bar and the power to factor out redundancy.
        </li>
        <li>
           Having had a spiritual awakening as the result of attaining agility, we tried to carry this message to programmers and to practice these principles in all our projects.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Twelve Steps of TDD as posted by Bob Flanders at eXtreme Programming yahoo group
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           We admitted we were powerless over things we believed worked as expected, and that our systems had become unmanageable and untestable.
        </li>
        <li>
           Came to believe that a new testing process greater than our usual process could restore us to sanity.
        </li>
        <li>
           Made a decision to turn our testing process over to a Higher Power we understood to be Test Driven Development.
        </li>
        <li>
           Made a searching and fearless set of test our developing software must satisfy.
        </li>
        <li>
           Admitted to our Higher Power, to ourselves, and to another human who we pair with the exact nature of our wrongs - our test run red.
        </li>
        <li>
           Were entirely ready to have our pairing partner oversee our removing all these defects of the software.
        </li>
        <li>
           Humbly asked our Higher Power to regularly check that our software shortcomings remain removed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Made a list of all the known defects, wrote tests for them, and became willing to make them all run green.
        </li>
        <li>
           Refactored code wherever possible, except when to do so would cause tests to run red.
        </li>
        <li>
           Continued to run tests and when they run red, promptly admitted it and got them back to green.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sought through reading and research to improve our testing strategy, seeking for better ways to carry that out.
        </li>
        <li>
           Having had a realization of better systems as a result of these Steps, we tried to carry this message to other developers who feel stuck; and to practice these principles in all our future projects.
        </li>

        The Serenity Prayer
      </p>
      <code>
        God grant me the serenity<br/>
        to leave untested things I cannot test; <br/>
        courage to test the things I can; <br/>
        and wisdom to know when to refactor.<br/>
