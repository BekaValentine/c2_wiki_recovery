        Lucida Modeling Environment
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Lucida Modeling Environment is an object oriented, meta programming language, implemented inside a <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> server.
        The 'language', however, has no syntax because it is not programed using text editors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lucida is an object model of object oriented languages themselves. It has objects that represent many of the constructs of OO like Classes, Selectors, Responsibilities and Expressions. Unlike other modeling environments, however, the implementation for the model can be built in the same environment allowing for extremely rapid prototyping. The result of the modeling exercise is a network of live, executable models.
      </p>
      <p>
        The environment is rich with meta information that is used to provide proactive assistance to the author. A developer is always presented with a set of pre-filtered, valid options to choose from when building the model or its implementation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lucida offers a number of features that are either not available or are poorly supported in the mainstream OO languages. Its ability to provide the combination of these features makes it truly unique. The features include:
