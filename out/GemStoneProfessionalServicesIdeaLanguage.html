        Gem Stone Professional Services Idea Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> Professional Services Idea Language is an <a href="IdeaLanguage.html">IdeaLanguage</a> that I wrote on how to design <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> applications with <a href="GemStonej.html">GemStonej</a>.  The root idea in the language is Layered Architecture (a la <a href="FourLayerArchitecture.html">FourLayerArchitecture</a>), and it fans out to some 60 other ideas from there.  Some of the ideas from the language have been published individually at <a href="http://www.javasuccess.com,">http://www.javasuccess.com,</a> but they are out of context on that site.  The language as a whole lives in a <a href="WikiWorks.html">WikiWorks</a> installation behind <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>'s firewall, but <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> has yet to publish it.  --<a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>
