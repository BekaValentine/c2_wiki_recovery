        Managing Complex Links
      </h1>
      <p>
        Managing a densely or complicated set of links.  The note in <a href="ZootSoftware.html">ZootSoftware</a> talks about this in one way.  I have a different take on the matter, based on the observation:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>People are <a href="GoodAtLookingAround.html">GoodAtLookingAround</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Example 1:  I like to cross link all the people in my address book.  I used to find a name and not recognize it (I have lived in lots of places)  Why is this name in here?  I also used to want to call someone up to play tennis, and not remember who all the tennis-playing friends were.  Obviously, cross linking the entire address book is a Herculean task and hard to maintain.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I used the <a href="GoodAtLookingAround.html">GoodAtLookingAround</a> principle (some of you will recognize <a href="HeapSort.html">HeapSort</a> in this use of the principle).  By each name, I simply put the first letter of why I know that person: S for swimming, squash, switzerland, sweden, salt lake city, and Sean's friends; I for IBM, Italy, etc.  Low cost for maintenance.  Just a couple of letters by each name.  Then, in the first page of the S section, I write little lists around the page, the last names of people I marked for Switzerland, another little list for squash, for swimming, for Sean's friends.   When I put a new name in my book, I make two entries, their name and address, and the list they initially belong to.  Still relatively low maintenance.

        This was super when I wanted a surprise party for Deanna - no way I could remember all her friends from art school.  But under D was a list of her friends, so I looked them all up.  I found people to play tennis with I had forgotten played tennis. etc.

        Example 2:  Traceability in software products
      </p>
      <p>
        We tried keeping interaction diagrams up to date as the design changed.  Ugh :-(  !!  One person was spending easily a third of his time on this silly exercise.  So we applied <a href="GoodAtLookingAround.html">GoodAtLookingAround</a> and collapsed sets of use cases together into UseCaseCategories and collected classes together into ClassCategories, then made a simple matrix of UCC vs. CC and put a tick mark if any use case in the use case category used anything of any class in the class category.  Actually very stable over a lot of design changes.

        Coarse grained? you bet.  But guess what, people are <a href="GoodAtLookingAround.html">GoodAtLookingAround</a>, and that is what maintenance people do for a living, looking at other people's code.  They are happy to have a starting place, and a little common sense in looking plus the same in coding makes for a good guess where to start looking.
