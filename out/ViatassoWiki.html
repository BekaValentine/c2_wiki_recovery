        Viatasso Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        Like so many others, I was deeply impressed by <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> after coming here for the first time. Consequently, I decided to write my own wiki to run my personal Web site. It's been running for a few months now at <a href="http://www.viatasso.com/.">http://www.viatasso.com/.</a>

        <strong>Some features</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Uses what I think are the most "intuitive" formatting rules. Bold with asterisks, italics with slashes, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           No restrictions on page names; they can have arbitrary spacing and punctuation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Clean URLs with sub-directories. For example: <a href="http://www.viatasso.com/cyan/compiler/collapsible-non-terminals.">http://www.viatasso.com/cyan/compiler/collapsible-non-terminals.</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Page renaming by just editing the page title.
        </li>
        <li>
           Syntax highlighting for several programming languages--and it's simple to add others.
        </li>
        <li>
           Recent changes tracks each revision made, including by whom and at what time, and how much was changed.
        </li>
        <li>
           The most recent changes on each page are highlighted in yellow (optional). 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It also generates XHTML 1.0 strict markup, and is styled with CSS. Standard standards stuff. I'm planning on releasing the source code on <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> as soon as the feature list stabilizes.

        <em>Q: Why the name Viatasso?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a word I misheard when watching a movie in elementary school. I thought it had a nice ring to it, and have remembered it ever since. Its only significance is to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Q: What language is it written in? It's shiny.</em>

        <strong>WYSIWYG Editing</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Inspired by HtmlArea, I'm now working on a way to do in-place, <a href="WysiWyg.html">WysiWyg</a> editing without the use of wiki markup.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a working version running on my local machine, which can be accessed at [removed] (as long as my IP address remains the same, *crosses fingers*). I'm quite happy with how it's turning out; <strong>switching from viewing a page to editing it is seamless.</strong> All you have to do is double click on the page and you'll get a cursor and toolbar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please try it out and let me know what you think. It should work in IE 5.5 and Mozilla 1.3. I'd really appreciate any feedback.
      </p>

        <em>Doesn't work in Konqueror 3.0.4 using KDE 3.0.3 on Suse 8.1. I get a page with "Front page" across the top, a pale stripe in the middle, and no apparent functionality.</em>
