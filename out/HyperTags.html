        A not so new concept which may soon revolutionize computer users' ability to UseByScanning, real-world artifacts via a form of hyperlinking based on <a href="HyperTags.html">HyperTags</a> being placed upon and/or replacing nametags, billboards, highway signs, products (replacing or enhancing bar-scanning technology, and even bumper-stickers! The technology employed could be a combination of optical (as in photographic, scanning, infra-red, or invisible paints), wireless (as in <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a>, RFID, DigitalBroadcasting via the airwaves (on separate and dedicated channels or multiplexed within commercial and/or public broadcasting), audible as well as signals above the range of human hearing (sent through air, water, or conducted through solid materials) (even one's water-pipes might be useful as media). Printed material might also serve as media for hyper-tags (using special encoded text, or optical recognition of ordinary text.

           And you might even have RFID embedded in your flesh directing everyone to donaldr.noyes.com ...

               it will not be required or necessary that RFIDs be embedded in your flesh since most people already carry devices which have a range 1000 times distant from their persons. RFIDs are proximity devices, having a range measured in feet, whereas PersonalCommunicators have a range measured in miles.

        With the <a href="DisappearingComputer.html">DisappearingComputer</a>, <a href="HyperTags.html">HyperTags</a> will become valuable references for the ConnectedGeneration (those presently under 40 years of age). Can you imagine a pointer-scanner optically attached to that wearable NanoComputer and built in to an ear-eye device (most probably looking like an ordinary pair of glasses) Perhaps even the NanoComputer will built into the device and not require optical-attachment.
