        Relax Imagine And Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes I don't feel motivated to get things done. I work for myself. 
        No one will fire me if I don't work. I won't go out of business. 
        I won't lose customers. I could sit in front of the TV all day and
        do nothing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I feel a whole lot better when I work. I get excited
        about ideas. I smile. I challenge myself. My business improves.
      </p>
      <p>
        So why do I sometimes go weeks without writing code? Or sit down
        and force myself to work, without really getting into it?
      </p>
      <p>
        What happened to the old days, when I'd come home from school 
        and fire up <a href="TurboPascal.html">TurboPascal</a> for a few hours of just plain messing
        around?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think in the years I worked as a professional software
        developer, I got <a href="BurntOut.html">BurntOut</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the past two or three years, I discovered <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> and 
        <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>. I realized I could push myself to 
        the next level as a developer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I read <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange</a> and <a href="ThePragmaticProgrammer.html">ThePragmaticProgrammer</a> 
        and <a href="RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode.html">RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode</a>. I taught myself Emacs and CVS.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know I have a million things to learn. Lately I have discovered 
        <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> and <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it seems to me that all this learning doesn't help until I apply it.
        And I <em>have</em> used it. But it seems lately I do more learning than using.
        Learning and playing is easier than creating something worthwhile.
      </p>
      <p>
        Knowledge is useless until we apply it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, lately, when I think about sitting down to write some real code,
        It just hasn't seemed like fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        I want to change that. I want the FunOfDoing back, not just the FunOfLearning.
      </p>

        This wiki makes me smile. So many smart people leaving their thoughts for other
        people to find. I like the plain white pages. I like clicking a link and writing
        this page. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki tells me to <a href="DoSimpleThings.html">DoSimpleThings</a>. I like that. I can do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't need to force myself to be productive. I don't need to worry about
        completing my projects anymore. Even if I did, maybe forcing myself 
        doesn't work too well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe it makes more sense to just relax for a minute. Clear my head.
        Put a smile on my face and sit up straight and come back to <a href="BeginnersMind.html">BeginnersMind</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do I want to build? Not a big thing. Something small. One little piece.
        WriteTheUnitTestFirst.
      </p>
      <p>
        Run the test. It fails. A challenge!
      </p>
      <p>
        What can I do? <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It worked! How exciting! 
      </p>
      <p>
        So breathe in. Exhale. Smile. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Relax. Imagine the next thing for a minute.  Write the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Relax, imagine and code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Do it again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And again.
      </p>
      <p>
        And soon I have the <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The work gets done, little bit by little bit.
      </p>
