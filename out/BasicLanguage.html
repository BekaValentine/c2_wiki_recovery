Its <a href="TeleType.html">TeleType</a>-friendly editing approach is probably one of the biggest reasons for its long-standing success.

        HA! Most 8 bit BASICs had nothing to do with Microsoft's "MBASIC." They were all quite independent. <em>And incompatible with each other...</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Generally, the basic interpreters that came with the various 8-bit micros were developed by the companies that manufactured the computer (Apple, Atari, Commodore, etc.) <a href="MicrosoftBasic.html">MicrosoftBasic</a> was a replacement BASIC.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ignorance is bliss, I guess.  But deadly to a convincing argument.  <a href="CommodoreBasic.html">CommodoreBasic</a> and AppleBasic (not IntegerBasic, however) were both produced by Microsoft.  Commodore used Microsoft BASIC from the first release of the PETs, as far as Google is able to tell me.  Atari opted not to use Microsoft BASIC on the basis that it'd require 2K more than they could fit in ROM (10K versus 8K; note that about 2K of the Commodore 64's Kernal ROM is dedicated to BASIC).  It turns out Atari's BASIC was a closer match to <a href="DartmouthBasic.html">DartmouthBasic</a> anyway.

        A basic BASIC interpreter (HaHa) is fairly trivial to implement: <a href="BasicEmulatorInJava.html">BasicEmulatorInJava</a>

        As I understand it, Bill Gates' original BASIC became Microsoft "MBASIC", which ran on 8-bit CP/M systems. 
        It was similar, in my opinion, with DEC "BASIC*PLUS", which ran under RSTS on PDP-11 systems (and possibly other platforms; I really wouldn't know). 
      </p>
      <p>
        It had competition on the 8-bit CP/M platform - CBASIC - which was a really nice pseudo-compiled language that did *NOT* require line numbers on every line.

        Actually, it would be more accurate to say that most BASIC interpreters for 8-bit micros had at least some code from Microsoft. Even <a href="CommodoreBasic.html">CommodoreBasic</a>; note the copyright screen from the Commodore 128 says "Copyright 1977 Microsoft." 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's not quite right either. It's just that Microsoft widely licensed its Basic. They charged $100k for a source code license circa 1980. If you saw a copyright notice like that, there's every reason to think that Commodore simply licensed MS Basic, not that they used "at least some code" from it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope -- it is <em>absolutely right.</em>  In 1977, Commodore purchased an implementation of, and a royalty-free license to (re)use, BASIC from Microsoft, which Microsoft implemented as CBM BASIC 1.0.  Subsequent versions were modifications, admittedly by Commodore, but the basic software was Microsoft's work.  Compare the raw assembly listings of AppleBasic against <a href="CommodoreBasic.html">CommodoreBasic</a> and you'll see a <strong>huge</strong> amount of common overlap.  Even the GETCHR routine, placed in zero-page memory (albeit at different locations, IIRC), is identical.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's been said that the royalty-free licenses were the biggest financial mistake Microsoft has made back then.  It's likely this "mistake" that has significantly influenced future corporate policies at Microsoft, making them into the mean-as-hell monster that it is today.

        Basic was designed as a <a href="LanguageForTeaching.html">LanguageForTeaching</a>, however, it was badly designed for that. <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> and later <a href="OberonLanguage.html">OberonLanguage</a>, and <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> are good languages designed for teaching, since they implement important concepts and enforce good practices in programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, </em><a href="OberonLanguage.html">OberonLanguage</a> was not designed for teaching.  Like Modula-2, it was designed to actually be used in a production environment.  --SamuelFalvo<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Basic was very easy to implement (there is even dds, an entry to the 1990 <a href="InternationalObfuscatedCeeCodeContest.html">InternationalObfuscatedCeeCodeContest</a> that implements a Basic interpreter in only 8 lines of C). Because of that, every microcomputer in the 80s came with Basic installed. This remained true until Macs and Windows appeared, since any programming library is difficult to implement for a windowing system and Basic would be the worst choice of language for it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Arguably false; what makes BASIC any less applicable to a GUI environment than, say, Scheme?  Or C?  Indeed, C is far and above the worst possible language to use, because the structure of the language is fundamentally opposed to how GUIs work.  Meanwhile, with BASIC, you can add keywords to support the constructs (e.g., </em><a href="AmigaBasic.html">AmigaBasic</a> and GfaBasic), making your life substantially easier.  And, yet, C ended up the language of choice due, in large part, to fad.  Remember, MacOS was written in <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> at first.  If you want a language that's awesome to work with in a GUI context, I suspect you'll want none other than <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> or <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, both of which existed at the time too, and had both demonstrated clear superiority over other languages for supporting GUI work.  --SamuelFalvo)<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think I agree that Basic was actually a good choice; it was implementable in much less code than a full C implementation, and e.g. Commodore 64's had good integration of graphics and sound with Basic, such that doing simple animations was quite easy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Commodore 64 Basic was acutally widely criticized for the lack of built-in graphics and sound commands (you had to program VIC and SID registers directly with binary using PEEK and POKE commands). On the contrary, ZX Spectrum and Atari Basics where quite capable in this respect.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I disagree with your comment about C, though; it wasn't "fad", it was that it was (and still is, today) a good language for *system* programming. Its use in application programming is more debatable, but for serious apps, for a long time its main competition was Pascal, which was loved by some but widely hated for good objective reasons -- the Pascal dialects that did not have those objective defects tended to have other issues that limited their adoption (e.g. availability on only one platform).
