        <em>When I use emacs, I find myself constantly using the mouse to select a buffer from the menu. (I know that using the mouse is evil, but I don't know emacs well enough to know of any better method.) --</em><a href="TerrelShumway.html">TerrelShumway</a><em></em>

        You might want to try these Emacs commands:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           control-x b <buffer-name> : Switch to a named buffer.  Hit tab if you don't know the buffer names.  Type just enough of a buffer name to disambiguate it, then hit tab again and it'll complete the name for you.
        </li>
        <li>
           control-x f <file-name> : Switch to the buffer holding a file.  If there is none, create one and load the file.  The tab trick works here, too.
        </li>
        <li>
           control-x b enter : Switch to the previous buffer.
        </li>
        <li>
           control-x k enter : kill a buffer
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and for split-window:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           control-x 2 : split the window in into a top half and a bottom half (then use control-x f to load different file into the half your cursor is in, or control-x b to load a different buffer.  
        </li>
        <li>
           control-x o : switch to the other half
        </li>
        <li>
           control-x 0 : Get out of split-window mode
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I do buffer management all day in emacs with just these commands.  I hope you find them helpful (and keep you away from that mouse).  -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>

           March 2002: Thanks for the tip, but I don't use emacs anymore. My finger muscles are hopelessly habituated to Vim. The buffer management problem is still there, but I just open several windows and ALT-TAB between them.

        screen is very nice.  CTRL+A is not the best choice for the meta-key. It is also the default emacs binding for beginning-of-line (and readline is used by <strong>a lot</strong> of terminal-based programs). (1 September:) You can change that by creating a ~/.screenrc file for yourself and having a line say something like 'escape ``' (this would change the escape key to be the tick character).

        re: <a href="UsingPythonDontNeedRuby.html">UsingPythonDontNeedRuby</a> -- I use Python a lot.  With my first look at Ruby, I see a lot of Perl and Smalltalk roots.  Perhaps Ruby is what Perl should have been.  Having made the transition from Perl to Python a long time ago, I can see that Ruby offers a lot to a Perl programmer, but not so much to a Python programmer.  As others have said, the core philosophy is different.  The most glaring violation of Python philosophy that Ruby makes is against "no magic" e.g.: 1) automatic string interpolation, 2) backticks, 3) the magic self in __main__ (or whatever it is called) that includes puts, gets, etc.

        Did a Perl class in school, realized in was not as terrible as I remembered it being. Looking at Ruby again soon.
