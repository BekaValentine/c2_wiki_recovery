        Man Who Wasnt There

      <code>
        Last night, going up the stair<br/>
        I met a man who wasn't there.<br/>
        He wasn't there again today<br/>
        I wish that man would go away.<br/>

        Vanbrugh's wit<br/>
        Without Thought or Lecture<br/>
        is hugely turned<br/>
        to Architecture!<br/>

        Vanbrugh, the playwright, became the Architect of Blenheim Palace, near Oxford,
        the extravagent Great House built for John Churchill, Duke of Marlborough, by a 'thankful nation' for his successes in the War of the Austrian Succesion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vanbrugh was more than ably assisted by the gifted disciple of Wren, Nicholas Hawksmoor, an epic Architect in his own right, (eg ChristChurch Spitalfields, London)
