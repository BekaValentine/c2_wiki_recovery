        Occasionally, there is a tendency to overlook the merits of a given action in favour of the person perpetrating it.  GoodPeople do not always do <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>s, likewise BadPeople do not always do <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>s.  If one makes a it a habit to <a href="PlayTheManNotTheBall.html">PlayTheManNotTheBall</a>, the consequences are many and varied.  <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>s attributed to BadPeople may be shot down in flames, and people may get hurt - you may even <a href="KillTheHostage.html">KillTheHostage</a>.  Similarly, if GoodPeople are allowed to get away with <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>s, the <a href="UnintendedConsequences.html">UnintendedConsequences</a> will be less than pleasant, especially if people realize they have been SleepWalking.

        As part of an <a href="EgolessWiki.html">EgolessWiki</a>, we should avoid ascribing value to a contribution based <em>solely</em> on the identity of its contributor.  Otherwise we are left with little choice but to demolish 7500 miles of autobahn.
