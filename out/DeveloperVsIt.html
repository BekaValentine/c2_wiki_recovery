        Developer Vs It
      </h1>

        There exists a natural tension between product development groups and a company's ItDepartment.  Product developers (not part of the IT group) require flexability and ItDepartments need to look after the whole system.   It is not unlike a landlord tenant relationship.

        My department at a research university was looking for a "Computer Systems Analyst I" for <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>.  Many of the resumes we received mentioned <a href="InformationTechnology.html">InformationTechnology</a> in the objective.  We immediately threw these out since IT and programming are not the same thing.  <em>It's nice that you've [sold PCs over the phone for Dell] (insert any other menial/tech support job here) for the last [N] years, but do you know the difference between [object-oriented and object-centered programming] (reference to real programming/hacking)?</em> Maybe we're harsh, but it's the truth.  -- <a href="WillGray.html">WillGray</a>
