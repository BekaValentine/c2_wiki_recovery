        Query Interface
      </h1>
      <code>
        <strong>HRESULT IUnknown::</strong><a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a>(REFIID iid, void** ppv)<strong></strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a> is a mechanism in COM (microsoft's Component Object Model) for determining if a known component supports a specific interface. You use the current interface pointer (usually IUnknown), and "query" the interface by passing an interface ID to it. If the object supports an interface which matches the ID, it gives back a pointer which can be cast into a pointer to the correct type of interface. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It's pretty ugly sounding, but think of it as a C++ <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a>. It's essentially navigation by typecasting!!!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All COM interfaces inherit from IUnknown, so you can always use <a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Returns E_NOINTERFACE and passes back NULL in the ppv if the interface is not supported by this object.
        </li>
        <li>
           The 128-bit binary GloballyUniqueId (GUID) is also known as an InterfaceId (IID), in this case.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To see if two pointers refer to the same object, do <a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a> on both, asking for their IUnknown interface.  The two pointers refer to the same object <a href="IfAndOnlyIf.html">IfAndOnlyIf</a> the IUnknown pointers are equal.  Casting the pointers to IUnknown and comparing them is not sufficient, unless you're using a smart IUnknown pointer like the one in <a href="ActiveTemplateLibrary.html">ActiveTemplateLibrary</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Or, consider that its really an <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> that takes a 128-bit guaranteed globally unique identifier (GUID) as the key.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Different from a conventional </em><a href="FactoryPattern.html">FactoryPattern</a>, in that it always returns another pointer to the >same< object (not a pointer to a newly created object).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Same conceptual object anyway. There is nothing to prevent you from using a group of associated objects to implement a COM component.
      </p>

        Why didn't they just implement respondsTo(aMethodName) and polymorphism? Is this some clever way to make the computer's job easier at the expense of the human's? ;->
      </p>
      <p>
        It's actually equivalent to respondsTo(aWholeInterfaceNotJustAMethodName) and it <strong>is</strong> polymorphic, although not type safe in the C/C++ language mapping.  Typing and type safety are a language issue, and because COM is language neutral it cannot guarantee type safety, that must be provided by a language mapping that provides access to COM services from a specific language.
      </p>
      <p>
        In C++ one can do this:
      </p>
      <code>
        IUnknown *the_object = ... // this supports the Foo and Bar interfaces<br/>
        IBarInterface *bar;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        the_object-><a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a>( IID_FOO, &bar ); // this works fine<br/>
        bar->Bar( "hello, world." ); // crash! bar actually points at an IFoo<br/>
      </code>

        I have a theory on the origins of <a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a>(): <a href="http://www.lesher.ws/queryinterface.html">http://www.lesher.ws/queryinterface.html</a> --<a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>

        <em>Ha!  I've long suspected that's where Microsoft was getting its design ideas...</em>

        Or is that an example of <a href="DuckTyping.html">DuckTyping</a>?  ;)

        Note:  <a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a> is more like a DownCast than a CrossCast.  A CrossCast occurs when the type being cast to is not a subtype of the type you have.  Since all COM types are subtypes of IUnknown, it's a DownCast.  See <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a> for more (though this page is full of <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> specific stuff)--<a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>

        Why doesn't the Java bridge for UNO make the proxy objects implement the exported interfaces automatically?
      </p>
      <p>
        Having to write
      </p>
      <code>
        XFoo xFoo = (XFoo) UnoRuntime.queryInterface(XFoo.class, obj);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        totally sucks, when with normal Java interfaces, you'd write
      </p>
      <code>
        XFoo xFoo = (XFoo)obj;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>No idea.  </em><a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> classic, <a href="VisualBasicDotNet.html">VisualBasicDotNet</a>, <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a>, and <a href="ActiveTemplateLibrary.html">ActiveTemplateLibrary</a> all allow you to <a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a> through typecasts.<em></em>
