        Things We Hate About Sketch Up
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are some very frustrating problems with <a href="SketchUp.html">SketchUp</a>.  In general, the "Pro" features (which require paying a substantial amount of money for a software license) are much <strong>less</strong> polished than the free features.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bugs due to hidden variables</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Components have a set of hidden variables that control the scaling.  Unfortunately, the <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> does not provide any way to see what these variable values are, let alone set them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is not safe to incorporate a dynamic component into a parent component, unless all of the attributes of the child are "fixed" by placing an equals sign in front of the component.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The UI has no setting to "fix" all of the attributes of a component, so that it is safe to incorporate into a parent component.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Problems re-using components</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Google consistently uses the same word "Component" to describe both a Class of components and an Instance of a component.  This leads to some corollary problems.  For example, the UI makes it very difficult to tell whether one is editing a property of a single instance, or of an entire class.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no "Parent" pronoun that can be used to generically make a component depend on a property of its parent.  This means that once a component is made to depend on one parent, it needs to be recoded before it can be made part of a different component.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no default behavior for "orphaning" a component.  That is, taking a component that gets information from its parent, and letting it have default information if its parent is missing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>GUI Lag</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Auto-saves take place in the foreground, instead of in the background.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The UI experiences severe lag whenever an auto-save occurs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the 3-D view panel, middle-clicking (to use the orbit and pan tools) often does not work.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Other Problems with the Component Attributes Dialog</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no hierarchical namespace for components, so component names become very long.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The UI's Component Attributes dialog's titlebar for each component only shows the first few characters of each component name.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Component Attributes dialog box does not list two standard properties that are needed by many components.  (The full list of standard properties is at <a href="http://sketchup.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=114551)">http://sketchup.google.com/support/bin/answer.py?hl=en&answer=114551)</a> These two standard properties are missing from the UI:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Creator
            </li>
            <li>
               Copy
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The UI does not provide a way to export the attributes of a component to a human-readable text file.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Component Attributes dialog does not allow viewing the formulas and the current values side-by-side.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Other </strong><a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> Problems<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The UI's use of the space bar, enter key, and escape key is not consistent with similar programs (such as <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a>).  Worse, it is not consistent from one part of the UI to another.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The UI does not remember the state of the dialog boxes from one session to the next.  For example:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Even if you used the Component Attributes dialog last time, it does not appear at the start of the next session.
            </li>
            <li>
               Even if you re-size a dialog box (to fit between the 3-D view panel and the edge of the screen, for example) every time you use the dialog box, the dialog box always starts at the default size.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Many error messages produce "OK" box pop-ups, but do not include any link to an explanation of what is wrong, let alone how to fix it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The "Offset limited to" tool-tip is not intelligently placed.  It normally appears slightly to the right of the mouse (with a slight lag).  This makes it very easy to click the mouse on the tool-tip, resulting in the mouse-click being ignored.
        </li>
      </ul>
