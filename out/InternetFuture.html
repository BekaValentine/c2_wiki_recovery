        Internet Future
      </h1>
      <p>
        The future revolves around the internet, they say.
      </p>
      <p>
        What next?
      </p>
      <p>
        Internet 4.0?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think they'll put the Internet on computers. And there will be a lot of cubes floating around. -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        Nick, you are partly right. Parts of the Internet will be put on computers, by computerUsers intent on managing their own information. It is not unlikely that as much as a Terabyte of the Internet could be managed for this purpose and in this way. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20080305.1654.m06

        <em>Ya think? I think the idea of putting the Internet on computers is ridiculous. The Paper, Publishing and Porn cartel will never stand for it and computers aren't fast enough. Anyway, if you try to put a terabyte of information in one place, the gravitas will be too much and it will collapse in on itself, drawing in all surrounding data so that none can escape.</em>

        <em>The internets 2.0 will be an intricate series of tubes through which you can squeeze nubile women, plenty of fluoride, and viruses that really kill humans. </em>BigOil will be into it, too - their tubes are the biggest of all. Floating cubes will have to wait for internets 3.0, after Al Gore invents anti-gravity.<em></em>

        I think it is "teh internets" in true <a href="PwnAge.html">PwnAge</a> style.

        <em>PROTIP: If you want to make fun of gamer slang in a page, create a page called </em>GamerSlang, not <a href="PwnAge.html">PwnAge</a>. This page could then contain both "pwnage" and "PROTIP".<em></em>

           Or, modularize the pages into individual modules on a per subject basis. The problem with <a href="PwnAge.html">PwnAge</a> is that it is in the <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> form, like <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>.

        Levels of pwnage available through Internet 1.0 have been very limited, but by the year 2000, we expect to reach pwnage levels of over 53 gigazerglings even in remote rural areas. -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>
