        Panasonic Owl

      <p>
        Office Workstations Ltd. (OWL) is a research and development laboratory for Panasonic, one of the trading names for Matsushita Electric Industrial Co. of Japan; hence our unofficial name: 'Panasonic OWL'. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We developed "Guide", the world's first hypertext authoring system (predating the Web).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Feel free to provide a reference backing up the claim that Guide was the</em> "<strong>first</strong> <em>hypertext authoring system". Just because it came before the Web doesn't mean that it's the first.</em>

           It wasn't the first, but I remember when it came out, and they were making that claim back then, too, and never backed down from it. Here's a history that includes Owl (but not as the first): <a href="http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~wwwbtb/book/chap1/htx_hist.html.">http://ei.cs.vt.edu/~wwwbtb/book/chap1/htx_hist.html.</a>

           Owl is credited in <a href="TimBernersLee.html">TimBernersLee</a>'s book, <em></em><a href="WeavingTheWeb.html">WeavingTheWeb</a><em>. Tim approached them about modifying Guide to support the internet work he was thinking of, but it seems no-one there was interested.</em>
