        Reverse Flyweight Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        implemented in the same way as the <a href="InstanceFlyweightPattern.html">InstanceFlyweightPattern</a>, but used for the opposite purpose.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Name: <a href="ReverseFlyweightPattern.html">ReverseFlyweightPattern</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Also Known As: <a href="MultitonPattern.html">MultitonPattern</a>, <em>n</em>-ton pattern.
        </li>
        <li>
           Classification: CreationalPattern? (because its usage is more like Singleton than Flyweight...)
        </li>
        <li>
           Motivation (of creating):
          <ul>
            <li>
               Differentiation of the <a href="FlyweightPattern.html">FlyweightPattern</a> usage (where the instances/identities are <em>not</em> important, only the immutable state is) from this type of usage (where the instances <em>are</em> important, and the state is <em>mutable</em>).
            </li>
            <li>
               Generalizing the <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> to support multiple instances.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Application:  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anywhere one wishes to save memory in creating objects that map to real world structures, for example IO ports on an embedded system. Additionally, the <a href="ReverseFlyweightPattern.html">ReverseFlyweightPattern</a> allows the encapsulation of various fixed numbers, especially those fixed in hardware. A concrete example would be for objects representing computer monitors: the number of monitors is fixed at runtime, but can change between different computers, or even different runs of the same compiled instance of the program (or, with sufficiently <a href="PlugAndPlay.html">PlugAndPlay</a> monitors, possibly even <em>while the program is running</em>), so Singleton is <em>clearly</em> not appropriate.
        Alternatives are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           instantiating an object for every action that needs that particular real-world structure; this is costly and assumes that all data is actually <em>stored</em> in said real-world structure.
        </li>
        <li>
           instantiating global objects for every real-world structure that the program might ever need at the beginning of each program/in a header file; there is no guarantee that any of these global objects will be used, wasting memory.
        </li>
        <li>
           Using global flags to do the <a href="ReverseFlyweightPattern.html">ReverseFlyweightPattern</a> by hand; this violates <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, because you have to do the "exists-yet?" check at every usage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also, because the <a href="ReverseFlyweightPattern.html">ReverseFlyweightPattern</a> maps so closely over the <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>, one can use it to replace the singleton.

        <li>
           Consequences: Decreased memory usage as a result of less instantiated objects.
        </li>
        <li>
           Implementation: Same as the instance flyweight pattern.  In perl, for example, it would be package Whatever; require 'memoize'; memoize 'new';

      <code>
        #An embedded system has a certain number of IO pins, and each IOpin object maps to.<br/>
        #The state of each IOpin object for any single given pin number is exactly the same.<br/>
        #Essentially, this is an extension of the Singleton...<br/>

        {<br/>
        lvalue(<br/>
        set => def (Bool value) {<br/>
        Memory m = Memory.getInstance(); #get singleton<br/>
        m.poke(@address, value);         #extern "C" { *(this->address) = value }<br/>

        Of course, this example doesn't HAVE to be a Reverse Flyweight, but this is the basic idea.
