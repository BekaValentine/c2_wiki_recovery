        What It Wants To Be
      </h1>
      <p>
        A concept which causes implementers with a mind set similar to that of <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> to discover ways to make a structure, an object or a process into one more useful or more fitting for the tasks it was meant to fulfill.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a phrase Ward uses on many occasions to explain something not yet explained or not having a name, but one which when named or explained is found to be an obvious part or extension of the thing wanting.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be this very want that drives inventors forward and awakens them in the middle of the night, or comes to them in a flash of inspiration when they are otherwise occupied.

        According to some, it appears wiki <em>wants to be</em> a mess ;-)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I've been around for years, and have found that it is tending toward order, even if because it is chaotic, it appears to new-comers and </em><a href="TheOtherOnes.html">TheOtherOnes</a> (some) to be a mess.<em> -- </em><strong></strong><a href="DoingStuff.html">DoingStuff</a>.<a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20131211<em></em>'
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'll just posit, without references, that <strong>what the wiki wants to be is the </strong><a href="GlassBeadGame.html">GlassBeadGame</a><strong>. </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>This is exactly what I want my wiki - and its extension of the </em><a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> - to be.<em> --</em>ReMused
        </li>
      </ul>

        Perhaps <a href="WhatItWantsToBe.html">WhatItWantsToBe</a> is <a href="WhatItIs.html">WhatItIs</a>. (in the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>)
