        Industrial Economy
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <strong>industrial economy</strong> is defined by the production of <em>physical</em> goods, outside of a guild system, which is to say: <em>en masse</em>. It is marked in its consumption of earth's mineral and energy resources and its use of labor, where the human is reduced to a mere "cog in the machine". Or being part machine, part human, with very long-life expectancy. Not much different from the Sci-Fi "Borg".
