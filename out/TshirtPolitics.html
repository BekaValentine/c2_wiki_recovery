        Tshirt Politics
      </h1>
      <p>
        Much of the political work at <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> revolved  around who had the coolest t-shirts. You could get folks to do you BIG favors in return for a good shirt. The group with the <a href="AppleCrayComputer.html">AppleCrayComputer</a> made particularly effective use of this strategy.

        I much prefer this brand of politics to SpaceWarPolitics, which we had in spades at <a href="TektronixInc.html">TektronixInc</a>. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>
