        Semiconductor Test Systems Group
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is the group at Tektronix that built the LT-1000 semiconductor tester.  <a href="RikSmoody.html">RikSmoody</a> got the project started on Smalltalk.  <a href="WardAndKent.html">WardAndKent</a> introduced a handful of patterns in a crash effort to redirect the effort.  The patterns have been recounted many times in the <a href="HistoryOfPatterns.html">HistoryOfPatterns</a> starting with an early OOPSLA (<a href="http://c2.com/doc/oopsla87.html).">http://c2.com/doc/oopsla87.html).</a>

        The patterns were presented verbally.  I've only bothered to write them down now that they are so often cited.  Most recently I rewrote them as a series of sketches on an index card ...

        I got to present this with one of those nifty TV overhead cameras that could zoom in and fill the screen with the images.  You may notice that <a href="ShortMenus.html">ShortMenus</a> also provides the means to change tasks and that <a href="StandardPanes.html">StandardPanes</a> was inadvertently left out all together. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
