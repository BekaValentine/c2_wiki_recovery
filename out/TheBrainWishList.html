        The Brain Wish List

      <p>
        Proposed changes to <a href="TheBrain.html">TheBrain</a> software:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I wish references to Thoughts could be made as links within thought notes. (YES, this is the main missing feature of <a href="TheBrain.html">TheBrain</a> in my opinion also. This would turn <a href="TheBrain.html">TheBrain</a> to a wiki in fact!)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em> rightClick on any text string that is a thought name. The chose 'Activate' to do this.  A bit annoying that it takes two clicks, but it does work.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They should announce that the recently issued patent(s) will not be used to hold up other like-kind software projects (refer to other commentaries at [1][2][3]). Their press release on the first patent gloated over the "significant barrier" the patent will represent to other efforts. <a href="MindMappingSoftware.html">MindMappingSoftware</a> has been around for a while, so the patent wouldn't be likely to stand the test of a trial, but the patent is likely to cause other efforts to try to stay out of harms way if they aren't funded to the extent that they can afford a patent challenge, which is said to cost around 500k.

      <ul>
        <li>
           I wanna Linux version. Integrated in a GUI, as the file management system. Wishful thinking - see patent issue aforementioned.

        <li>
           They should have better standards compliancy. Compatibility with Eudora, which uses the standard mbox email format. Today <a href="TheBrain.html">TheBrain</a> only works fine with Outlook, which uses a proprietary email format from Microsoft.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Isn't this a GuiWiki?

        <em>The problem with using Wiki is that once you've been here, all almost-isomorphic hypertext media are compared to Wiki. Rotate your viewpoint. Compare everything to the </em><a href="XanaduProject.html">XanaduProject</a> instead.<em></em>
