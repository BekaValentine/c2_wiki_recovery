        One may find it convenient, when deciding to read the pages for a certain date in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, to archive them (using  the browser and <a href="AdobeAcrobat.html">AdobeAcrobat</a>) for later offline revue of the page, or a selected portion of the Page, <em>as well as</em> the pages listed within the part.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is possible on my computer by the following:
          <ul>
            <li>
               highlight a selection on the page
            </li>
            <li>
               follow with a right click in the selection area to obtain  a file dialogue allowing the naming of the archive pdf which will contain the pages
            </li>
            <li>
               then click on save, which will cause the construction of the archive
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A Few of the Advantages
          <ul>
            <li>
               time to download - from 1/10th  to 1/500th (or even shorter) of the time it would take to revue the page and its pages.
            </li>
            <li>
               the obvious advantage of having a copy complete with working links, to the pages, or from the pages to offline pages in the list, or to referrals to online pages linked to.
            </li>
            <li>
               the ability to add to the list in simple mouse click operations
            </li>
            <li>
               the ability to have locally, HistoricPages, ie pages as they appeared when the <a href="RecentChangePagesByDay.html">RecentChangePagesByDay</a> was downloaded.
            </li>
            <li>
               the ability to have a copy of the pages in forms existing before a devestating destruction or malforming of them by a vandal, or overzealous refactorer
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other Kinds of Archives one might make using this method:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pdf Archives of a certain Categories List
        </li>
        <li>
           Pdf Archive of a Search Term Listing (Perhaps a  topic, like <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>))
        </li>
        <li>
           Pdf Archive of the Backlinks on a Wikizens Name (Pages on which his name appears)
        </li>
        <li>
           Pdf Archive of a page and the links on it and and the links on them, etc (becoming an archive on the topic of the original page, offline
        </li>
        <li>
           Pdf Archive of <a href="RandomPagesByDay.html">RandomPagesByDay</a> (as part of participation in improving Wiki by Gnoming pages in the Archive daily or according to some personally arranged schedule. (Part of <a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A Onetime Example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://donaldr.noyes.com/c2/RcC220110324.pdf">http://donaldr.noyes.com/c2/RcC220110324.pdf</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               downloaded the section including the page list for March 24, 2011 and each of the pages in the set in only 54 seconds - (21 pages, that's less than 3 seconds per page)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
