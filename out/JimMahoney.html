        Describe <a href="JimMahoney.html">JimMahoney</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jim is an Instructor at Marlboro College *and* The Graduate Center at Marlboro College. I, as a recent student fell under his spell and *almost* started to enjoy PERL - which is really saying something, since I came from a mainframe/COBOL/IT background.
      </p>
      <p>
        Jim also happens to be a pretty good physicist - at least, he could explain things in a way I understood... Is there any other way to measure a physicist? ;^)
