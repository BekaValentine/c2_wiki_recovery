        Where do I start? [2] His research led to the languages OBJ [<a href="ObjLanguage.html">ObjLanguage</a>] and FOOPS, he is the Editor in Chief of the Journal of Consciousness[1]. His work has introduced me and many others to abstract algebra and functional programming. He has written many ground breaking papers on the subject of software reuse. See <em>Tossing Algebraic Flowers down the Great Divide</em>[3]. Also check out his recent Tatami[4] project.
