        Data Fabric
      </h1>
      <p>
        Like an EnterpriseDataFabric (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Data_Fabric),">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enterprise_Data_Fabric),</a> but less 'enterprisey'.
      </p>
      <p>
        By analogy from SwitchFabric, a 'data transport layer' that can resolve, cache and distribute queries and events from disparate <a href="ApplicationProgram.html">ApplicationProgram</a> s, <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a> s and <a href="FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a> s into a single live and persistent <a href="DataSpace.html">DataSpace</a>. A possible solution to software <a href="ImpedanceMismatch.html">ImpedanceMismatch</a>, and a way of making <a href="EventDrivenProgramming.html">EventDrivenProgramming</a> less painful by making it pervasive at the system level.
      </p>

        Something computing needs to evolve before we all go insane from trying to get incompatible systems to talk to each other - even within our own desktops.
      </p>
      <p>
        A similar concept to the <a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a>, taken into the domain of processes. <a href="ResourceDescriptionFramework.html">ResourceDescriptionFramework</a> (especially projects like <a href="HayStack.html">HayStack</a>) and <a href="RepresentationalStateTransfer.html">RepresentationalStateTransfer</a> are possible first steps toward a <a href="DataModel.html">DataModel</a> on which a <a href="DataFabric.html">DataFabric</a> could be built. Also similarities with UnixPipes and <a href="FlowBasedProgramming.html">FlowBasedProgramming</a>, with <a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a>'s <a href="EnterpriseServiceBus.html">EnterpriseServiceBus</a>, <a href="LindaLanguage.html">LindaLanguage</a>'s <a href="TupleSpace.html">TupleSpace</a>, <a href="BlackboardMetaphor.html">BlackboardMetaphor</a>, and <a href="PlanNineFromBellLabs.html">PlanNineFromBellLabs</a>. A somewhat higher-level idea than <a href="DataBusPattern.html">DataBusPattern</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since a bulk of the work of interconnecting data from separate systems involves executing code (even small utility functions or scripts), a working <a href="DataFabric.html">DataFabric</a> may need to be a ComputeFabric as well, thus being a kind of <a href="ApplicationServer.html">ApplicationServer</a> for <a href="GridComputing.html">GridComputing</a>. But less 'enterprisey'.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is all pretty interesting, but we'll need to solidify some of these concepts into easy-to-digest examples or user stories before further discussion. It is highly unlikely anybody not already intimately familiar with all these disparate technologies will follow all the links and investigate everything so as to participate in a discussion of the makeup of such a fabric.</em>

        Having read the <a href="ReactiveDemandProgramming.html">ReactiveDemandProgramming</a> and <a href="ActorVsAgent.html">ActorVsAgent</a> pages, this seems to be pretty much the same idea. It's difficult to reduce into specific examples as they haven't really been implemented yet. It's not about the intimate details of all the above-mentioned technologies - because they're all doing very complex things rather clumsily - but about a very simple essence common to them all. Something like massively parallel <a href="DeclarativeProgramming.html">DeclarativeProgramming</a> with a demand-driven pipe model. My intuition is that this paradigm will fit very nicely with a <a href="ConcatenativeLanguage.html">ConcatenativeLanguage</a>.
