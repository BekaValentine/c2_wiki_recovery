        Wiki Gnome White List

      <p>
        At one point, due to deletion of tons of <a href="WikiSpam.html">WikiSpam</a>, my usual IP address was banned by the <a href="SurgeProtector.html">SurgeProtector</a> for a while; it took an e-mail to Ward to un-ban me. In the interest of FullDisclosure, I deleted a bunch of spam, changed my <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie, and seconded my own deletions... I was banned for several hours. (I was able to verify this by accessing <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> through my home ISP, but only over Lynx.)  This particular spammer, in addition to defacing existing pages, tromped through <a href="WantedPages.html">WantedPages</a> and created lots of new pages with existing links to them (a clever tactic).  As undoing this spam required page deletion, that left me (as well as other <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s) vulnerable to the <a href="SurgeProtector.html">SurgeProtector</a>.

        Perhaps it would be beneficial to have a whitelist of well-known <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s who are exempt from the <a href="SurgeProtector.html">SurgeProtector</a>, so efforts to clean up such spam don't inadvertently get one banned?  I'm not asking to be on such a list myself, but it might be a good idea--especially if more spam attacks of this nature occur.

        Like they say, you are honest to a fault, Scott. Next time, use an OpenProxy. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        Does the <a href="SurgeProtector.html">SurgeProtector</a> also protect from too many page creations/edits? It seems like that would slow the spammer down. Also how about a page link similar to <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a> that was a "DeSpam" - it would revert a page by stepping backwards through EditHistory to one that had fewer external hyperlinks (i.e. <a href="http://">http://</a> refs) - Perhaps with a threshold of five-ten? -- <a href="LayneThomas.html">LayneThomas</a>
