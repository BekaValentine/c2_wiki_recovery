        Is there any information out there on actual worked examples of unit testing, system testing or functional testing in an XP environment?  The XP approach and philosophy seems workable but I am concerned that the thinking on testing has been lightweight to date. So guys, <a href="WhatAboutTesting.html">WhatAboutTesting</a>?
