        Logical Const
      </h1>
      <p>
        An algorithm, procedure, or operations is <em>logically const</em> if it does not alter the logical state of an object or type.  Note that this is a looser property than <a href="PhysicalConst.html">PhysicalConst</a>ness (the bits don't change).  <a href="LogicalConst.html">LogicalConst</a>ness is useful in several cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>.  Some expressions/objects have state which is difficult or expensive to compute; it is useful to defer evaluation until it is actually needed.  Given that most programming languages where const is an issue (those with <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s) generally don't have language support for <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>, the programmer often has to fake it; and "faking it" almost (?) always involves rearranging the "bits" of the object.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Caching.  If you have a LargeContainer which is expensive to search, but high locality of reference, caching away the last <em>n</em> searches might be a fruitful optimization.  Again, this requires rearranging the bits of the container object.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is easy for a compiler to determine whether or not the bits change.  It is harder to determine whether or not the logical state of an object changes; for this reason implementing <a href="LogicalConst.html">LogicalConst</a> often requires holes be left in the typing system.  Two ways to do it are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ConstIncorrect.html">ConstIncorrect</a>ness (or <a href="CastingAwayConst.html">CastingAwayConst</a>).  Simply discard the <a href="ConstQualifier.html">ConstQualifier</a> in the implementation of a method which preserves <a href="LogicalConst.html">LogicalConst</a>ness while rearranging the bits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           MutableKeyword.  A newer feature in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> language; fields of an object tagged mutable can be updated even in a supposedly const method.  (However, there is nothing which prevents the programmer from changing a mutable field in a way which does not preserve <a href="LogicalConst.html">LogicalConst</a>ness).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A good rule of thumb for <a href="LogicalConst.html">LogicalConst</a> is as follows:  <em>If an operation preserves </em><a href="LogicalConst.html">LogicalConst</a>ness, then if the old state and the new state are compared with the <a href="EqualityOperator.html">EqualityOperator</a>, the result should be true.<em>  In other words, the </em><a href="EqualityOperator.html">EqualityOperator</a> should reflect the logical state of the object.  I know of no language which enforces this...

        <em>Enforcing logical const in the face of mutable is computationally intractable.  You could do some </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, but that is about as far as it can go.<em></em>
