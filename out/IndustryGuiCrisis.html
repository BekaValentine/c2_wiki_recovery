        Industry Gui Crisis
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems there is an industry-wide GUI crisis. People are pulling their hair out over GUI issues. In particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lack of a GUI standard and/or standardized cross-language GUI kits
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Much more difficult to create even simple GUI's than with tools from a generation ago
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Confusion over browser integration
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If enough disagree that there is a GUI Crisis, then feel free to delete this topic after a few months.

        <em>I'd be interested to see what evidence you have for the existence of a GUI crisis.  I can't say I've encountered it.  Quite the contrary, in fact -- with click-n-drag GUI builders built into </em><a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> and <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a>, and event-driven programming and HTML typically being a part of university and technical college computing education, there's considerably less of a "GUI crisis" now than there was a generation, or less, ago.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Those are vendor/language-specific. I agree there are semi-decent vendor and language-specific solutions, but after 25 years of GUI's you'd think we'd move beyond that. We're stuck in 1984.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Lack of a GUI standard
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Definitely true.  This is unquestionable, even.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I dunno... there seem to be a whole lot'a GUI standards.  ^_^</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lack [good] of cross-language GUI kits
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Definitely <em>not</em> true.  <a href="WxWidgets.html">WxWidgets</a>, Qt, GTK are all cross-platform.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>It has complicated integration/binding. To qualify, it would have to be reworked as a service.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Much more difficult to create even simple GUI's than with tools from a generation ago

           Absolutely!  It seems that the larger the toolkit, the more capable it is, and yet, the less scalable it is.  See <a href="ImmediateModeGui.html">ImmediateModeGui</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Confusion over browser integration
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
           This requires clarification.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>How or if to integrate with a web browser, create an independent "GUI browser", or compile/integrate into a specific desktop app.</em>

           GUI crisis is an IndustryUsabilityCrisis from the user perspective.

           Despite the fact that developers & marketers are convinced the interfaces are "intuitive," customers still can't figure out how to accomplish tasks without relying on <a href="GoToGuy.html">GoToGuy</a>s and Gals.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>In my opinion, that is a different topic. It is a psychology/political/human-nature topic rather than a technical one. (I think its largely caused by bigwigs wanting control rather than let usability experts decide.)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               That's good. Brush off human factors engineering as something non-technical. I'm sure that's just what usability experts want.

           Try disabling/enabling <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> in <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a>. Now try telling someone else how to do it and why. Now bang your head a few times. Compare and contrast these experiences in your journal.
