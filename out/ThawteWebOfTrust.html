        Thawte Web Of Trust
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Thawte Web of Trust system (<a href="http://www.thawte.com/html/COMMUNITY/wot/)">http://www.thawte.com/html/COMMUNITY/wot/)</a> is a certification system allowing two people to be sure of each other's identity, even if they've never met.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for Thawte to certify your identity, you obtain at least 50 notarization points by meeting notaries and showing them officially-issued photographic identification; each notary can provide a maximum of 35 points. Once you have 100 points, you become a notary yourself, initially able to issue up to 10 points. The number of points you may issue increases with the number of notarizations you perform.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you live in a zone where there are no notaries nearby, you will have to be notarized by a Thawte staff member. From time to time, a number of staff travel to various countries and conduct `roadshows'; alternatively, if a roadshow is not being held in your area, you may request a trusted-third-party (TTP) notarization, which currently costs US$25. Both of these methods will get you 100 points.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notaries may optionally charge for notarizations, though many do not. Some notaries enjoy setting up notarization meetings, where a group of notaries can notarize a larger number of candidates over a meal and coffee; this is usually a good compensation for transportation costs and the like, for notaries who do not accept payment.

        If you're a Thawte Web of Trust notary, please feel free to put your name on this list, along with a URL if you have one. This isn't a substitute for Thawte's notary directory, it's just a way of seeing if any wiki regulars are notaries.

        While I like the idea, this seems very vulnerable to corruption. The web page did not address revocation, and a group of as few as five people can establish a self-contained "cell" that could easily fake verifications. -- <a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
