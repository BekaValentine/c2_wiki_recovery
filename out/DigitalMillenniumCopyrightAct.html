        The Digital Millennium Copyright act is an Evil law set to stop mp3 sharing, etc. It, however, does more than that. Have a look at this:

      <p>
        As you can see, the DMCA is censoring people from saying what they fixed. Can anyone say <a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am still trying to figure out why the DMCA stopped Mr Cox from publishing details of security fixes. An explanation, rather than a 'nudge-nudge' quote and accompanying lambasting would be nice. Mind you, I don't care much for the DMCA myself, but I still don't understand this whole bit.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's the whole thing with people being sued recently for publishing information describing security vulnerabilities in commercial software ("assisting the circumnvention of copyright-protection mechanisms"). The details presumably affect some commercial software in some way... or possibly DVD drives. I suppose looking at the diff is the only way to know.

        I wouldn't be surprised if <a href="AlanCox.html">AlanCox</a> really had no reason to be afraid, but was just being sarcastic to make a political point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There was more than sarcasm behind Cox's action. See </em><a href="http://kerneltrap.org/article.php?sid=343">http://kerneltrap.org/article.php?sid=343</a> for some of the mails he wrote after the changelog. Alan also resigned from the Usenix ALS committee as a reaction to the arrest of <a href="DmitrySklyarov.html">DmitrySklyarov</a>: <a href="http://lwn.net/2001/0726/a/alan-quits-als.php3''.">http://lwn.net/2001/0726/a/alan-quits-als.php3''.</a>

        Since I could not view the kerneltrap link, I tried digging up one that works.  I dunno why the above link does not work, and I am not sure what article it is supposed to be pointing to, but here is a link that <a href="WorksForMe.html">WorksForMe</a>: <a href="http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/9">http://kerneltrap.org/node/view/9</a>

        For anyone who want to look at the dots and comma's, I eventually found the full text of the act here: <a href="http://www.legalarchiver.org/dmca.htm">http://www.legalarchiver.org/dmca.htm</a>
