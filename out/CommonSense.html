        Common Sense
      </h1>
      <p>
        A phrase first coined (in Greek) by <a href="MrAristotle.html">MrAristotle</a>. Your common sense is the quasi sense organ by which you perceive the "common sensibles" - the qualities in the world that transcend any particular sense organ, like shape (which you can sense through both sight and touch) and the essence or kind to which things belong, the causal powers that explain why things are the way they are, etc. I think the phrase is meant to describe the faculty of rational thought in a rather intriguing way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later redefined somewhat (misunderstood?) not as the inner sense that responds to what is common to different outer sense organs, but as a lowest-common-denominator collection of beliefs, prejudices, practical know-how, unexamined intuitions, and/or guessing ability thought to be possessed in common by nearly all people. Also used as a synonym for "horse sense", your ability to look at matters straightforwardly and not be confused by sophistry or book-learning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, the term has so many incompatible meanings to so many different people, and is so bound up with so many hidden agendas and conflicting broader views of cognition, that it may be wisest to avoid it altogether. Some who appeal to common sense mean to shield their favorite cultural prejudices from examination and criticism. Some who appeal to common sense are just trying to pull you back into a state where you can acknowledge what you know to be true even though it doesn't fit into some theory you got from book-learning or abstract speculation.

        My reading of this changed when I discovered common sense is based on experience. It is therefore not really common, and I'd rather it were called Experience Sense.

        I found this out first when I went snow camping, and was told a bunch of things as being "simply common sense" which I had no clue about. A year later, they were simply common sense. Like keeping your socks dry. To a winter camper, the consequences of not keeping your socks dry are serious and well-known. To a non-camper, it is surprising that the idea has any consequences at all.	
      </p>
      <p>
        I found out subsequently, and most of all when I had children, that most of what falls under "common sense" can be backed up to experiences that the anticipated category of listeners is supposed to have had. I find myself explaining common sense items to children all the time. My mother used to say, "use your common sense" often. As a child and young adult I used to think she had deep intuition and I didn't. I now see her experiences and thinking ability in operation. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        The current leadership of the UK Conservative and Unionist Party (somewhat like the US Republicans) touts a very, very frightening idea called the "Common Sense Revolution". It seems to consist in: bigotry, myopia, bourgeois petty-mindedness, isolationism, fear of difference etc. etc. After all, <em>everyone knows</em> that "immigrants are stealing our jobs" and so forth.

        Let's not forget Thomas Paine's "Common Sense" of 1776 which begins: "PERHAPS the sentiments contained in the following pages, are not yet sufficiently fashionable to procure them general favor; a long habit of not thinking a thing wrong, gives it a superficial appearance of being right, and raises at first a formidable outcry in defence of custom. But tumult soon subsides. Time makes more converts than reason."

      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Counter Contention 2: <em>One can avoid being too pessimistic and optimistic, one can use known good heuristics such "Solve the difficult bits first" and one can go outside the square when obvious (in hindsight) common sense tells you too. Oops this definition is getting a touch vague ... Common sense requires the application of a large body of knowledge and wisdom to a problem. You can seek the knowledge, wisdom is a bit harder.

        I think the common sense (dominant) part of this topic is really trying to describe a well-developed sense of risk, which is the thing that's "uncommonly uncommon". It's hard to complete a single learning without at least one failure. It's hard not to fail at least a little on anything the least bit interesting. The question is not whether or not to fail, whether or not to learn. The question is how much can you afford to bite off and risk losing in one chunk? I guess if there's a "common sense" part of risk awareness, it's that SizeOfCommitment is the main variable.

        I think the term <a href="CommonSense.html">CommonSense</a> is pejorative. It is almost never used except in the negative: So-and-so should have used a little common sense when they did X.

        To exercise <a href="CommonSense.html">CommonSense</a>, one must put the brain in gear. Too often, people react with responses that are far out of line with the sensible reaction to a stimuli. Witness the growing number of "road rage" incidents which are triggered by what to many drivers are minor annoyances. Perhaps this is because driving has become more than transportation, having status, emotional and psychological components which are triggered by sensory rather than mental inputs. As an example, what did you think, versus what did you feel the last time some one displayed aggressive and unsafe driving. What was the common sense versus the actual actions you took in response? Be honest! Was your brain in control?
