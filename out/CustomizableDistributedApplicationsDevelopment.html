        Development of CDAs is a hard task even for experienced programmers due to their rich nature and many capabilities. A developer or a team of developers has to have a skill set that includes almost every aspect of software development from GUI to client/server programming. This leads to the fact that this kind of applications is expensive to build and it is rare when companies are able to build them.
