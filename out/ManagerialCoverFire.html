        Managerial Cover Fire
      </h1>
      <p>
        Behavior provided by a manager to protect the staff under him/her from
        interference by those outside that branch of the organization.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a developer taking a managerial position to prevent a more useful staffer from being placed as manager, diluting their effect on the code.
        </li>
        <li>
           requiring all contact with the group to be coordinated with the manager.
        </li>
        <li>
           personally accepting full responsibility for the performance of the team. <em>See </em><a href="KentOnWardOnSustainablePace.html">KentOnWardOnSustainablePace</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           taking care of administrative matters.
        </li>
      </ul>
