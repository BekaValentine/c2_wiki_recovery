      <p>
        According to the bio in the back of <a href="SinAndSyntax.html">SinAndSyntax</a>,Constance Hale spent her childhood in Hawaii, messing around in the kapakahi syntax of pidgin English. She went on to study English lit. at Princeton University and to earn a master's degree in journalism at U.C. Berkley. After newspapering for a few years, she landed at Wired, where she dabbled in old and new media and wrote Wired Style: Principles of English Usage in the Digital Age. She continues to work in print and online, and teaches writing and grammar to grown-ups. Hale lives in Oakland, California with a guy named Bruce and a dog named Homer (after the Greek poet, not Bart Simpson's father!).
