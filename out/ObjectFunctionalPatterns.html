        Object Functional Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ObjectFunctionalPatterns.html">ObjectFunctionalPatterns</a> describe ways to adapt features and strategies usually found in <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s for use in <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. Some of these are <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a>s, but many are not. <a href="ThomasKuehne.html">ThomasKuehne</a> first brought these concepts to Wiki with his <a href="FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign.html">FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign</a> and many patterns in this language originate from his PhD thesis which is a book by the same name.

      <p>
        <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> shows how to treat functions as first class objects. This is useful for implementing <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s in an <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> environment.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="GenericFunction.html">GenericFunction</a> and <a href="GenericFunctionObject.html">GenericFunctionObject</a> describe how to implement <a href="ExternalPolymorphism.html">ExternalPolymorphism</a> and <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> -- features normally found only in <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s. These mechanisms allow us to make verb based abstractions in addition to the noun based abstractions that <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> languages give us. When objects are used in these abstractions they become passive rather than active which gives us a wider range of expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FunctionCallObject.html">FunctionCallObject</a> is a <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> that describes how to treat the stack frame of a function call as a first class object it is very closely related to <a href="LazyObject.html">LazyObject</a>. If <a href="FunctionCallObject.html">FunctionCallObject</a>s can be made to work then <a href="ContinuationsAndCoroutines.html">ContinuationsAndCoroutines</a> can be used in an OO environment and can potentially reduce or eliminate the need for threads. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Programs can be made more efficient by delaying computations using <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> and caching the results (see <a href="CallByNeed.html">CallByNeed</a>). <a href="LazyObject.html">LazyObject</a>s are one way of doing this. <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> has its problems though. In an world where state is mutable  <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> can be <em>too</em> lazy. Immutable <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>s and <a href="CommandQuerySeparation.html">CommandQuerySeparation</a> can be used to protect against aliasing and side-effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="InternalIteration.html">InternalIteration</a> can make code easier to read and write. <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s enable their use, but they do have some limitations especially when it comes to flexibility. The <a href="TransfoldPattern.html">TransfoldPattern</a> shows how to <a href="InternalizeExternalIterators.html">InternalizeExternalIterators</a> in order to simultaneously iterate over multiple collections. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="TranslatorPattern.html">TranslatorPattern</a> extends the concept of <a href="ExternalPolymorphism.html">ExternalPolymorphism</a> to objects and more importantly aggregates of objects. So that these aggregates can be used in new contexts without having to be re-opened and extended.

        I wonder if <a href="ThomasKuehne.html">ThomasKuehne</a>s ValueObjectPattern has any details that are missed on the <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> page. Similarly I wonder if there is any difference between his VoidValue and our more familiar <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a>.
