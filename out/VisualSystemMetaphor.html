        Visual System Metaphor
      </h1>
      <p>
        At <a href="ProductSight.html">ProductSight</a>, we've really had a hard time coming up with a good <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        From the <a href="XpSeattle.html">XpSeattle</a> user group meetings, it seems that other teams also struggle with the formulation of a <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>. It was somewhat encouraging to read <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>'s Xp2000 keynote (<a href="IsDesignDead.html">IsDesignDead</a>) in which he admits to not having the hang of this metaphor thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <a href="ProductSight.html">ProductSight</a>, we have a pair of <em>Cartoons</em> (or drawings) of our system on white boards. The cartoons are a rough sketch of the system that we use when talking about where we are going to add classes and how they inter-relate. One cartoon looks a little like UML ... the other a little like a sequence diagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although a real verbal metaphor would be better, having <em>something</em> helps.
