But I'm currently working on legacy code that was initially uncommented, undocumented, without tests and not well factored, and frankly, at least I can't get there from here quickly.

        <em>I know it's not ideal, but I didn't exactly have a choice. The business situation is such that we needed to keep adding features right after taking over the code base. So we </em><a href="PayForMeatWithCandy.html">PayForMeatWithCandy</a>, and refactor/add tests/comment/debug as we go along.

        Sorry, the attempt was to say that if you can build a system of any size with
        so few bugs they don't need to be tracked, you are better (at it) than I am. I don't see how it can be done.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Tip: If you are using such a system, consider tracking project risks and/or feature requests with it, depending on the situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you start mixing non-defect data into a defect tracking system, take great care to provide a way of reporting on (or at least counting) just the defects. Otherwise, you leave the system open to misinterpretation. Consider the "Microsoft NT ships with 64,000 bugs!" headline. Few external people will dig deep enough to discover that N entries in the tracking system doesn't mean N bugs. -- </em><a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a><em></em>

        <em>I guess the question is; what is a bug? Defects, misunderstanding, failures, etc. You need a way of keeping tracking of all the stuff that development churns up.

           I made extensive use of TestTrackPro at a previous job - worked OK, but: Cumbersome windows client, lots of work to enter a new issue, searching was powerful but difficult to grok, no real way to plan for a specific release, flakey server.
