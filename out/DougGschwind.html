        I am a developer/architect, and am looking forward to the proceedings of the group. Our first meeting resulted in lots of interesting discussion. I am sure it will be more so when we target specific patterns for discussion.

        My goals for participating in the Boulder Design Patterns Study Group are simply to be able to speak fluently in design patterns, recognize the right pattern for a given situation, and have a pretty good idea regarding a suitable Java implementation.

        I agree with Tim's stance in that we have different people in the group present their understanding of a given pattern. That will help educate the presenter as well as distribute the load of mediating the discussions so that Tim isn't the only one with that task.

        I also concur with the presentation goals. As I recall those were to the effect of discussing the sections per pattern as present in the GoF book (e.g. Intent, Motivation, Applicability, Structure, etc.), depicting a solution in code that does NOT leverage the given pattern, and lastly depicting a solution in code that leverages the pattern so as to help us understand how the use of the pattern results in code that is more readable, maintainable, etc.

        Would you care to implement a Smalltalk to Java translator? Strike a blow for freedom and all that? :)
