        Prototype Object/Relational mapper produced by <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The prototype and early documentation is available from <a href="http://communities.msn.com/objectspaces">http://communities.msn.com/objectspaces</a> [<em>MSN group seems to be dead, 2004-02-25</em>]
