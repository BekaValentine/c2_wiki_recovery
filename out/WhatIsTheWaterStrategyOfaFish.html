        What Is The Water Strategy Ofa Fish
      </h1>
      <p>
        Fish don't <em>have</em> a strategy for dealing with water, they <em>are</em> a strategy for dealing with water. 
      </p>
      <p>
        XP doesn't need an explicit strategy for dealing with risk, it <em>is</em> a strategy for dealing with risk, albeit one that causes you to ignore some risks (i.e. ones that you can't convince your customer to care about).

        I wonder if Kent was intentionally referencing McLuhan's famous quote: "We don't know who discovered water, but we can be certain it wasn't a fish"?
      </p>

        "[Fish] <em>are</em> a strategy for dealing with water."
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, really? And what if my demand on the water is to drive the turbines in this tidal power station? Are fish the strategy for that, too?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>No.  They are </em>'a<em>' strategy, not the only one.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Fish aren't strategies.  <em>Create fish</em>, <em>use fish</em>, <em>buy fish</em>, <em>turn into fish</em> might be strategies for various things.  But if I ask someone for a plan of action and they say <em>fish</em>, they're either speaking nonsense or talking about catching them.
      </p>

        Agreed. It's like saying, "And what if my project really is just like my past projects and the specifications are all known up front, and it's a life-critical system, etc., etc." Well, in that case, you want a different strategy for risk, like the method they use for writing the software for the space shuttle.

        Fish <strong>are</strong> a strategy that genes use to deal with water.  Individual fish components address specific problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Gills: How to get oxygen while under water
        </li>
        <li>
           Fins: How to move quickly while under water
        </li>
        <li>
           Scales: How to streamline for traversing water
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Fish integrate these and other strategies into a single solution.  The ultimate problem to be solved is genetic propagation.  The context is (among other things) a water-based environment.  The solution (for fish) is to be a fish. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, XP is a strategy for dealing with risk.  Individual components of XP deal with software development in the context of a risk-filled environment:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unit Tests: How to let everyone change the code safely
        </li>
        <li>
           User Stories: How to communicate effectively with customers
        </li>
        <li>
           Short iterations: How to make sure that you stay on top of customer's needs
        </li>
      </ul>
