        Vapor Ware
      </h1>
      <p>
        A product that doesn't exist yet. By implication, it will <em>never</em> exist; it's not even in development. But somehow that doesn't stop the salespeople selling it.  [Not all vaporware is completely nonexistent; software that is in development and has been announced somehow, but doesn't have a firm availability date and feature set, is often considered vaporware.  Software not-yet-released, but with a promised ship date in the near future (and an expectation that it will actually be delivered) often escapes the "vaporware" label]

        Large software companies often become famed for '<a href="VaporWare.html">VaporWare</a>' production - they announce competing products days after rivals release a product in order to induce <a href="FearUncertaintyDoubt.html">FearUncertaintyDoubt</a>, then go off and start work on the product...

        <em>Tactics like that got </em><a href="IbmCorporation.html">IbmCorporation</a> in trouble with the anti-trust authorities.  Nowadays, companies aren't generally blatant about pre-announcing vaporware; instead word gets leaked to the trade press.  For example, people have been talking about <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a> for years now; nobody knows for sure when it will ship or what it will have when it does.  It might end up like <a href="MicrosoftCairo.html">MicrosoftCairo</a>--as pie in the sky<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And if the </em><a href="FearUncertaintyDoubt.html">FearUncertaintyDoubt</a> is enough to kill the competing product (and if the competing company don't have a lot of cash, it probably goes down with the product), they don't need to really finish the product.  At best a half-baked product is released and will be forgotten 6 months later.<em></em>

        Even at that both these still ignore the 'NEVER exist' criteria. The term vaporware like the products it describes is a bit ill defined and still in the pipe. I guess by now any reader who has not already experienced <a href="VaporWare.html">VaporWare</a> is starting to get the idea.

        <em>My family is thinking of getting a new Windows version. But we don't want to buy XP because </em><a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a> is going to come soon. Then <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a> gets delayed. So, I guess no Windows version for a while... did <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> just <a href="VaporWare.html">VaporWare</a> itself?<em></em>
