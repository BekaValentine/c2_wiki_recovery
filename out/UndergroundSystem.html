        Underground System
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="UndergroundSystem.html">UndergroundSystem</a> is a system that management doesn't know about, but the developers do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending on the general competence of management, varying degrees of stealth are employed to hide the existence of the <a href="UndergroundSystem.html">UndergroundSystem</a>. The best respected use of an <a href="UndergroundSystem.html">UndergroundSystem</a> is to implement by stealth necessary items for software development, e.d. well-designed <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a>. Yes, I am of the opinion that <a href="BondageAndDisciplineVersionControl.html">BondageAndDisciplineVersionControl</a> deserves to be driven scriptwise and the real <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> hidden somewhere else; however the more common case is there is no <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> because Management doesn't want to spring for it.
