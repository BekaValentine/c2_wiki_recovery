        Xp Is For Experience
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have long considered the case for <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is made best by considering its connection and its dependency upon eXPert, eXperiencedProgrammers. XP works best when people "already" know what is a better way to approach a programming task, having "already" experienced similar processing problems and having arrived at satisfactory solutions. In my view, XP's successful results are more dependent upon that skill than upon the approach or method used. Teams have always worked best when work is carried out in an atmosphere of Cooperation, Concentration, and Consistency.

        Consider this marketing paragraph from a company (here called Xp Company) using such processes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Xp company recognizes that each development project is different. It therefore does not believe that a sole methodology should be applied to all projects.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The key is to choose the parts of methodologies that are relevant and applicable to the individual project.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Saying that, there are some principles, techniques and best practices that Xp Company applies to all projects: HireTheBestPeople</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>The </em>'number one factor<em>' effecting success is the people on the team. Waiting for and hiring the best people is key.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
