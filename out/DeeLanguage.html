        D is a <a href="SystemProgramming.html">SystemProgramming</a> language developed by <a href="WalterBright.html">WalterBright</a>. Its focus is on combining the power and high performance of <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> with the programmer productivity of modern languages like <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>. Special attention is given to the needs of concurrency, reliability, documentation, quality assurance, management and portability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The D language uses <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> and compiles directly to machine code. It supports many programming styles: imperative, object oriented, and metaprogramming. It's a member of the C syntax family, and its appearance is very similar to that of C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        A book, <a href="TheDeeProgrammingLanguage.html">TheDeeProgrammingLanguage</a> by <a href="AndreiAlexandrescu.html">AndreiAlexandrescu</a>, was recently released and has been seen as an important step forward for D. (Chapter 13 "Concurrency in the D Programming Language" is available as free read online: <a href="http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1609144">http://www.informit.com/articles/article.aspx?p=1609144</a> )
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two versions of D in use. D1 achieved stable status in 2007 and D2, a non-backwards compatible successor is nearly feature complete and is currently in the final stages of development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Latest versions are D1.075 and D2.060 (Aug 2012)

        I looked at it and I think it is a great language. It is small and simple, OO like Java but native executables (60 KB+), GC, interfaces, templates, closures, enums, dynamic arrays, hashes, switch(string) and a lot more. I have installed a wiki to support Walter's creation: <a href="http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi">http://www.prowiki.org/wiki4d/wiki.cgi</a> (350+ pages in Aug04). -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>

        According to <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a>, there have been at least a dozen languages called D. <a href="http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html">http://www.research.att.com/~bs/bs_faq.html</a>

        Interesting, I was just yesterday thinking that it would be nice to be able to declare functions inside functions to support the simplification of complex if/then/else statements using <a href="ExtractMethod.html">ExtractMethod</a> refactoring. The idea here is to simplify/clarify the situation where you need to use a large number of local variables in a complex logical comparison and want to keep the expression(s) in the if/then/else statement(s) as short/simple/clear as possible. Without something that allows you to extract a method but still allow access to the local variables of the enclosing function scope, you are left with either passing everything you need into the extracted method (which often confuses things as much as just leaving the messy logical expression in-place), or making all the variables needed in the extracted method(s) instance variables of the enclosing class (confusing, too). Reading the D Language "Quick Comparison" table, I noticed that it supports the notion of "Nested Functions" which allow exactly the behavior desired. Serendipity is an interesting thing...

      <p>
        Being able to nest function definitions is nice for all kinds of reasons (with full-strength <a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>, please), but in the scenario you describe, isn't the code trying to tell you that you're missing one or more classes with responsibility for the logic in the expression? Depending on what the result of the expression is for, maybe Strategy or State would be good patterns to use here. And anyway, isn't the better solution to "the situation where you need to use a large number of local variables in a complex logical comparison" to factor the code so that you only have a small number of local variables involved in a simple logical comparison?

        As a <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> programmer, the thing I like most about D is that it has both <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> and automatic("stack") objects, which you can use to manage resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, the main emphasis of it is, I believe, to take the good bits of C++ and remove the crud, i.e., compatibility with </em><a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, platform dependent type sizes and preprocessor. While adding in various c++ features that exist at the library level into the core language, i.e., garbage collection, strings, collections.<em></em>

        D looks like a fantastic language, but it's not enough of an improvement over C++ to get me to learn it. If I want speed, I can be fairly productive in C++ using <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> et al. If I don't care much about speed, there are much more productive and high-level languages I can use like <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> or <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>. D seems to be in an uncomfortable middle area: equivalent or slightly slower performance than <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a> but not substantially more productive.
      </p>
      <p>
        If D had better standard libraries including a well-designed portable GUI frontend, I'd consider it for desktop app development. I think it could see some success there or in games, but only with more library work.
