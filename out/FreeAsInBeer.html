        <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> is something that is distributed at no charge (<a href="GratisSoftware.html">GratisSoftware</a>), or solely for the cost of distribution. The term is used to distinguish software that costs nothing from <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> (<a href="LibreSoftware.html">LibreSoftware</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> is about the <em>free</em>dom (Latin <em>liber</em> from which the English <em>liberty</em> is derived) to do whatever you want with the software (provided you don't restrict this same right from others). It has nothing to do with <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> but is often confused as such.  <a href="FreeAsInSpeech.html">FreeAsInSpeech</a> software is often sold for money, making it not <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> derives from the first line of an essay by <a href="RichardStallman.html">RichardStallman</a>: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html.</a> However, beer is rarely free so this metaphor is actually quite inaccurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>IIRC, the contrast is made between </em><a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> and <a href="FreeAsInSpeech.html">FreeAsInSpeech</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The different meanings of "Free" in <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> and <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a>, and the resultant difficulty of convincing companies that they could make money producing <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> led to the coining of the term <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>. Stallman argues against this change here: <a href="http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html">http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-software-for-freedom.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> is a <a href="MarketingPattern.html">MarketingPattern</a> that is an extreme example of the <a href="LossLeader.html">LossLeader</a>. It enables entry into a market that is either saturated, locked into a single product, or that contains superior products. It can also be used to sell upgrades to existing products (many companies will make old versions of their software <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a>, to encourage upgrading to the latest, not-free version). Given enough resources you can use this pattern to dominate your competition (see <a href="MicrosoftInternetExplorer.html">MicrosoftInternetExplorer</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        By maintaining control over a <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> product, the creator can ensure that it remains designed to lead a user into purchasing either a more fully-featured version, or a related product. If you do not gain this advantage from your <a href="FreeAsInBeer.html">FreeAsInBeer</a> product, you should consider releasing <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>/<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, as it may allow you to offload some of the development costs to volunteers, and is a good PR move.

        I don't think that <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> has to cost nothing by default. You're free to sell <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>, provided you make the source code available to others to do with as they wish... -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I also believe that it was <a href="EricRaymond.html">EricRaymond</a> and the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> people who had issue with <a href="RichardStallman.html">RichardStallman</a> 's sociological ideas about <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> and therefore created the term <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>. <a href="RichardStallman.html">RichardStallman</a> does have an issue with <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, but the opening paragraph of the page makes it sound like <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> is a response to <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, which is false.

        Also contrast with the term FreeAsInPretzels, which I overheard lately. Seems like a pretty vivid description of a lot of the 'free' software out there; functionality-restricted versions which are intended to nothing but whet your appetite for not-so-free-software. -- <a href="AdamBerger.html">AdamBerger</a>
