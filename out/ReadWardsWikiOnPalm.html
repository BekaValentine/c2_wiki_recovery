        What I want to see is <em>this</em> database on my <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> handheld, and a means to snapshot every so often (based on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>). Then I could get a fix on the bus or wherever. I suspect the entire database would be too large, however, and I'd have to delete all those games. In a few years, we'll have ubiquitous mobile net access and I can stop worrying, I suppose. -- <a href="NeilGall.html">NeilGall</a>

        Given the total lack of gratuitous multimedia and bleeding edge html
        here, I'd have thought that setting up an <a href="AvantGo.html">AvantGo</a> channel to
        batch up the pages listed on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> would be pretty easy.
        You wouldn't lose much (if anything) in the conversion.

        Alternatively, it'd be pretty easy to write a site file for <a href="SiteScooper.html">SiteScooper</a>.  --<a href="KornySietsma.html">KornySietsma</a>

        <em>I don't think you're going to get </em><a href="AvantGo.html">AvantGo</a> to do it.  But I did get the Pendragon browser (<a href="http://www.pendragon.com)">http://www.pendragon.com)</a> to cache pages on my palm.  I like the idea of caching <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>, but I'm not really a <a href="QuickChangesJunkie.html">QuickChangesJunkie</a>. --<a href="JohnStoshMuczynski.html">JohnStoshMuczynski</a><em>  I must have had a good day back then.  These days it won't cache that many pages before hitting "the limit".  --</em><a href="JohnStoshMuczynski.html">JohnStoshMuczynski</a>

        Plucker (<a href="http://plucker.gnu-designs.com/)">http://plucker.gnu-designs.com/)</a> works great using these settings:
      </p>
      <code>
        home_url	= <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/quickChanges">http://c2.com/cgi/quickChanges</a><br/>
        home_maxdepth = 2<br/>
        home_stayonhost = true<br/>
        home_staybelow  = <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/">http://c2.com/cgi/</a><br/>

        <em>The link above seems to be a </em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>. Is <a href="http://www.plkr.org/">http://www.plkr.org/</a> the same thing?<em></em>

        How about using <a href="AvantGo.html">AvantGo</a> and pointing it to this wiki? Anybody done that? I've used <a href="AvantGo.html">AvantGo</a> for other sites and it works. It even can handle forms in a way.

        Have a look at PluckerSoftware over on <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> - it's <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, lets you sync any website or most hard disk files onto your Palm device, and then use the included offline browser.  Sort of <a href="AvantGo.html">AvantGo</a> without the restrictions (2MB size, Internet sites only), and much more flexible - however, it's not quite as easy to set up, though the installer is very slick and required almost no tinkering.
      </p>
      <p>
        One issue with any offline syncing tool (e.g. GNU wget) is that the Wiki software needs to make it easy to exclude all non-viewing links, e.g. Edit page, search page, <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s, etc.  Ideally, the Wiki should use one CGI script URL for viewing, and a completely separate one for editing, searching, etc - many offline syncing tools can limit themselves to not go 'above' a certain directory in a URL, but few are able to do <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> matching to exclude particular variants of the same CGI URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        P.S. Please can we have <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, it would make life much easier... or was there a decision that <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a> works better? -- <a href="RichardDonkin.html">RichardDonkin</a>
