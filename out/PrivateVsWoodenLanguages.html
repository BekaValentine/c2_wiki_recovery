        First some generalizations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Private, meaning in part individualized or personal, not hidden, but perhaps uncommunicative to the general public.
        </li>
        <li>
           Wooden, being fixed and inflexible, applied in a closed fraternity of practice, as being the approved and acceptable means of expression.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The first being employed in an individual's environment as a means of self-expression and elaboration, the second as employed by a cadre of individuals, formalized and standardized for group use.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Often used in criticisms, when words used in the language appear in the general collective of expressions. Noted as not very useful because of the lack of clarity as to what the language's words mean in this, a foreign context.
