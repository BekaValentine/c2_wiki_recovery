      <p>
        This phrase came to mind I'm sure because I heard <a href="SimonPeytonJones.html">SimonPeytonJones</a> talking about MetaProgrammingInHaskell in Oxford last week, and the additional challenges for type inferencing in the <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> that his new syntax for generative programming brings with it. Then there was this excellent fragment from <a href="KathyBracy.html">KathyBracy</a> on <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a> yesterday:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Richard, all you had to do was look up four lines on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> to see my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> had the same computer signature (which I'm sure you saw) to know it was I who wrote the above comment.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        As I then clarified, I had not in fact seen the edit to Kathy's <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, let alone noticed the IP number on it and looked inside to see that it was Kathy herself - <a href="ForSure.html">ForSure</a> - who was always, or at least frequently associated with that IP number, the very same that had then also edited <a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a> and added the paragraph in question. Yet I guess that Kathy's assumption would have been a reasonable one for certain classes of <a href="RecentChangesJunkies.html">RecentChangesJunkies</a>. Correct?

        [<em>Yes</em>] -- [helpful answer last touched and perhaps agreed with by 62.64.201.151]

        Two reasons to raise this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          	I thought the analogy with TypeInferencing might be amusing
        </li>
        <li>
          	There is is a serious issue here about barrier to entry to Wiki or indeed (as in my own case) barrier to re-entry. "My <a href="IdentityInferenceEngine.html">IdentityInferenceEngine</a> clearly isn't as good as yours and it shows. Therefore I do not want to take part at all."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any thoughts from those more regular that me since the DNS reverse look-up was done away with?
      </p>
