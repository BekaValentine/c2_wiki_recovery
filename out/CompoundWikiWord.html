        <em>A notion which can allow information manipulation in a </em><a href="WikiWithMoreThanPages.html">WikiWithMoreThanPages</a> and a <a href="WikiWithMoreThanUsers.html">WikiWithMoreThanUsers</a><em> </em><a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a>.<a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20110914

        A <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> is WordsSmashedTogether, while a <a href="CompoundWikiWord.html">CompoundWikiWord</a> is WikiWords Separated By Specfic Nonblank Delimiters.The string above, following the italic phrase, is an example of one using the dot (.) as the delimiter.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> about such a notion is that it can be used as a <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a> in a URI. It also can be manipulated to form collections named by any of its constituent <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s, including collections based on any reordering of one or more of its parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.<a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a> would be used as the filter to construct a collection of pages containing the two WikiWords together, or if indicated, the WikiWords separated by spaces and/or other words.
          <ul>
            <li>
               In the immediate form the collection would collect the <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> pages which include <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a> and could be placed in sorted order of the modifiers (using the example, by <a href="DateStamp.html">DateStamp</a>).
            </li>
            <li>
               One might also use the Notion to Collect all the <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a> pages by a given contributor either ever created, or created in date order, or by month, or by year, decade, or century. (This is particularly useful in construction histories)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The use of <a href="CompoundWikiWord.html">CompoundWikiWord</a>s can indicate other things and provide for other kinds of things, including such things making possible a <a href="WikiWithMoreThanUsers.html">WikiWithMoreThanUsers</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        To make these thing possible, <a href="CompoundWikiWords.html">CompoundWikiWords</a> would be processed using a <a href="WikiQueryLanguage.html">WikiQueryLanguage</a> (WQL). An unimplemented (as yet) in any <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> I know.
