        Causally Reflective Metastructure

      <p>
        Is a <strong>metastructure</strong> -- it is code about code, not code about content.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is <strong>reflective</strong> -- it describes itself, rather than something else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Is <strong>causal</strong> -- a change to the metastructure changes the behavior of the system, as opposed to simply breaking the description.
      </p>
      <p>
        Java has a ReflectiveMetastructure, in that programs can query the system for information about classes, methods, members and so on. The Java metastructure is, however, generally <strong>not</strong> causally reflective. If you succeed at changing a Java class object, you generally succeed at breaking the system.

        Many early <a href="ObjectOrientedDatabase.html">ObjectOrientedDatabase</a>s were like this.

      <p>
        Smalltalk and some lisp systems have a <a href="CausallyReflectiveMetastructure.html">CausallyReflectiveMetastructure</a>. When I change the contents of a CompiledMethod (carefully!), the system behavior actually changes.
