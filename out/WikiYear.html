        Wiki Year
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Definition:</strong> A term that defines the standard unit of time that one has been a <a href="WikiMember.html">WikiMember</a>, <a href="WikiLurker.html">WikiLurker</a>, or <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a>. Thus, in context, one would say that one has been a <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a> for 11 WikiYears.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sort of like "doggy-years"; an off-the-cuff measurement of WikiMembership.
      </p>
      <p>
        To find out what real amount of time that a WikiYear is equal to, I think that we would consider what the average turn-over is for <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>s.  We would then assign this turn-over rate (for example: 3 months) as being the definition of a WikiYear. (If figuring out this turn-over rate isn't intuitive, then the community could agree on a period of time.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiNewbie.html">WikiNewbie</a>s would be <1 WikiYears old,
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> or a WikiRegular would be <5  WikiYears old, but older than 'Noobs
        </li>
        <li>
           WikiVeterans would be <10 WikiYears old, but older than 'Zens
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        etc.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Would there then be cause to have such labels as WikiAncients or WikiMethusalehs? Just kidding. Seriously though, I just think that the concept would add a bit of good-natured fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a>, though, would still remain an accolade earned through practicing the <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a>, instead of just being the oldest WikiMember on the block.
