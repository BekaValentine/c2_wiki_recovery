        Category Based Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A category for any language that people assert is "based" in something.
      </p>
      <p>
        E.g., <a href="PrototypeBasedLanguage.html">PrototypeBasedLanguage</a>, TupleBasedLanguage, etc.
      </p>

        I'm disappointed I was hoping this was about languages based on <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a>, like <a href="CharityLanguage.html">CharityLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's what </em>SaundersMacLane gets for picking such a generic name for the math.  Like how <a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> needs a disclaimer that "This is not a category for theories."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, <em>but,</em> this is probably the <em>only</em> wiki category page that applies also to itself --- meaning, <a href="CategoryBasedLanguage.html">CategoryBasedLanguage</a> can itself serve as a page describing category-based languages.  :-)
