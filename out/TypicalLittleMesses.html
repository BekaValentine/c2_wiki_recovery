        <strong>Browser Flattens Tabs:</strong> Some very old browsers replace tabs with spaces when editing. This changes indented text and old-style bulleted lists into klunky preformatted text. <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a>s simply put the tabs back or use new-style bulleted lists. (See <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>, <a href="TextFormattingExamples.html">TextFormattingExamples</a>, <a href="SimulatingQuoteBlocks.html">SimulatingQuoteBlocks</a>, <a href="TabMunging.html">TabMunging</a>.)

      <p>
        <strong>Authors Try HTML:</strong> A typical mistake is to type a link using HTML tags like 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><A HREF="<a href="http://c2.com/~ward/">http://c2.com/~ward/</a>">Blah Blah</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        which is properly written as an inline link :
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><a href="http://c2.com/~ward/">http://c2.com/~ward/</a></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Occasionally one will see something like [1]. This is a legacy of the now-defunct <a href="EditLinks.html">EditLinks</a> feature. (See <a href="FixingLinks.html">FixingLinks</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Authors Can't Spell:</strong>
        So <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a>s make the necessary adjustments to spelling and grammar without otherwise drawing attention to modest mistakes. (Remembering, gently, that built-in spell checkers are only <em>so</em> smart.)
      </p>
      <p>
        This can also result in pages added with spelling errors or with word forms (such as plurality) that result in <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s that don't get linked to enough. Clicking the page title to see which pages refer to the poorly named page allows a <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a> to update links and eventually eliminate the poorly named page. (See <a href="RefactorByMerging.html">RefactorByMerging</a> for a list of plural pages.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Pages Are Accidentally Added:</strong> E.g. someone creates the PurduePatternReflectory entry used as an example of a page waiting to be written on <a href="WelcomeVisitors.html">WelcomeVisitors</a>. Or someone creates WebPageHere. So <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a>s delete the pages to clean up the database and keep the site in order. (See <a href="HowToDeletePages.html">HowToDeletePages</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Spam:</strong> Just what constitutes <a href="WikiSpam.html">WikiSpam</a> is debatable, as is whether to delete it from "visitor" pages like <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a> and <a href="RecentVisitors.html">RecentVisitors</a>. But considering this Wiki's variety of visitors, lurkers, and active participants, eliminating porn spam is a must. (See <a href="DeletingSpam.html">DeletingSpam</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>New authors duplicate content:</strong>  No one can readily hold all of Wiki in their head.  New authors often haven't even read a fraction of Wiki yet are exuberant and, in their <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a>, often create duplicate content.  Don't grow the page, move the content to the relevant pre-existing spot and leave a little note letting them know what's going on.  Consider it an opportunity.  If it isn't clear that the content should be moved -- for example, it doesn't <em>quite</em> fit in a pre-existing spot -- then leave a suggestion that it be moved so that such action can be debated.
