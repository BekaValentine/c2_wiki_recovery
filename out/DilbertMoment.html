        A "<a href="DilbertMoment.html">DilbertMoment</a>" is coined after that luckless inhabitant of cubicle hell, Dilbert.

            <li>
               Of course, being surrounded by mountains helps.  Belgium wanted to be neutral in WWII, and we know what happened to them...

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Their clocks would be very, very accurate.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Until the entire industry gets whacked upside the head by a now-obvious <a href="DisruptiveTechnology.html">DisruptiveTechnology</a> like quartz crystals...

        <li>
           They would have excellent chocolate.
        </li>
        <li>
           Their pocketknives would be extraordinary.

        (...) After years of inbreeding, the super-smart people have evolved into skinny, gray creatures with huge eyes. They wear makeup to look like stern Germans when tourists are around.
