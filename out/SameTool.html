        Same Tool
      </h1>
      <p>
        Same is a tool to find duplicate lines in multiple text files. Very useful to find and fix <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a>. It has been designed by <a href="MarnixKlooster.html">MarnixKlooster</a> to be simple, portable, and fast.

        Indeed it is possible to build a tool for mechanically removing
        duplicated methods and code - I built such a thing for the
        language Self (see <a href="http://www.guruinfo.co.uk).">http://www.guruinfo.co.uk).</a> The tool did
        as much refactoring of duplicated code as it could, without
        manual intervention to tell the tool what made sense. A lot of
        the time the results were surprisingly good; hierarchies constructed
        by this tool were often just what you'd expect, showing that basing
        hierarchies simply on removal of duplication leads to 'good' 
        hierarchies. The results of trying to automatically refactor methods
        was (even) more contentious though. For example, although '+ 1' is 
        duplicated a lot, do you really want to replace it with a method 
        called 'incremented' (or something similar) just so that the concept 
        of incrementing is expressed only once? --<a href="IvanMoore.html">IvanMoore</a>

        Funny, while working on a recent project, I did exactly that.  If the '+ 1' is happening frequently on the same object, it probably wants to have such a method... at the very least, it might better explain what '+ 1' represents:  next element of a list?  next highest priority?  one second less till doomsday?  :)  --<a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a>

        See <a href="http://www.xpdeveloper.com/xpdwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SameTool">http://www.xpdeveloper.com/xpdwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=SameTool</a> for a fork of Same that is faster and scales better when you have to handle hundreds of thousands of lines of code.
