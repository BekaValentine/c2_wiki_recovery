        Delivery Is Not The Goal

        As <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> points out, there are games within games within games. This may well present a subtle danger to those of us who would apply or promote <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.

        XP focuses on rapid delivery of high quality software. That's great, but we should be aware that, as is hinted at on <a href="CthreeProjectTerminated.html">CthreeProjectTerminated</a>, sometimes delivery is immaterial to the goals of the games being played by the rest of the organization. Sometimes <a href="DeliveryIsNotTheGoal.html">DeliveryIsNotTheGoal</a> (but <a href="TerminationCanBeSuccess.html">TerminationCanBeSuccess</a>). And we should be aware that, sometimes, the health and well-being of our project relies on the benevolence of someone who is playing one of those other games. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider what goals other than delivery the various roles described on <a href="WhoIsTheCustomer.html">WhoIsTheCustomer</a> have in their various games.

        <em>We may suspect that XP's very strong focus on delivery might expose an XP project to these effects to a greater extent than a project based on some less focussed process.</em>

        There is some truth in that Keith. At its most negative a "more transparent process" makes an inconvenient project easier to kill off by that senior manager figure so well known to Wiki, <a href="NiccoloMachiavelli.html">NiccoloMachiavelli</a> (see <a href="TheGamesContinue.html">TheGamesContinue</a>). But if Adam Smith ever gets the better of Niccolo (and remember it's <em>your</em> choice that makes the difference) he would presumably view this as a temporary, local inefficiency in the market. In the end enough good people will take <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>'s advice to <a href="ChangeYourOrganization.html">ChangeYourOrganization</a> and the better businesses that result will ... do some real good for real people in the real world.
