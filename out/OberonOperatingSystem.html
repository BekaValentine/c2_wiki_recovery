        Oberon Operating System
      </h1>
      <p>
        Oberon is an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> developed by <a href="NiklausWirth.html">NiklausWirth</a> and <a href="JuergGutknecht.html">JuergGutknecht</a>. See also <a href="OberonLanguage.html">OberonLanguage</a>.
      </p>

        Some of its cool features are
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tiling windowing system. Windows are arranged in two tracks. You never have a mess on the screen and windows are always rectangular. I'd really like to have a window manager like this!

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Integrated Text format with embedded objects. You can middle-click on a Module.Function name and it automatically loads the module and calls the function.

        If I remember correctly, one of the design requirements for Oberon was that Oberon should compile Oberon within less than a minute. Apparently, the motivation for Oberon was that <a href="NiklausWirth.html">NiklausWirth</a> had worked with Cedar (a fine tool) at <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a> and felt that it was just too large, so he went home and rewrote it.

        <li>
           I've found it short on documentation to help me get started. After 3 hours I gave up.

      </ul>

        It uses UI metaphors and conventions that are wildly different from the modern "standard", which can make it rather challenging to learn about. But this also makes it a treasure if you're curious about how things can be done differently from the modern "standard", and it does actually have useful applications made for it. <em>Curious. UI and app examples?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Useful apps: Windowing system, compiler, text editor, web browser and server, at least. Interesting UI ideas: It uses extensive mouse "interclicking" or "chording", clicking one mouse button while holding another (Ctrl-* or Alt-* keyboard shortcuts are examples of keyboard chording, Oberon does it with the mouse too). Tiled window system. Exposure of the system API to the user as commands. Probably more I don't remember; one can download a version that will run on top of Linux or Windows, and (as far as I recall) it comes with a decent assortment of introductory documentation. -- <a href="SimonHeath.html">SimonHeath</a>

        <strong>Oberon Influences, Conspiracy Theories</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently found out that Oberon has a strong influence on some other products including the <a href="PlanNine.html">PlanNine</a> editor called Acme (which I think can run on other operating systems).
      </p>
      <p>
        Quote:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"Acme is a text editor and graphical shell from the Plan 9 from Bell Labs operating system, designed and implemented by Rob Pike. It can use the sam command language. The design of the interface was </em>'influenced by Oberon<em>'. It is different from other editing environments in that it acts as a 9P server. A distinctive element of the user interface is mouse chording."</em> --<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acme_%28text_editor%29</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One of my conspiracy theories, is that <a href="RobPike.html">RobPike</a> (and other Unix programmers) are very much in love with Wirth and his student's works from Switzerland. For example consider <a href="LimboLanguage.html">LimboLanguage</a>, <a href="SawzallLanguage.html">SawzallLanguage</a>, Inferno,  Acme Editor, and several other heavily oberon/modula/pascal influenced products. They are very very very similar in syntax and ideas. They've shown several obvious similarities - striking similarities actually. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider also the C programming language, which is very much like an extended version of Wirth's original Pascal when Pascal first came out with its shortcomings. C was simply disguised in completely different syntax and more flexible than Pascal - and now Limbo and Sawzall and other languages are looking more and more like Wirth's ideas. This is a good thing, not a bad thing - of course - it's perfectly okay for ideas to be shared. I think more credit should be given and less hatred,  though, toward Wirth.   --ConspiracyTheorist 
      </p>
      <p>
        Even consider <a href="RobPike.html">RobPike</a>'s paper here, which again has a lot of Wirth similarities in the Type system declarations:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://coblitz.codeen.org:3125/citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/761/http:zSzzSzcm.bell-labs.comzSzcmzSzcszSzdoczSz89zSz1-a.pdf/pike89concurrent.pdf">http://coblitz.codeen.org:3125/citeseer.ist.psu.edu/cache/papers/cs/761/http:zSzzSzcm.bell-labs.comzSzcmzSzcszSzdoczSz89zSz1-a.pdf/pike89concurrent.pdf</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And consider this paper which mentions Oberon numerous times (<a href="PlanNine.html">PlanNine</a>'s help system starting phases):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/1st_edition/help/help.pdf">http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/1st_edition/help/help.pdf</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, it is not such a Conspiracy Theory - but rather a <em>fact</em> that Oberon is having an influence on famous Cee programmers who'd we would have otherwise falsely assumed hated Wirth.
