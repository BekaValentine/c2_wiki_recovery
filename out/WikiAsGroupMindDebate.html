        Wiki As Group Mind Debate
      </h1>
      <p>
        I don't consider <strong>any</strong> online forum a GroupMind for one major reason - the participants are not controlled by the GroupMind, and many can even be lying to the GroupMind.  Insects, the main example of <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a> or <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>, are limited by the fact that the colony <strong>will</strong> enforce conformity with expulsion/death. --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        Ian Stewart and Jack Cohen have a word. They say "Extelligence" to mean a physical manifestation of intelligenne - something that requires intelligence to make, and to interact with. A book, a puzzle, a computer. Intelligence and Extelligence, they claim, are locked together in a feedback loop.
