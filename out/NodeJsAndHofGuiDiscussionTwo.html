        ["conceptually and syntactically messy" in ways we've already discussed -- for instance, syntactic mess arising from the need for a class definition, which even in the most concise of languages (say, Python) is still heavier than a mere method call as .addEventListener() approaches involve, and conceptual mess arising from the fact that the base Button class itself can never be instantiated usefully as a button, and therefore that it <em>isn't</em> a button. Redefining methods outside the class is very nice to have, and it's good that <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> provide ways to do it, but it doesn't solve the issues. As for the multiple-handler issue, the GUI framework generally needs to do work of its own when you click a button, plus you need to add your own action, at the minimum; under your approach, do you need to explicitly invoke the method in the superclass to make that work? -DavidMcLean]

           In that approach, only a little bit more, but that's not normally how it would be used. And we could tweak the syntax of a language to shorten such, but brevity is not the only factor to consider.

           It's actually shorter than the "external" approach because the class provides context whereas the external approach has to keep reinventing context for each attribute/method etc.

        Re: "and conceptual mess arising from the fact that the base Button class itself can never be instantiated usefully as a button and therefore that it isn't a button." -- Please clarify. I don't consider OOP to be about classifying objects, categories, and/or types in some kind of intellectual way; it's primarily a modularization technique, and any mental classification assistance is a nice bonus. The "meaning" is whatever the architect want's it to be. If we need "locks" on some objects/classes per instantiation/inheritance limits for protection etc., that can be added to a language (see <a href="DualTypingLanguage.html">DualTypingLanguage</a>), but I don't know what the need is you have in mind here.
      </p>
      <p>
        [My point is that you can't meaningfully instantiate an instance of the Button class, if the only way to attach handlers to a button is by overriding its methods. Any instance of the Button class itself is not actually a button, because it can't possibly have any associated behaviour. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still not following you. And I never ruled out <em>other</em> ways to attach handlers. I'm am just making the most common way easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        [For the first point: The class Button represents a button. If you make an instance of it, with new Button(), the thing you get should be a button. However, if you can only bind event handlers by subclassing it (MyButton extends Button), then making an instance of Button itself, with new Button(), does not give you a button; it gives you a decoration. As for other ways to attach handlers: Correct, you didn't explictly rule them out, but you also never actually presented any other ways to attach handlers and you continually deride the most common approach to doing so. Feel free to propose other ways to attach handlers, preferably that work for multiple handlers. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: "If you make an instance of it, with new Button(), the thing you get should be a button." -- That's exactly what is happening. I don't see a problem. Subclassing is doing pretty much the same as "new" in the kind of language I'm thinking of (objects and classes are the same thing). Perhaps we need better syntax conventions to clarify that; I'm just half borrowing Java parts to try to make the examples resemble something familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        [If you make an instance of Button with new Button(), you get a button with no event handlers attached to it. That's not a button; that's a decoration. That's the problem. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        No, it's a blank button that doesn't do anything. (Or, an error if title is required.)
      </p>
      <p>
        [A blank button that doesn't do anything is a decoration. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, if you don't want a blank/dud button, then fill it up with stuff. 
      </p>
      <p>
        [Obviously. But you can't do that if you have an instance of Button, because you can only attach handlers by subclassing. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that's what we want to maintain regimentation of modules. Example 8490 shows a possible way to allow "externally defined" classes, but I'm not sure it's wise. I'm not sure I want to try to compete with your scatter-shot techniques. This is dicey territory.
      </p>
      <p>
        [We "want" it to be meaningless to instantiate instances of the base Button class? Why? How does it "maintain regimentation of modules"? -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure what you are getting at. It seems you are used to doing it a certain way. Java's rigidity has perhaps boxed in thinking. Incidentally, if we wanted to programmatically prevent an "empty" instance, then we could have a language with "required" key-words etc., just like in CRUD-land.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'm not a Java user; its rigidity has had no impact on my thinking. I don't see why it would be useful to provide a Button class which can be instantiated if doing so cannot produce a useful instance. How does it "maintain regimentation of modules" to do this? -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        How is that different than forgetting to hook a HOF to a button? I don't get your complaint.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You can create a button instance, assuming you have .addEventListener()-style methods on the class, which has no event handlers. However, that button instance can subsequently have event handlers bound to it. Therefore, the instance provides a meaningful button. If you create a button instance in a situation where the only way to bind handlers is subclassing, then that instance is not meaningful, as no event handlers can be bound to it. It's a question of what's possible rather than of what's actually done, essentially. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        So you are saying you want to be able to do something like Example 8490? (Putting aside whether it's good design or not.)
      </p>
      <p>
        [The ability to add methods to a particular instance after its instantiation does address the complaint, in the sense that the instance is no longer "meaningless", but it implies a strange blend of classical and prototypical OO, and I believe it still doesn't resolve the conceptual problem since hanging additional methods off an instance involves changing its interface on-the-fly. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: "it implies a strange blend of classical and prototypical OO" -- Yes, it's called making OO more competitive with FP. I don't know what you mean by "changing its interface on the fly". Isn't that what a dangling HOF does?
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> has the same strange blend. Why not go for pure prototypes? As for changing the interface, no? Not at all? The interface of an object is the set of operations that can be performed with it; adding an extra method changes that, while adding an event handler does not. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        We could have "locking" mechanisms in the language, but I'm not sure it would help anything much in a practical sense. Generally we want the ability to customize objects/classes. I didn't like Java's "final" for that reason: let me "locally" customize stuff as I see fit. As far as whether to use pure prototypes, I don't know if they could be flexible enough without goofy syntax. At this point we are just looking at the possibilities rather than putting syntax and OO conventions in stone.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Pure prototypes can definitely be "flexible enough without goofy syntax" if classical OO can be, since prototypical OO trivially subsumes classical OO (just define an object that you treat as though it were a class, putting all the methods on it and using clones of it as instances). -DavidMcLean]

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cloning (any) large attributes and/or method code kind of seems like a resource waste. But it's mostly a minor side-topic. Either ancestor tree traversal or cloning would probably work for the examples I gave. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="CopyOnWrite.html">CopyOnWrite</a> means cloning is not necessarily a resource waste.  What is "ancestor tree traversal"?<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's essentially using a form of tree-traversal under-the-hood. By "ancestor tree traversal" I mean if a given attribute/method is not defined in the current object, then the parent (ancestor) is recursively searched until they define it, or until we reach the top, and the sought-after attribute/method (result) remains undefined. That's "traditional" OOP, more or less. Cloning could make the "also run parent" feature we talked about elsewhere a bit sticky and/or confusing. It just seems to me we have more options if we keep and use a tie to ancestors. We can address ancestor parts/context/etc. when needed. Even if we can't envision such uses now, it keeps the door open. And explicit cloning is not prevented anyhow; we could have separate operators for those. Thus, we can have both worlds as needed, with ancestor traversal being the preferred. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I see.  What I don't see is how your use of overridden methods can handle multiple, independent event handlers fired for a single event.  For a given Button, there may be an explicit OnClick handler defined by the developer, but the form the button is used in may want to add its own OnClick handler to the Button.  Other widgets in the same form may want to add OnClick handlers to every Button, too.  So, any given Button may have the one explicit OnClick handler defined by the developer plus multiple OnClick handlers defined by various components of the environment the Button is used in.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That gets into how the "back end" works, and there are multiple angles to take on that. I'll float one approach here: define the on-click event for the form also. The "event" parameter would have "targetObject" as an attribute:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        class formX extends Form {<br/>
        onClick(event) {  // method<br/>
        if (event.targetObject.name=="buttonX") {<br/>
        console.write("The form also responded to buttonX click.")<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If we wanted a pre-selected group of buttons to respond, they can add an attribute "belongToGroup7".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        class formX extends Form {<br/>
        onClick(event) {  <br/>
        if (isDefined(event.targetObject.belongToGroup7)) {<br/>
        console.write("A Group 7 button was clicked.")<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        buttonX extends Button {<br/>
        belongToGroup7 = True;   // define an attribute<br/>
        onClick(event) {whatEver();}<br/>
        }<br/>
        buttonY extends Button {<br/>
        belongToGroup7 = True;   <br/>
        onClick(event) {whatEver();}<br/>
        }<br/>
        buttonZ extends Button {  <br/>
        // No group membership <----NOTE<br/>
        onClick(event) {whatEver();}<br/>

It still doesn't allow widgets to add an arbitrary number of event handlers to each other, nor does it allow outside code to add arbitrary event handlers to any widget.

      </p>
      <p>
        I once encountered a case that didn't seem like a technical reason, and others complained about it also online. I don't remember the details, so don't ask. Anyhow, if we had an interface that accepted a map as an input parameter, for example, adding extra key/value pairs to that map is generally not considered a problem; any extra stuff in the map is typically ignored. If you are thinking of "locking" in types etc., protection-oriented syntax or key-words can be added to a language. But I don't see how HOF's prevent such anyhow. If a HOF returns a string for an interface that expects a number, we have the same problem (although it may depend on language).

        <strong>Multiple Handler Issue</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: "As for the multiple-handler issue, the GUI framework generally needs to do work of its own when you click a button,..." -- Yes, but isn't that done BEFORE it calls "onClick"? The GUI framework typically calls an "onClick" method, not the app developer, which implies that the GUI framework can do whatever it pleases before doing the onClick method(s).
      </p>
      <p>
        [That's one approach, and if the framework is simple enough that's perfectly viable. If there're a lot of aspects that need to react to a click event, though, in a more elaborate framework, then letting them hook in separately is going to be a lot tidier. In addition, presuming that the application developer will have no use for multiple handlers simply because your framework doesn't use them internally isn't sensible framework design. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: "plus you need to add your own action, at the minimum; under your approach, do you need to explicitly invoke the method in the superclass to make that work?" -- I need clarification on this. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different ways to design a GUI event system, but here is one way to go about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The base Button class defines a constructor. When an explicit button is defined (allocated) this constructor runs for the button and establishes or registers a reference of the newly allocated button instance object to the GUI system. (The pointer could be a RAM address or the object name). When that button is clicked, this reference to the object is used to see if any onClick event is defined for that object, and runs it if it exists.
      </p>
      <p>
        [So the base classes would invariably have <em>absolutely no</em> behaviour in their on* methods, under this design? Otherwise, it becomes necessary to invoke the superclass methods explicitly to guarantee proper handling. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see a need for such at this point.
      </p>
      <p>
        [A need for any behaviour existing in the base-class on* methods, you mean? -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        Correct, I currently see <em>no</em> need for it. Well, except maybe logging a "not-handled" warning message.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Alright. Reasonable, assuming a fairly simple framework, I suppose. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> parent_run_01
      </p>
      <p>
        If you can envision a useful scenario, please do. Note that a language can have an "always (run) before" and "always after" keyword set that tells it to run the current (parent) method even if a child overrides it (although it's really sort of prepending or appending instead of "override", technically).
      </p>
      <p>
        [True -- that's a fairly common <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a> feature, actually. A full complement of AOP features would make on* methods perfectly viable as a solution, by my reckoning, since that would imply different components of the framework could hook into the event methods arbitrarily as necessary with before/after/around advice. Cool. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>

        One syntactic approach is a marker or dummy method in the parent to indicate where the child method(s) run such that "before" or "after" is determined by where in the method code one puts the marker. For example, if you put the marker at the end, then the child runs "after" the parent method code. If you put it in the middle, then half runs before and half after.
      </p>
      <p>
        [That seems worse than proper <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a> facilities, since it leaves the decision of hook position in the definition of the original method; if the parent method failed to provide a hook point at all, then there'd be no options for hooking. With advice, as AOP actually provides, multiple hooks may be inserted and any of them may be before, after, or "around" (the hook itself chooses when and if to run the original code), which is far more flexible. -DavidMcLean]

        class MyForm extends Form {<br/>

      </p>
      <p>
        Since objects and classes are the same thing here, we'd probably want to allow classes to be nested, and in that sense you are correct, we could do that also. It wouldn't necessarily be a "parent" class, but an outer container class since it's not the same kind of "thing". This may allow a way to have <strong>automatic default</strong> form scope so that we don't have to explicitly set it. The gut implementation, such as the top master button class, could check the existence of such:
      </p>
      <code>
        // Example 8653<br/>
        // Master button class setting default container as a short-cut (yet still overridable)<br/>
        if (isObject(outer)) {container=outer;}  <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here "outer" is somewhat similar to "self" in that it references the "outer" class/object. I realize scoping rules can result in sticky tradeoffs and <a href="WaterbedTheory.html">WaterbedTheory</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [So do you <em>need</em> to nest classes to get a reference to the container? It's still unclear where "formX" comes from in your above sample; is it a global? Is baking references to containers into the actual widget classes a good idea? For example, what happens if you want to reuse the same widget across a few forms, when the widget carries a reference to its container? (With an .addEventListener() approach, the container reference is captured in the listener itself because of closures.) -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        "FormX" is the containing class/object. This nesting is not really different than Java, except the fact that objects and classes are the same thing here.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [You've missed the intent of my question again, sorry. I know what formX <em>is</em> -- a reference to the form object or class that will contain the widget. I don't know where it <em>comes from</em>. Is it a global variable? Regional/module-level? A magic keyword that gets you the containing form (unlikely, considering it has X in it, but still possible considering this is an imaginary language)? How's it work? -DavidMcLean]

      <p>
        We don't have to nest classes if one explicitly sets the context, such as with "container = formX;" above. However, if the nesting is set up as expected, then we wouldn't need to set the reference for each button, for it could automatically "inherent" it per Example 8653. We thus have a choice of doing it both ways: 1) lone, or 2) nested, with the lone one requiring more code.
      </p>
      <p>
        But this class nesting is not to be confused with OOP inheritance: it's a "coded" default in this "form" case, not an OO-inherited one. I agree that nested class/object relationships versus OOP relationships is confusing, and this is why TOP should be involved: code is shitty for managing/tracking myriad multi-factored relationships. Relational is just a better tool for that, even if we have to use code generation as a final step because the DB brand cannot handle direct code snippets.

      <ul>
        <li>
           [How exactly would one confuse inheritance with nested classes? Those are generally pretty clearly delineated; inheritance produces potentially-altered subclasses that should be substitutable for instances of the base class, while nested classes produce entirely distinct classes that merely reference their containing class through lexical scope. Of course, the functionality of either or both of these features varies among languages (<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> doesn't capture the containing class's instance in instances of inner classes, for example), but they seem quite distinct from here. -DavidMcLean]

        An instance's class-nest scope determines its context even if it runs a parent method via inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the "buttonX" object/class is instantiated (line "brenda"), the Button class runs its constructor (line "sally"), and it runs in the current object's scope such that "outer" returns a reference to the formX object. (Remember, "outer" is a scope word comparable to "self". A language could have a lot of scope words for various purposes, but we won't get into that here.)
      </p>
      <p>
        [So "outer" is bound lexically to each class, and when you access it from a method it dispatches based on the object's actual class rather than where the method's defined? That seems a little confusing as a scoping method -- it doesn't cleanly correspond to either lexical or dynamic scoping -- but seems generally viable and wouldn't take much more getting-used-to than any other scope approach. What about the case where you want the same widget (same colour, title, position, whatever) displayed on two forms, with different behaviour? How does that come out in this design? -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        One approach is to subclass a button containing the common items, and overriding any difference. Another is to use an IF statement on "container.name". And a third approach is to call a form-level method for the differing methods ("container.mySpecialFormMethod(event)"). A fourth approach may be to create a template form class, and then override the differences, but I haven't really thought out all the implications of such.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The option of an if statement on "container.name", presumably in the button class's onClick(), is unconscionably mixing concerns. The rest of those seem reasonable, given sufficiently "nice" syntax for working with the object system.

      <p>
        Having a direct and simple on-click event attached to the button object/class to me seems the most natural and strait-forward and uses a paradigm already in use for an application: OO.

        It wasn't intended as a formal term. We should have a consistent way to specify "passable" blocks (for lack of a better term), and plain-jane OOP methods appear to be good enough in a well-designed OOP language (which Java doesn't qualify for in my book). On occasion it may be somewhat more code to live with a limited "kind" of passable blocks rather than also use HOF's, etc, but worth it in terms of consistency and familiarity.

        Generally yes, because the syntax and context is confusing and different for anonymous ones.

        But we don't pass references to loops or IF blocks around. OOP and HOF's are a way to <strong>pass around references to "behavior"</strong>, as are functions. Loops and conditionals are intended to be used only in their current environment.

        <em>Sure.  When anonymous blocks are dynamic (see above re "dynamically assigned" and "dynamically passed") they can be passed around, just like objects and other values.  So?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, they are not comparable to regular loop and condition blocks.

        <em>Of course they are.  They're blocks of code.  Why would they be any different?  It's no different from an instance of a class, which is precisely the same instance whether it's passed around or not.</em>

        They are different. If we intend to pass them around and/or reference them from a wider variety of code spots, then we typically need extra info and maintenance-friendly conventions to work with them effectively. A box of stuff sitting in your closet doesn't need the same labels and packaging as a box you intend to ship to Timbuktu. Or even a "sub-box" inside the Timbuktu-destined box.

        [While your metaphor is true, it isn't particularly applicable to blocks of code. Lambda expressions are in most cases referenced <em>exactly once</em>, as in cases like f(x -> x*2) where the anonymous function is immediately passed to another function, so there's no demand for "extra info" in those situations. When a particular function is to be referenced from multiple places, it's given a name -- it has to be, since rewriting the expression each time it's used will produce a different function -- and then there is no meaningful distinction between that function defined by a lambda and a function defined with "normal" declaration syntax (excepting degenerate cases like PHP's horrendous interpretation of functions and "closures" as fundamentally distinct). Static functions, from the language's perspective, have only their name and their type (the latter of which might not even be explicitly accessible, if working in a dynamically-typed language), and we don't need "extra info" to work with such functions effectively; why would we need more info if the function's assigned to a variable dynamically rather than statically? -DavidMcLean]

        Whether they are mentally comparable to loops and conditionals or not is turning into a rather obtuse discussion. My main point is that with decent OO and OO libraries, we don't need HOF's and lambda's for GUI programming. If OO can do the job, then don't introduce or depend on yet another language idiom to do the same thing. (H/L may shave code size SLIGHTLY in some cases, but that's not worth the added confusion by my judgement. Consistency often overrides code size in terms of team grokkability.) I am comparing them to OOP, NOT loops etc.

        <em>Your alleged confusion over "yet another language idiom" (e.g., lambda expressions) appears to be baseless, especially as certain language constructs like lambda expressions appear to simplify real </em><a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a>s, like being able to attach an arbitrary number of independent event handlers to an event without the labyrinthine circumlocution described in <a href="NodeJsAndHofGuiDiscussionThree.html">NodeJsAndHofGuiDiscussionThree</a>.
