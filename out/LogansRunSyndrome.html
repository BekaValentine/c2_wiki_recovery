        Logans Run Syndrome
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LogansRunSyndrome.html">LogansRunSyndrome</a> depicts the state of the world where individuals lead an idyllic lifestyle until they are <a href="TooOld.html">TooOld</a>, then members of that community are expected to quietly submit to euthanasia.  Those who refuse are hunted down and "neutralised".

        <em>That's not a syndrome reflecting the real world; that's the plot of the movie.  While age discrimination exists, I'm not aware of any contemporary society that euthanizes the middle-aged, nor hunts down those who refuse to submit.</em>

        <em>Sometimes, the term refers to corporations that (illegally) staff themselves primarily with young developers who are eager to work long hours (and inexperienced/gullible enough to believe company tripe about being "in this together"), burn them out, and then let them go when they reach a certain age (and start demanding higher salaries and more time with families, etc).  Usually, the termination is for (alledgedly) failing to keep up with expectations (expectations which require continuous and excessive overtime to have a chance of meeting).</em>
