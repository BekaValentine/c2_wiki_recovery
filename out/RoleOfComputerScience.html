        Role Of Computer Science
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm a <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> guy. In my role as a <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> guy, I study computation, communication, calculation, and the properties thereof. I <em>trust</em> the developers and software engineers to know what properties they want, and I find ways to give it to them. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How does </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> help developer productivity, code management, and such?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, that is an irrelevant question. You don't ask a rocket scientist how much 'rocket science' helps the human endeavor, because the rocket scientist doesn't make knowing that part of his job. The rocket scientist might point out the satellites orbiting Earth, but likely does so without knowing their cost-to-benefit ratio. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Why can't it help there? What is holding it back? As a practitioner, this stuff is key. Our "customers" want more features with fast turn-around for less cost. (I skipped "and less problems" because you'll start talking about type checking again if I dare mention it.)</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong><em>YOU FOOL!  LOOK WHAT YOU'VE DONE!</em></strong>  You had to go and mention <em>it!</em>  NOOOOOooooo!!!!
            </li>
            <li>
               The reason it cannot help is because it is not the scientist's job to apply his findings to problems.  That's the job of the engineer.  It is <em>your</em> responsibility to take what is known of your field and apply it to solve the problems most important to you.  For what it's worth, computer science already has numerous publications on the topics you mention.  I recommend visiting <a href="CiteSeer.html">CiteSeer</a> and perusing their vast library of papers.  However, something tells me that you'll just call <a href="BookStop.html">BookStop</a> on me.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>You give me a specific example and details about where it has helped (exludeding those already mentioned), and I'll consider it.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I can note is that my skills are in heavy demand, and that works of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> are often used today in ways that are claimed by others to aide "developer productivity" and "code management". (Examples of such works include programming languages, concurrency models, garbage collection, data models, database management systems, commit protocols, version control software, configuration management utilities, etc.) I can't offer you exact numbers on how much these 'help', or a precise 'model' of 'developer productivity'. Knowing those things isn't part of my job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've looked at a few </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> papers. It seems they're just offering opinions or observations about how something will 'help' developers.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Authors of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> papers aren't expected to prove demand for a given set of computational properties. They need only prove, empirically or mathematically (or both), that the set of properties is achieved. This means that the 'reasons' for such properties often get waved away in the introductions to the papers - the reasons aren't critical to the contents of the paper, except insofar as knowing the reasons for a set of properties might help users of the paper decide (e.g. due to an analogous situation) whether its contents are relevant to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Among those properties we are asked to achieve for developers in particular: <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, support for ad-hoc <a href="ChangePattern.html">ChangePattern</a>s, ability to detect mistakes prior to shipping products, ability to break large projects into bite-sized pieces that can be contracted to independent developers, ability to guarantee there are no deadlocks or race conditions, the ability to code without worrying about buffer overruns, ability to ensure a change in persistent data to many cells is atomic in event of certain hardware failures, and on and on and on. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> people don't need to ask "why"... except due to curiosity, perhaps a need to feel their work is meaningful, or as observations from their own roles as developers. If need proof that properties are worthwhile, you'll need to wait until the authors (or the employers of the authors) put on their <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> hats and write <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> papers.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've read about "provably correct software", but it has proved too time-consuming in practice.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a practitioner of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> I have only once been asked to prove a particular unit of software correct (a RAID driver). Most of the time, when it comes to 'correctness', we are asked only to demonstrate or resist <em>certain classes</em> of errors. For example, the ability for a commit protocol to avoid partial-writes in event the computer is shut down while in mid-transaction. Or the ability to identify obvious instances of undefined behavior prior to shipping a product.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your claim that it "has proven too time-consuming in practice" is probably a claim you'll need to take up with <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> people. All I can do is observe that people are still paid to do it on occasion, . . .
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>I'm not disputing that, but its a small niche.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and that a great many organizations use automated tools (automated type checkers, code combers, memory leak detectors) to resist certain forms of errors from being shipped. And they do so on a regular basis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Most of these are just accounting and look-ups of sorts: making sure there's no reference cycles, called functions are actually defined, parameter signatures match based on the type DAG, etc. There's not a lot of brand new ideas there (unless working with an odd language). DAG traversal algorithms are probably older than me (a possible case of <a href="PostSeventiesIdeaSlump.html">PostSeventiesIdeaSlump</a>). Plus, you suckered me into talking about @#%* types again. Enough about types please. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Then stop <em>complaining</em> about types and just accept that they're useful if you want certain benefits from programming.  And, yes, type-checking, et. al. <strong>are</strong> forms of automated proof verification.  It just happens that they're not as rigorous as some applications demand.  They're not <em>all</em> about making sure there's no reference cycles (what would a heart defibrillator need with this anyway?), that called functions are defined (a linker enforces this admirably anyway), or that parameter signatures match based on type DAGs (hey, look, it's static type checking!).  If it were, there'd be no need for <a href="FormalMethods.html">FormalMethods</a> at all.  Remember, we lost a $327.6 million space probe because of insufficient application of <a href="FormalMethods.html">FormalMethods</a>.  That's $327.6 million of our <em>tax dollars.</em>  It all depends on what application you're trying to solve. --<a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

            <li>
               <em>I agree there apps/situations where very fastidious techniques pay off. I never said otherwise. But there are many different ways to do fastidiousness, and no scientific way to evaluate the alternatives.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               [Different mechanisms of accomplishing a particular goal are evaluated economically, not scientifically. Scientists and engineers might work to make a particular mechanism cheaper, of course. For example, type-checks were a lot more expensive and less reliable when they were done by hand.]
            </li>
            <li>
               This implies <strong>economics is not a "science"</strong>. I'm not sure there will be universal agreement with that. And I've already agreed that "computer science" has helped with computer machine performance. The "hardware" is not where the gaps are. --top
            </li>
            <li>
               [Perhaps I should clarify: economics is not among the studies of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>. And I did not recently mention machine performance.]
            </li>
            <li>
               Yet another reason to rethink the term "computer science". And most of my concerns as a rank-and-file developer generally relate to or lead to economics. If CS chooses to not help there much outside of faster hardware, then it's of little use to us rank-and-file developers. I'm asking you again: <strong>where does CS help us rank-and-file developers?</strong> (excluding those already discussed) -t
              <ul>
                <li>
                   [CS provides tools for rank-and-file developers, of which I've already supplied a plethora of examples. An education in CS also teaches rank-and-file developers of approaches to solving common development problems based on what has been proven empirically or mathematically to work in the past.]
                </li>
                <li>
                   If somebody invents a flying car, that would help also. But it is very indirect. It is not a reason for the rank-and-file developer to study more CS.
                </li>
                <li>
                   [If you're asserting that the tools mentioned have only been of 'very indirect' support to rank-and-file developers, I'd like to see you try working without them.]
                </li>
                <li>
                   I couldn't work without a car either (my wife's job and mine are too far apart), but that does not mean I should study car engineering. 
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       <em>Actually, it does.  I did study car engineering.  I bought my latest used BMW at a wholesale price and replaced the cracked radiator myself for the cost of the parts.  I've done the same with a long string of cars and motorcycles.  For the negligible cost of gaining a little knowledge, I save a lot of money.  An analogous saving applies to knowing </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>.<em></em>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       I'm skeptical of the total economics of that. Plus, BMW tends to have a high cost of ownership anyhow. If you buy an expensive-to-repair car it will tilt the calculations. It would be like buying Oracle when MS-Access or <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a> would do and claiming your 30k Oracle training paid off.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       [I'm with top on this one. If a person has an interest in car engineering, then by all means they should study it... but you need to account for the time-cost and interest-level of repairing those vehicles as well. Those without time or interest would have listed a lot more than "for the cost of the parts".]
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       <em>Despite clever positioning (and a festoonment of non-critical luxury gadgets, plus often-exhorbitant scheduled maintenance fees) by BMW Corporate to ensure BMWs are regarded as "premium sports sedans" in North America, in much of the rest of the world they're just cars, put together with bolts and nuts like any garden-variety Chevy.  Learning basic car maintenance, diagnostics, and straightforward repairs is conceptually no more difficult than changing computer cards and hard drives.  For the cost of a repair manual (a do-it-yourself oriented Haynes manual will do, though factory service manuals are often inexpensive and better-written) and/or a Google search plus some common hand tools, anyone with a bit of mechanical inclination (typical among Computing types) can change fluids, filters, cooling system components, brakes, and so on.  However, this is intended as an analogy, not a topic unto itself.  The important point is that for a minimal investment in greater knowledge (e.g., in </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>), you can save money and effort by being able to do tasks that you'd otherwise have to (a) hire, or (b) waste time having explained/debated to/with you by Wiki participants.<em></em>

                    <li>
                       [The analogy has some value. I think it worth pointing out that: if you <em>aren't</em> willing to study car engineering, mechanics, techniques, tools, and terminology related to car construction or repair, then you probably shouldn't be offering opinions on them. A certain degree of knowledge is expected. Similarly, while you might not <em>need</em> <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> or <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> to do your job, you probably shouldn't be offering opinions about them if you aren't willing to learn their associated techniques, tools, and terminology. If the 'practitioner or cars' is someone who drives to work, his 'pipe-drive' model of power steering is not going to be well accepted on a forum that expects more of its participants.]

                    <li>
                       I believe you have the burden-of-proof backward, for reasons already described in <a href="BookStop.html">BookStop</a> under "vetting". It would be fair to ask for a cost/benefit analysis, such as cost of time for learning car care, technology change learning, cost of tools, used-oil disposal fee/drive (some States), compared to direct service, etc. One does not have to read the entire book to ask for such. That would be a silly request. If you truly "know" why such car study is better, then you should be able to supply such numbers. Otherwise, it comes across as a finger-in-the-wind feeling-based assessment.

                       <em>You have a valid point about cost/benefit analyses -- it is appropriate to ask for overall costs vs benefits of learning car repair and do-it-yourself vs paying a mechanic.  Or, more topical to this Wiki, asking for overall costs vs benefits of (for example) using a SQL DBMS vs rolling your own persistent container class for some purpose.  However, what has spurred this thread is not the merits of such questions -- which, it seems, rarely get asked here -- but your tendency to offer off-the-cuff opinions or proclamations on </em><a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and/or <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> subjects (such as type theory, or object oriented programming, or the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> and its implementations) with <strong>apparent</strong> authority whilst obviously lacking anything more than a casual knowledge of these subjects.  As someone with a background in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> (and auto mechanics), it comes across to me as naive and arrogant -- like a non-mechanic who suggests with authority and adamance that pistons would be better made of wood than aluminium.

        <em>Fans of "type-heavy" programming also claim it allows the compiler to verify more and prevent tons of bugs with few downsides, but we have enough debates about that already.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, let's not start a debate here. Let's, instead, only point out that some people believe the cost-to-benefit ratio is a profitable one, and that some people do not. And perhaps they're both right. The world is a big place, and the economic incentives can vary from one group to another. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not a fundamental role of science to decide what people "should" do, only to support them in enhancing what they "can" do. Type-heavy programming is one means by which people "can" verify code and prevent certain classes of software error.

        I'm certain fanatics of all sorts make claims that I'm not willing to defend. But, honestly, I've never seen this claim that types are objectively more economical in all situations always... perhaps someone claimed it, but I've not seen it. I <em>have</em> seen the claim that software-provably-without-certain-classes-of-bugs is 'better' than software-that-may-or-may-not-have-those-bugs. It's not a claim I'd dispute; the only question is whether or not that level of 'better' is worth the cost of achieving it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now you are suggesting that there is no such economic truth to type-heavy.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no universal economic truth except for supply and demand. It is likely that "type-heavy", however you're defining it, is objectively more economical in some circumstances, and not economical in others, and on that borderline where the cost-benefit ratio is near 1.0 in yet others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Which is it? Is this smart-person-only type-heavy proof scientific or economic in nature? Or just a wrong view? --top</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If they claimed it was universally more economical, it would be bullshit. If they claimed it was more economical but didn't specify 'universally', then perhaps they were referring to a situation described in context. If they claimed that software provably without bugs is better than software possibly without bugs, then you've grossly misinterpreted their claim. I guess I'd need to see the assertion if I'm to answer this question of yours.

Or at least no way to tell without trying it yourself. I'm pretty bright (or so I'm told), but I've a feeling I'd get lost very quickly in such an environment. How far do you think you'd make it?

        When I first started criticizing OOP, proponents would make very similar-sounding claims such that OOP is "better theory" and only ignorant dum-dums say otherwise, etc. But I'd also get at least an equal number of emails from those who supported me and expressed that they were too timid to take on the critics. (I've since pulled the email address due to spam.) Some of them were from established writers. Orielly's "Oracle Programming" book even had a reference to my website for at least 2 editions. Further, popularity does not automatically mean "truth". Otherwise, mobs could vote the world flat.

      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing makes a scientist immune to self-deception. Wisdom requires that one look with even greater skepticism at his or her own thoughts and ideas to help compensate for inherent confirmation bias. I constantly question my approaches; if I've forgotten a justification for a particular design, I often spend a day or two sketching out the pros and cons and reasons and requirements justifying that approach over alternatives, and often I come to the same conclusion. Sometimes I learn that a change made in a related design obviates the design element I'm reviewing. And when someone is skeptical of my ideas, I take that as a sign of <em>"where there's smoke, there's fire"</em> until and unless I can explain - <em>most of all to myself</em> - why that skepticism is unwarranted. 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, you often give impression of failing to be appropriately critical of your own ideas.  You answer skepticism by <a href="ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof.html">ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof</a> to others to 'prove' flaws in your ideas. You usually set the burden for said counter-proof unreasonably high, such as a formal counter-proof for what you originally presented as a 'sketched' idea. You find excuses to dismiss skepticism rather than confront it. This is exacerbated by your provision of (often ridiculously) weak justifications for your ideas, such as appeal to 'the masses', or arguing for app-language-neutrality on the basis of avoiding fanboyism, or claiming without evidence that there is some sort of 'psychology' benefit or that it 'fits your mind' better. You need statistics about 'the masses' and the market issues surrounding 'fanboyism' or the first two are appropriately called <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>. You need to control for nature vs. nurture and your own fanboyism, or the latter claim about 'fitting the mind' is worse than uninformed speculation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Compensating for confirmation bias and other forms of observer bias means becoming your own worst critic. You cannot be a fanboy, a salesman, or a soft-hearted mother. You mustn't fear taking a use-case gladius and stabbing your intellectual baby forty times before either marking its resilience as 'adequate' or throwing it out with the bloody bathwater. Can you do this?

        <li>
           Disagree. The 'terminology difference' is, however, explained immediately below this interjection, so no reason to expand here.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Anyhow, you should improve your understanding of logic, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. Learn this: An argument or statement S is <strong>illogical</strong> if it <em>cannot be proven</em> by logic from available evidence, givens, and axioms. There is a set of <strong>false</strong> statements that can be <em>disproven</em> by valid deductive logic or a combination of evidence and sound inductive logic. For any <em>consistent</em> logic, the set of <em>false</em> statements is a <strong>subset</strong> of the set of 'illogical<em> statements.  Among </em>illogical<em> statements that cannot be disproven are several subcategories:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Statements that are undecidable (that is, for which the logic cannot make a decision).
        </li>
        <li>
           Statements that may be decidable, but are still 'unknowable' because it is impractical, physically impossible (as opposed to logically impossible), or illegal/unethical to gather sufficient evidence and information to make a decision.
        </li>
        <li>
           Statements for which there is insufficient evidence or information to make a sound or valid decision, but for which it may be possible to gather such evidence and information (aka 'unknown' statements). The act of asserting unknowns to be true is sometimes called '<a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>'. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>By your standards, what the hell is NOT </em><a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               A variety of arguments from insufficient information are perfectly reasonable. Argument from a hypothesis (if X is true then...), argument from circumstantial evidence (though we can't conclude it, we have good reason to believe X, these reasons are ...), argument from accepted information (according to the almanac (brand) 1981, the ..., therefore ...), argument with reference to prior arguments (if we accept argument XYZ we know ...), argument from principles (language implementations that trash HDDs are 'better' according to my weights, therefore ...), even argument from personal observations (I have seen ABC, therefore I cannot accept that ABC is impossible) - so long as you don't elevate personal observations to 'statistics'. In addition, there are a lot of fallacious arguments that don't involve <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>, but I don't think you were asking for those.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From the above you should conclude that asking me to 'disprove' statements I call illogical is, itself, an unreasonable and illogical request on your part because not <strong>all</strong> illogical statements can be disproven. You should apologize for making such unreasonable requests.
      </p>
      <p>
        A related property: a statement or S is 'irrelevant' to a given argument A if there is no logical relationship between S and A. Attempting to use an irrelevant statement in an argument, however, is either illogical (a form of <a href="NonSequitur.html">NonSequitur</a>) or a distraction tactic that falls in the field of rhetoric rather than logic (aka <a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>). I would note that 'code' serves no logical or rhetorical purpose <em>unless</em> you can bridge the gap by arguing or demonstrating the code 'relevant' to a particular argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, many of your 'illogical' arguments consist illogical leaps in logic (<a href="NonSequitur.html">NonSequitur</a>), of making unjustifiable claims (<a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>), and of irrelevant rhetorical distractions (<a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>). As noted above, formal logic does not disprove these things. If I don't feel like use of short-hand descriptions of your argument, I might say that 'there is no rule of sound or valid reasoning that allows you to make that leap' (for a <a href="NonSequitur.html">NonSequitur</a>) or 'it is unclear how this is relevant to the argument' (for <a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>) or 'that assertion doesn't seem justifiable' (for <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a>). Alternatively, I can give you the benefit of the doubt and ask you to fill in the 'leap' that doesn't seem to be legally filled, ask you demonstrate relevance of the claim that seems irrelevant, and ask you justify the assertion that doesn't seem justifiable. I tend to give the benefit of the doubt to persons who don't regularly demonstrate inability to fill these gaps.

        <em>Well, we have a terminology conflict here. Lack of sufficient evidence (assuming that's the case) is not the same as "illogical". For example, let's take a recent event: the decision about the future of the Afghanistan military conflict. Some experts want to add more troops, and some want to reduce them. Neither path can be "proven by logic" since nobody can predict the future with sufficient certainty, especially given complex interactions. However, to go around and say that both sides are "illogical" is misleading, if not slanderous. You may have a personal working definition of "illogical", but please don't ruin the common usage by substituting your own personal vocabulary reality willy-nilly. -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Merely lacking sufficient evidence is not illogical, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. However, asserting a statement to be "true" in an argument, despite insufficient evidence, IS illogical. If "neither path can be proven by logic", then stating either path as a point in the argument is not logical. And your 'example' itself is misleading - the debate over Afghanistan military is about principles and priorities and assumptions, not about 'predicting the future with certainty'. One can still make an "illogical" argument from a given set of principles, and one may have "irrational" principles (Consider: <em>It's our duty to waste resources and money! That's the American way! Therefore, we should continue expending resources and money in Afghanistan. Military activity expends much resources and money. Therefore, I support the war!</em>) But principles themselves (what you consider 'better') are outside the domain of logic - asking whether a principle is "true or false" doesn't even make sense. Ask, rather, whether they are rational.

        <em>Just because you claim it's "insufficient evidence" doesn't make it so.</em>

        <em>And I believe the Afghanistan analogy is sufficient to compare to the HTML++ debate. You are abusing the term "illogical".  -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How is the Afghanistan analogy is relevant to the HTML++ debate? And how is it relevant to misuse of the term "illogical"? You often make or assume statements for which I see little or no logical reason to believe, such as "GML is <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly" or "disabling on-display actions improves computer security". It isn't as though you can argue for GML by simply stating principles. You must also argue that GML fulfills those principles. I don't think it abuse to call various among those bridging arguments "illogical". One example of an illogical argument: <em>"starting over with a particular goal in mind </em>sometimes<em> results in a better product for that goal, </em>therefore<em> GML is </em><a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly (relative to HTML++)"<em>.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>With regard to "GML is </em><a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly", that is misleading. You imply it's an isolated self-contained claim, which it's not. The argument was that starting from scratch makes it easier add CRUD-friendliness without worrying about non-crud-baggage (eBrochure baggage). Remember the car-to-boat analogy? Your confusion is not my sin there. You seem to also mistake explanations for formal statements, and "debunk" that statement in isolation. Explaining something and providing a water-tight logical claim for a given portion of text are not necessarily the same thing. Obviously, the one "sometimes" sentence above begs the question of whether this is a case of that situation, which was addressed in <strong>other</strong> parts. If the above was <strong>all</strong> I said about that topic, then your complaint would be justified. But it was not, so you see I am not wrong and bad and evil. Be careful about the context implications of your examples. -t<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To contradict, the above 'sometimes' sentence is, in fact, the only logical reason I have identified in the entire <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> page to believe "GML is <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly" relative to HTML++. You have also appealed to <em>irrelevant</em> market properties and fanboyisms. You have also provided much verbiage for 'security' benefits, which mostly make me wonder whether you even know what computer security means (see <a href="IwannaLearnComputerSecurity.html">IwannaLearnComputerSecurity</a> if you're interested in the initial bits). But, if you think there's another reason for me to believe GML is <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly, then I'm at a loss for what it is. Further, you seem to ignore the greater context of development-side <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendliness and server-side <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendliness and multi-organization <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendliness and concurrent-user <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendliness and so on, which leaves me wondering what '<a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly' means to you. (Admittedly, '<a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly' is pretty vague, but to me that means looking at it from as many perspectives as possible.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>With regard to GML, you claim the forces I mention are "irrelevant", but I disagree with your evidence, which is largely anecdotal. A disagreement is not the same as being "illogical". It is soft evidence against soft evidence. You have no </em><a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> that shows them irrelevant. You only have "soft" evidence. Stop mistaking personal notions and personal assessments for universal truths. (To keep the text train simple, I will not address the security sample here.) -t<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pay attention to immediate context. I said the market forces you mention are "irrelevant [to whether or not GML is <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly]." That is, at least, how I read the sentence. Sure, market forces are relevant to market success. That's a different argument. If you'll note an earlier statement of mine: "a statement or S is 'irrelevant' <strong>to a given argument A</strong>", not as a universal principle. I assumed, apparently incorrectly, that you could reasonably infer which argument was being discussed. Also, it is your burden to show relevance for evidence you present. Are you going to argue these fanboyism market properties are relevant to whether "GML is <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly"? If so, I ask that you explain the connection between the two.

        <em>Again, I find your writing style strange and difficult. (Others who think like you maybe don't. So be it.)

        <em>Then we each gave our arguments about why HTML++ will or won't bend.

Some of our evidence is anecdotal, based on past observations. In this respect it is similar to the Afghanistan analogy, where calling both sides "illogical" is inappropriate, rude, and misleading.

           "Fallacy" is <strong>also</strong> more general. I didn't say "Illogical is THE more general term", did I?

        Anyhow, "educated assessments" can be illogical, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. Each "based on" offers potential for an illogical leap.

      <p>
        Also, I do not acknowledge your position on the Afghanistan analogy. I reiterate: the primary argument there comes from differences in <em>priorities</em> and <em>principles</em>, and calling these "illogical" is indeed inappropriate, but for reasons that do not serve your argument. One may still make illogical arguments "based on" a given set of priorities and principles, observations, and hear-say anecdotes. I suggest we desist with this <a href="ArgumentByAnalogy.html">ArgumentByAnalogy</a>.

        Rather than further expanding the HTML++ line of argument here (not sure how you got off of GML, it isn't as though an argument <em>against</em> HTML++ is necessarily an argument <em>for</em> GML), I offer: <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a> - move to <a href="LimitsOfHtmlStack.html">LimitsOfHtmlStack</a>.

        <em>It started as an example of my allegedly ignoring principles of computer science and/or "logic". It's clear now you are either wrong or greatly exaggerating. I believe you to be a drama queen, repainting professional disagreements as blatant and clear violations of math or logic. That aspect *is* relevant to this topic. Further, "priorities and principles" apply to GUI kits also. For example, how the down-arrow grid issue affects how likely a user is to accept a new standard or tool. -t</em>

        And, yes, "priorities and principles" apply to GUI kits too. For example, being '<a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly' is your 'priority'. But that does not mean it logical to claim "GML is <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly" simply because that is your goal,

        <li>
           Yes, one of us is just plain delusional indeed. 
        </li>

      <p>
        nor was GML's <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendliness well supported by your other arguments.

        And sure, the default behavior of the 'down-arrow' being undefined or non-conventional may determine market success. But '<a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly' is not defined by 'successful in market'; it's defined, in the broad sense, by how well a standard optimizes performance, portability, safety, security, etc. for both server-side and client-side and productive development of CRUD applications (including widgets, database hookup, etc.). So, your appeal to "how likely a user is to accept a new tool" is irrelevant to whether 'GML is <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly', and using irrelevant points in an argument is illogical. If you were better skilled at organizing your thoughts, you could take the same damn information and make a logical argument: "if default key-bindings match common convention, then developers of <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> applications will not need to repeat efforts to bind them properly. Further, the implicit default key-bindings should better allow clients to achieve localizations to non-American keyboards. Additionally, since these key-bindings do not need piped along the network, that may offer an (admittedly marginal) performance improvement. For these reasons, conventional default key-bindings is more <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly in terms of productive development, portability, and performance". But noooo. <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> can't possibly make a <em>logical</em> argument even if the information is available. Even for a <em>logically justifiable</em> conclusion, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> resorts to <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> and <a href="NonSequitur.html">NonSequitur</a>.

        <em>Market acceptance is a pre-requisite. If nobody adopts it, it's gloriousness matter nils.

        Very well, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. Other than your goal at large, I doubt anyone is convinced by your reasons. You keep bringing things like 'market success' or 'HTML++ sabotage' up in response to my questions about technical merit, and you claim vehemently you weren't being illogical. I must say, I don't know anyone other than you who would think it logical to point at market success as a 'pre-requisite' for <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendliness. I just can't reason with that sort of 'logic'.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Any discussion of "technical merit" with you will almost certainly lead to your </em><a href="HobbyHorse.html">HobbyHorse</a> topics.

        And apparently a discussion of "technical merit" with you hops (with nary any mention of technical properties) to discussions of sabotage, fanboyism, and marketing. I suppose you think that's the better route.
