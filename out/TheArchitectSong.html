        <em>My definition of an Architect is somone who makes key decision about tactical platfom level tools and interfaces. Mind you I prefer to label the task rather then the role i.e. the act of making such decision is "architecture" but I cringe when people call themselves "architects".</em>

        I never wanted to be just a programmer. I always wanted to be ... an
        architect! Flying from meeting to meeting in the magnificent Pacific
        Northwest. Felling vendors with a single chop of my hand. EDS! EMS!
        EJB! UML! With my significant other(s) by my side! And we'd sing ... <em>sing</em>
        ... SING!
