        After 20 years at DEC (Digital Equipment Corporation, bought by Compaq), I went independent, helping to build the SW infrastructure for an elder-care corporation near Philadelphia. Now I'm an employee of that organization, the sole programmer on site.

        Thanks for the invitation. I'm glad to stay here near Philadelphia, enjoying my work and trying new things. (I finally have a client who _wants_ to do new things.)

        Wanted to update my weblog info. Still poking in now and then to see what's happening.  I've been intrigued by and playing with Python a lot recently.
