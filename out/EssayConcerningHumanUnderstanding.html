      </p>
      <p>
        The acts of the mind, wherein it exerts its power over simple ideas, are chiefly these three: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Combining several simple ideas into one compound one, and thus all complex ideas are made. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The second is bringing two ideas, whether simple or complex, together, and setting them by one another so as to take a view of them at once, without uniting them into one, by which it gets all its ideas of relations. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The third is separating them from all other ideas that accompany them in their real existence: this is called abstraction, and thus all its general ideas are made.
        </li>
      </ul>
