        <dd>If you were eating in a restaurant, and you saw a cockroach crawling up the wall, you probably wouldn't say,</dd>

        <dd>"Oh look, there's <em>the</em> bug.  Good thing it wasn't in our food."</dd>

        <dd>Rather, you'd assume that the place was infested.</dd>

        <em>Actually, if a restaurant were software, we'd walk in expecting it was infested. Naturally, if we didn't see a roach until dessert, we'd say, "Oh look, there's </em>the<em> bug.  Good thing it wasn't in our food."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A software engineer would say, "Let's move to a different table and see if it happens again."

        That's not a bug, it's a dessert!
