        The Book Of The Three Imposters
      </h1>
      <p>
        This book was supposed to have blasphemously disproven the
        teachings of Jesus, Moses & Mohammed. It was famous in the
        Middle Ages ("De Tribus Impostoribus"--attributed at times 
        to Frederick III) ...then Arthur Machen finally wrote a book 
        with this title (an excellent book, but one that has nothing 
        to do with the legend).
