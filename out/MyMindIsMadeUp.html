        My Mind Is Made Up
      </h1>
      <p>
        Don't even bother trying to persuade me of your silly little wrong opinions. I know better than to fall for those old arguments. <a href="MyMindIsMadeUp.html">MyMindIsMadeUp</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong><em>"My mind is made up, don't confuse me with the facts!"</em></strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong><em>"My Mind's Already Made Up"</em></strong>

        Actually brings up the old classification of minds:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>OpenMind.<strong> Can entertain any idea, no matter how ridiculous.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="ClosedMind.html">ClosedMind</a>.<strong> Cannot entertain any new idea, no matter how accurate. (This page.)</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, the above two are a <a href="FalseDichotomy.html">FalseDichotomy</a>, because they are not the only two choices. There is also:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>ActiveMind.<strong> Can entertain any ideas that have persuasive evidence -- and only those ideas. Willing to spend considerable effort to get and weigh the evidence -- but once that is done, sticks to what it knows, unless <em>new</em> evidence comes in. (An </strong>ActiveMind<strong> might be made up; it depends on whether the argument is new or old in the judgment of the listener.)</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em> (Is </em>ActiveMind the same as SelectivelyOpenMinded )<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>InactiveMind.<strong> Seeks a simple, quick solution to the problem of ideas, and usually chooses to accept-everything (</strong>OpenMind<strong>) or reject-everything (</strong><a href="ClosedMind.html">ClosedMind</a><strong>) rather than having to bother with the effort of considering and weighing evidence.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

        This introductory line is an expression of those who do not want to think about what is or what is to become.
      </p>
      <p>
        The mindset disallows the opinions, truly or falsely based, that discomfort their own <em>status quo</em>. When expressed in the wiki, it is a thinly veiled deception - not unlike the closing lines of <em>Gone with the Wind</em>.
