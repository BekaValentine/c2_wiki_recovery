        This concept can be helpful when thinking about things which elude your MentalGrasp, but currently I'm having a hard time explaining how or why.

        In my mind this is an UncrystallizedThought, but in the minds of people like <a href="NielsBohr.html">NielsBohr</a> and RobertOppenheimer it was a .. tool? A way of thinking?

        Despite the fact that physics introduces the idea at A-level (or earlier? I forget. 16 year olds can be expected to parrot these apparent facts, even if they don't understand), it wasn't until reading MakingOfTheAtomicBomb by RichardRhodes that I saw how it affects thought.

           There are pairs of properties which, according to the <a href="UncertaintyPrinciple.html">UncertaintyPrinciple</a> of <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a>, are linked. The more you know about one, the less you know about the other

        Maybe the mappers shouldn't write off the packers. Maybe they should embrace also their packer nature? Will ReadRefactorWrite. Three 'R's.
