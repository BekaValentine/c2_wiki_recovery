        When most people think e-commerce, they think of
        business-to-consumer sites like Amazon or E-Bay.
        But most e-commerce is business-to-business, and
        <a href="BizToBiz.html">BizToBiz</a> e-commerce is probably one of the reasons
        for the upsurge in US industrial productivity in
        the past few years.  As long as companies just
        automated their internal operations, white-collar
        productivity did not improve much, but when companies
        can automate the way they interact, they can be much
        more efficient.

        <em>I smell a </em><a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a> here. Per <a href="TomPeters.html">TomPeters</a>, one simplifies workflow _first_, then automates. If <a href="BizToBiz.html">BizToBiz</a> can be burdened with the credit of increasing US productivity, then the <a href="HawthorneEffect.html">HawthorneEffect</a> also shares some blame.  --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em></em>

        Take a look at a book entitled <em>Competing Against Time</em> ISBN 0-02-915291-7, which was one of <a href="TomPeters.html">TomPeters</a> main sources. The authors did a bunch of research that found less than 5% of the time materials spent in supply chains was involved in adding value.  In other words, more than 95% was wasted.  Most of the wasted time was involved in crossing company boundaries.  I agree that simplification comes first, and often automation is not necessary.  I would probably call it material flow instead of work flow simplification - the two are different, but interconnected.  One big improvement is eliminating purchase orders, in other words, getting rid of one piece of "automation" from a previous stage of technology.  But there is a lot of low-hanging fat in <a href="BizToBiz.html">BizToBiz</a>, which is why (I think) business people are interested. --<a href="BobHaugen.html">BobHaugen</a>

        This is not surprising to programmers in the Bay Area.  If I had a nickel for every "unique opportunity in the business to business e-commerce space" e-mail I've received in the past few months, I'd be funding startups, not working for them. --<a href="JohnBrewer.html">JohnBrewer</a>
