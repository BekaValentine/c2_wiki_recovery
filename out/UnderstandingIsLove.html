        "Believe me, when you understand something you will not copy it. A copy cat is a copy cat because he does not understand. Understanding is love. If you don't understand, you don't love."

        I saw this quote on a visit to Florida several years ago, copied it down, and promptly lost it. It was worth enough to me to go a couple of hours out of my way, on my most recent trip down there, to get the quote again. (I have a very understanding spouse.) I have the full text of the speech, which I've finally gotten up:

      </p>
      <p>
        The quote above is the fifth paragraph. I take no resposibility for the punctuation (which I copied exactly from the speech transcript), nor for Wright's opinions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FrankLloydWright.html">FrankLloydWright</a> seems here to be making a point much like <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> or <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>: If you have a good generative pattern, you have something more powerful than a cookie cutter. If you understand something, you won't copy it; you'll copy the essence of what makes it good.

        It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye. (<a href="AntoineDeSaintExupery.html">AntoineDeSaintExupery</a>)

        I've always liked Michaelangelo's comment on copying: "Where I steal, there I leave my knife."  I read this as "If you're going to copy, do it better; make the original look pale by comparison."  (The quotation's not in Bartlett's or the Oxford Dictionary of Quotations, so perhaps it's apocryphal.  I still like it.)
