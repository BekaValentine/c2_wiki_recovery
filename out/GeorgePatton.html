        Gen. George S. Patton, Jr. is one of the most famous (or infamous) American military commanders in history. Patton's Third Army lead the breakout from Normandy and charged across France in a brilliant example of ManeuverWarefare.

        Lest the reader think only praise should be heaped upon this triumphant warrior, it should be remembered that Patton was also a bigot, bully, and alleged philanderer.
