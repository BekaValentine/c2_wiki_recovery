So what exactly is the difference between <a href="DataOrientedSchemaMethodology.html">DataOrientedSchemaMethodology</a> and ObjectOrientedMappingMethodology? XML is just data, and <a href="XmlSchema.html">XmlSchema</a> can only describe data, so how can it be called <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>, given that objects have both data and behaviour?
