        I was reading <a href="CodingConventions.html">CodingConventions</a> and was reminded of certain computer science teachers I have known who insisted on <a href="MethodCommenting.html">MethodCommenting</a> in student assignments. (Mmm, <a href="BigBlocksOfAsterisks.html">BigBlocksOfAsterisks</a>.)  I rather think their students would have learned more had <a href="MethodCommenting.html">MethodCommenting</a> been discouraged, and the assignment marked on whether the reader could understand it anyhow.  -- <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>
