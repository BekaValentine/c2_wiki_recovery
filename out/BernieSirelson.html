        (A particle of the past... I wrote this a very long time ago- 
        in my youth, so to speak, and it persists. I think I'll
        just leave it as it is. [03-22-10])

        Basically, what I'm about is Freedom- not freedom as only
        liberty, but freedom as in the Unbounded Domain. Freedom 
        like life is just a big place to explore. The process is
        to challenge thought; to confront limiting behaviour and
        patterns; to pose impossible juxtopositions. And to participate
        with life as we are already free and all else is a lie.
