        Why So Many Cee Plus Plus Test Frameworks
      </h1>
      <p>
        There are a large number of C and C++ test frameworks,
        differing in slight ways.
        See <a href="ConsiderationsForAndComparisonOfCeePlusPlusTestFrameworks.html">ConsiderationsForAndComparisonOfCeePlusPlusTestFrameworks</a>.

No longer written in Python, but should still be portable to other systems.  CUT 2.6 is written in Python, incorporating the features first developed in the CUT 3 Haskell version.  CUT 3 was never released, as I have received no public support for the decision to move to Haskell (a pity really).

      <p>
        Proliferation is not necessarily a bad thing.  Different people have different needs.  Having a bunch of packages that do the same thing is wasted effort, but the packages don't all do the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some good reasons for different packages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Compiler incompatibilities.</strong>  There are lots of C++ compilers and supporting libraries with various levels of non-conformance to current and past standards.  Writing one framework to support all of those is a lot of work, and leads to lowest-common-denominator functionality.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Platform incompatibilities.</strong>  C++ programs are often written to take advantage of specific operating-system APIs.  Each API has its own set of rules for what constitutes an error.  Each API has its own way of generating printed and graphical output.  A platform-independent test framework cannot take advantage of these features.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Ancestry.</strong>  <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> is the most mature framework, but some would say it suffers from being too closely based upon JUnit.  <a href="CppUtx.html">CppUtx</a> and <a href="CxxTest.html">CxxTest</a> are based on C++ idioms.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Programming Styles.</strong> C++ supports a lot of different ways of writing programs.  People who use lots of templates might want features in a test framework that are very different from those who resist using templates.  Similarly, people who use C++ as "a better C" might not want to use inheritance and other OO features when writing their tests.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If all the frameworks can be refactored down to one framework, without losing important features, then that would be a good thing.  If it turns into an everything-but-the-kitchen-sink monstrosity, then I expect people to stay with the simpler frameworks.
      </p>

        You beat me to it - adding a list of reasons for the proliferation while I was out househunting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Agreed: proliferation and diversity are not necessarily bad.  Actually, I started out wanting to call this page <a href="ConsiderationsForAndComparisonOfCeePlusPlusTestFrameworks.html">ConsiderationsForAndComparisonOfCeePlusPlusTestFrameworks</a> --- all I wanted to do was to compare their features, so I could decide which one I wanted to use.  I thought that recording such a comparison might be useful - certainly, I would love to see one.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've carried my own minimalist C, and then C++, test framework around since 1980. I've started to grow jealous of features I see in other test frameworks. I wanted to do some comparisons before I decided which to use.

        I have modified a few of the items listed above.
