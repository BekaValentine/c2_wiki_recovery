        Wiki Forbidden Topics
      </h1>
      <p>
        A list of topics that ought to be forbidden (or at least discouraged) on Wiki:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Debates over religious doctrine. (In particular, the creation/evolution debate). The reason that these topics should be discouraged on this wiki is simply that they are very off-topic.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I assume that includes programming languages, methodologies, and operating systems?</em> Computer science topics are, by definition, <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>. Of course, <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s and <a href="ParadigmPissingMatch.html">ParadigmPissingMatch</a>es are to be discouraged.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Debates over gun control/right to keep and bear arms.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Why should anything be forbidden? Who would enforce it? What's wrong with letting <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> decide what lives and dies? Why must you people always try and stifle the freedom that exists on wiki? If something is off-topic, it will likely get deleted by many people, <a href="SoftSecurity.html">SoftSecurity</a> is part of <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This advice is intended as that - advice. The above topics were listed because they are - in general - </em><a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, and also because they generate much more heat than light. Maybe, "forbidden" is too strong of a word; I'm not going to try and forbid anything, nor do I have any intention of massively deleting that material which I don't personally approve of.<em></em>

        <em>I just posted saying I was always right and therefore my posts would never be deleted. . . Can you believe that comment disappeared?</em>

        Perhaps we should call this HistoricallyFutileWikiTopics, and then list topics that has been debated to death with only a large mess for show and are eventually deleted. Instead of being an advice for what topic to choose, let it be a warning for those who wish to walk that path again.

        <em>Apparently, the WBL vandal thinks this page is off-topic, as he is regularly deleting it!</em>
