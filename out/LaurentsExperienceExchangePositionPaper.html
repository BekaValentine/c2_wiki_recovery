        This story starts with a phrase borrowed from <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> to suggest
        one disappointment that may await the XP advocate : <strong>"Fallen among thorns"</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quoting Ron, <em>"XP is a discipline of cooperation, feedback, discovery, and learning.  Companies that don't get that, don't get XP.  In such a company, often XP will fall among these thorns and be choked out."</em> (He wasn't as gloomy as this excerpt makes him out to be. I selected for shock value.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all organizational soil will be hospitable to the seeds of ideas
        that XP sows.
      </p>
      <p>
        We may either seek fertile soil to plant the seeds; or accept the soil
        we are given, and work that soil as best we can. In this exchange I will
        be concerned with the latter situation, which for various reasons I
        chose for myself over the past year or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will attempt to extract the lucky breaks and the salient decisions from 
        my experiences over these dozen-odd months, with particular attention to
        one aspect that has emerged to give them structure : my quest for a "larger
        intellectual context" to XP, which eventually gave rise to <a href="BookShelved.html">BookShelved</a>.
        This will take us through the country of "ChangeArtistry", over <a href="TheFifthDiscipline.html">TheFifthDiscipline</a> and like as not end up in even stranger lands.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or such, at any rate, is what I hope to get from this workshop.
