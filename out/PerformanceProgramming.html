        Performance Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DonKnuth.html">DonKnuth</a> recognized computer programming as an art. But can it be a performance art? Don's own <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> produces works too long for public reading. Surely the very act of programming takes too long to maintain an audience's interest. But then, maybe not.

        I've been working on a program in my spare time for a couple of months. A handful of friends have watched development progress by visiting a web page devoted to the effort. The page is like a journal of the project except that, in the style of wiki, I haven't kept it chronologically.

           <a href="http://c2.com/~ward/bs2/doc/index.html">http://c2.com/~ward/bs2/doc/index.html</a> ... and details within.
        </li>
      </ul>

        If the page is a performance, you've already missed the beginning. But the show isn't over. The project is of a nature that will have me tinkering for months or even years. You're welcome to join us or announce a show of your own. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        I remember in my younger days making a fancy trace in basic which would spit the trace out to another computer. It was quite facinating watching the code fly by on one screen while a full-screen graphic app ran on the other.
