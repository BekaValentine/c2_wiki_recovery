        Hi and welcome to my <a href="WikiHomePage.html">WikiHomePage</a>! (Yes, <a href="GirlsDoWiki.html">GirlsDoWiki</a> :)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have over 20 years experience in the full software development life cycle, including real-time software development; graphical, analytical, and database software systems; configuration management; people and project management; sustaining software and hardware; integration and test; and CMM-based process improvement. I've worked in a variety of industries, and am now a Senior Consultant in Corporate Research at ABB (<a href="http://www.abb.com)">http://www.abb.com)</a> in the <a href="NorthCarolinaTriangleArea.html">NorthCarolinaTriangleArea</a>. My group's purpose is to provide business-goal-driven improvement guidance to ABB business units in the Americas who develop software systems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My personal focus is on supporting <a href="AgileTeams.html">AgileTeams</a>, and I've created a website dedicated to them (<a href="http://www.agileteams.com).">http://www.agileteams.com).</a>  As far as I know, I was the first person ever to become both a PSP (<a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a>) Instructor (see PspInstructor)/ TSP (<a href="TeamSoftwareProcess.html">TeamSoftwareProcess</a>) Launch Coach (see <a href="TspLaunchCoach.html">TspLaunchCoach</a>) and a Certified <a href="ScrumMaster.html">ScrumMaster</a> (see <a href="ScrumMasterCertification.html">ScrumMasterCertification</a>.) I attend AgileRTP meeting whenever my travel schedule permits.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe in <a href="MethodologicalPluralism.html">MethodologicalPluralism</a> over <a href="MethodologicalPurity.html">MethodologicalPurity</a>: there is <a href="NoSilverBullet.html">NoSilverBullet</a>. If I were still primarily a developer (like my brother, PaulSmiley, and my brother-in-law, Jim), I would want to have a broad collection of good tools in my toolbox; and I consider methodologies and processes such as PSP/TSP and agile to be 'tools' in the same way that {programming languages, design methods, databases ...} are.

        Karen, I tracked you down as I am trying to develop an understanding of <a href="InformationTechnologyGovernance.html">InformationTechnologyGovernance</a> and see that you created the changes in SoftwareEngineeringInstitute. I have two short questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1) is it fair to say CMM/CMMI has no relationship to <a href="CapabilitySecurityModel.html">CapabilitySecurityModel</a> ?
        </li>
        <li>
           2) do you know of good portals / wikis etc where practioners in <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a>, <a href="StrategicManagement.html">StrategicManagement</a>, IT alignment, etc get together?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        BTW if you cannot edit on this site suggest you visit <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> and temporarily use <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiWikiWeb">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiWikiWeb</a> -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> 31Mar05

        Hi David - sorry for the delay in responding to your questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1) I was/am unfamiliar with <a href="CapabilitySecurityModel.html">CapabilitySecurityModel</a> and would have to learn more about it to have a lot of confidence in my answer, but for now I would guess no, there is probably no connection with the CMM/CMMI
        </li>
        <li>
           2) For <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a>, you could try out CM Crossroads. At SEPG this year, there was some vendor activity around creation of a BusinessDevelopmentMaturityModel - a Google search might find you something of interest on <a href="StrategicManagement.html">StrategicManagement</a>. (I'm assuming you've already searched groups.yahoo.com for those topics.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Good luck! -- Karen :) 14Dec05
