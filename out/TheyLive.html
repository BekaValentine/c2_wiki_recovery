        Terrible movie with a wonderful premise; we are all <a href="MindFsck.html">MindFsck</a>ed thralls serving intergalactic slavers that control us through hypnogogic advertising. Contains the longest and silliest fight scene in movie history.

        Despite the bad acting and whatnot, it was a great movie. I don't know if it actually invented them, but it sure had some great lines: "I came here to chew bubble gum, and kick some ass... and I'm all out of bubble gum." Well, okay, maybe <em>one</em> great line.

        Definitely a B movie (and notice how "Big Business" has replaced Communism as the bogey), but the makeup job on those aliens was terrific. It was the only movie that <em>ever</em> gave me nightmares. -<a href="DavidBrantley.html">DavidBrantley</a>
