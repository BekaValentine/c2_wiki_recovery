        My name is Wooil Song, from Korea, a reporter. 
        Now, I am preparing a report about wiki.

        <dd>Please see <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>. <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> (this, the first, wiki) stays fairly uninterested with the hundreds of other wikis that have grown to large importance on their own. In particular, FoxWiki, Swiki, Zwiki, Twiki, <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a>, <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a> and its child <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> are some rather popular wikis or wiki software. You may also want to read <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>, but that gets into technical details you may not be interested in. Then again, <a href="SoftSecurity.html">SoftSecurity</a> might be worthwhile. -- ss </dd>

        I've finished my report, thank you all! :)

        Looks like your report was a success. We've received many Korean visitors recently.

        <dd>Well, I'm a little bit worried, when the article is published in the February issue of the magazine, a large number of masses would come into and test here and there, maybe some trampling around; this would lead <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> to a temporal chaos. However, the magazine is not a game magazine for youngsters but a developers magazine for IT professionals - it is recognized as one of the most technical developers' magazines in Korea, so we wouldn't see the worst case, though. -- <a href="JuneKim.html">JuneKim</a> </dd>
