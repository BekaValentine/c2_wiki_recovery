        Beyond War And Casualties
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> of 2004, carried into 2005 has resulted in lots of casualties in the communities.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not sure whether <a href="CureWorseThanTheDisease.html">CureWorseThanTheDisease</a> or not, as perhaps responding directly, forcefully and promptly to inappropriate actions could have been the best solution. Question is at what point this consideration becomes more important than <a href="MakeRoomForAllViewpoints.html">MakeRoomForAllViewpoints</a>, and for how long?

           I prefer this wiki being <strong>disabled</strong> rather than <strong>usurped</strong>. Heck, even if Ward pulls the plug, that is far more preferable to some anonymous usurpers seizing control by force and blackmail.
        </li>
        <li>
           Well-intentioned and misguided is a bad combination, and desperation can only make it worse. 
        </li>
        <li>
           how are you going to convince 2 anonymous people who fight each other without letting me know their motivations and their intentions? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Emotional appeals are not going to make any headway unless you appeal to some kind of logic.

           We know that even if both of you are not brave enough to assume more than an <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a> position, you do care (rather irrationally imho) about "saving face" and would not like that your "public anonymous image" to be damaged by the resolution of this conflict.

      <p>
        One side viewed it was fight over editorial control on specific pages
        (if those pages stayed as they are, we'd institutionalize that anybody can get possession aka editorial control of a piece of wiki by acting irrationally enough and blackmailing the wiki community), as well as basically you have nothing at all to gain by defending them, other than you do it as a matter of principle.

        <em>217 discussed his views about the perplexing war with WBL</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One side explained he does not understand the reasons for war to continue. WBL did not seem to have participated in this page. I do not know for sure, tried my best to ignore hot pages at the time.

        <strong>Unsound idea(s) being floated here</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>"Change wiki to be more like a magazine than instant messenger"</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What if the </em>RecentChanges has a one day lag? And a separate page is generated to log instantaneously cases where external links are added?<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We probably continue to have a need to discover and revert spam quickly, but if "RecentChanges" got delayed then there would be less over-reactions to edits by people here? Wouldn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Assumption is also made that if there are real <a href="BarnRaising.html">BarnRaising</a> type collaboration, then contributors all need sometime to stop and think, or is realtime collaboration (which I think is good for Brain storming) essential in creating pages that will endure the test of time?
      </p>
      <p>
        If <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> are closer to the "Changes in week x" type, most people reading RecentChanges would see a more peaceful wiki, even if there are constant edit and reverts between two persons fighting over "version A" vs "version B".
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It was noted elsewhere that people who read wikis (e.g. got to wiki via a link elsewhere, then start reading the links in the page) probably did not know about the edit war. <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> looks very peaceful to me as a casual user too.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        With a slooow <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, individuals can still home in to edit pages they know and care about, whilst general browsing on what else is going on is delayed.
