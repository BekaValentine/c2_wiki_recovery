        Programming Inside The Cube

      <p>
        Cubizens don't get the attention they deserve.  Slaving away in harsh conditions like some robotic assambly lines.  <a href="DilBert.html">DilBert</a> and his coworkers suffer from a cube lifestyle.  <a href="ProgrammingInsideTheCube.html">ProgrammingInsideTheCube</a> can lead to unsatisfactory code, but many hackers manage to thrive despite their oppression by a <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a>.  Currently, I work in a cube-like environment--only 2 walls and some extra lighting built-in.  I can see 3 of the other 4 workers in my area from where I sit.  Unfortunately, we're having to reorganize the cubicles to fit 2 or 3 more people and get "more privacy".  What I don't understand is why the others actually favor these changes.  If it were up to me, we'd just have a cubicle wall to divide us from the hallway traffic.  -- <a href="WillGray.html">WillGray</a>

        I consider myself a "cubizen" and might use "cubiclean" to describe my co-workers.  -- <a href="WillGray.html">WillGray</a>

        I'd be tempted to use 'cognicubiform' for this, but I have no occasion to use it. - <a href="JesseMillikan.html">JesseMillikan</a>
