        People Editing Recent Changes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Why are people editing <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> so much these days? And messing with my sense of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does it even make any sense to do so? Doesn't <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?RecentChanges</a> recompile the list based on the current state of the database?
      </p>
      <p>
        No, it's static, just like other Wiki pages.
        It's only automated to the extent that changing pages causes lines to be appended to the end.
        <em>(...and some tricks to put the right date in.)</em>
        It's a manual process, done from time to time, to move old data to ChangesInWeek<Number>.

        <em>OH! Oh my. I once went in, and thinking I'd be a </em><a href="GoodWikiCitizen.html">GoodWikiCitizen</a> lopped off a bunch of days from the top of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. From what you're telling me here, that was not a good thing to do. Is this correct? -- <a href="JohnRepici.html">JohnRepici</a><em></em>

        That's fine. If no one ever did that then the page would just continue to grow endlessly. You did the right thing.

        I'm afraid I started something unhealthy:
        I put <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a> in place of multiple dial-in dynamically assigned IP names,
        to make it clear who was doing large scale changes of <a href="WikiMindWipeRepair.html">WikiMindWipeRepair</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then someone got off on an experiment related to knowing or hiding who was making what changes to pages.
        (<a href="MeaningOfIdentity.html">MeaningOfIdentity</a>, <a href="ContentOfIdentity.html">ContentOfIdentity</a>, <a href="IdentitySubversion.html">IdentitySubversion</a>)
        Now I'm wishing I hadn't started it.

        <em>I have noticed for a long time that some entries did not have a machine identifier afer a </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> entry.  For example, NewSubject ....., where normally there would be NewSubject ..... ObscureMachineName.  I always wondered how that happened.  At first I thought it happened when Ward made a change, but now wonder if the person (making the recent change) manually edited the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page.  Does anyone know how this happens?<em></em>

        The reverse domain name look up failed. Probably because the IP has no publicly known domain name. For instance, this computer has no domain name so the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> entry shouldn't have a domain name. <em>I lied, but the principle is correct.</em>

        In setting up this wiki on my site, I learned that servers who have this environment variable enabled actually do a reverse DNS for every single connection, not just cgi scripts. That's every graphic, small or large on the page, every frame content, etc. will cause the server to run a reverse DNS. I can understand why it is disabled on my hosting service. Right now I just put REMOTE_ADDR in place of it (which is even more unfriendly, but). Someday I'll learn how to do my own reverse lookup in perl. - jr
