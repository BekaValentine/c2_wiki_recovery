        <a href="TopQuadrant.html">TopQuadrant</a> is where you can now find <a href="RalphHodgson.html">RalphHodgson</a>. We are a US-based consulting company working in the "Solution Design" space addressing the translation gap between business strategy and IT solutions. With the many solution choices in the industry, development is no longer pure "green-field" but more about selecting and integrating components, innovating where clear business value will derive. We are using solution envisioning methods along with a database of solution "Capability Cases" with technologies, vendors and products situated expressed in a business problem context. The method, v2rM, "Vision to Reality" Method, is scenario-based. Scenarios are annotated with forces and desired results. These are mapped to solution capabilities expressed in a pattern language.

        <em>Now could we have the version that's not in marketing-ese?</em> Why? Is marketing a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>? <em>Yes, see </em><a href="AvoidNeologisms.html">AvoidNeologisms</a>.<em> Nothing wrong with marketing, in its place. Using marketing jargon on the Wiki, however, is different. </em>see anotherForm below<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now in addition to NameSpaces, we have a new term SolutionSpaces. Note the use of the two words, "forces" and "results", sounds like a <a href="SuccessOrientedApproach.html">SuccessOrientedApproach</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's a "SolutionSpace"? And why does the use of "forces" and "results" in ad copy suggest a </em><a href="SuccessOrientedApproach.html">SuccessOrientedApproach</a>? And does the fact that it merely <em>sounds like</em> a <a href="SuccessOrientedApproach.html">SuccessOrientedApproach</a> mean it isn't?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The purpose of Marketing-ese isn't to communicate but to obfuscate, in contradiction to the purpose of Wiki and in contrast to all other, natural and unnatural, languages like English, Sindarin, Klingon and 8086 assembler.</em>

        I couldn't resist distilling the first paragraph:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We're a (VAR|systems integrator) who keeps notes on past projects so we (succeed|don't screw up) again.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If that doesn't describe <a href="TopQuadrant.html">TopQuadrant</a>, they need to clarify precisely what it is that they do. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do they offer custom programming, or do they combine off-the-shelf components? 
        </li>
        <li>
           How much of their effort is created fresh <em>vs.</em> adapted from previous projects? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Etc. Answering those questions might tell us something about what the company does.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It is at least an approach which does not test to fail, and does not require an unmerciful refactoring because the first result failed as desired, and does not use the flip coin method.
