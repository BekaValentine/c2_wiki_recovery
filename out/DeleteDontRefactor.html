        Very similar to <a href="DisagreeByDeleting.html">DisagreeByDeleting</a>. A choosing of the easier of two mutually-exclusive alternatives. Since it will not require thinking about what should be part of the page and personally MakeItHappen, deletion simply removes the need to provide or continue meaning on the page.

        There isn't enough here to categorize it as an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. Tacking on the <a href="CategoryAntiPattern.html">CategoryAntiPattern</a> tag says it's your opinion, but a true anti-pattern needs more context, an anti-solution, and the true solution.

        This is a classic <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> between the <a href="WikiReductionist.html">WikiReductionist</a> versus the <a href="WikiFilterist.html">WikiFilterist</a>.
