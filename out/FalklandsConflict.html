        Falklands Conflict
      </h1>
      <p>
        War waged between United Kingdom and Argentina. The disputed Falkland Islands are a British colonial possession with a democratic self-government located near the coast of Argentina. The Argentines have claimed the islands for years, and in 1982 the country's military government forcibly invaded. British Prime Minister <a href="MargaretThatcher.html">MargaretThatcher</a> ordered the islands be liberated from Argentina, and sent a taskforce to drive out the occupiers. 
        Though the casualties were fairly high for such a minor conflict, Britain was ultimately victorious, and the islands are once again British and democratic.
