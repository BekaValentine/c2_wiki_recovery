        Sentence Style For Naming Unit Tests
      </h1>
      <p>
        A method of naming <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a><strong>'s that allows the test class to be read as descriptive documentation of the class under test.  Invented by </strong><a href="ChrisStevenson.html">ChrisStevenson</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A unit test class is named after the class under test.  E.g. a test for the Sheep class would be called SheepTest or SheepTests. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The methods of the test class are named to complete a sentence that begins with "A <em>class-under-test</em>...".  E.g. the methods of SheepTest would be named to continue the sentence "A Sheep...".
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, in Java:
      </p>
      <code>
        public class Sheep<strong>'Test {</strong><br/>
        @Test public void eatsGrass() { ... }<br/>
        @Test public void bleatsWhenFrightened() { ... }<br/>
        @Test public void producesDeliciousMilk() { ... }<br/>
        @Test public void movesAwayFromSheepdogs() { ... }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This can be read as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A Sheep eats grass
        </li>
        <li>
           A Sheep bleats when frightened
        </li>
        <li>
           A Sheep produces delicious milk
        </li>
        <li>
           A Sheep moves away from sheepdogs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are tools that generate documentation from tests written with this convention.  For example, TestDox
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        More expressive languages do not need this convention, because tests can be implemented as blocks associated with string descriptions of what is being tested.
