        Pluggable Architecture
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="SoftwareArchitecture.html">SoftwareArchitecture</a> that allows to plug functionality using <a href="PluggableModules.html">PluggableModules</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Winamp - Sound, Visual, and Skin plugins
        </li>
        <li>
           Photoshop - Filters, Importers/Exporters
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        The <a href="PluggableArchitecture.html">PluggableArchitecture</a> is <em>sort of</em> like the <a href="DataBusPattern.html">DataBusPattern</a> / <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> (same thing), except that it usually has a much more constrained channel of information, and it is rare that the plug-ins communicate with each other. The central functionality is generally much more powerful than the outer plug-ins. The plug-ins fit very specific roles, whereas in the <a href="DataBusPattern.html">DataBusPattern</a>, the components do pretty much anything.

        Use a <a href="PluggableArchitecture.html">PluggableArchitecture</a> when you want a system to work in straightforward and predictable ways, with very specific points of variation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> when you want a system to be pretty much universally extendable, and made up of the connections of lots of little pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use a <a href="PluggableArchitecture.html">PluggableArchitecture</a>, you get to pinch the points at which change occurs.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you use a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> architecture, pretty much everything can be changed atomically, but you have to keep more inter-connections in your head at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that we will need significant advances in 2D <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a> technology, before we can appropriately understand <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> architectures. In the near term future, <a href="PluggableArchitecture.html">PluggableArchitecture</a> seems to be almost always the better way to go, if you need extensability. -- <a href="LionKimbro.html">LionKimbro</a>
