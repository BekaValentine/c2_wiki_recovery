        My broad interest in Agile subjects is shown through the following activities:

      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm a Certified Scrum Master, practicing this art in my current employment, and participating in various newsgroups to learn and support others.

           I am program director for the Agile Alliance Roadmap program, have a look at <a href="http://www.agilealliance.com/programs/roadmaps/Roadmap/index.htm">http://www.agilealliance.com/programs/roadmaps/Roadmap/index.htm</a>

           I founded the Agile Scotland group (<a href="http://www.agilescotland.com/),">http://www.agilescotland.com/),</a> a group of people with interests in Agile Methods. We're meeting once a month, and have animated discussions on anything agile. Thus far I managed to attract speakers like Ken Schwaber, Mary Poppendieck and Barry Boehm (amongst others). 
        </li>
        <li>
           I regularly organise agile training sessions: In 2003 <a href="KenSchwaber.html">KenSchwaber</a> provided his Certified Scrum Master class in Edinburgh. In 2004 <a href="MaryPoppendieck.html">MaryPoppendieck</a> ran her Lean Software Development course in Glasgow.

        <li>
           I lecture at Glasgow Caledonian University, a cycle on Agile Development Methods.
        </li>
        <li>
           My current activity focusses on Agile2005, assisting MikeCohn in the organisation of one of the tracks. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Low priority activities are around the creation of a catalog of Scrum simulations (together with <a href="JeanTabaka.html">JeanTabaka</a>).
