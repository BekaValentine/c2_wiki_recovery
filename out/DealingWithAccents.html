        Dealing With Accents
      </h1>
      <p>
        Due to globalization, more IT personnel have heavy accents. If you have a heavy accent (compared to where you are), here are some tips to improve communications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't speak fast. Slow down when you speak, especially if you are asked to repeat a phrase for clarity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use synonyms for words that are causing difficulty, or find a different way to say the same thing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Provide a wider context first. For examaple, say "Who took my candy?" instead of "Who took my licorice?". Use <a href="StepwiseRefinement.html">StepwiseRefinement</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be prepared to spell out the problem words, or perhaps carry a notepad. Some find this undignifying, but sometimes you have to leave your ego at the door if you want to communicate well.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Practice pronouncing the final consonants of a word. Non-native English speakers often have a hard time with the final consonants. Another common problem is the difference between "R" and "L". 
        </li>
      </ul>
