        Selling Xp
      </h1>
      <p>
        Given that <a href="NameXp.html">NameXp</a> is a moot point by now, more of the discussion is around selling it.  Discussion moved here accordingly.

        I too originally thought that the name <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> might not seem like a good idea, but having just spent numerous hours explaining this thing we call XP to numerous suits I can say with conviction the name is correct.  It is a very fresh approach and as such it deserves a name that attracts attention and makes it stand out from the rest of the methodologies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When I am explaining the methodology I always start out by asking if the interviewer has heard of <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and his work.  I have only gotten a yes once.  I then talk about streamlining the software process saying things like: "<em>most methodologies want you to test, but we really do test, in fact we write the tests first."  "Most methodologies want you to review your code, we continuously review our code by working in pairs.</em>"  Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I go on through the various things that currently accepted methods espouse but never fulfill and I say why XP actually delivers.  I finish with "<em>...and that is why I can say it is 6 times faster.</em>"  Now at this point I will either be asked for a name or I just tell what the methodology's name is.  The interviewer will invariably pause to write it down. --<a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a>

      <p>
        <em>but when they go to repeat what you told them they'll likely say, "I heard about this really kooky but kind of cool thing the other day, </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> ...", and then they're dealing with a bad reaction before they've said word one about what XP actually means.<em></em>

        Part of the problem is exactly the problem we had at <a href="MasPar.html">MasPar</a>- we have a solution and most folks don't even know there is a problem. Our marketing guy used to say, "First we have to create the mailbox in folks' heads, then we can start delivering messages to it." Managers and customers have no idea that they can and should demand the kind of accountability and flexibility that XP can produce. Decades of interaction with IT have them conditioned to expect long dark periods followed by disappointment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people know about <a href="EvolutionaryDelivery.html">EvolutionaryDelivery</a>. One way of looking at XP is that it is a technical strategy that can execute <a href="EvolutionaryDelivery.html">EvolutionaryDelivery</a> indefinitely with programmers of ordinary skill. Folks who want ED but are afraid may be able to see how XP addresses those fears. But again, the audience for ED is currently small.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have an answer. When I explain the technical strategy to technical folks, they either love it or hate it. When I explain the management strategy to upper management, they love it. But our big problem is getting customers and managers to demand transparency, accountability, and flexibility. Once they know to ask, we can deliver. --<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        So far, by the time your new chum has worked through the <a href="ExtremeUnifiedProcess.html">ExtremeUnifiedProcess</a> chunk, and figured out what we have to do with RUP and MSF, and looked around at stuff on <a href="EvoFusion.html">EvoFusion</a>, <a href="EvolutionaryDelivery.html">EvolutionaryDelivery</a> and maybe stumbled over something on <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, they figure either (a) "By god this might actually work!" or (b) "We'll never cut through this much hogwash in time to save the project!"

        I like the comments in <a href="CrossingTheXpChasm.html">CrossingTheXpChasm</a>, suggesting that you need a different approach to sell to different segments of the market.
        To sell this to middle and upper management, one needs a "sales approach"
        <em>(ick!)</em>
        with <strong>images and names</strong> that immediately suggest the most relevant attributes of the product your selling.
        When you tell them you want to do "N," the name "N" has to be something they know they don't fully understand, but which they feel they'd like to know more about.

        The notion of bringing XP in one chunk at a time makes a lot of sense. Most projects are underway: few are beginning. Full methodologies are, by and large, declared into use by fiat, and observed little or not at all. In my three years at Chrysler, I have used the term "Extreme Programming" essentially never in discussion with management. --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        When selling <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> to suits I like to start with
        the fact that this process is one proven, successful way to reengineer
        the software development process
        (see <a href="XpIsResultOfApplyingBusinessProcessReengToSwEngProcess.html">XpIsResultOfApplyingBusinessProcessReengToSwEngProcess</a>).
        By using something suits are familiar with (<a href="BusinessProcessReengineering.html">BusinessProcessReengineering</a>)
        as well as has been proven successful in many areas of business
        it seems to get <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> accepted more quickly accepted.
        <a href="BusinessProcessReengineering.html">BusinessProcessReengineering</a> is pretty extreme (HammerAndChampy
        say that radical is the most important word in the description
        of BPR) so the name fits without too much excitement.  --<a href="HankRoark.html">HankRoark</a>

        I think that what REALLY works is to start small and limit your initial investment. Don't get focused on selling the approach across the collective. Just find a way to get starting adapting the practices and philosophies in your own vicinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        What we did on the <a href="DoIt.html">DoIt</a> team was just -- start using XP practices. Without any selling. Without anyone outside the team especially knowing. We figured out how to "plug" our practices into whatever surface artifacts we needed to support.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that we have a two year history of successful delivery in the face of rapid change, we're getting some attention. Enlightened teams have been able to smell the difference for a long time -- now other managers want to know how we do what we do. And, may the timing gods be praised, now we're starting to see lots of web presence (and Kent's new book) to help us sell the concepts. But our credibility is based on consistent delivery, not on the philosophical value of the approach.
      </p>
      <p>
        And that is actually a big difference between XP and the methodologies I've heard preached in the past. You CAN deliver head-turning results, and create an environment that the very sharpest people in the organization are eager to join. In the end, you don't have to base the sales pitch on the theory. Put it in practice in a small way, and you will create real-world arguments for the value of the approach. You DON'T have to invest thousands of dollars per seat in massive modelling and repository tools.

        Interested in drilling down specifically on messages for <a href="SellingXpToExecutives.html">SellingXpToExecutives</a>. Agree with introducing XP in small pieces by stealth (and have been applying that) but there comes a point where you want to try a project using all the practices, and this seems to be when you need to be able to persuade senior management --<a href="AlexChapman.html">AlexChapman</a>
