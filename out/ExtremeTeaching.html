        Extreme Teaching
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Extreme Teaching" was coined by <a href="AlexChaffee.html">AlexChaffee</a> to describe an iterative, agile classroom teaching method.  Basically, you divide the class time into iterations, and allow the students to prioritize what is taught during those iterations.  The teacher plays the 'developer' role; the students are the 'customer.'

        Wow. That was fun.
      </p>
      <p>
        My friend Sarah is teaching a class at <a href="CalBerkeley.html">CalBerkeley</a> Extension
        (or "UCBX" as the cool kids say) on Web Design. At 3:00 she
        asked me to guest lecture for tonight's 6:30 class. The
        schedule (which she drew up at the beginning of the
        semester) said "Part 1: iterative design. Part 2: web
        technologies". Instead of separating them into parts, I had
        a great idea:
      </p>
      <p>
        Use an iterative methodology to teach about web technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        We brainstormed for 10 minutes, writing down technology
        topics on index cards ("Flash", "HTML", "Client-server",
        "Database", "Java"). Came up with at least 50 of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the hour was nigh, I packed up my cards and my kitchen
        timer and biked over.
      </p>
      <p>
        So first I gave a brief lecture on methodologies. I discussed a phased
        approach (e.g. the Boehm Waterfall) versus an iterative
        approach (e.g. the Boehm Spiral). I then said we were going
        to "go meta" and structure the rest of the class using an
        iterative methodology -- one we're going to make up as we go.
      </p>
      <p>
        I then gave Kent Beck's "<a href="TheseAreMagicCards.html">TheseAreMagicCards</a>" speech, only
        the magic part was "Anything you write on them, you will learn."
      </p>
      <p>
        So "Desire is limitless, but resources are finite" which
        means you have to prioritize. We had 50 cards but we weren't
        going to be able to cover all of them. So which ones are
        most important?
      </p>
      <p>
        Our process then went like this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           minutes: The Planning Game: lay the cards out on a table.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Sort them in order of priority. If desired, write new cards
        or split old ones.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           minutes: Teach. I pick the top card, give a brief
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        lecture, then ask for questions until the students are
        satiated. Rip it up and make a mark on the board. Repeat
        until the kitchen timer rings.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           minutes: Retrospective. What did we learn? What was our
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        velocity? What problems arose? How can we change our process?
      </p>
      <p>
        Repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was REALLY REALLY GREAT.
      </p>
      <p>
        The planning game *engaged* the students from the get go,
        got them talking to each other (I stepped aside and didn't
        participate in the prioritization), and "broke the ice" and
        encouraged them to ask questions and talk amongst themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 5 minute timer helped stop "analysis paralysis" -- even
        though the students didn't know what half the terms meant,
        they were able to make priority decisions, and didn't waste
        time in research or speculation mode. After the first 20
        minutes I'd used enough of the terms, in context, to give
        them a bit more foundation from which to choose the next
        set; accordingly, the top cards were a totally different set
        after the second planning game.
      </p>
      <p>
        The retrospectives allowed us a chance to examine and change
        the process itself. This is one of the subtle advantages of
        an iterative process: it schedules time to reflect on the
        process, rather than just being heads-down in crisis mode
        all the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        One change we made was, students weren't discussing among
        themselves enough, so we tried adding "after every
        technology topic, discuss how you could use it in your own
        web site."
      </p>
      <p>
        Another was, "Instead of Alex or Sarah answering every
        question, if a student knows about the topic, they should
        lead the discussion."
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, for the final iteration, they came up with a change
        that dazzled me: they proposed we change the facilitator!
        So I sat down, and someone else stood up and ran the
        meeting: He picked up the timer, set it to 5 minutes, ran
        the planning game, and so on. I was tickled pink to see the
        process I'd established running without me, and to see their
        creativity within (and beyond) the rules I'd originally set.
      </p>
      <p>
        (When the chosen topic was "API", one of the students raised
        his hand. "Yes, Spencer?" "Yes, I think Alex knows about
        that one." Laughs all around.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Since it was the last iteration, we didn't have a full 20
        minutes left, which provoked a discussion of how to measure
        the velocity with different units, whether to alter the
        estimates, and so forth. Excellent stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many process observations happened inside the retrospective. For
        instance,
      </p>
      <p>
        After we added the "discuss an example" practice, our
        velocity went down. Why? Some suggested it was the extra
        discussions. Another thought it was getting late and people
        were sleepy. Or maybe we're getting into more depth on each
        topic because we're more comfortable with the process. How
        can we experiment to verify each hypothesis? Is the lower
        velocity acceptable, or should we reduce the scope more? Etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 2 iterations I took the "mark on the board" chart and
        used that data to make a new Big Visible Chart (by the way,
        when you describe this, take a beat between saying "BVC" and
        saying what the letters stand for -- it gets a good laugh)
        tracking our velocity across time. This gave me the
        opportunity to compare <a href="InformationRadiator.html">InformationRadiator</a>s (BVCs) and
        <a href="InformationRefrigerator.html">InformationRefrigerator</a>s (MS Project) and some other
        Alistairisms.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm definitely going to teach my next "real" class like
        this, no matter what the topic. Wow. It was fun and
        educational for me and for them. All that stuff they say
        about empowering the stakeholder and engaging interaction
        might be true after all :-)
      </p>

        Not Extreme as such but still fairly radical (I think):
      </p>
      <p>
        I read recently that one of the physics prof's at TrentUniversity (Peterborough, Ontario) doesn't have static lecture notes.  Instead he assigns readings from the course text and then students can log onto a course website and list topics or areas they had difficulty understanding on their own.  Before the next lecture, the prof. has a look at what the students are having difficulty with, and only lectures on those areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought that was pretty cool.
