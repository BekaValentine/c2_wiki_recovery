        Good Example Of Hype
      </h1>
      <p>
        The only good thing about hype is it put the thing in everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>XML (</strong><a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a>) Hype<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think most people like XML at first because of WWW's HTML Hype. It was claimed to be very human-readable and writable. Yet if you compare it to INI/YAML/SEXP/ODGL, all others are just easier to read/write/parse. (Actually there is no need at all to account for how easy it is to parse a format as long as you are not the one writing a parser).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Not strictly true, as this will affect the speed at which the parser could operate, which might be of interest for some time-critical things.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               From search in Google and what I have heard so far, an XML parser library's size is the biggest of the four and also consumes a lot of memory. What makes you think that parsing "<foo>text</foo>" can be done faster than "(foo "text")"; just count the characters, and XML can't be extracted with <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The dream of being able to have unrelated applications automatically talk to each other through XML is still a dream. Those applications still can only talk via the same XML schema, which is no different a constraint than using the same XXX protocol.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the good thing about it is that now XML is everywhere. Most software products now have a way to input/output XML data. Whether or not the XML-ish format can be immediately fed into other programs or not (which it usually can't) is not the point. At least you can do XSLT on it. XML is becoming a big ugly glue data format. But it was good for that purpose.

        <strong>Java Hype</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Java was pushed by <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a>. They released the free SDK and a full-blown GUI/Network/Database library. For the first time all those things have been standardized.  Sure the language itself was a hype, it was not much more than <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> plus <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> minus <a href="PointerArithmetic.html">PointerArithmetic</a>. But the hype of Java promotes an <a href="ArmyOfProgrammers.html">ArmyOfProgrammers</a>. You can see how many Java <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects have grown. <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is at least easier to learn than C++. Because of the common knowledge in the GUI/Network/Database library, newbies can more readily find help. Lots of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects are Java because of its hype. -- <a href="PisinBootvong.html">PisinBootvong</a>

        <em>You seem to be implying that the good thing about hype is that it can produce de-facto standards that are slightly better than the de-facto standards it replaces. Without so much hype, maybe a truly meritorious language will more likely emerge to replace the big guns.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Without hype things move slowly. Hype wastes a lot of creative effort, but a small portion results in real progress. Hype is tangible merits grown out of proportion. Without hype there is just not enough energy and focus. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
