        I used to work as a consultant for TIBCO Software Inc. (<a href="http://www.tibco.com/)">http://www.tibco.com/)</a> doing enterprise architecture related work, at various locations around Europe, after that I spent a short time working as a technical architect (let's not get into the whole <em>what is an architect</em> thing, ok?) for Infogain (<a href="http://www.infogain.com/)">http://www.infogain.com/)</a> in the UK. Now I do freelance contract work. If you'd like to hire me send me a mail.
