        Scrum Reports
      </h1>
      <p>
        A short status, usually given orally, in a <a href="StandUpMeeting.html">StandUpMeeting</a> (or by e-mail <em>email is hard.  </em><a href="DailyScrum.html">DailyScrum</a> should always be in person or conference call<em>), containing three sections (short!):</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Things I Did Today, 
        </li>
        <li>
           Things I Have Planned for Tomorrow, and
        </li>
        <li>
           Things That Got In My Way.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've never heard these described as reports.  Usually they are answers to the three questions in the <a href="DailyScrum.html">DailyScrum</a>.  Of course, as time goes on and people get used to the rythym of the meeting, eventually the <a href="ScrumMaster.html">ScrumMaster</a> may stop asking the questions and just look for answers.  I still view these as answers to unasked questions, not reports.  Probably a pretty picky nit to pick.  -- <a href="MichaelIvey.html">MichaelIvey</a>
