        I like The Matrix. But I find it disturbing that it is owned by AOL (see <a href="AmericaOnline.html">AmericaOnline</a>), along with many of my other favorite movies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, you better get used to it now that we have allowed AOL and Time Warner to become the biggest monopoly in the world. I'm flabbergasted that people complain left and right about </em><a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> but allow a merger of the monopoly AOL (90% market share!) and Time Warner - monopoly on cable in many cities in the US, monopoly on TV stations, monopoly on magazines, monopoly on newspapers in many cities in the US.

        <strong>The Matrix.</strong> (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0133093)">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0133093)</a> I just went for the visuals, since I'm an old computer graphics hand. But I found the base plot line tolerable, even interesting, the plot and acting tolerable, and the visuals Extremely well integrated into the movie - not the "let's stop the movie for 10 seconds so everyone can see our computer generation capabilities", but fully woven into the action. So I liked it, and have found a few others with the same experience. -- Alistair

        I, too, liked <em>The Matrix</em>. While it's kind of a dumb plot, it somehow spoke to me, inspired me to get out there and make stuff happen. And the slow-motion bullet-dodging thing is a really good example of how flow feels when you've got it right. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        I found myself folding up into my "thinking really hard during flow" pose during this movie. (I can tell because my feet go to sleep.) My major complaint is that the hero blows away a lot of innocent bystanders at the climax. -- <a href="BetsyHanesPerry.html">BetsyHanesPerry</a>

        Ontheotherhand: Pointless Violence DOES make a film interesting. Think about how boring it would have been with no shooting at all.

        Remember: Every "AI" he killed was also the death of an innocent bystander.

        They were hostages, not bystanders. When you resist an oppressive group like the Matrix's machines, it's quite likely that hostages will die and there's not much you can really do about it. (Unless you can negotiate, which is not a factor in The Matrix.) -- <a href="JoshuaJuran.html">JoshuaJuran</a>

        As for the lobby shootout, I found it very much resembled a video game. Next time you watch the movie, pay attention to that scene, and listen to the music (it reminds me of the Quake II soundtrack). And notice that when Neo and Trinity have cleared the room and finally enter the elevator, the bodies have already vanished. When the elevator blows up, the bullet damage is gone. It's not reality, it's not real, and it's not meant to be. -- jj

        <dd>Interesting idea, but you are wrong about the damage in the lobby. If you watch the scene closely, you will see that there actually is <em>something</em> lying in the back of the hall, what might as well be the dead bodies. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>When the elevator blows up, damages from the prior shooting can be seen too. That they are not as heavy as the ones seen before is explained on IMDb by the fact, that this is the <em>back</em> of the hall, which is less damaged in the prior scene too. The damage still seems to be too little. Search for "hallway" at <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Goofs?0133093">http://us.imdb.com/Goofs?0133093</a></dd>

      <p>
        Also check out the Neo/Morpheus matchup - Mortal Kombat, anyone? -- jj
      </p>
      <p>
        Innocent? Bystanders? Remember the training program (the one with "The Woman in the Red Dress") in which Morpheus explains to Neo "Most of these people are so inured, so hopelessly dependent on the system, that they will fight to defend it." Its not just that the Agents can take over the virtual bodies of real people, but that they lack the outside perspective which would allow them to aid in their own liberation. But no comment is made about trying not to kill innocent bystanders. The guards in the lobby, on the roof top, anyone who isn't currently an agent. And just as in Star Wars, there is no time to show the other side of the coin, the effects of the loss of life. Not even in the case of Cypher's rampage and the death of the crew. Dramatic pacing and all that rot. Mortal Kombat is not such a bad analogy, as this whole movie has the feel of a video game, of an unreality, even without a reset button. Sure, Neo gets to come back from the dead, but only him. The Oracle said that either he or Morpheus would die, and sure enough he did, but it didn't stick. "You rise to fight again." -- <a href="DougPhilips.html">DougPhilips</a>

        The Matrix was filmed in <a href="SydneyCity.html">SydneyCity</a>, even if the street names are from Chicago.
        For Sydney residents, it's an odd feeling to see the place where we live up on the big screen, more so to know we are living in the "pinnacle of human civilization". Also, large areas of central Sydney were buzzed by black helicopters for several weeks while they were filming it. But I liked the Matrix anyway (I've only seen it twice, my wife has seen it three times, and other Sydneysiders four or five times - much better than the Phantom Menace). -- <a href="JamesNoble.html">JamesNoble</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I second that odd feeling. I've been out of Sydney for two years and had no idea that the film was made there. I go along expecting a surreal hollywood special effects extravaganza and <strong>bam!</strong> I'm back home. Weird. Even the interior sets were unmistakably Australian. The film itself was somewhat satisfying - like a poor man's version of "Ubik" - but that one unbearable point in the premise, using humans as power sources, did it a disservice. I think I'll have to see it again to figure out if I actually like it.

        I had a related experience recently watching <a href="KoyAanisQatsi.html">KoyAanisQatsi</a> with a bunch of friends who are American manufacturing engineers. They kept saying things like, "Okay, that's the Carlsbad flower fields", "yeah, that's the San Onofre reactor", and "Wow, that Grand Canyon sure is something". For me and most Australian viewers, these images had been abstract, mysterious, and iconic. For these guys, a lot of the movie was just a travelogue. But the weirdest part was when we got to some of the factory-floor sequences. Huge intimidating spider-like arms blast rivets into skeletal alien automobile chassis in a terrifying firehose of welding sparks and my geek friends say, "cool! You know we could use a rig like that down on the new TRZN line ..." -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        <em>Though it would still have been </em>BadHollywoodScience, a better explanation that wouldn't destroy the plot would be that the <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a>s wanted highly parallel processors, and since humans only use 10% of their brains, they could plug the humans in and get the other 90 -- <a href="DanHankins.html">DanHankins</a><em> </em>

        What about the following explanation: the AIs are programmed to maximize the number of humans that lead a "satisfying" live, where "satisfying" is so defined that the AI cannot simply keep the humans in coma all the time but has to spend resources on all kinds of expensive stuff. So the AI figures out that it can fulfill its mission best (i.e. most humans at given resource limits) by simply hooking all humans up in this VR illusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this setup, the AI would essentially be "benevolent". It would still fight the Resistance, of course, since they use resources inefficiently. -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

        Yes, if they needed energy from a biological source they would have been better off burning the goo they fed to the enslaved humans.
      </p>
      <p>
        ....or use the energy from guinea pig brains; they're used to enslavement anyways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the intelligences of the Matrix themselves are computed in the spare cycles of the sleepers brains? And our "dreams" are bleed-through from the thoughts of those AIs into our own minds? You could have fun with such a concept - when Neo jacked out he might have carried a vital algorithm away locked in his head, the same thing which makes him "the One" being also the key to the entire distributed computer.
      </p>

        What I enjoyed most about The Matrix was how it plays a trick on the audience that watches it. Some of the audience went to see the film for surface reasons. They wanted to see an action film, and that's what they saw. Some wanted to see a special effects film, and that's what they focused on. Others wanted to see violence and gun-play, and that's what they got.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much like Neo waking up to see his life was a surface illusion, the film itself presents an illusion to the audience. If you were told that The Matrix was really a film about <a href="ZenBuddhism.html">ZenBuddhism</a> and related philosophies, would you have gone to see the film? Probably not. So like the illusion the machines created for the humans in The Matrix, the Wachowski brothers create an illusion for you. The machines create their illusion to keep the humans subservient. The Wachoski brothers create their illusion to keep the audience from running away from a film featuring a ton of Eastern philosophy.

        <dd>"The reality of today's software technology is analogous to an intriguing short story in Stephen Gaskin's 'Mind at Play' [Gaskin79]. In the story, people are driving shiny new cars and living comfortable lives. However, there is one man who wants to see the world as it really exists. He approaches an authority figure who can remove all illusions from his perception. Then, when he looks at the world, he sees people walking in the streets pretending to be driving fancy cars. In other words, the luxurious lifestyles were phony. In the end, the man recants, and asks to be returned to his prior state of disillusionment."</dd>

      </p>
      <p>
        The "world-as-illusion" storyline isn't new, and it's not especially Zen-like. If anything, the main thrust of the Matrix (that you can be outside of the system, and need to be outside to control it) is against the main thrust of Zen teachings (as I understand them, anyway). Neo <strong>had</strong> to wake up to become the Chosen One; he couldn't have stayed inside and gained the skills that he did.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While Neo stepped outside to see the way things are, he had to step back in before he could apply it. Somehow, the Matrix defies sterile manipulation from a computer console, even for the AIs. -- </em><a href="LexSpoon.html">LexSpoon</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In so far as the movie has a main thrust, it would be to realize as a movie the comic book ideas that the directors had. As far as <em>need to be outside to control it</em>, not quite. Neo couldn't be outside the system, he had to be immersed in it. He had to question everything, to overthrow the belief in the rules as presented to him. Very Zen, for some values of "Very" and "Zen." You cannot control the system from outside, you can only control it by becoming "one" with it. Neo's being "outside the system" allowed for an easier way to come to that realization, but his awakening to the system had to be from his experiences within the system. -- <a href="DougPhilips.html">DougPhilips</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        "He had to question everything"? Then it's odd that after Neo awoke from his pod, he never once wondered whether what he was experiencing - the reality behind the machine-mediated, mundane illusion - was real. This blasé acceptance of the new situation was the opposite of questioning the nature of reality. This undermined any claim the movie might have to being a film for thinking people. Great flash combined with sixth grade philosophy.

        For Gods sake, guys, it's the ChristMessiahSaviour story for the 21st Century. (Older than time itself.) Hero needs to 'know', finds out info but doesn't believe in himself/his abilities, begins to understand in possibility, begins to believe in self but needs to 'fight', is tested, finally understands transcendence; the only way to overcome is to transform from within with 'love & light'. The next movie will be about how he 'wakes up' the sleeping population. Let he who has eyes see.

        The word <em>matrix</em> was Latin for womb, and is still used in biology and the like for the enclosed space in which things grow. I don't know how it got attached to a rectangular box of numbers, but I'd expect that's not the sense intended here.

Deeper psychological analyses have been found on episodes of <em>Star Trek</em> - indeed, the whole Matrix thingy is derivative of the <em>TNG</em> episode "Ship in a Bottle" (in which Prof. Moriarty, of Sherlock Holmes fame, finds himself re-created in the holodeck and spends the next 45 minutes debating his existence with the Enterprise's officers corps).

        Of course, the Matrix is derivative of just about everything else, too... :)
