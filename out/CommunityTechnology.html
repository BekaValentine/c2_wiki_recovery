      <p>
        Community Technology is a London based charity.
      </p>
      <p>
        We seek to empower people by promoting access to technology.  We provide:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Free/cheap computers to the public
        </li>
        <li>
           IT services for other charities
        </li>
        <li>
           IT training
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Alongside computing we are developing various projects to promote new technologies such as <a href="MolecularNanoTechnology.html">MolecularNanoTechnology</a>, BioStasis, AntiAgingTechniques, <em>etc</em>, and make them accessible to everyone.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can help!  We always need computers, if you or your company are throwing away any, <strong>STOP!</strong>  Contact <a href="StephenElson.html">StephenElson</a> and we can arrange to put them to good use.  BTW - we'd love to take your computers in France, America, Iceland, <em>etc</em>, but the south of England is easier :^)
