        Hey John Doe
      </h1>
      <p>
        Described in <a href="ForFree.html">ForFree</a>, this is an example of a simple notification scheme for people using a Wiki.  Our good friend John Doe would periodically go to the <a href="HeyJohnDoe.html">HeyJohnDoe</a> page, click the title, and see a list of all the pages that have that link.  John Doe can then go to pages he hasn't seen (most browsers track this and show visited links in a different color).
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a simple idea-- maybe something people are already doing here.

        I use this with <a href="AtisWiki.html">AtisWiki</a>.

        <a href="ForFree.html">ForFree</a> describes how simple systems often solve unanticipated problems. Unfortunately, search in this wiki has been optimized such that the <a href="HeyJohnDoe.html">HeyJohnDoe</a> technique won't provide timely notification. Try again tomorrow or use a simpler wiki.
