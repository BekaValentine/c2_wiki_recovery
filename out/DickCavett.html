        Dick Cavett
      </h1>
      <p>
        Erstwhile talk show savant, the likes of which no longer exists in America.  His guests were selected not for their ability to provide an unending hype-stream for their current ventures or their ability to provide an empty but amusing soundbite but instead for their artistic, literary, creative or political merit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alas, these days, Cavett is reduced to doing voiceover work for motel chains and Fortune 100 companies and the occasional Broadway supporting role.
      </p>
      <p>
        His interviews of Dr. Jonathan Miller and Janis Joplin, for example, will both blow your mind.
