        Introduction<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Over the past couple of years, I have watched as interest in Extreme
        Programming (XP) gradually consumed comp.object. In addition to the
        informational and question-answering posts, there has been a flurry of
        zealotry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Zealotry takes many forms. Some posters felt it necessary to go far
        beyond merely advocating/prosoelytizing XP. They chose to directly
        confront not only existing object-oriented technology, but the
        established base of software engineering in general, human psychology,
        and management practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The onslaught has had a very noticeable impact on the traffic in
        comp.object. People attempting to have discussions on non-XP traffic,
        for example, sometimes find their threads taken over by XP issues.
        Others simply refuse to post, lest they get caught up in the fanaitical
        vortex. (I have received several pieces of private e-mail on this
        topic.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There has always been fanaticism and zealotry in comp.object. Booch
        advocates slugging it out with Rumbaugh (OMT) advocates and
        Shlear-Mellor advocates, for example. Language wars were also common,
        e.g., Eiffel, C++, Smalltalk, Java, and Python. Of course, there were
        the nitty-gritty detailed threads on the real definitions/values of
        such things as covariance, polymorphism, and single versus multiple
        inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pre-XP mix of people in comp.object included good numbers of
        university professors, grad students, methodologists, and gurus of all
        denominations. People doing real object-oriented projects, who had an
        immediate need for information, made up a significant portion of the
        posters.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be fair, there are at least 2 other major factors that have colored
        what we see in comp.object:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The Internet itself. Until the early 1990s, the Internet was
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        primarily the domain of people who understood technical matters,<br/>
        and who also had the resources to exploit it. These people<br/>
        included universities, people working on government contracts,<br/>
        large telecommunication companies, and technical consultants<br/>
        for hire, for example.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Nowadays, in the "dot.com world," the Internet is a model of<br/>
        cultural diversity. This diversity is wildly amplified by all the<br/>
        new avenues (and cross avenues) for communication. One no longer<br/>
        has to understand the differences between newsgroups, mailing<br/>
        lists, bulletin boards, and chat rooms. You can tap into just<br/>
        about any on-going conversation, from just about anywhere.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Our enriched discussions make it very clear that we "Internet<br/>
        old-timers" can no longer make the same assumptions about our<br/>
        fellow participants as we once did.<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
           A branch of sociology called "diffusion research," investigates
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        how a new idea (an innovation) moves through a society. Diffusion<br/>
        researchers study how new ideas are communicated, how they change<br/>
        the society, and how the diffusion (communication) changes the<br/>
        new idea itself.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Diffusion researchers identify the phases of an idea's acceptance,<br/>
        and the types of people involved in those phases. For example,<br/>
        the first on the scene are referred to as "innovators," while the<br/>
        last on the scene (if they ever make it) are referred to as<br/>
        "laggards."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        You can get some idea of the phases of an innovation's acceptance<br/>
        by looking at the labels given to the people involved, e.g.,<br/>
        innovators, early adopters, early majority, late majority,<br/>
        late adopters, and laggards.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The innovators for object-oriented technology were involved<br/>
        prior to 1970. The early adopters showed up in the first half<br/>
        of the 1980s. The early majority started showing up in the second<br/>
        half of the 1980s. Somewhere towards the end of the 1990s, the<br/>
        late majority began arriving.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Those people coming late to a technology have a distinctively<br/>
        different outlook than those arriving early.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Different Playing Fields, Different Rules<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In the not-too-distant past, discussions in comp.object were governed
        by certain "rules" (conventions really). For example, it was perfectly
        permissible (and, in many cases, encouraged) to cite literature
        references to back up your point. This process was an interesting cross
        between the scientific method and legal arguments (i.e., using
        precedence to argue the meaning of a point).
      </p>
      <p>
        Real case studies, as well as data and stories from real projects, were
        especially prized.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the more commonly-invoked rules was "some data is better than no
        data." This could be trumped using the "more data is better than less
        data rule." Of course, there were endless discussions involving
        statistical significance, the context of the data, and what one could
        and could not generalize from the information at hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another, very important, rule was that you had to work within the
        confines of nature as defined by other disciplines. For example, we
        have to accept the limitations of the human mind to learn new things.
        We have to understand that not everybody can do everything equally
        well. "Too many cooks" can spoil the "broth" regardless of the context.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also important to realize the value of particular activities,
        tools, and concepts. E.W. Dijkstra and Harlan D. Mills both advised us
        that designing programs correctly was far better than testing and
        debugging a program into correctnes. This lead to another rule: don't
        be sloppy now hoping that your sloppiness will be caught later.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dilbert's boss ("Mr. Twin Peaks") gave us an "anti-rule" (a rule in
        reverse) when he said "Anything that I don't understand has to be
        easy." This told us again that we had to respect existing bodies of
        knowledge and experience. If we were not willing to investigate a
        methodology, or a discipline, for example, we should be very careful in
        our assumptions about that item.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sir Isaac Newton (1642-1727), in a letter to Robert Hooke, reminded us
        that "If I have seen further (than you and Descartes) it is by standing
        on the <a href="ShouldersOfGiants.html">ShouldersOfGiants</a>." This taught us to first investigate what
        is already known or in place, before setting out in a "new" direction.
        Doing this would either give us a "head start," or show us that we did
        not need to reinvent the wheel.
      </p>
      <p>
        The abundant diversity in the object-oriented world also made us aware
        that the "playing fields" were not all the same. For example, depending
        on who your were talking to, a "class" could be a simple template, a
        template plus a creation mechanism, or a set of items constructed using
        a particular template. Some people talked about "classes and
        inheritance," while others sought out "exemplars and delegation." Types
        and classes are the same thing for one group, while being fundamentally
        different for another.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the more interesting and important playing field distinctions,
        with regard to object-oriented software engineering, is that among the
        artificial intelligence sector, the Smalltalk sector, and, for lack of
        a better label, the C++ sector. (Eiffel, Ada, Java, and other
        programming languages are all used by people who could be said to fall
        into this sector.)
      </p>
      <p>
        "Software Engineering" in its most exacting form lives in the C++
        sector. The denizens of this sector typically value metrics,
        methodologies, engineering knowledge and disciplines, technical
        literature, and formalized approaches in general. They strongly tend to
        value science and engineering over "magic." For these people, it is not
        enough to do something well. You have to know that you did it well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lord Kelvin (William Thomson), who lived from 1824 to 1907, speaks for
        the C++ sector when he says
      </p>
      <code>
        "When you can measure what you are speaking about, and express it<br/>
        in numbers, you know something about it; but when you cannot<br/>
        measure it, when you cannot express it in numbers, your knowledge<br/>
        is of a meager and unsatisfactory kind: it may be the beginning of<br/>
        knowledge, but you have scarcely, in your thoughts, advanced to the<br/>
        stage of science."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When he came up with FLEX, Alan Kay was looking for a computer for the
        rest of us, i.e., a computer for non-programmers. He carried this idea
        forward to Dynabook ("Dynamic Book"), and then to Smalltalk. Ideas like
        a simple language syntax and semantics, a graphical user interface, and
        the mouse could all be combined to bring the computer closer to the
        masses.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is no accident that many Smalltalk advocates see little value in
        formalized methodologies, metrics, and other artifacts of the C++
        sector. Since it is so easy to quickly create and modify applications
        why would anyone bother with some rote process? As knowledge of
        object-oriented software engineering became more widespread,
        Smalltalkers were mercilessly harassed by people asking them "what
        methodology to you use?"
      </p>
      <p>
        When Rebecca Wirfs-Brock and her cohorts came up with "responsibility
        driven design" (RDD) in the late 1980s, she provided some relief. Now,
        when asked about one's choice of methodologies, Smalltalkers could (and
        did) say "Wirfs-Brock." Kent Beck, Ward Cunningham, and others
        contributed items such as class-responsibility-collaboration cards to
        the Smalltalk arsenal.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be sure, those in the Smalltalk sector can become very nitty-gritty
        technical when discussing such things as typing, the mathematics of
        inheritance, and reflective systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        The terminology, concepts, and approaches found in the artificially
        intelligence sector differ significantly from those in the other two
        sectors. The Common Lisp Object System (CLOS) boasts full-blown
        metaclasses (classes whose instances themselves are classes), for
        example. The word "class" also takes on a different connotation,
        meaning the set of all instances of a pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        The artificial intelligence sector is more free-form than the Smalltalk
        sector. Progress is usually made in a heuristic (experimentation,
        evaluation, or trial-and-error) manner. Methodologies and metrics are
        remotely important, if at all.
      </p>
      <code>
        The Arrival of the XP Contingent<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Extreme Programming came from the Smalltalk sector. Like RDD ten years
        earlier, it is an approach that comes from the programming language
        level upwards -- as opposed to many methodologies that arise in the C++
        sector which, almost exclusively, work from high-level concepts
        downward. XP is unapologetically code-centric.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than evolving it from a more complex methodology (e.g., the
        Rational Unified Process), Kent Beck took what he knew from his decades
        of software development experience and crafted an approach that would
        greatly amplify what he considered good programming practices. If you
        understand the Smalltalk sector of the object-oriented community, many
        facets of XP will look and sound familiar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent is very concerned with the human element in software development.
        So, there is a huge dollop of people-related issues in XP. Some of
        these people issues are fairly tame. For example, XP advocates keeping
        the number of hours worked to a reasonable level, e.g., 40 hours per
        week.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the XP people issues do not initially make much sense to people
        in from the C++ sector. Specialization of skills to the point of
        creating a new job category is not allowed. There is also a lot of talk
        about intelligence and job descriptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        About the only way I can begin to describe these (to me) very strange
        ideas is this. Somewhere in the past, somebody came by and disparaged
        coders, i.e., people whose primary job function was writing code. In a
        reaction to this abuse, several things happened:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Non-coding activities became trivialized, and were considered
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        less important than coding. So, for example, analysis and design<br/>
        activities that had non-code components pretty much disappeared.<br/>
        The products of these processes were mocked as "pretty pictures."<br/>
        Software testing was something that anyone could learn, and<br/>
        anyone could do well.<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Horror stories, not always untrue, of documentation for
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        documentation's sake became almost a mantra. Another commonly-<br/>
        recited point was that non-code documentation always gets out<br/>
        of date, so there is no sense in producing it (or more than a<br/>
        very small amount of it) at all.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (Apparently, one is not supposed to point out the differences<br/>
        between a bad idea and a bad implementation of a good idea.)<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Many (most?) aspects of one's job description became intelligence
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        issues. Attempting to take away any activity from a programmer<br/>
        was viewed as saying the programmer was not intelligent enough<br/>
        to perform the activity. Issues such as having too many different<br/>
        things to do, lack of demonstrated talent or desire, or mindset<br/>
        conflicts were all ignored.<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Classic software project management became daemonized. Self
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        management (or emergent management) was the new norm.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You could say that very few, if any, restrictions were placed upon
        programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another confusing (to me) situation involves XP advocates using terms
        found in the C++ sector, but with different definitions, and without
        any metrics. For example, there is a lot of talk about "quality."
        However, when asked for definitions or metrics to support the quality
        claims, XP advocates are not very forthcoming.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are other points of contention that I have with XP. However, in
        my discussions, I have become acutely aware that we are playing by two
        very different sets of rules, on two very different playing fields.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is not that my values and my perspectives are right, and XP's are
        wrong. It is just that we are so far apart on the issues that it would
        take forever to get anywhere close, and that is assuming that that is a
        desirable goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        Adopting XP in its current form, goes against most of my training,
        research, and experience. It also conflicts violently with my training
        as a scientist. Further, XP can evolve and improve on its own without
        any "assistance" from Ed Berard. Thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        People like Topmind and Elliot see themselves as crusaders, fighting
        for a cause. While I do crusade, I have no vested interest in, nor
        desire to see, XP go away. In addition, commenting (positively or
        negatively) on XP does not further my career, nor does it put any money
        in my pocket.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent Beck is very right. We are talking across a paradigm gulf.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not interested in any more "XP battles." If you want to say that
        XP is righteous has defeated the evil Ed, be my guest. Now, and in the
        future, I will make every attempt to duck XP questions and any
        references to XP technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will be glad to discuss my views on software engineering in general,
        and on object-oriented software engineering in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let the celebration begin!

        For those who haven't yet read the paper, it covers misconceptions <strong>about</strong> agile advocates ("anti-agile misconceptions") as well as misconceptions <strong>by</strong> agile advocates ("agile zealot misconceptions"). The stated goal of the paper is "not to discredit agile methods, or their advocates. Rather, the goal is to recalibrate the on-going exchange of technical ideas." I read his paper in that light, all 110 pages, and found it thought-provoking. (About half of the paper is references.) YMMV.

      <p>
        <em>Kent Beck is very right. We are talking across a paradigm gulf.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the past year, I have found a lot of presentations and papers by people (even from the <a href="SoftwareEngineeringInstitute.html">SoftwareEngineeringInstitute</a>) looking harder for compatibility than for incompatibility. I don't consider myself an expert on the same level as <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> or <a href="EdwardBerard.html">EdwardBerard</a>; I'll readily admit that I still have a lot to learn and experience, and I definitely expect my opinions on these matters to evolve over time as a result. Right now I'm personally not convinced that the paradigm gulf between agile and everything else is so large as to be unspannable. I visualize the bridge as a spectrum, shades of gray as opposed to black & white. (Or rainbow, like the <a href="CrystalMethodologies.html">CrystalMethodologies</a>?) I'd love to hear others' thoughts on this.

        There's probably a more appropriate [existing?] Wiki page than this for a general discussion of the ParadigmGulf [<a href="ComparingParadigms.html">ComparingParadigms</a>, <a href="ExtremeParadigmShift.html">ExtremeParadigmShift</a>, <a href="MixingParadigms.html">MixingParadigms</a>, <a href="ParadigmShift.html">ParadigmShift</a>, <a href="SoftwareDevelopmentImprovementParadigmShift.html">SoftwareDevelopmentImprovementParadigmShift</a>, <a href="TimeForaParadigmShift.html">TimeForaParadigmShift</a> ?]. Anyone have a recommendation, and/or care to refactor?
