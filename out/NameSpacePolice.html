        Much of the money that pours into <a href="DotCom.html">DotCom</a> companies goes to the creation of brands, primarily by advertising in traditional channels, such as print, radio and television, where advertising rates are skyrocketing. Brands are protected by trademark law and the registration process it prescribes. Trademark holders have an obligation to protect their brands by litigating abuses in the market. This is just one more cost of doing business and is easily within the resources of a properly capitalized internet venture.
