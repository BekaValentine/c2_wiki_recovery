        It's just a tuple-processing collective. Honest.

        A real-world implementation of the <a href="CryptNet.html">CryptNet</a> is the bramble of Mixmaster nodes... but the messages going through Mixmaster are just chit-chat about inconsequential things, honest.

        Those of you who are knowledgeable about conspiracy theories would have immediately seen the parallels between <a href="CryptNet.html">CryptNet</a> and the FreeMasons. To the public, those belonging to <a href="CryptNet.html">CryptNet</a> claimed that there were only 10 levels of rank in their society. However, it was rumoured that there were actually 33 levels of <a href="CryptNet.html">CryptNet</a>. The secretive FreeMason society also has 33 levels that one can ascend to (although they do not hide the fact that there are 33 levels).
