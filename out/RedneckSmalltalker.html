      <p>
        It has been noticed that an inordinate number of Smalltalkers have originated in the rural areas of the US. Among those claiming this are <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>, <a href="JohnBrant.html">JohnBrant</a>, and <a href="DonRoberts.html">DonRoberts</a>.

        Hey, I'm gonna borrow some of these and add them to my "high tech redneck" list here: <a href="http://www.danpierce.net/redneck.php">http://www.danpierce.net/redneck.php</a>

        For the uncultured, what's a "redneck" anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
        The term originally refers to the sunburned neck of someone who works outside all day. It's most common to the southern US, and the term has morphed to mean more about the practices and ideologies of blue collar southern Americans than their particular jobs.

        I used to live in the south (before it occurred to me that I could just leave if I wanted to). I had a job once where I would come in and one of the guys would call me a geek by way of a greeting, I'd call him a redneck and go on to work -- transaction complete: two harsh insults delivered two fine compliments received. Go figure.

        I never set my beer on a floppy, but I <em>have</em> put a wine bottle on a CD. Thoughts, or dare I even ask? <em>America On-Line sends me coasters almost weekly.</em>

        Yes, be very careful: you might be a chardonnay-sipping, public transport-riding, gun-controlling, <a href="LiberalPinkoCommieSmalltalker.html">LiberalPinkoCommieSmalltalker</a>!

        My friend from Texas would always rebuke me for using the word "redneck". He was adamant that the correct term should be: "neck of color".

        <em>* You have firsthand experience with the dangers of multiple inheritance.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, rednecks have a problem with <em>single</em> inheritance, as in "You know you're from Oakhurst when your family tree doesn't branch."
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it is multiple inheritance. The problems come when there are multiple paths from you to the same superclass^Hancestor. ---- <em>So "diamond inheritance" then?</em>

        When I taught a <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> Smalltalk course at IBM in Charlotte, North Carolina, I had the class do an impromptu exercise:  Change the menu item "About to close widget"
        to "Fixin' to close widget".  They loved it!  By the way, you can add me to list of Smalltalkers who came from small towns.  I farmed with my dad in Indiana until I graduated from college. - Allen Benson (I don't have a Wiki page yet.)
