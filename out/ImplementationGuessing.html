        Implementation Guessing
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you are experienced in your field, then it may happen that you can guess (or at least try to guess ) the implementation, i.e. the chosen solution, behind some artifact.
        I call this <a href="ImplementationGuessing.html">ImplementationGuessing</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are a GameDeveloper and see some new computer game. You wonder about the nice looking rain splashes from the characters.  Then you notice that the splashes do not seem to have anything to do with the actual rain drops and realize that particle emitters must just be randomly spawning on up-facing geometry.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are WebDeveloper and use some WebShop and think e.g.: 'It uses Struts/Tapestry/*. I wonder if they have the same problem as we for BackButton/SessionTimeout/*. Yes they did." (Or: "No, BackButton seems to work. It seems they are using Redirects.").
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Often there are only a few direct hints (like URL formatting in the web example) and most cues come from the emergent properties (like dodging obstacles).

        It's related to DiagnosisGuessing like this:

      <ul>
        <li>
           You are a CarMechanic and hear a certain sound in a passing car and think: "His exhaust box is loose. Better he heads toward the car shop."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are a Doctor and see the approaching patient and think: "Oh it seems he has got X. Lets check Y first."
        </li>
      </ul>
