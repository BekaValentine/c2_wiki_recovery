      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="HuntTheWumpus.html">HuntTheWumpus</a> - A strange game many remember fondly. In this precursor to Infocom-like text adventures, your goal is to hunt down and shoot the wumpus in a network of interconnected rooms. The catch is that if you bumble into the room that contains the wumpus, he will eat you. To kill the wumpus, you have to shoot into his room from an adjacent room; when you are 'close' to his room, you receive the message that you can smell him nearby.

For the Atari 8-bit PCs, ran in 8K of RAM; a much less-interesting, lobotomized version was also available for the ubiquitous Atari 2600 game console. Crude by modern standards, but revolutionary in 1980 (about when it came out). The predecessor to Wing Commander and similar games. (If you lost and lost badly, you would be posthumously demoted to "garbage scow captain" or some similar gag rank.)
