        Reduce Code Complexity
      </h1>
      <p>
        Whenever I analyze and design, I look at the lines of code which are so long they need to wrap to the next line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, in an application, code can be simplified (shortened) by reducing the code to essentials. Often, the lengthy lines are the result of many parameters which remain the same in the application or are not needed in the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, the code can be replaced with shorter (sometimes one word) lines. I give as an example the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, some related database navigation commands were reduced to the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        nextRecord()<br/>
        prevRecord()<br/>
        firstRecord()<br/>
        lastRecord()<br/>
        currRecord()<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This helps me in writing the remainder of my database program, including navigation buttons as simple as:
      </p>
      <code>
        Private Sub btnLast_Click(<a href="ByVal.html">ByVal</a> sender As System.Object, <a href="ByVal.html">ByVal</a> e As System.EventArgs) Handles btnLast.Click<br/>
        lastRecord()<br/>
        End Sub<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        the lastRecord() Subroutine:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Private Sub lastRecord()<br/>
        Me.BindingContext(DsCompanies, "Company").Position = Records - 1<br/>
        whatRecord()<br/>
        End Sub<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The remainder of the record navigation commands and buttons are handled in like manner. The whatRecord() is to update a display label which is of the form "Record 23 of 1027". At the time of changing records, all bound controls are also changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one of the ideas in PowerProgramming is to understand and to be understood, such coding conventions enable this.
      </p>
      <p>
        When in the future I come across such code, it will be easy to understand, having been treated to <a href="ReduceCodeComplexity.html">ReduceCodeComplexity</a>.
