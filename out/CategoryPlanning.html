      <p>
        Category Planning consists of pages which identify the specific and particular activities required in the successful conclusion of a project, process or product development. Some believe that such activities are essential and must be employed in the interest of shortening the cycle from the concept to the concrete. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some methods attempt the shortening of preliminary planning in favor of incremental just-in-time activities which  correctly identify what steps and processes are required for the next iteration. Success in such attempts is realized when there is a high level of skill and experience of the participants and their having already experienced success in similar settings and scenarios.
