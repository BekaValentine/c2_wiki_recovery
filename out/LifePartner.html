        More <a href="PoliticallyCorrect.html">PoliticallyCorrect</a> term than <a href="SignificantOther.html">SignificantOther</a> (which could apply to a trained assistant dog).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not so sure that </em><a href="LifePartner.html">LifePartner</a> isn't just as descriptive of a dog<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not to mention that <a href="SignificantOther.html">SignificantOther</a> applies to non-permanent relationships, too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>More politically correct, and even more limply milquetoast.</em>

        When I hear the term "Life Partner", it always brings to mind this joke:
        <em>We're partners for life. Instead of a divorce, I'm just going to kill you</em>
