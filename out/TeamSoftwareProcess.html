        Team Software Process

        <strong>Description:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Team Software Process(SM) or TSP(SM) was developed by <a href="WattsHumphrey.html">WattsHumphrey</a> and the <a href="SoftwareEngineeringInstitute.html">SoftwareEngineeringInstitute</a> (SEI). Its primary purpose is to provide specific guidance to developers trained in the <a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a> so they can work effectively as a high-performance project team. Both 'team-building' and 'team-working' support are provided to projects by an SEI-trained <a href="TspLaunchCoach.html">TspLaunchCoach</a>.

        <strong>Results:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           SEI data indicates that TSP project teams can obtain greatly improved (orders of magnitude) product quality, significantly less time spent in testing after 'code complete', better schedule and effort estimation accuracy, and with equal or better productivity. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Recent presentations at SEPG Conferences indicate that excellent results can be achieved with both low and high maturity organizations (see <a href="CapabilityMaturityModel.html">CapabilityMaturityModel</a>).

        <strong>Relationship to Agile and this Wiki:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           TSP is generally acknowledged to be a <a href="HighDisciplineMethodology.html">HighDisciplineMethodology</a>. A TSP project must have a <a href="TspLaunchCoach.html">TspLaunchCoach</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           TSP's proponents also generally believe it is a <a href="HighToleranceMethodology.html">HighToleranceMethodology</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Many people seem to think that TSP and Agile methods are incompatible, although some believe that they can be blended successfully under certain circumstances. See <a href="AgileAndTspDiscussion.html">AgileAndTspDiscussion</a>. (Doing so would be an example of <a href="MethodologicalPluralism.html">MethodologicalPluralism</a>, yes?)
