        <em>Well, just as </em><a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s add categories, they could add listing of HatColors to the bottom of pages that seem to primarily be the view under one of the hats.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Nope, <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> says using the hat colors as tags is a bad idea. It would be better to call to attention the fact that one or more of the hats is not being used. "There needs to be more <a href="YellowHat.html">YellowHat</a> on this page," for example.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, the more I think about this and see it in action, the more it looks as if tagging what's already there makes it easy to see what is missing, <em>if</em> stuff that goes under the same hat is kept together.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I think the <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> <em>can</em> be used to run Wiki discussions, but the hypertext nature of Wiki makes it too easy for people to skip the hats they don't like, and part of the idea of the <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> is to make everybody spend some time with each hat so that they get good at thinking with all six hats. But then, a hat with nothing under it would be an open invitation to contribute, wouldn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems that it would be pretty simple to split a Wiki page into a section for each hat and invite people to place their contributions under the appropriate hat.
      </p>
      <p>
        The person starting up the page would do the <a href="InitialBlueHat.html">InitialBlueHat</a> by himself. Then he would divide the page into sections, one for each hat in the sequence. So for example if the sequence he chooses uses the <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a> twice, then there will be two <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a> sections on the page. The only way for another person to contribute to the <a href="InitialBlueHat.html">InitialBlueHat</a> would be to refactor the page. The person starting the page might use an <a href="InitialBlueHat.html">InitialBlueHat</a> to introduce readers to the <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> and to justify his choice of hat-sequence, but he could also just leave the <a href="InitialBlueHat.html">InitialBlueHat</a> to be <em>implied</em> by the structure of the rest of the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        People would be encouraged to place their contributions under the appropriate hat and to contribute to all hats.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="FinalBlueHat.html">FinalBlueHat</a> could be used to allow people to comment on the quality of the result. But I think that, rather than stating a conclusion, readers of the page should be allowed to draw their own conclusions. (Would stating a conclusion disallow that? Don't readers draw their own conclusions anyway?)
      </p>
      <p>
        I wonder if it would work. Maybe a good <a href="CollectiveIdea.html">CollectiveIdea</a> will result from this.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, the <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> is supposed to prevent arguments. On the Wiki, arguments start out as <a href="OpEd.html">OpEd</a>s and eventually take the form of <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s. Because the <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> allows contradictory ideas to be laid out in parallel, it gives everybody the chance to express his or her view, while making it more difficult for people to attack each other's views (which only leads to people entrenching their positions and isn't very productive).
      </p>
      <p>
        Writing a <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> page might be a good alternative to an <a href="OpEd.html">OpEd</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe <em>this page</em> should be refactored into an example! (Done!)

        <dd>Can the <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> be combined with <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>?

        <em>On adding hats to the collection of the six thinking hats: (tongue-in-cheek)</em>
        You could consider using all of the hats you have in your collection, The New York Yankee Baseball cap ("Champions at any Cost Hat"), The Cap you got at the last conference or seminar you attended (The "Current Technology Hat"). The Football(American) Helmet you still have from your days as a Collegian, (The "Protect Your Brain Hat"), add any appropriate hat from your collection to be used appropriately or inappropriately. -whatever! 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        There are several wiki pages that have fictional conversations between the hats (using each as a <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>).  I think this is a bad idea, as it forces people to refer to the <a href="SixThinkingHats.html">SixThinkingHats</a> page to figure out what is going on.  The dialogues would make more sense to most readers, and not lose any meaning, if the sides were just labeled <strong>Pro</strong> and <strong>Con</strong>.  --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps the dialogue between </em><a href="GreenHat.html">GreenHat</a> and <a href="BlackHat.html">BlackHat</a> (on <a href="WikiSquatting.html">WikiSquatting</a>) would then be better labeled <strong>What-if</strong> and <strong>Yes-but</strong>, in-lining the appropriate interpretation of the hat roles? -- Or do you think that <a href="GreenHat.html">GreenHat</a> is <strong>Pro-</strong> in that case?  <a href="JeffreyMiller.html">JeffreyMiller</a><em></em>

        An example misuse: <a href="RefactorLowHangingFruit.html">RefactorLowHangingFruit</a>.

      <p>
        <em>Really? Misuse? And there is a </em>better<em> way to use the hats in a discussion? Please clarify, because whoever refactored the arguments on </em><a href="RefactorLowHangingFruit.html">RefactorLowHangingFruit</a> into statements by the hats made a lot more sense than the original thread mess.<em></em>
