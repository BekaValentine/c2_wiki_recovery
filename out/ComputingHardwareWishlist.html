        Not the dumb stuff like more CPU or RAM. Rather, the more esoteric stuff nobody thinks about. So lesse,

           a keyboard that comes in 2 or 3 pieces, that I can arrange at any angle or position I find reasonable
        </li>
        <li>
           a 3D ringmouse for each hand (for those crucial 4th and 5th degrees of freedom)
        </li>
        <li>
           keyboard <em>no wider than your shoulders</em> (essential for a happy upper back. You guys with wider shoulders can't imagine what trouble just about every keyboard causes.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               You're right; I just tried to imagine it and utterly failed. I've never seen that, I don't think.
            </li>
            <li>
               Yep, that's why it belongs on an esoteric wish list. If only...

           I would like to be able to just visualize an object in virtual space and grab it.. or leading up to that I would be ok with an input device that tracks my eye movements and perhaps a blink could launch an object-file-app-whatever when I'm focused on the 3-d icon representing it.  <em>What about simply having the mouse cursor follow your eye movements, and mouse buttons under your thumbs, like the scratch pads on most laptops?.</em> Wouldn't that lead to the mouse cursor always blocking what I'm trying to read?

           <a href="BlueTooth.html">BlueTooth</a> headphones that completely replace wired headphones and are as simple to use - charges on one of those new InductiveMats so you can just plop them down without fiddling with more wires for charging, plays mp3s from all devices (HandHelds, mp3-players, game consoles as well as Phones), stereo somehow (two pieces that clip together for easy transport but detach to put in ears), perhaps the 2nd one smaller.

           full 3-d virtual space projection, hopefully from a projector similar to a nice pair of sunglasses.

        Rugged hot-swappable ram in various/variable granularities?
