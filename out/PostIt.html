        <a href="PostItNotes.html">PostItNotes</a>: TradeName describing a series of [usually] small, light-colored papers that have lightly adhesive strips at the top of the back side.
        Post-It Notes are manufactured by 3M / Scotch and considered to be an office supply staple.
        The Post-It Note, being self-adhesive, requires no tape to hold it to [computer monitors | walls | doors | desks | windows | etc.] but has a so lightly adhesive backing as to be easy to remove without leaving a residue, thereby leaving all the adhesive on the paper, and thus making the Note somewhat reusable.
