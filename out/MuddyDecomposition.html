        I've been playing with the following and would really appreciate some input. Please let me know if this is covered elsewhere.

        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Many real systems are difficult to decompose or reduce.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        After producing an initial model for a system, numerous special cases or exceptions must be incorporated to fully describe the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A clean decomposition of a system is easier to understand and explain.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is often assumed there should be a simple or clear solution for all problems.
        </li>
        <li>
           Finding a pattern that models a system may be difficult ot find or not exist.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Choose a model with few special cases.
        </li>
        <li>
           Visually or textually partition the special cases so that the overall model is easily visible.
        </li>
        <li>
           Possibly provide only a link to the special case (e.g. raising an exception with the exception handlers at the end of the section of code, extend relationships in use cases)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        <general case><br/>
        ...<br/>
        if this is a special case, perform a single atomic operation<br/>
        <general case><br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Also, make sure every special case is motivated by a real and immediate need. If you think you ought to include a special case because you might need it, think instead that <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The overall model for the system is visible and necessary special cases are handled discretely.

        It is interesting and I look forward to trying it.  I put in a request that you continue so that <a href="ResultingContextNamesProblems.html">ResultingContextNamesProblems</a>.  If it only says "problem solved", you don't need a section for it.  On the other hand, if you say the next problems a person might encounter, you will do the reader a favor. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        <em></em><a href="ResultingContextNamesProblems.html">ResultingContextNamesProblems</a> sounds good, but I'm not ready for this yet. I'm not even such I've (clearly) applied the solution yet. More it's a recognition of a family of problems I'm struggling with and brainstorming on solutions. --<a href="WayneCarson.html">WayneCarson</a><em></em>

        One common result is that by factoring out the special cases neatly, you can find the commonality in them.  Part of the value of <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>, to which this seems to me to relate, is in illuminating what <strong>isn't</strong> done. --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
