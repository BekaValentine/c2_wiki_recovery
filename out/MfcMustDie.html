        Maybe MFC must die. I haven't enjoyed the pleasure, or suffered the pain, of working with it for about four years. But maybe it is wise to consider what MFC's legacy will be. Are "FoundationClasses" in general a worthwhile idea ?

        <em>You can't be implying that MFC had anything to do with the idea of foundation classes? There were many foundation and framework libraries around for years before MFC. I guess you could say that MFC succeeded despite itself because the idea of foundation classes has always been a good one.</em>

        Hmm... "MFC Must Die" sounds too much like MojoNixon's "Don Henley Must Die".
        Maybe something more hardcore, like "KMFMFC"....
