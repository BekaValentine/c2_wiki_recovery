        I am a freelance software developer, using mostly <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a>, with a bit of Java here and there. I also dabble in various aspects of <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>. (I've even implemented <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> in a parser written in <a href="DelphiLanguage.html">DelphiLanguage</a>--I was amazed at how much it simplified the task of parsing.) I serve as Chief Technology Officer for Fenestra Technologies Corporation (<a href="http://www.fenestra.com/),">http://www.fenestra.com/),</a> a software development firm located just outside the beltway in Germantown, Maryland, USA.

        I recently moved to Ohio (<a href="http://www.state.oh.us/),">http://www.state.oh.us/),</a> after living in Oklahoma (<a href="http://www.state.oh.us/)">http://www.state.oh.us/)</a> for eleven years.

        I used to be a physics professor at Oklahoma State University (<a href="http://www.okstate.edu/),">http://www.okstate.edu/),</a> but I eventually decided that the academic life was not for me. I now work at home. This gives me the decided advantage of not having to wear clothes while I work. This is especially beneficial during the summer. While I work at home, I sit in an <a href="AeronChair.html">AeronChair</a>.

        I am interested in all aspects of software development, from methodologies (e.g., <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>) to <a href="SoftwareConfigurationManagement.html">SoftwareConfigurationManagement</a> to <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>s. I still haven't found the time to sit down and learn Smalltalk.

        My wife is a professor at Ohio University (<a href="http://www.ohio.edu/),">http://www.ohio.edu/),</a> where she studies nervous system development and physiology in <em>Caenorhabditis elegans</em> (<a href="http://elegans.swmed.edu/),">http://elegans.swmed.edu/),</a> a common nematode that lives in the soil. It's used as a model organism to study basic physiological processes that are too complicated to study in more complex organisms.

        When we're not working (which doesn't add up to much), we're usually birding (<a href="http://www.americanbirding.org/).">http://www.americanbirding.org/).</a>
