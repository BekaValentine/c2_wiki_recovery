        <a href="PoliticallyIncorrect.html">PoliticallyIncorrect</a> is a cool talk show hosted by BillMaher.  Each evening they have 4 guests and discuss some current event or philosophy.  Unfortunately, it is late at night, so I seldom watch more than a few minutes of it.

        <em>Considering that they've got four guests on at once, they really should get a host that doesn't like to talk as much as </em>BillMaher does.<em></em>
