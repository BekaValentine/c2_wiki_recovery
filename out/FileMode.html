        As opposed to <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> and <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> pages (see also <a href="WikiModes.html">WikiModes</a>):

      <p>
        <a href="FileMode.html">FileMode</a> pages are usually created through the misguided efforts of inexperienced wiki refactorers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FileMode.html">FileMode</a> pages present a shapeless clump of vaguely related information adhering to no distinction and conveying no consensus. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FileMode.html">FileMode</a> pages often conceal gems that once were pages in their own right, but it takes a patient and determined reader to discover these now. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FileMode.html">FileMode</a> is strongly discouraged on <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> - refactorers take heed.
      </p>
      <p>
        When you see a page in <a href="FileMode.html">FileMode</a> it is usually better to fix it and not waste time making yet another <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a> for it. <a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a>.

        The above describes what's wrong with <a href="FileMode.html">FileMode</a>, and how it comes about---but it doesn't really describe what it is.  I've read this page from top to bottom and I still can't figure out just what makes a <a href="FileMode.html">FileMode</a> page a <a href="FileMode.html">FileMode</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any examples here on Wiki?

        Hopefully not, but you might consider <a href="WikiWikiSandBox.html">WikiWikiSandBox</a> an example (though it really is AppendMode).
