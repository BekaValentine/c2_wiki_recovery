        I work for a research organization called the "National Research Council of Canada". This is a big organization with something like 20 institutes focussed on different research domains. My group does applied Artificial Intelligence work mostly applied to industrial decision support.

        So, why would I decide to attend XPimmersion2 ? The short answer is that we are finding ourselves building larger systems these days and our current practies are inadequate. XP looks to be a reasonably good fit to our needs for various reasons (technical risk, instability in the requirements, project size...).

        I'm going to be running a new project which starts in April (concerning monitoring, diagnosis, and maintenance scheduling of a fleet of trucks) and plan on adopting XP as the development methodology. Well see how things go.
