        Java Text File Performance
      </h1>
      <p>
        Please tell me what I've done wrong, because I think I've measured Java as being 7.2 times slower than Smalltalk on the same platform reading the same file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        The file is an ascii text file containing 347,847 lines and totalling 8,101,370 bytes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The task of each program (Java and Smalltalk) is to read the file a line at a time and answer an array of 347,847 strings, each containing one record from the file.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Java is <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a>, the Smalltalk is <a href="VisualAgeSmalltalk.html">VisualAgeSmalltalk</a>. The platform is a 256MB NT machine with reasonable performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the java (add the necessary declarations yourself):
      </p>
      <code>
        String[]          answer = null;<br/>
        String            aString = null;<br/>
        BufferedReader    aReader = null;<br/>
        Vector            aVector = null;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        try {<br/>
        aVector = new Vector();<br/>
        aReader = new BufferedReader(new FileReader("g:/gecko/input/stub.CEL"));<br/>
        while ((aString = aReader.readLine()) != null)<br/>
        {<br/>
        aVector.add(aString);<br/>
        }<br/>
        aReader.close();<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        answer = (String[])aVector.toArray(new String[0]);<br/>
        }<br/>
        catch (IOException e) {<br/>
        e.printStackTrace();<br/>
        }<br/>
        return answer;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here's the analogous Smalltalk:
      </p>
      <code>
        | aFileStream aLine outStream answer |<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        aFileStream := CfsReadFileStream open: 'g:/gecko/input/stub.CEL'.<br/>
        outStream := ReadWriteStream on: Array new.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        [aFileStream atEnd not] whileTrue: [<br/>
        aLine := aFileStream nextLine.<br/>
        outStream nextPut: aLine.<br/>
        ].<br/>
        aFileStream close.<br/>
        answer := outStream contents.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The measured time, in Java, is 132.580 seconds ... about 2 minutes, 12 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        The measured time, in Smalltalk, is 18.3 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        It looks to me like the Smalltalk is more than 7 times faster.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should I read the file a different way in Java? Am I doing something blindingly stupid (besides contemplating Java for this task)?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I just re-ran the java, skipping the part that added each string to the vector, and got 12.5 seconds. Wow!</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Is <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> really meant to be used to run code in production? I got the impression that you were supposed to deploy your application in another JVM? If this is true you might get better performance still.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, try another collection than java.util.Vector. It needlessly synchronizes every operation on it.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This is a factor SEVEN we're talking about. I would be astonished if there was a difference of even a factor of two from the choice of VM's or collection classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did some further investigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tried using ArrayList to store the strings read from the file, and I also tried simply writing them into a pre-allocated array. The choice of collection classes appeared to produce no significant difference in performance. It would seem that the bottleneck is the string allocation time; when saved, each pass through the loop requires additional string storage.
      </p>
      <p>
        For simply reading the file (and discarding the output), here were the results:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="VisualAgeSmalltalk.html">VisualAgeSmalltalk</a>:  1.7 Seconds<br/>
        <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a>:      12.5 Seconds<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Again, about a factor of 7.
      </p>
      <p>
        So there are now TWO data points: (1) simply reading the text file and (2) reading the text file into an array of strings. For each, <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> was SEVEN times slower than <a href="VisualAgeSmalltalk.html">VisualAgeSmalltalk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, for what its worth, a co-worker did a similar exercise in Perl and measured 80 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        So ... it would appear that Java is the SLOWEST, by far, Perl was next, and Smalltalk was fastest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>12.5 seconds is slower than 80 seconds? In what parallel dimension would this be the case?!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Comments?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Try using an ArrayList instead of a Vector. In certain tests we did, ArrayLists performed consistently better (i.e. faster) for inserts than <em>any</em> other Collection.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A suggestion - run <a href="OptimizeIt.html">OptimizeIt</a> on the test program. See what it identifies as the bottlenecks. Optionally, report back with your results. ;)

        Storing the Strings is taking you about 120 seconds, or about 3 stores per millisecond.  This seemed awful to me, so I wrote this code to try it for myself:
      </p>
      <code>
        import java.util.*;<br/>
        import java.io.*;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public class TimeVector<br/>
        {<br/>
        public static void main(String args[])<br/>
        {<br/>
        String[]          answer = null;<br/>
        Vector            aVector = null;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        try {<br/>
        long timer = System.currentTimeMillis();<br/>
        int i = 347847; //347847;<br/>
        aVector = new Vector();<br/>
        while (i-- > 0)<br/>
        {<br/>
        aVector.add(""+i);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        answer = (String[])aVector.toArray(new String[0]);<br/>
        System.out.println(System.currentTimeMillis() - timer);<br/>
        }<br/>
        catch (Exception e) {<br/>
        e.printStackTrace();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I ran it under JDK 1.3 on my brother's machine (I was trying to get as close to your setup as possible):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Compaq Presario 7470
        </li>
        <li>
           60 MB
        </li>
        <li>
           AMD K-6 processor
        </li>
        <li>
           Windows98
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Unfortunately for comparisons, all of these are probably different than what you've got.  At any rate, I got the following numbers:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          , 6590, 6590, 7470 -- for an average of 6.825 seconds, or about 17 times as fast as the roughly equivalent code in your setup.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Under adverse memory conditions, it takes more like 20 seconds (6x).
      </p>
      <p>
        I know this doesn't speak to the original I/O question, but
        it does seem like times tend to vary a great deal.  Does <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>
        use the 1.3 <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a> VM?  That could be a lot of it.  It would also
        be somewhat informative if you could run the above code on your
        setup and report back with the results.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another possibility is that you're falling off a <a href="MemoryCliff.html">MemoryCliff</a>: Java Strings take up about twice the space as ASCII strings.  What kind of numbers do you get with a half-size version of the original problem?  --<a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>

        Check the vm options.  Make sure the jit is turned on.  My seat-of-the-pants tests with the IBM JDK 1.3 Classic VM (build 1.3.0, J2RE 1.3.0 IBM build cx130-20001124 (JIT enabled: jitc)) and Sun's 1.3 Java <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a>(TM) Client VM (build 1.3.0_02, mixed mode) showed that turning off the jit made the code seven and three times slower, respectively, on a Debian Linux 2.4.2 kernel/libc 2.1.3 running on an AMD 1.1Ghz Athlon w/512MB.  Times with the IBM jvm were around .8 seconds with a 10,989,663 byte, 6,6054 line file and about 1.5 secoonds with the Sun jvm with the jit on.  Changing Vector to ArrayList didn't make much of a difference.  I could get it down to around .66 seconds by increasing the heap size.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's a slightly more closely matching test:
      </p>
      <code>
        C:\tmp>c:\jdk1.3.0_02\bin\java -classic TextFileTest<br/>
        Vector time (secs): 27.299<br/>
        ArrayList time (secs): 25.257<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        C:\tmp>c:\IBMJDK13\bin\java -Xmx256m -Xms256m TextFileTest<br/>
        Vector time (secs): 0.761<br/>
        ArrayList time (secs): 0.711<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Wow! A difference of a factor of <em>38</em>.  File here was 11,953,623 bytes, 109323 lines.  Machine Pentium III 733Mhz, 256MB, Windows NT4 workstation.

        Yeah, we did some comparisons here. My <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> runs Java1.2 -- 148 seconds, give or take. We ran the same code on the Sun SDK 1.3 VM, and measured 7 seconds. With some switch finagling, we got 2.3 seconds for the same code.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we ran under the old SDK version 1.2.2, we pulled an out-of-memory exception. So it seems that something in the 1.2 environment does, in fact, create a <a href="MemoryCliff.html">MemoryCliff</a>, that <a href="VisualAgeJava.html">VisualAgeJava</a> manages to recover from (at great cost in performance), that the 1.2.2 VM simply crashes and burns on, and that the 1.3 VM avoids altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Wow" is right!
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The <a href="ComputerLanguageBenchmarksGame.html">ComputerLanguageBenchmarksGame</a> seems to suggest a similar result.

        I fiddled some more with my (non-text-file) code, and discovered something predictable, then something surprising.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I upped the size of each String I added to the Vector.  This made me hit a <a href="MemoryCliff.html">MemoryCliff</a>: it went from taking around 7 seconds to around 140 seconds, with only about a 10% change in problem size.  Upping the initial heap size for the JVM (to 12 MB) took care of this cliff.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when I upped the initial heap size some more (to 20 MB), my performance worsened -- back to around 140 seconds again.  The best explanation I can think of is that 20 MB of heap, plus whatever the JVM uses itself, plus the OS, plus whatever other apps I had running (Xemacs, the browser), is greater than 60 MB, and therefore my nice big heap is getting paged in and out of memory.  In fact, I could hear the disk whirring away.
      </p>
      <p>
        What kind of puzzles me is that I could hear the disk whirring away when I had set the initial heap size to be too <em>small</em>, as well.  Am I missing something in the gradually accreted complexity of a JVM on top of an OS with VM on top of MS-DOS? --<a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a>
