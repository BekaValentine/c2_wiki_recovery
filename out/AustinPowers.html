        What can I say? 
        Great if you like Mike Myers - intolerable if you don't.
        I didn't stop laughing all the way through.

        I must be perverse. I loved the original, but I think the sequel is one of those <a href="MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts.html">MoviesToAvoidAtAllCosts</a>. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        Agree. I loved the first one, but thought the second sucked. The potty "humor" just doesn't do it for me. Also, ElizabethHurley (who stays within her acting ability limitations) <strong>crushes</strong> the performance of HeatherGraham (who has no discernible acting talent whatsoever). -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        The original is a wonderful spoof of spy movies; the sequel is an ungodly train wreck of a film.

        Two comments I've heard that I enjoyed: "It's not clear whether Phantom Menace will earn more money at the box office than Titanic did, but it is certain that Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me will out-gross all other movies this 
        year"; and, "It's not so much 'more of the same' as just 'the same'."

        Actually, less of the same. Just btw, the admittedly brilliant original was still derivative on other spoofs; note the <a href="PeterSellers.html">PeterSellers</a> portions of the late-sixties James Bond spoof, "Casino Royale", especially the rotating-bed geek-glasses ruffled-shirt pelvic-thrusting scene with Sellers and Ursula Andress. <em>Worth noting too that "Casino Royale" is a really dreadful film; there's only one perfect spy spoof, and that's </em><a href="OurManFlint.html">OurManFlint</a>.<em></em>
