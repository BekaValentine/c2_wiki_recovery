        I am currently studying a Masters of Learning Innovation at QUT (Brisbane, Australia), and as part of my Cyberlearning unit, we are preparing a presentation for fellow colleagues of ‘Learners in Cyberspace’. This presentation is on a free access website, and I would like to use the following link as part of the presentation.

        <strong>Q:</strong> Hi - I'm a student at Northwestern University and I'm writing a research paper about wiki communities. I don't know very much about these intriguing phenomena and I'm hoping that there's someone out there who could give me some insight. Please, please, please email me at j-lissner@Northwestern.edu. I would love to learn more about this interesting virtual community. Thank you and please email me at j-lissner@northwestern.edu.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Start by reading all the introductory pages on this wiki, and then you can ask more specific questions.
      </p>

        <strong>Q:</strong> I am a student of Informatic, from Brazil. I am studying about wiki now. I don't understand many things. I checked wikipedia, smesh, sourceforge,... I don't understand if I need to install something in my computer to use wiki? If I have to pay for a server? How to start a wiki page? Please, help me!! My email: nochalant@ig.com.br

           To <em>use</em> a particular wiki, you don't need to install anything -- just a normal web browser on your computer. Free.
        </li>
        <li>
           To set up your own wiki on one of the free <a href="WikiFarms.html">WikiFarms</a>, and use it, you don't need to install anything -- just a normal web browser on your computer. Many are free. A few have a monthly fee.
        </li>
        <li>
           To set up a customized wiki -- you need to install a <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> on your web server. You can use free software to turn your computer into a <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a>, but (apparently) most people pay for a server (?). See <a href="RunningYourOwnWikiFaq.html">RunningYourOwnWikiFaq</a>.

        By the way, somehow your edit added a lot of garbage binary characters to this page, throughout, from top to bottom. See if you can fix that next time (I repaired the damage just now).

        <strong>Q:</strong> Hi - I am also a Student and I am doing a thesis partly about wikis. In my opinion, The best free info about wikis is found on wikis themselves such as this one. But how am I supposed to give references to the material I have used from <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> when it might constantly change? If one of my teachers looks up a quote or a section I have paraphrased from one of your <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s, that information may not be the same or it may have been removed altogether when they visit the link to verify the existence of the information I have given in my reference. Then I would get in trouble. To fix this problem then, is there any chance that I would be allowed to indirectly claim the information found here as my own by not giving any references as to where I found it at all? Can you tell me what the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>'s policies are on this? I appreciate any advice. mike. mikeforbes@hotmail.com
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Your thesis should state that pages here can be changed at any time. Give the url of the page, together with the last updated date. It is then very unlikely you will be penalized.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A2:</strong> You might also consider linking to a "old" version of the page (which will not change). Other wiki have a "history" of every version of the page. This C2 wiki does not, but you can get the same affect by giving a link to something like <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20040514090820/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHelpDesk">http://web.archive.org/web/20040514090820/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHelpDesk</a> . -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a> 2005-05-06
      </p>
      <p>
        (Later) Ah, I learned something new. This C2 wiki *does* keep <a href="HistoryPages.html">HistoryPages</a>. -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a> 2005-06-27
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the <a href="HistoryPages.html">HistoryPages</a> on this C2 wiki are only kept for a few days -- so it wouldn't help you. Sorry. But web.archive.org should still work for you. -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a> 2005-07-05

        <strong>Q:</strong> I'm not formally a student, but I do have a tech question for <strong>Java</strong> experts, of which I am not. What are some recommended ways to use Java to build a <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> database, or at least a <a href="MultiParadigmDatabase.html">MultiParadigmDatabase</a>? It doesn't have to be high-end, or even ACID, at this point. But index-ability of columns is a must. Thanks. --top
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Download the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>, modify to suit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rel is based on the Berkeley DB, from what I gather. Do you have any experience with Berkeley DB, and if so, why do you think it would be well-suited for a dynamic DB engine (as opposed to the common "static" form)?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm assuming that by "based on", you mean Rel is an extension of the Berkeley DB.  It isn't -- it's a full-fledged multiuser DBMS with associated programming and query language, which the Berkeley DB is not.  However, Rel does use the Berkeley DB as part of its storage engine.  The Berkeley DB simply provides persistent, transactional, high-performance maps.  These can be used as a building block for the storage engine of any kind of DBMS, whether "dynamic" or "static".</em>
