        When To Adda Category
      </h1>
      <p>
        Does anyone want to look up all the pages about nothing? If not then there is no need for CategoryNothing. Is there a need for CategoryLiterature if there is already a <a href="CategoryBooks.html">CategoryBooks</a>? How can you tell? How do you know when a new category is needed, when an old one will do, when none is needed or which pages should go into which category?
      </p>
      <p>
        Who uses categories? What are the stories? Will adding a category or adding a page to a category be helpful? Ask the user. The relevance of categories is based on the needs of the users of the categories. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is the "user" of a category someone that uses the content, or someone that uses the categorized structure, (or neither/both)? A: Someone using the structure.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The simplest thing to do is not to add a category unless you've actually wanted to look something up in that category. By extension it makes sense to add a page to a category, not simply because they seem to belong there, but because you, personally, have found it to be interesting and you'd like to be able to find it again. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you have the experience of being the user of categories in hand you will have all the knowledge and justification you need to make modifications to the categorization scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an excellent idea. The purpose of <a href="WikiCategories.html">WikiCategories</a> is to simplify the search for pages having a common theme. It is important to have a reasonable number of pages, probably between 5 and 500. Do not create categories that do not have at least the minimum number of members. If a category approaches the upper limit it is probably time to subdivide.

        TenExemplarsAndYouCategorize Please don't add a new category unless you can find ten other pages that would fall into that category.

        I believe that categorization is an entire branch of LibraryAndInformationScience. Before you add a category to a page, please put yourself in the place of a librarian. Think about whether the category is appropriate to the item and general enough to help others find related items. One notion we should think about is that of a "controlled vocabulary". The <a href="LibraryOfCongress.html">LibraryOfCongress</a> has a strict set of words that can be used for categorization. Limiting the possible search terms keeps one's search options manageable.

        <em>To help think like a librarian, consider this quote from </em><a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>:<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        S. R. Ranganathan, considered by librarians all over the world to be the father of library science, proposed five laws of library science. Most librarians accept them as the foundations of their philosophy:
      </p>
      <p>
        These laws are (<em>replacing "page" for "book", "wiki" for "library"</em>):
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Pages are for use.
        </li>
        <li>
           Every reader his or her page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Every page its reader.
        </li>
        <li>
           Save the time of the reader.
        </li>
        <li>
           The Wiki is a growing organism.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These laws may seem simplistic, but they are not so! They express a simple, crystal-clear vision of what librarianship ought to be. Nowadays, these laws are being mapped and reinterpreted for the digital age.
