        Community Solution

        <em>Healthy communities can solve problems very effectively. Social conventions and unwritten rules can be more effective than enforced policy.</em>

        Here's my recent take on community solutions. Essentially, the more tighter knit a community, the more it relies on community solutions. However, the more impartial people are towards others, the more technical or legal the solutions become--relying on the "system" to manage the faceless crowd. These are correlations, not implications. I think these are part of the reason why Community May Not Scale:

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>When a group grows from dozens of individuals to thousands, it becomes impossible to feel any real acquaintance with more than a fraction of the population. When this happens, community standards and unwritten rules stop working.</em> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The group loses focus. Things fall apart. There seems to be a limit to how many people one person can really know. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
