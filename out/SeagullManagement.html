        Seagull Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        A manager who comes in, makes a lot of noise, flaps about, eats all the sandwiches and flies out, leaving s**t everywhere.

        <em>I read about a consultant who actually used the title "Corporate Seagull" on his business card.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's incredible. That's actually as Dilbertesque as when RatBert, while consulting, demonstrated he could earn $70 by wiggling his furry behind for five minutes. <em>(Please: reference? Explanation?)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>He explained that he had described what he did for a living when someone said "So you are a corporate seagull?". I don't think he got the joke, but he liked the expression...</em>
