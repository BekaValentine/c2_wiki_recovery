        Hi I'm an Architect turned Developer (through the CADD door).
        I spent my formative years (late 1970's) working with Pattern 
        Languages in Architecture so it was a natural for me when 
        I discovered its was being applied to systems development
        to say I'm excited is an understatement! My fellow
        developers are very tired of hearing about Eli Whitney, Alexander
        and other reusers of merit! I would very much like hearing from
        you! 
      </p>
