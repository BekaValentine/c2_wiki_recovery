        Images Of Organization, ISBN 0761906347 
        is a book by Gareth Morgan that presents different metaphors of organizations and discusses the differences in strengths and 
        weaknesses in each metaphor. Organizations can be imagined as machines, as families, as brains, as military units, and many others.  In some respects, this is a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> of organizations.  It is also a very well-written 
        and thought-provoking book in organizational theory with many references for
        further reading and thought. -- RachelSilber
