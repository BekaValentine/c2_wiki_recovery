        Capability Designator
      </h1>
      <p>
        A data value used to specify a capability (also called a "capability descriptor"). For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           in a <a href="CapabilityList.html">CapabilityList</a> system, a c-list index is a designator
        </li>
        <li>
           in an <a href="ObjectCapabilityLanguage.html">ObjectCapabilityLanguage</a>, variable identifiers are used as designators
        </li>
        <li>
           in the <a href="PasswordCapabilityModel.html">PasswordCapabilityModel</a> there is no distinction between a capability and its designator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The "scope" of a designator determines the context in which it can be used. For example, the scope of a c-list index is normally a single ProtectionDomain, and the scope of a variable identifier is normally specified by a program's block structure (<a href="LexicalScoping.html">LexicalScoping</a>). In <a href="DistributedObjectCapabilityModel.html">DistributedObjectCapabilityModel</a> protocols, the scope of designators may (or may not) be restricted to a particular connection.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some capability researchers consider there to be security benefits in restricting the scope of designators, in order to limit the extent of compromise if a capability designator is 'stolen' due to some implementation flaw -- especially in the case where designators are transmitted over a network (even if encrypted). Others argue that it is better to concentrate on preventing such implementation flaws, and that using designators with global scope can make protocols simpler.
