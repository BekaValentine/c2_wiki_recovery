        Visual Modeling
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="VisualModeling.html">VisualModeling</a> is a way of building models of systems using an abstract, graphical representation. Not limited to modeling software, <a href="VisualModeling.html">VisualModeling</a> is also extensively used for <a href="BusinessModeling.html">BusinessModeling</a>, OrganizationalPlanning and many other non-software domains. Currently, the most popular modeling language is the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a>, a standardised notation that allows the visual descriptions of systems using an object oriented paradigm. <a href="VisualModeling.html">VisualModeling</a> is almost always not sufficient to describe the entire system being modeled and usually a great deal of work is necessary to actually construct the system being modeled. This is contrasted with <a href="VisualProgramming.html">VisualProgramming</a> (or <a href="GraphicalProgrammingLanguage.html">GraphicalProgrammingLanguage</a>s?), for which the visual model has a 1-to-1 mapping with the code generated, but is generally regarded as lower level and less abstract than <a href="VisualModeling.html">VisualModeling</a>.

        With recent additions to the UML, such as the <a href="ObjectConstraintLanguage.html">ObjectConstraintLanguage</a> and changes to the Activity Diagrams and other features, the gap appears to be closing between <a href="VisualModeling.html">VisualModeling</a> and <a href="GraphicalProgrammingLanguage.html">GraphicalProgrammingLanguage</a>s. Also recently entering the scene is a hybrid between the two, known as Instantaneous Round Trip Engineering, that allows models and code to be maintained in sync in real-time. It remains to be seen which method will ultimately provide the best solution. -- <a href="DionHinchcliffe.html">DionHinchcliffe</a>
