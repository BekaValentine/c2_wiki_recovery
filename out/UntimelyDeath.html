        Describe <a href="UntimelyDeath.html">UntimelyDeath</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Death before its time. It is a paradox. I have thought about this and not found anything better to say than "every death is timely when you think about it."
      </p>
      <p>
        But death is a sensitive subject and a real happening in peoples' lives so be careful what you say about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And even more so when you publish in some more eternal medium.
