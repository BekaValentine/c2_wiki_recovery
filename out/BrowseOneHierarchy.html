        Browse One Hierarchy
      </h1>
      <p>
        A browser maintains a position within a hierarchy and
        moves that position by handling picks on lists of 
        choices.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore:</em>  Be clear about what hierarchy is being
        navigated. Avoid the temptation to navigate more than
        one hierarchy or to maintain more than one position in
        a single hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use <a href="LeftSelectsRight.html">LeftSelectsRight</a> to visualize the path taken to
        a specific point in the hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        The browser is not a good model for operations that
        take place between two hierarchies or two points within
        a single hierarchy.  <a href="CutAndPaste.html">CutAndPaste</a> or <a href="DragAndDrop.html">DragAndDrop</a> between
        two independent browsers provides a better model for 
        organizational operations like <em>move</em>.

        On the other hand, a control that allows the browser to switch 
        to another hierarchy, discarding information about the current
        hierarchy, still fits the pattern and can be useful in some
        circumstances.    I built a Cross Reference Cards browser that
        handled a stack of cards with links.  Only one stack could be
        browsed at a time, but one could switch to a different stack.
