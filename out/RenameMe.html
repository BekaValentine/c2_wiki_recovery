        A <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a> for suggesting that the current page title be improved. <a href="ChoosingWikiNames.html">ChoosingWikiNames</a> is an art.

      <p>
        There are several reasons a page title may not represent the subject or content of a page:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The page has a subject that is too wide, and the presentation may be about a specific subset of the title.
        </li>
        <li>
           The page may start off with a statement in agreement of the page title and then move to a topic which diverges from or is contrasting with it. The divergence may be due to the employment of <a href="ConversationalChaff.html">ConversationalChaff</a>, or failure on the part of the participants to "stick to the subject".
        </li>
        <li>
           Certain of the discussion and trend of the page moves to a more interesting sub-topic which should probably be inserted under a page title of its own. (But this is more a job for <a href="RefactorMe.html">RefactorMe</a>.)
        </li>
        <li>
           The material in the page is generally consistent and holds to a subject but it is not the page title. It is a candidate for Moving of the page material in total to another properly named page and deleting the misnomer page.
        </li>
        <li>
           The page title is confusing, relying on obscure idioms or cultural references.
        </li>
        <li>
           The page title does not scan well. A goal is for <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s to form phrases that would naturally occur in sentences to promote <a href="AccidentalLinking.html">AccidentalLinking</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
