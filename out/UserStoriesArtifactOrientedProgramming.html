                   <em>.. first observation is that computation can be seen as a limited form of deduction because it establishes theorems. For example, 15 + 26 = 41 is both the result of a computation, and a theorem of arithmetic. Conversely, deduction can be considered a form of computation if we fix a strategy for proof search, removing the guesswork (and the possibility of employing ingenuity) from the deductive process. This latter idea is the foundation of logic programming. Logic program computation proceeds by proof search according to a fixed strategy. By knowing what this strategy is, we can implement particular algorithms in logic, and execute the algorithms by proof search.</em>

                   <em>Applications that communicate through a publish and subscribe paradigm require the sending applications (publishers) to publish messages without explicitly specifying recipients or having knowledge of intended recipients. Similarly, receiving applications (subscribers) must receive only those messages that the subscriber has registered an interest in. This decoupling between senders and recipients is usually accomplished by an intervening entity between the publisher and the subscriber, which serves as a level of indirection. This intervening entity is a queue that represents a subject or channel.</em>

        Thank you for your kind response. It is because I am fond of the idea of <a href="PositiveDialogue.html">PositiveDialogue</a> and is my way of showing how honest questions and concerns should be handled. It is also because there is far more that I do not know, than what I do. In some of the questions about ArtifactOrientedProgramming I am forced to discover terms for approaches quite familiar with the questioner or respondant, but unfamiliar to me.  In researching these, I find things that are related to the concept, but which have a different intersection of structure and methods, as well as a different approach and focus.

        The internet is a rich repository of useful information which when handled correctly can enrich the reader's understanding of a whole range of ideas and knowledge. I have found a way to use SearchEngines to zero in on ideas, by looking at more than abstracts or summaries, and often find more relevant and explanatory items further down, almost buried in the remainder of the document. I have recently been labeled a pack-rat of information. This is true in the sense of securing all kinds of information and storing it locally, but it is also true that I am developing in ArtifactOrientedProgramming a certain style and approach so as to make these snapshots of the internet available and reachable regardless of where in the pile-of-stuff I have packed it. It uses a liquistic approach which makes the title or name of an artifact into a WordPile. This is related to an approach introduced as the <a href="OnePileFilingSystem.html">OnePileFilingSystem</a>, where most used documents are in the upper most reachable parts of the pile.
