        <em>That's the </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>.  Your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> has been spoofed so many times by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> that the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> thinks it can't possibly be you.

        <em>You're welcome.  BTW, you need to </em>'delete<strong> your </strong><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookie, not just change it.  If you merely change it, <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> will soon spoof your new <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> and before long we'll be back to the same problem.<em></em>
