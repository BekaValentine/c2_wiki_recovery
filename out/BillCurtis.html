      <p>
        I am a programmer, currently living in Oakland, California.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been writing software professionally for about 6 years, a bit longer if you count side work I did while a student.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do a lot of Java as of late.  I used to do a lot of C, a fair amount of Perl, and a bit of C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am looking for a guy name Jon Peto, who used to live in Northampton, Massachusetts.  If anyone knows him, please let him know.  Nothing urgent, I just want to say hi and find out what he is up to.  Thanks!
      </p>
