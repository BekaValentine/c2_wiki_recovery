        You Must Work In Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        A man is flying in a hot air balloon and realizes he is lost.  He
        reduces height and spots a man down below. He lowers the 
        balloon further and  shouts:  "Excuse me, can you tell me where I am?"
        The man below says: "Yes, you're in a hot air balloon, hovering 30
        feet above this field.
      </p>
      <p>
        " You must work in Information Technology," says the balloonist. 
        "'I do," replies the man. "How did you know?"
      </p>
      <p>
        "Well" says the balloonist, "everything you have told me is technically
        correct, but it's no use to anyone." 
      </p>
      <p>
        The man on the ground says, "you must work in management." 
        "I do" replies the balloonist, "but how did you know?"
        "Well", says the man, "you don't know where you are, or where
        you're going, but you expect me to be able to help. 
        You're in the same position you were before we met, 
        but now it's my fault."
