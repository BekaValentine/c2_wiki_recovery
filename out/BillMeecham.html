        August 16th 1995 was the first time I visited the Wiki Portland Patterns pages.

        Then I was a part time consultant and full time programmer for a communications company.  I was learning database design and Synon, a popular caseTool at the time, and in the process discovered patterns in our <a href="EntityRelationshipDiagram.html">EntityRelationshipDiagram</a>.  Having just connected to the <a href="InterNet.html">InterNet</a> the December before, I fired up Lycos 1 the <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a> on that 2400 baud dialup and found the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went on to do straight consulting work for a year and then started with the software company Extol as a developer.  I learned a great deal from the Joseph W. Baran, my boss, one of the best and brightest for which I ever worked.

      <p>
        New opportunities presented themselves and I moved on to be a <a href="SystemsAnalyst.html">SystemsAnalyst</a> at a major real estate company bringing all of the <a href="BusinessPatterns.html">BusinessPatterns</a> knowledge collected over the years and have tried to apply them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before all this I worked for a process control manufacturer where I learned the early concepts of <a href="SixSigma.html">SixSigma</a> based on the wisdom of Joseph M. Juran.

        I live in the pocono region of Pennsylvania.
