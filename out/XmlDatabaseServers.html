        Xml Database Servers

      <p>
        Two possible definitions:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           An ordinary database server that can speak XML. <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> 2000 is an example of this.  <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> 2000 can take http get queries, and will return Xml (at least according to the Microsoft Web Site).  Oracle too; Oracle 8 has good XML support, but this means that it has good libraries; it can generate or map XML to relational table, or store XML as-is in large text field.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           A database server written from the ground up (or adapted from an object database) for storing XML more efficiently.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Please post more information on the topic, especially examples of products that fit the number 2 description.

        <dd>No, this is not the case. We want to provide an open product that is useful to the Open Source community. At the same time, we need to cover the essentials: food on the table, roof over the head, and better video cards for Unreal and Quake.</dd>

        Can anyone give a summary of the state of the art of databases that look like graphs of semi-structured data? The article in DDJ was interesting, but it looked like this field was very young. Also, the use of an SQL-derived language spoke to me as a failure. I would think that XML could have a much different query semantic, on the order of a <a href="ParadigmShift.html">ParadigmShift</a>.
      </p>

        Related question: What's a good, free XML database that you can plug in Unix (hopefully with a low footprint)? I'm guessing it's spelt "Roll your own in Perl."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Funny you should say that. Slowly, slowly, I'm rolling my own in Perl. See </em><a href="http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CrystalPalace">http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CrystalPalace</a> to learn more. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a><em></em>

        Databases that look like graphs? The field is young? Can anyone say CODASYL? <em>...or Total, IDS, etc. Thanks for noticing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Time for another <a href="IndustryLearningExperience.html">IndustryLearningExperience</a>, perhaps?

        Spuriously semi-random challenge: Consider a <a href="ReasoningTree.html">ReasoningTree</a>. Alistair points out that reasoning is a graph. It isn't. It's really a hypertree in that there are no cycles, but two branches can join. Cycles make for circular arguments, and that would be bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        An XML form is typically tree-like but sometimes it has links out. A framework based on XML could legitimately be in the shape of a hypertree then. (it could also be graph like, but that's another problem).
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you serialize a hypertree so it still makes sense to a human reading it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does it matter if a human can read the linear format? I'm not sure, but I suspect it's related to the indexing requirement of any really whizbang XML database/epistemological framework. Also, it would solve the problem of the <a href="ReasoningTree.html">ReasoningTree</a> which would be helpful for patterns folk.
      </p>
      <p>
        I did say <em>semi-</em>random.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hypertrees are usually called <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a>s, aka DAGs.
      </p>
      <p>
        You serialize a DAG by attaching markers to reused nodes and referencing those, of course. (Well, that's one way, anyway.) I don't know whether there's a standard way to do that in XML (<em>Yes: use ID and IDREF type attributes</em>), but Lisp "s-expressions" are really rather like XML, and in Common Lisp you can say
      </p>
      <code>
        (foo #1=(bar baz) #1# #2=(#2#))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        to produce a structure that sort of corresponds to this:
      </p>
      <code>
        [] -+-> foo<br/>
        |<br/>
        +-> [] -+-> bar<br/>
        |	^	|<br/>
        |  ,'	+-> baz<br/>
        +-'<br/>
        |<br/>
        +-> [] --.<br/>
        \	|<br/>
        `--'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ("sort of" because there's more than one way to think about the structure of s-expressions). This notation can cope with graphs that have cycles, like the above, as well as acyclic ones.
