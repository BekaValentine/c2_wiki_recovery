        Color Forth Myths
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> has some controversy surrounding it.  Much of it stems from a fundamental misunderstanding of the community beliefs held, in general, by the majority of its developers.  This page aims to summarize many myths promulgated by those from outside the community, and address them, point by point, here.

        Confirmed?  (Now just watch as SamuelFalvo raises a <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a> just so he can put up JPG images of <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> code snippets on the C2 Wiki...)

        <strong>1.  </strong><a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> is useless for the <a href="ColorBlind.html">ColorBlind</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a> is not color-blind; however, his eyesight is failing him as he ages.  As a result, he built his language to cater to his particular sight issues: lots of bright colors to replace hard to read punctuation.  The color unambiguously indicates the purpose of a Forth word, significantly simplifying the already pretty simple <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> compiler.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, Chuck was very careful to mention that this concept, essentially using a <em>different visual dimension to indicate a word's purpose</em>, need not be restricted to color.  There is no reason why <em>fonts</em> cannot be applied similarly.  Indeed, anyone who has read the book, "Oh!  Pascal!" would recognize the immediate value of <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ing.  In this book, various typefaces indicate the various Pascal-related particles: <strong>keywords</strong> are in bold, <em>italics</em> used for (IIRC) comments, etc.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Personally over the years I've found </em><a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ing with <strong>bold</strong> to be less readable than using SyntaxHighlighting with colored normal fonts. <a href="RobPike.html">RobPike</a> argues that <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ing is for <em>fools</em> in some of his literature (but I disagree). To some, it is debatable whether or not <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ing or SyntaxHighlighting is really all that much more readable (I think it does help a bit, myself).<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           It's interesting you mention this.  I pretty much maintain this page, although I myself choose <em>not</em> to use <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>.  While I love the idea behind it, I find it pragmatically challenging, precisely because I find forced color changes to be somewhat error-prone.  I listed an example recently, towards the end of the page as of 2008-05-13, of reading a variable at compile-time and adding it to another value to form a range of values.  This idiom is used all over the place in <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> code.  However, although I'm not color-blind, I find the yellow-to-green transition hard to pick up upon when reading code.  The chroma-Hamming distance just isn't big enough for me.  :-)  (OTOH, I <strong>love</strong> how it uses cyan text for eliding compiler markup like <strong>postpone</strong>!  And it's very easy to see.)  Hence, where possible, I prefer proper SyntaxHighlighting or <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ing while using a properly punctuated Forth.  Of the two, I prefer SyntaxHighlighting over <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ing. --SamuelFalvo

      </ul>
      <p>
        Applying this concept to Forth, and recognizing that Forth essentially has only three classes of words (defined, immediate, and compiled), plus two classes of numbers (immediate and compiled), we <em>really</em> only need five typefaces to reproduce the core essence of <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> in a purely monochrome environment.  With just bold and italics, we get four of those right away.  The fifth would be plain text.

        : convertFtoC   32.0 f- [ 100.0 180.0 f/ ] fliteral f* ;<br/>

      <p>
        Additionally, it should be noted that color-blindness only impacts the ability to discern certain colors; it is not a total inability to see in color. While the particular colors <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> uses may be poorly-chosen for the color-blind (e.g. red and green), it is possible to carefully choose colors which are accessible to those with and without this condition.

        <strong>2.  </strong><a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> is just a glorified assembler.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This raises the interesting point that will occur <em>repeatedly</em> throughout any exploration of Forth: code only what you need.  "Solve the problem you've got."  Do the <a href="SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">SimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> ... <em>for you.</em>  In <strong>no uncertain terms,</strong> this means that Forth is tailored precisely to its audience and to the application you're working with; a <em>dot</em>-product of user and application requirements.  Broadly speaking, <em>there is no such thing as a language called Forth.</em>  Forth is what you <em>start</em> with.  By the time the program is implemented, it isn't Forth anymore; it is now whatever language you've created to solve your specific problem with.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is <em>critical</em> to understanding why Forth (and <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>) is the way it is.  If <a href="YouJustDontGetIt.html">YouJustDontGetIt</a>, you'll <em>never</em> grok Forth or <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>.  Guaranteed.  I apologize if this sounds elitest, but there are things some people just can't wrap their heads around, no matter how hard you try, like <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>'s Monads, or <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>, or ...  Forth's minimalism happens to be on this list.  It is neither good nor bad; it just is.
      </p>
      <p>
        With this background, <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> is clearly geared heavily towards highly customized, turnkey application solutions.  Greater than half of classic <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> is usable from the interpreted command-line, providing for more interactive development.  <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> is different; almost <em>all</em> of the language is implemented as compiler primitives now.  Commonly used Forth primitives are included (via <strong>LOAD</strong>-blocks) into each application, just as C applications would #include headers for commonly used libraries.  Looking at the sources for these, we find numbers and commas, the classic "place this number at the next location to compile" sequence of Forth instructions.

      <p>

      <p>
        The stack-based runtime environment provides the core of the <a href="MetaLanguage.html">MetaLanguage</a> that is Forth, allowing the user to engineer his own language, starting at the assembly level, and potentially ending at artificial intelligence.  <a href="ConcatenativeLanguage.html">ConcatenativeLanguage</a>s have properties similar to functional programming languages, and Forth is perhaps the best known <a href="ConcatenativeLanguage.html">ConcatenativeLanguage</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> has, almost since it first was released to the public, supported importing and exporting of its source blocks to HTML.  It is true that Chuck did not plan for this, since his projects are proprietary anyway.  However, the community found that source code portability wasn't nearly the problem it was first made out to be.

        <strong>4.  A Filesystem is a necessity to write applications.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Files aren't <em>needed</em> in Forth.  For some applications, they may be desirable; but it is important to distinguish <em>need</em> from <em>want.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Blocks provide persistent storage analogous to orthogonally persistent operating systems today.  In fact, their interface and modus operandi resembles closely how demand-paged virtual memory works in every major operating system today.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you do need to access "files," as we know them now, you write a file system, in Forth, to access the relevant data.  There are two approaches: one, if you're running <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> hosted under a "traditional" OS, you can write words which invoke the services of said OS.  This is more a binding than a real driver, but the application code wouldn't notice the difference.  On the other hand, if you're running on bare metal, where <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> really prefers to run, then you'll need to code the actual driver itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second approach also has two subdivisions.  One is to forego existing filesystems, and write your own.  For example, a file is an ordered collection of extents, where each extent is itself an ordered collection of bytes.  Supporting multiple files is pretty trivial, and writing a first-fit allocator of disk space isn't much harder than for RAM (although you will suffer a performance hit, since you're using a RAM-optimized algorithm for much slower disk storage).  When you transfer whole cylinders to and from memory, instead of individual sectors, this approach might even make some sense.  Directories can be implemented by using specially designated files, of the aforementioned construction, to map symbolic names to direct file references.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is fairly simple to implement.
        </li>
        <li>
           It works well with Forth's BLOCK system.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disadvantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It won't be compatible with any other existing filesystem.  This could be a show stopper.
        </li>
        <li>
           It lacks fault tolerance (like FAT, it'll be prone to disk errors, power glitches, etc).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There is obviously a (one-time) time investment in writing this.  The question the Forth coder must ask himself is, "Will it be faster to adopt a different persistence algorithm than to write using files?"  If it is, and it usually is, it is <em>time-wise cheaper</em> to just use directly addressed storage.  Experience with <a href="ExoKernel.html">ExoKernel</a>s gives further evidence to this realization.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other approach is to write a filesystem driver for an <em>already existing</em> filesystem.  Modern filesystems are mostly engineered for performance and for fault tolerance, which of course are hard problems to solve.  As a result, the amount of work necessary to make this happen is pretty formidable, and not one line of code written will ultimately contribute to the application you're <em>really</em> trying to develop.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a result, <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> <em>willingly</em> ignores files.  Most (but, admittedly, not all) applications can be re-engineered to rely on a different storage algorithm, and made to work with directly addressed blocks of storage.  Since blocks mimic virtual memory processes, it follows that Forth software would work best with something like an <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> or a TableOriented persistence strategy.

      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, ANSI Forth defines standard file access words which grants OS-independent filesystem access.  Most Forth environments also provide more OS-specific words too, should you need them.

      </p>
      <p>
        Since the source is stored in a binary compressed manner with color tagging, this should be self-evident.  However, the real problem alluded to is when you write customized color handlers, allowing for in-line graphical widgets representing higher-level program constructs.  In other words, the color equivalent of macros.
      </p>
      <p>
        To use a macro, one needs to have the implementation of the macro, expressed in terms of some base language.  This much should be self-evident to the reader.  Why should this be different, however, for <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>?

           Even colorCoders may not be aware of the kernel word "class" that allows for changing the action, or adding to the current action of a class of colored words. (<strong>"Yikes! All green words blink now"</strong> sorta thing. --lol) Also, one should note that the creation of such a <strong>macro</strong>, the way the term is used above, to create a new color-type ( say sky-blue-pink for html ( better fml) tags ), one would mearly include this new code as colorForth bytecode, more likely colorForth/assembler-macros. In this way, any extention to the kernel requireing a re-compile in an assembler is basically unnecessary for a kernel update to a user of custom kernel code written by someone else.

              It should also be noted that colorForths are begining to appear with the kernel written in colorForth in the bytecoded section of the image. This is convenient to them that like to do things in the kernel. Should I want to change the way your kernel is going to run my code, then you and I will come to some agreement as to how to included my code to this colorKernel, and you could just load my code in at the proper juncture. Or I would document the idea, and you could add the changes into your colorKernel and move it to the head of the disk and cold re-boot.  --Ray St. Marie

        <strong>6.  </strong><a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> (including <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>) lacks parameter passing<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Forth has zero problems passing parameters.  In fact, it excels at it, since the data stack is a first-class programmable object, as is (QUITE unlike any other language) the return stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Forth couldn't handle parameter passing, how is it able to execute "1 2 +"?  The data stack is used for all parameter passing <strong>and returning one or more results,</strong> if any.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BUSTED</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One question from <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>, prior to refactoring, was, "As someone who isn't too familiar with Forth: How well does Forth handle complex parameters? e.g. if someone wanted to, say, write an XSLT processor in FORTH, how would one pass to it the XML data, the XSL data, and get back the transform result?"
      </p>
      <p>
        In Forth, as in C, complex structures are best passed around as pointers to things.  Strings, and other arrays of stuff, for example, are expressed as a pair of numbers: a pointer to the first character/element of the string/array, and its length.  Parsing source text, for example, is done without ever modifying the source string in memory.  Since pointer arithmetic is world reknowned to be burdensome, error-prone, and just plain fickle, most Forth modules hide pointer arithmetic behind higher level words.

        That being said, you need to consider your market as well.  If <em>most</em> of the folks writing desktop applications are using C++, <em>and</em> you're writing a desktop application yourself, then there is a <em>good chance</em> that you might want to consider using C++ too.  The odds of success in employing Forth in a C++-dominated world are pretty slim.  You can do it, and it has been done before.  But, why?

        <strong>12.  </strong><a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> is nothing more than syntax-highlighting and <a href="PrettyPrint.html">PrettyPrint</a>ing.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> uses colors to inform the interpreter what, precisely, it needs to do with a word.  For example, a rather historic word <strong>index</strong> is used to print line 1 of a range of screens on disk.  Since each screen characteristically starts with a comment describing the purpose of the screen, it follows that this word produces a kind of directory listing.
      </p>
      <p>
        When actually <em>defining</em> the word <strong>index</strong>, it will appear in red.
      </p>
      <p>
        When actually <em>executing</em> the word <em>at compile-time</em>, it will appear in yellow.  For example, there is some confusion to new <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> programmers over the utility of macro-words (formerly known as "immediate" or "compiler" words in <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>).  The precise behavior of macros can be emulated by defining words in the Forth vocabulary, and invoking them at compile-time by making their color yellow explicitly.  This is often performed to evaluate constants.  For example, let's say we want <strong>index</strong> to render a screenfull of lines at a time.  We could write this (I'm using punctuated <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> as an example, due to this wiki's lack of color support):
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>index</strong> dup <em>scrhgt @</em> + range ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In the above snip, dup is compiled, since it appears "normally" in green (see below), while the phrase "scrhgt @" would occur at <em>compile-time</em> because it would appear in yellow.  Hence, on the data stack would be a precisely known integer value.  Then, because we transition back to green for the subsequent words, the interpreter "just knows" to compile the value on the stack as a literal before continuing with other words.  Contrast this with traditional <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> syntax:
      </p>
      <code>
        : index   dup [ screenHeight @ ] literal + range ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When actually <em>compiling</em> a call to the word, it will appear in green.  We have seen an example of this above.
      </p>

        When actually <em>compiling the word into another definition,</em> it appears in cyan.  This doesn't make much sense unless you're writing a macro definition, but that's to be assumed.  For example, <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> lacks a begin/while/repeat construct. ( UPDATE: this is no longer the case as colorForth2.0a does have begin/while/repeat included -- rastm2) However, it can be implemented relatively easily.  Let's assume someone already implement ANSI-Forth-style if/else/then words.  Then:
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>macro</em><br/>
        <strong>begin</strong> here ;<br/>
        <strong>while</strong> <em> </em>'ansi-if<em>' </em> swap ;<br/>
        <strong>repeat</strong> <em> </em>'branch then<em>' </em> ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Contrast this with:
      </p>
      <code>
        : begin  here ; immediate<br/>
        : while  postpone if swap ; immediate<br/>
        : repeat postpone branch postpone then ; immediate<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Thus, what we see in <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> is not mere syntax highlighting.  The colors <em>serve a purpose intrinsic to the semantics of the language itself.</em>  It doesn't exist solely for the user's benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a> decided to explore <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>, in part, because he has failing eyesight, and precisely because he recognized that tagging each word explicitly with its stated purpose (best visually rendered via color, although typeface could just as easily be used) would make the program clearer.  This serves a practical purpose: by removing the need to even enter "markup" words like [ ] : and so forth, he is able to make his font-size larger <em>without</em> reducing the amount of content and context viewed on his screen.  Note that syntax highlighting never <em>removes</em> tokens from an input stream -- it merely colorizes what is there based on structural knowledge.
      </p>
      <p>
        The difference lies in explicit-vs-implicit coloring information.  With <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a>, the programmer always determines the color of the word, since that directly affects <em>how</em> the word will be interpreted at load-time.  With traditional syntax highlighting, the editor uses statically-determinable structural information about the program to render the colors.
      </p>
      <p>
        The race is close, but I'd have to vote <strong>BUSTED</strong>.
