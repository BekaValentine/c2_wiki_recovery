        Lots of nice refactorings in the last few weeks, folks.  Keep up the good work.  Special appreciations for the cleanup of <a href="WhyWikiWorksNot.html">WhyWikiWorksNot</a>.  Sorry if it seemed I lost my sense of perspective there.  -- <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a>

        Thank you for your engagement, today I terminate my part as refactorer, to concentrate myself on the <a href="DataMusicProject.html">DataMusicProject</a>, which I feel, will be more useful to the Wiki community. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>

        I just discovered <a href="http:longs.cgi">http:longs.cgi</a> and I'm trying to make the large pages I find there smaller. It's not too hard to find sections that are starting to drift towards a new topic, and then move those sections to a page that is dedicated to that topic. Most of these pages are in <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>. I know it would be good to <a href="ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode.html">ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode</a> but I still find that difficult. I feel I have accomplished something useful when I pull text on some topic that was scattered over several pages and move it all together on one page (<a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>).

        I did start with cutting down my own prior contribution to only one single page. But I have to say that the Wiki environment engages to develop ideas. So I'm afraid that I'll have to restart with cutting back my own contributions at least one more time. -- <a href="PieterJansegers.html">PieterJansegers</a>
