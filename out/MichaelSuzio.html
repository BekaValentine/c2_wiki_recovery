        Michael is a big fan of Java, but has serious problems with it's lack of
        <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> and lack of support for <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>. He's starting
        to like <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> and <a href="DylanLanguage.html">DylanLanguage</a> a lot.  <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is just too nasty to even want to get into -- he likes his pointers hidden, thank you.
      </p>
      <p>
        Michael is also very interested in Artificial Intelligence formalisms and algorithms, and is considering a Masters degree in this discipline.
