        Strong Keyboard Typing
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some people type rather strongly on their keyboard, some soft.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course this also depends on the type of your keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some type to the rhythm of the music (I do some times).

        I spent my early college years typing on public-access VT100s.  Their keyboards tended to stiffen up after they got a lot of use, so you had to type really hard.  To this day, if I get too far into the zone and too immersed in what I am working on, I will find myself pounding the keys like I did back then.  It's similar to the sensation of snoring so loud that you wake yourself up.  -- <a href="DavidFlater.html">DavidFlater</a>

        Contrast with WeakKeyboardTyping, which offers little or no protection against typing errors. This is orthogonal to the issue of StaticKeyboardTyping, where some think the blue sparks shorten the typing lifetime, versus DynamicKeyboardTyping, where error checking is delayed until typing time.

        Some prefer <a href="SoftTyping.html">SoftTyping</a>, which causes fewer typing errors.

        Oh, and try programming on a Teletype sometime. One foot pound of pressure per key. Get used to that, and then discover that you can't help but destroy any regular keyboard with your Incredible-Hulk fingers.

        <em>In my long-ago youth, when I was a hardware engineer at Digital in Maynard, we all wanted to build a velocity-sensed keyboard for the vt100 (and its descendents). Our idea was that when you typed CTRL-C gently, the task would gracefully begin to wind down. A little harder, and it would just quit. Harder still, and it would interrupt out with a core dump. And if you REALLY banged on it, the machine (generally a PDP-11 or VAX-11) would reboot. For some reason, we could never get Gordon and Ken to go along with it, though.</em>

        I learned to type on a 1929 Underwood typewriter.  It had a big silver lever on the right side of the carriage that would advance the paper and return the carriage to the home position. I still pound keys, and occasionally slap my monitor for a carriage return.

        <em>Don't you mean the *left* side of the carriage?</em>

        I always learned to write on a computer keyboard, but in 2002 I bought a Dell computer that came with a heavy-duty keyboard, or at least that's what I think it is, as I've seen it quite a bit in banks, where the employees often pound real hard on the keyboard. For some reason, I started typing harder and harder, and well, since my keyboard was <em>not</em> falling apart no matter how hard I typed, you get the idea; I still use it, in fact. And worse, since the Enter key at the college's keyboards made a funny noise when pressed hard, I ended up hitting Enter real hard all the time. My friends are always scolding me because they feel I'm going to destroy their keyboards! -- DaNuke

        Addendum: As of 2012, this Dell keyboard is almost 10 years old. And yet, it still works and feels great when typing. Yep, this is definitely a heavy duty keyboard, and I am absolutely not changing it ever. -- DaNuke
