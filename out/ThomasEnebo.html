        A lurker of this site for some time...I find it inspirational and a good 
        place to look for information involving design topics.

        Also, the fascination of this site revolves around how well people play
        together here.  I know there are occasional editing fights and such, but for 
        the most part the people on this <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> are very respectful.  Quite a bit
        different from the Internet as a whole.

        I have started writing yet another wiki clone.  I have written the grammar using javacc and I want to mimic the wiki syntax of this site.  However things like mismatching quote like
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>heh</strong>'
      </p>
      <p>
        is a lot tougher than I originally thought.  Without some of these problems the grammar matches things okay.
