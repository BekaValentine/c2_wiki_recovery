        Spending some of my time in fixing some of the OldPages and checking for <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>s while reading a broad range of pages (20140724)
      </p>
      <p>
        Dedicating an hour or two a day to this task, in the effort to <a href="FixOurWiki.html">FixOurWiki</a> and to be involved in <a href="CrazyThingsThatMightSaveWiki.html">CrazyThingsThatMightSaveWiki</a>. It is some "stuff" worth doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It would be nice if you could try to track down some of those </em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>s and replace them with good links, or remove the relevant bits if the link no longer works and the associated paragraph doesn't make sense without it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree, and this effort is the first step. In the second step, which may involve 8 to 10 thousand links, an orderly, systematic (via back-links on <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>) research may lead to subsitution or replacement of about 25 percent or so (2000 to 2500) with current links, or discovered information.

           As of 20140734 at 8:15 AM there are 521 entries.

      </ul>
      <p>
        I have added an auxiliary tag, "<a href="FixThis.html">FixThis</a>" as an option to hi-lite places where added and proximate effort may prove fruitful.
