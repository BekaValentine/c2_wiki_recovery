        Has anyone had experiences, positive or negative, with online job search sites, positive or negative?

        I've been a user of DICE since its pre-internet, dial-up days, and lately I've been getting severely annoyed at some of their stratagems for dealing with low job volumes.  It seems they "bump" the dates on stale listings to bring them into the "today" category, and their profiles feature, which used to be useful for extraction of listings by keyword, has been broadened out to the point of uselessness.  (I liked it a lot better when you could download all the jobs for a particular area code, as a zipped text file;  I could then slice-and-dice locally to my heart's content.  Too geeky? Not, I think, in view of its target audience -- or what used to be its target audience.
