        Just so people know, this is simply the result of me transcribing notes from someone else talking. I wasn't always able to "keep up" very well, particularly during the description of said properties. Cope was moving through most of them pretty quickly and I did my best, but I don't want people to take the above as any kind of authoritative definition. <a href="RichardGabriel.html">RichardGabriel</a> has a much nicer set of notes and more extensive presentation on this stuff (I saw him give it at ChiliPLOP'98). --<a href="BradAppleton.html">BradAppleton</a>
