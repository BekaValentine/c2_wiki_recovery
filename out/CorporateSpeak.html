        Corporate Speak
      </h1>
      <p>
        An affliction similar to <a href="NewSpeak.html">NewSpeak</a>, but pandemic in American businesses.  Typified by (mis)use of motivational terms (<em>It's not a problem, it's a </em>'challenge<em>' </em>), faddishness with technical jargon (anything-dot-com,
        e-anything), and a curious desire to get quality results without paying for them.

        e.g. Work Smarter, Not Harder ? Ironically, XP is about that (in a logical meaning of the term). I guess the irony was always that a project managed in a totally illogical manner was most likely to have this as their battle cry.
