        Hi,
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Peter and I've been involved with Smalltalk since 1981. I have consulted with many companies, large and small, who use Smalltalk. I run the web site <a href="http://www.smalltalk.org.">http://www.smalltalk.org.</a> Please come and visit. Our intent with this web site is to make is a community resource for people who use Smalltalk. Please contribute to our site. You can email me at <a href="mailto:peter@smalltalk.org.">mailto:peter@smalltalk.org.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am currently developing a rather large application system in Smalltalk.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most recently I consulted with a large company debugging and detangling the concurrency control within a very large desktop application deployed tin production to about 10,000 personnel. It turns out that concurrent programming is very difficult work and that most programmers are not educated or trained to write concurrent programs. It's a serious issue for businesses, especially now that we have N-core processors everywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the best,
      </p>
      <p>
