        Wiki As Programmers Notebook
      </h1>
      <p>
        I installed <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> on my laptop and I'm experimenting with using my Wiki as  the <a href="ProgrammersNotebook.html">ProgrammersNotebook</a>. You can link things together, search etc. One problem is that you cannot doodle, like in a real notebook. -- <a href="RichieBielak.html">RichieBielak</a>

        <em>You should be able to do this; make a real hyperlink to your favorite drawing tool, or to a file managed by that tool.  Or find/write a Java drawing applet and incorporate that into your Wiki engine.  Hmmm... sounds like an interesting concept for something to incorporate into </em><a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> or JWiki (see <a href="JavaWikiByRichardKeene.html">JavaWikiByRichardKeene</a>)... -- <a href="DanHankins.html">DanHankins</a><em></em>

        <a href="TwikiClone.html">TwikiClone</a> has a Java drawing applet plug-in available, based upon <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a> -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        One big benefit of using a wiki as a notebook is that you can share it with others.  It's nice when you jot down the description of some problem in the wiki, and a few minutes later someone says "Hey, I know how to fix that!"  Or you can search other peoples' notes for similar issues. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        Another benefit of using a wiki as a programmer's notebook is <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a>.  You can link up your personal notebook with the company-wide wiki, or with the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> itself.

        I have used an installation of <a href="http://twiki.org">http://twiki.org</a> for this purpose.  I use Visio and attach them "inline".  It has a drawing plugin as well <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/TWikiDrawPlugin">http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/TWikiDrawPlugin</a>  -- <a href="StanleyKnutson.html">StanleyKnutson</a>

        My <a href="PowerBook.html">PowerBook</a> runs an instance of <a href="SnipSnap.html">SnipSnap</a> for a notebook, and I'm looking to integrate my notebook and personal blog.  Someday, I hope to figure out how to effectively host a shared "snip space" for all our developers, but I haven't figured out how to encourage sharing of knowledge while respecting territory (a <a href="ProgrammersNotebook.html">ProgrammersNotebook</a> is a very personal thing). -- <a href="HansGerwitz.html">HansGerwitz</a>

        We use pbwiki. We started with a LearnLog for each member of the team and ProjectLog for each project. It is still an experiment since the team is a set of interns. -- <a href="DoraiThodla.html">DoraiThodla</a>

        I use <a href="http://tiddlywiki.com">http://tiddlywiki.com</a> with Git for version control, so I can keep the wiki portable. -- DafyddCrosby
