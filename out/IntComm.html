        Int Comm

      <p>
        <a href="IntComm.html">IntComm</a> is short for the "Internet Public Communications Scratch Wiki." The wiki is made to be a scratch post for ideas about Internet Public Communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that the more you work on <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> technologies, the more you find that the problems we are solving are not <em>just for wiki,</em> but apply to the entire Internet at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, people talk about having an identity that can cross <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> boundaries. You go from one wiki to another, and each wiki knows, say, where your personal web page is, what your e-mail address is, and what kinds of settings you prefer.  And if we want to trust that a person is who they say they are, then you imagine some sort of public key infrastructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        But is that really an <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> problem? Isn't that really a problem for Internet Public Communications <em>in general?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or consider <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>. Technology like the NearLink makes it so that we can talk about pages on "near" wiki, without even prefacing with the name of the wiki! It's very similar to <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>. Or the InterLink. All of these require information about what is nearby, and what people call things in different places.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the face of it, it sounds like it's just an <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> thing. But is it really?
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps people would like to refer to wiki pages from non-wiki community sites, or from within email, or in the address bar of their web browser, or in instant messages, or wherever.
      </p>
      <p>
        And perhaps people would like to <em>publish</em> "<a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>" from non-wiki sources. Maybe a favorite article on KuroShin should have a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>. Maybe you want to title your blog entries, and refer to them from the wiki that you frequent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, technology like the "LocalNameServer."
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://intcomm.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/LocalNameServer">http://intcomm.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/LocalNameServer</a> ( <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> )
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Consider TraceBack, the blogger's version of the familiar <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>. Why shouldn't it also apply to bulletin board posts?
      </p>
      <p>
        These technologies are <em>not</em> just wiki technologies, and they are <em>not</em> just <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> technologies. These are technologies for the <em>entire span</em> of Internet Public Communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, the <a href="IntComm.html">IntComm</a> wiki is a place to coordinate and talk about such technologies. It is a ScratchWiki, meaning that there is little structure, and strong invitation to contribute.
