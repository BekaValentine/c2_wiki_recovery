        For the last few years, I have mostly been doing <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> development, but am doing more and more Cocoa programming with Objective-C as well, which I absolutely love.  In December 2002 I started learning Python, and subsequently Zope, CMF, and Plone.  I'm very impressed.  I used to be an advocate of the Frontier development environment, so the ZODB and Python go along well with those interests.

        I'm also one of those people that wishes <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> was ported to Mac OS X, and heck, why not Windows too?  I still don't know of any other platform / language that made it so easy for young people to pick up GUI programming.
