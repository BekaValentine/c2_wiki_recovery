        Well Chosen Numbers

      <p>
        In organizing ones artifacts, in addition to <a href="WellChosenNames.html">WellChosenNames</a>, do not forget another aspect of identification, that of numbering in your organization scheme.

      <p>
        One set of numbers which aids one in classification and identification because of its universal usage in artifact records is that of the date and time. I use it to the extreme because I find it continually useful.
