        I've been a programmer since I was very young.  I know a variety of languages, but most recently have used Python and C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        Awhile ago, I passed the mark where my professional lifetime as a programmer has exceeded my non-professional lifetime.  It has always been something of a mystery to me why one counts more than the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, I write and think a lot.  I have an infrequently updated homepage at <a href="http://www.omnifarious.org/~hopper/,">http://www.omnifarious.org/~hopper/,</a> and numerous other accouterments of a modern web denizen.  :-)  My online handle is Omnifarious, so if you see that anywhere, it's likely to be me.
