        Where's the good ice these days
      </p>
      <p>
        Lincoln Ice Fall, Hoosier Pass, Colorado.  It's between Breckenridge and the small town of Alma.  Easy access from the parking lot to the Ice Fall.

        Acctually it's in Sweden, northern parts. 6-7 of 200-500 meters of 60-85% degree ice. You'd love it. Most of them have easy access from road (1-400 meters). I have pictures somewhere.
