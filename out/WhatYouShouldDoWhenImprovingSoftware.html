        What You Should Do When Improving Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        In an article about the unreliability of embedded software, for some reason someone decided to add some comments about what they think you should do when improving software. <a href="http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,1540,1150971,00.asp">http://www.baselinemag.com/article2/0,1540,1150971,00.asp</a> however they claim they got it from ABN Amro Services Co.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their points are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Plan ahead - Think through your testing process.  Test code's behavior under both expected and unexpected conditions.
        </li>
        <li>
           Test early - The earlier the better.  Appeal to engineers who enjoy breaking things.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Test manually; Then, automatically  Before code settles down, test manually.  Later, have engineers use automated tests, before turning code in.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't test all code at once - Clean up old code as each file gets run.  Fifty percent to 80% of your files should never have to be touched.
        </li>
      </ol>

        What do people think about this advice?

        The first two are established. A <a href="LittleDesignUpFront.html">LittleDesignUpFront</a> is always good, and bugs found early tend to be less bothersome.
        Xp advocates writing a test for any bug that is solved, probably not truly "all of them, individually", it's a matter of balance. Also, do it iteratively. Sounds good. . . but is this really "Improving Software"? This sounds rather testing specific. Improving could involve decoupling, formatting, removing redundancies, etc. . . It also sounds a lot like <a href="ContinuousTesting.html">ContinuousTesting</a>, and it could benefit from using <a href="TacticalTesting.html">TacticalTesting</a>.

        The first item should really be split into two items,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Define the desired result for both valid and invalid inputs
        </li>
        <li>
           Determine how the test will set up the desired input condition and receive the result.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The first item describes what the program should do.  The second describes how the test is done.
