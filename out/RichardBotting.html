        I've been programming and using computers from the English Electric Ace (1960s) to a iPod. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I've just discovered that one of my machines from the 1960's (the FerantiPegasus) is
        alive and well in the Science Museum in London... and another (an ElliottEightOhThree)
        exists as a virtual machine under Linux.  Gosh! I could run my PhD
        graphics system(1971) under Linux.

        I know something of dozens of languages, diagrams, methods, etc. ranging from Ada to Z via the UML. And I <strong>still</strong>
        make mistakes.  I've documented some of the languages in <a href="http://cse.csusb.edu/dick/samples/">http://cse.csusb.edu/dick/samples/</a>
        as samples of my <strong>MATHS</strong> language.  MATHS used to be called <strong>PINAPL</strong>
        which stood for <em>PINAPL Is Not A Programming Language</em>.  The idea was a way to type
        discrete mathematics and logic in ASCII.  The purpose was not to write papers or do calculations
        but to describe problems and help discover solutions that could be shown to solve the problems.
        It included ideas from BNF (<a href="ExtremeBnf.html">ExtremeBnf</a>), NaturalDeduction, <a href="ZedLanguage.html">ZedLanguage</a>, PrincipiaMathematica, and lots of different
        programming languages.  I created a translator to HTML and use it for writing
        notes and web sites.  You can find out more at <a href="http://cse.csusb.edu/dick/maths/">http://cse.csusb.edu/dick/maths/</a>
        and try the translator out at <a href="http://cse.csusb.edu/dick/maths/hole.html">http://cse.csusb.edu/dick/maths/hole.html</a>

        <strong>Dream</strong>: Retire to small flat in an English town between a library and a pub.

        Dick - I just stumbled across your name in this Wiki - which I am trying to make sense of. Hope things going OK with you -

        This man knows more obscure English literature references than most Oxford graduates, but has a terrible time trying to grow silk plants in his office!

      </p>
      <p>
        The leaves kept dropping off that plant - odd that -- just after Rich went by. I just wish I had a hoard of non-obscure references like real Oxbridge graduates. 
        My university was in Uxbridge. The new
        plant is currently trying to take over my house -- since it was repotted.
