        I am a former Certified <a href="PowerBuilder.html">PowerBuilder</a> Instructor, and former certified Sun/SunOS/Solaris system administrator.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently an Applications Software Programmer for NorthropGrumman Information Technology (<a href="http://www.northropgrumman.com/).">http://www.northropgrumman.com/).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm certainly not anti-agile, but I have personal experience with successfully completing the SEI <a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a> (PSP) course, and being part of a team to use this knowledge and what is usually called a "heavyweight" process to complete a multi-year project under budget and schedule, all the while fielding changing requirements.  In late 2002, we were one of the teams who helped NorthropGrumman achieve CMMI level 5. Many years later (2013), I have to say that it's commitment from management that makes it sustainable.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2007, I will be developing an approach for using <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> (TDD) in a <a href="PersonalSoftwareProcess.html">PersonalSoftwareProcess</a> environment. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have enjoyed many years of <a href="PowerBuilder.html">PowerBuilder</a> and <a href="OracleDatabase.html">OracleDatabase</a> development, and used both in developing a multi-tier web application.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have many years of programming in pre-<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>/ANSI <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently loving <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> (but who isn't?), and use it frequently to parse code and data files for review (e.g., finding defects) and action (e.g., converting from <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> data and <a href="TransactSql.html">TransactSql</a> code to <a href="OracleDatabase.html">OracleDatabase</a> data and <a href="PlSql.html">PlSql</a>).
