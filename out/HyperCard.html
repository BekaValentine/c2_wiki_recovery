        <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> was one of the applications that made the <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> <em>insanely great</em>. It was the creation of <a href="BillAtkinson.html">BillAtkinson</a>.

        <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> was inspired by hypertext pioneering thinkers like <a href="VannevarBush.html">VannevarBush</a> back in the 1940's, and earlier applications, like Techware Tutor-Tech (created by Dan and <a href="DaveLampert.html">DaveLampert</a>) around 1982 for the Apple II.

        <a href="YeshaSivan.html">YeshaSivan</a> - much like <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> had a set of limited objects - but you could, if you knew how - do lots with them.  I did over 50 applications with it!

        I did two apps in <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>, and loads of mini-apps to help do various custom things the Mac wouldn't out of the box. It was and still is a great tool, and the first Myst represents what can be achieved with it. I joined the <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> mailing list for over a year. Then I tried to learn Java, thinking I could transfer all my skills in <a href="HyperTalk.html">HyperTalk</a> to a 'real' language. [[Ha]]! No chance! But I learned loads about coding from <a href="HyperTalk.html">HyperTalk</a>, and wanted to use it to write stuff that people could use on other platforms. I looked at <a href="MetaCard.html">MetaCard</a> (cross-platform, expensive), and bought <a href="SuperCard.html">SuperCard</a> (better colour, UI too complex). I went back to <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>, until Classic disappeared from OS X, so - admitting defeat - now I'm looking at GraphicProgrammingEnvironments as alternatives. After doing really complicated versions of 'hello world' in all sorts of languages, I still miss the simplicity and speed of a RAD that basically allows you to:

        Yep, it taught me to hack. Now I'm designing software I'm interested in, all because of HC - the original <a href="LifesJustTooShort.html">LifesJustTooShort</a> tool for doing what you want quickly... on the Mac, anyway. And for those who think it's been ditched by Apple - errr... it has.

        I was just a young'un when <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> was out; I didn't do much with it.

        There's now also a <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> implementation developed by <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> called <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>, which offers some similar but more advanced HC-like properties. Personally, I loved the idea but found the interface too complex.
      </p>
      <p>
        The class in Squeak that is meant to resemble a <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> stack is the BookMorph.  You can make a new stack by dragging the Book from the Object Catalog or the Supplies Bin.  According to <a href="MarkGuzdial.html">MarkGuzdial</a>'s book, "Ted
        Kaehler, who worked on <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> and built most of the BookMorphs,
        talks about using them to write active essaysâ€”documents that have text
        and graphics, but where some illustrations are active, dynamic,
        explorations of the concepts in the book. In this way, the BookMorph
        becomes an exploration space for Dynabook ideas.

        I remember in elementary school we had a lab full of Macs (LCII's or so) and they all had <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>. One day our teacher tought us how to animate a picture of a dog to make its eyes roll. Apparently, she didn't take HC very seriously.

        I have vague memories <em>circa</em> '84, before HC perhaps, of some app that convinced me *yet again* of how Apple was <strong><em>hot</em></strong> ... some <a href="ThinkWare.html">ThinkWare</a>. Anyhow, I got HC late 80s, probably clearance priced, after years on XTs, and immediately starting spending more time on Mac. (I had been writing hyper-help under DOS using Peabody.)

        I have been using <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> since it first came out in 1987. I have crafted many small and medium-sized projects with it, including a groupware that I did back in 1992 which is still in use today at the Minstere de l'Education du Quebec, and a system called "SIFAD" (Systeme Interactif de Formation A Distance) which I made during my masters degree in interactive multimedia (UQAM), which is also still in service today. I have been a member of the <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> mailing list since 1995. I helped a lot with the <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> community's efforts to save <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>, including a petition and a Web site (now turned into a wiki) which features thousands of ready-to-reuse stacks, HC-applications, scripts, etc. This wiki is called the Pantechnicon and can be browsed/edited at this URL : <a href="http://pan.uqam.ca/cgi-bin/usemod/wiki.pl.">http://pan.uqam.ca/cgi-bin/usemod/wiki.pl.</a>

        We (several Web-based groups) are currently creating an open source alternative to <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>, called <a href="FreeCard.html">FreeCard</a> ( <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/freecard/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/freecard/</a> ), which is being programmed in Java and with an XP methodology. <a href="FreeCard.html">FreeCard</a> is the application. FreeGUI ( <a href="http://www.egroups.com/group/freegui">http://www.egroups.com/group/freegui</a> ) is a <a href="MetaCard.html">MetaCard</a>-based prototype of the GUI of <a href="FreeCard.html">FreeCard</a>. It is fully functional as we speak, and has been so for over one year. The xTalk group is evolving the 4GL scripting language underneath the <a href="FreeCard.html">FreeCard</a> hood. <a href="FreeCard.html">FreeCard</a> will also be scriptable in several other [scripting] languages, including Java. The Pantechnicon, mentioned in previous paragraph, is a repository of ready-to-reuse <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> artefacts which will be 100% portable to <a href="FreeCard.html">FreeCard</a> without any re-coding. It is also where the community shares everything else related to our projects, including information and training in GUI design, scripting, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a small world, eh, for I have very recently invited the Montreal XP group, which is hosted in this wiki, to participate in the development of <a href="FreeCard.html">FreeCard</a>. I don't know yet if they will, but it seems to *me* that it would be "natural" for them to do so given the history of <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> as it is described here. I only discovered Ward Cunningham's fondness for <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> after joining this group. What an amazing coincidence, eh!

        Being a big fan of <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> I was looking at AppleScriptStudio (<a href="http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/xcode)">http://www.apple.com/macosx/features/xcode)</a> and found it to be a potential replacement. It is not based on the Stack and Card metaphor but allows normal-looking apps to be built. It does not allow changing the program while you run it, but the compilation takes place in a very transparent manner. <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> is pretty much the successor of <a href="HyperTalk.html">HyperTalk</a>. Creating an application is really quick, designing the UI is a pleasure with <a href="InterfaceBuilder.html">InterfaceBuilder</a>, and the nice part is that it can call code written in <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> (haven't tried Java, though it should be possible via the bridge), so it's like the XCMDs, only better. -- AndreThenot
