        Multicellular Organism
      </h1>
      <p>
        Organisms composed of many <a href="SingleCells.html">SingleCells</a>.  They compete for survival with <a href="SingleCells.html">SingleCells</a> and other multicellular organisms. Cooperation between them is relatively infrequent, but usually occurs at some stages in their life and in some plays a major role in survival. The <a href="SingleCells.html">SingleCells</a>, however, cooperate with the other <a href="SingleCells.html">SingleCells</a> in the same organism almost all the time, giving up their autonomy in support of the survival of the assembly, which all share the same DNA. In a few cases, multicellular organisms have reached levels of cooperation that have been described as <a href="MetacellularOrganism.html">MetacellularOrganism</a>s by analogy.
