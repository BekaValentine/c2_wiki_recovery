        Late Vs Early Binding
      </h1>
      <p>
        You can talk about this in lots of contexts, but I'm comparing <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> with <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. The former is a really neat little language - C with a bit of <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a>. The latter is, well, <a href="CategoryConsideredHarmful.html">CategoryConsideredHarmful</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The two languages have about the same vintage but <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> was much more successful because of its <a href="EarlyBinding.html">EarlyBinding</a>. There were two reasons for this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="EarlyBinding.html">EarlyBinding</a> is supposedly faster because you have less hashing and indirection on method calls.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="EarlyBinding.html">EarlyBinding</a> is supposedly safer because the compiler checks all your parameter signatures at compile time.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="ConstCorrectness.html">ConstCorrectness</a> was the original expression of this but then the <a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a> showed how you can damn well enforce any explicit parametric contract you like through <a href="EarlyBinding.html">EarlyBinding</a> polymorphics.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But just a moment's thought will demonstrate that both these reasons are CompleteNonsense:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Since anyone in their right mind knows to <a href="OptimizeLater.html">OptimizeLater</a>, there's no bloody point in "fast method calls". <a href="EarlyBinding.html">EarlyBinding</a> is the ugliest and most common expression of <a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a>. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Since anyone in their right mind knows to <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>, there's no bloody point in "explicit parametric contracts". This is because parametricization can't capture semantics - you're just as likely to make logic errors in your excruciatingly <a href="StlStyle.html">StlStyle</a> code as you are in plain old C.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Ah yes, but all those out-by-one and LintableBugs will bite you in the arse.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>No, not in </em><a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>, which is very sensible about this. For example you can send any message you like to "Nil" and it will not fail. So long as you <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a> the language semantics themselves will tolerate most LintableBugs.<em></em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               It's just like all that Stroustrup nonsense about throwing derived exception classes - anyone in their right mind knows to ThrowStrings unless you're going to use <a href="ExceptionsTidyThreads.html">ExceptionsTidyThreads</a>. The man's a raving loony.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Moreover, <a href="LateBinding.html">LateBinding</a> enables RealObjectOrientation. Classes are objects, and of course that's where your damn static members ought to go. This makes both ObjectDistribution and ObjectDelegation trivial to implement, so all of the horrible conniptions that C++ goes through to talk to databases and GUIs (esp. the <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> nightmares) turn into simple <a href="NakedObjects.html">NakedObjects</a> that just work. Result: vastly tidier, more maintainable, better optimized and more elegant code. See <a href="CocoaFramework.html">CocoaFramework</a> for plentiful examples.
      </p>
      <p>
        Conclusion: <a href="EarlyBinding.html">EarlyBinding</a> is nothing but <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a>.
