        A <a href="ParameterPassing.html">ParameterPassing</a> mode where parameters to a function are not evaluated until they are used; and are re-evaluated each time they are used.  Compare with <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> and <a href="StrictEvaluation.html">StrictEvaluation</a> (but notice difference of opinion on <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>).

           Looping constructs in many languages; in the statement while(x) y; the x part is evaluated at least once (and possibly an infinite number of times); the y part is evaluated zero or more times.

        Care must be taken when expressions containing side effects are passed to functions/macros that have normal order evaluation.  C/C++ programmers have long known to be very careful with macros defined by <a href="CeePreprocessorStatements.html">CeePreprocessorStatements</a>.
