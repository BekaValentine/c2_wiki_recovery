        Classes Without Oo

        Even if the language forces you to put all code in classes, it can't force you to do real object oriented programming:
        Some OO beginners will cram all their functions into one big massive class (typically a singleton).
        What they end up with might be a good modular or functional design, but it's not OO.

        I've also seen the use of method classes that pass around and operate on data classes.  Of course this violates the <a href="LawOfDemeter.html">LawOfDemeter</a>, but the programmers creating these classes don't know this law.

        They can also abuse this by making all the methods static.
        Then the class is, essentially, just a <a href="NameSpace.html">NameSpace</a>.

        <em>In some languages, like Java, you really have no choice.  You can't define functions within packages; static functions within otherwise empty classes is as close as you can come.--</em><a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a><em></em>

        Even many OO fans agree that OO may not be the best approach for all situations. Thus, it follows that a language should allow one to have functions and modules without being forced into OO syntax or OO-style namespacing.

        See <a href="FearOfAddingClasses.html">FearOfAddingClasses</a> for discussion as to why people would put too much functionality into existing classes, or fail to see the benefits of adding new classes.
