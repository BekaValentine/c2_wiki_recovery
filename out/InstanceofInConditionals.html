      <p>
        A code smell. You are asking an external entity (the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> or other provider of <a href="RunTimeTypeInformation.html">RunTimeTypeInformation</a>) to tell you something that the object should know about itself. It causes problems in practice because it means that business-level code has to know about the class hierarchy of Customer objects, that is, it has to understand implementation rather than specification.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instanceof in conditionals is a time to <a href="ReplaceConditionalWithPolymorphism.html">ReplaceConditionalWithPolymorphism</a>. At the very least, put an abstract Boolean method with a meaningful name on the Customer class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, now that we have <a href="JavaGenerics.html">JavaGenerics</a> there is very little excuse for casting. Rather than this:
      </p>
      <code>
        foo(Customer cust) {<br/>
        if(cust instanceof Person) {<br/>
        ((Person)cust).getPersonalName();<br/>
        }<br/>
        else {<br/>
        ((Org)cust).getBusinessName();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I very much prefer this:
      </p>
      <code>
        abstract class Customer {<br/>
        boolean isPerson() { return false; } <br/>
        boolean isOrg() { return false; } <br/>
        Person asPerson() { throw new <a href="IllegalStateException.html">IllegalStateException</a>(); } <br/>
        Org asOrg() { throw new <a href="IllegalStateException.html">IllegalStateException</a>(); } <br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Person extends Customer {<br/>
        boolean isPerson() { return true; }<br/>
        Person asPerson() { return this; }<br/>
        } <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that "asPerson" can be implemented however you like. Business code then becomes:
      </p>
      <code>
        foo(Customer cust) {<br/>
        if(cust.isPerson()) {<br/>
        // do some person calculations<br/>
        cust.asPerson().getPersonalName();<br/>
        }<br/>
        else {<br/>
        // do some business calculations<br/>
        cust.asOrg().getBusinessName();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        See? The code is asking the object about itself, rather than having to know things about class hierarchy. Let's say we have a customer type Dog, which for various reasons we do not want inheriting from "Person", but which for purposes of calculation acts like a person.
      </p>
      <code>
        class Dog extends Customer {<br/>
        boolean isPerson() { return true; }<br/>
        Person asPerson() { return new UnmodifiablePerson("Fido"); }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The main problem is that you need to use <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a>s. And those names must be consistent across the app. A big issue is when you include a boolean function like "isAcceptable", and "acceptable" means completely different things in different modules.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The key problem I can see is that it forces your <a href="BaseClass.html">BaseClass</a>es to know about what classes are derived from them.  I've used architectures like this in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, and it usually ends up being an extensibility nightmare; when a new derived class is added, the effects ripple all over the place. -- <a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree that it couples the derived classes with the super class. But there are not many simple alternatives. The instanceof test is problematic from a maintenance point too so neither way is proferrable from this position.</em>
        <em>For more complex situations either </em><a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> is needed (seldom available) or a more elaborate pattern for dealing with differing details. One example is the RoleObjectpattern. <em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Why would you ever need instanceof outside a debugger? Surely that is what <a href="PolyMorphism.html">PolyMorphism</a> is for?  What is this customer/personal name <em>really</em> for? Assume it's for a label, then:
      </p>
      <code>
        abstract class Customer {<br/>
        String getLabel();<br/>
        }<br/>
        class Person extends Customer {<br/>
        String getLabel() { return getPersonalName(); }<br/>
        }<br/>
        class Company extends Customer {<br/>
        String getLabel() { return getBusinessName(); }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        foo(Customer c) {<br/>
        String label = c.getLabel();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The "isPerson/asPerson" stuff is just replacing one problem with another.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Also, unless these objects have more than one name, these methods should already be abstract and called "getName".)
      </p>
      <p>
        I disagree. That a name is used as a label is a frontend issue and the meaning of a person name and organization name may differ significantly. Also you may have other labels for a person - how to distinguish these? Abstracting may help/simplify <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a> in some cases. But in many such cases it is <a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a> that will not go away this way and instead cause work-arounds to be handled later on.

        I've used things like instance-of (usually <a href="DynamicCast.html">DynamicCast</a>, to be exact) to good effect in plugin architectures, resource pools, and other things along those lines.  The examples presented so far on this page, I agree, should all be accomplished with plain old polymorphism.  But instance-of still has some uses. -- <a href="MichaelSparks.html">MichaelSparks</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For plugin, this is not a smell:
      </p>
      <code>
        do {<br/>
        String name = user.ask("What plugin do you want to try to load?");<br/>
        Object potentialPlugIn = dynamicMagic.createInstanceOfNamedClass(name);<br/>
        } while(!(potentialPlugIn instanceof PlugInInterface));<br/>
        PlugInInterface plugIn = (PlugInInterface) potentialPlugIn;<br/>
        socket.plugIn(plugIn);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ...unless your language provides a different mechanism.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Why not use two different methods for the two different behaviours?
      </p>
      <code>
        foo(Customer cust) {<br/>
        // do organisation related stuff<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        foo(Person pers) {<br/>
        // do person related stuff<br/>
        }<br/>
