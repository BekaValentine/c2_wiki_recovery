        Based in the UK, I have been working with Oracle databases since 1990, including a couple of years working as a consultant for Oracle UK Ltd. Now I work as an independent consultant specialising in analysis and design of Oracle databases and applications.  Somehow, I only became trully aware of Wiki in 2005!

        In my spare time I play lead guitar in a great band called The Love Handles.
