        Tree Pad
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TreePad.html">TreePad</a> ( <a href="http://www.treepad.com/">http://www.treepad.com/</a> ) is a family of tree-oriented text database managers written in <a href="BorlandDelphi.html">BorlandDelphi</a>.  Imagine notepad with the explorer folder tree glued on.  Been around since 1995 or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nodes can be added to the tree, copied, moved, exported, imported ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Each node has an associated text "article" for the storage of notes or what have you.
      </p>
      <p>
        The free version (now called <a href="TreePad.html">TreePad</a> Lite, ver 2.9.5) stores all its information in plain text "databases" (files) with an "hjt" extension.  It uses a very simple markup internally to keep track of which nodes are the children of which parents.  It features a very useful search feature.
      </p>
      <p>
        I use it for managing ... well, a bunch of stuff, like code, configuration data, the contents of boxes packed for moving or storage, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        There also some commercial versions of the product that feature things like rich text editing (stored as RTF), image storage, encryption, spell checking, and so on.  There is even a client-server edition (<a href="TreePad.html">TreePad</a>-X) which will handle absurdly large files.  Hefty price tag on that one.
      </p>
      <p>
        The developer (Henk Hagedoorn) is friendly and quite responsive.  I believe the product is coded in Delphi.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those of you who go for <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> will appreciate the freeware product's implementation.

        There's been some discussion on their list about that, but for the moment one uses a 3rd party tool for that conversion.

        If you like the idea of Treepad, you might like jreepad (<a href="http://jreepad.sourceforge.net/).">http://jreepad.sourceforge.net/).</a> This is a java clone of treepad lite that allows you to use wiki markup to create and link articles. --PaulWright

        There is also a now murdibund <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> project called <a href="KeyNote.html">KeyNote</a> (<a href="http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote_main.html)">http://www.tranglos.com/free/keynote_main.html)</a> that has a very similar set of fucntions, better in some places, not quite as good in others. It also imports and exports the <a href="PlainText.html">PlainText</a> FileFormat used by <a href="TreePad.html">TreePad</a>. --BrianvandenBroek

        By the way, the companion or extension I'm looking forward to is an email import tool.  I used <a href="InfoSelect.html">InfoSelect</a> to store email for about a year (it has an integrated email client) but found that it was ... troublesome (okay, it sucked).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The ability to organize email somewhere besides the email client's own filing system (since most of them make really awful query-able databases), and integrate that material with the other data I collect, would be a significant step up in knowledge/data/idea management.  -- </em><a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a><em></em>

           If you use <a href="MicrosoftOutlook.html">MicrosoftOutlook</a> you could have written a <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> application that access Outlook objects. Would that not suffice for email integration? Also I do not understand why one of the many <a href="WikiLikeThing.html">WikiLikeThing</a>s would not do a <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> job in knowledge/data/idea management -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

            <li>
               My remarks in <a href="MicrosoftOutlook.html">MicrosoftOutlook</a> will indicate why that's a non-starter.  I don't use it, never do unless under duress. -- gh

          <em>I used to have exactly the same problem and cursed it many times before finding that Categories in Outlook objects make the object appear multiple times.</em>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>To clarify, the email source will *not* be </em><a href="MicrosoftOutlook.html">MicrosoftOutlook</a> or OutlookExpress.  It can be built into the <a href="TreePad.html">TreePad</a> itself or can be any of the several RFC-compliant mailers with a bridge tool.<em> -- gh</em>

           ok fine forget about MSoutlook. But why use <a href="TreePad.html">TreePad</a> instead of one of the many <a href="WikiLikeThing.html">WikiLikeThing</a>s? I am starting to use a <a href="WikiAsPim.html">WikiAsPim</a> (<a href="SdiDesk.html">SdiDesk</a>) and find it quite ok -- dl

        Vault ( <a href="http://www.personalmicrocosms.com/Vault3/WhatIsVault3.aspx">http://www.personalmicrocosms.com/Vault3/WhatIsVault3.aspx</a> ) is another nice tree editor that fits the same niche, using XML and running on Linux as well as Windows.  Previously shareware, it is now open-source.
