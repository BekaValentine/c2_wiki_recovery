        United States Cultural Assumption

        The continent we call America is culturally diverse.  A majority of the nations on the continent use the metric system and have a national language other than English.  This is true even for <a href="NorthAmerica.html">NorthAmerica</a>.

        To a casual observer it might seem that a lot of Americans are from the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a>.

        Point taken, but a lot of Americans <em>are</em> from the US, given that it's the most populous country in America.  Certainly the large majority of Wikizens who are American are from the US.  -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        <em>Well a lot of Asians come from China, so if the Chinese changed their coutry name to People's Republic of Asia and started calling themselves "Asians" it would be ok... Also how many Americans are </em><a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a> citizens? 20~30% perhaps? It's not naming problem but a culture/perception one. Like the joke "Come here Indian, help me expel these illegal aliens. I'll pack your clothes white man." most <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a> citizens believe they earned the right of using America as their country name and to live in the lands they're living, so their world ends there. The continent is way larger than that, so whenever they say GodBlessAmerica it's a whole continent, not just their country being blessed.<em></em>

        The people of the ThirteenColonies were called Americans, to distinguish them from their British colonial masters. The name stuck.

        The name of the continent that mostly contains the U.S.A. is North America, not simply America. So why is it considered rude for citizens of the U.S.A. to call themselves Americans? It is the only country in North or South America that has the word America in its official title. Isn't it just good manners to call someone what they wish to be called?
