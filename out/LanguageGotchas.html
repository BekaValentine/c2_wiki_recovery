        Language Gotchas
      </h1>
      <p>
        Every language has "gotchas". These are oddities that stump you for a while when you first encounter them. This is not meant to be a <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> about which language is better, but rather a catalog that helps experienced developers transition to different languages more quickly, by pointing out things which don't behave like one would expect compared to other languages. It is kind of the <a href="DeltaIsolation.html">DeltaIsolation</a> method of learning. Generally, languages have their own pages if you want to complain about the reasons for given features. (Feel free to add language-specific links.)

           "Optimized functions" that don't behave like full functions. For example, the "empty()" function cannot take expressions, only single variables. The workaround is to assign to an intermediate temporary variable or create your own wrapper function. (Version 4)

               Using the return result of some functions can result in problems if a zero is returned because it is difficult to tell the difference between zero and false. One must use 3 equal signs or check the type. Examples of such functions include strtok, [forgot, come later].

               Variable references can cause memory corruption if you declare a function as returning a reference and return a constant, and also in other cases which are not syntactically preventable (or even really detectible by the interpreter)

               Biggest of all, IMHO: $_REQUEST[] $_SESSION[] $_SERVER[], ob_start(), and all sorts of constructs which make writing orthogonal code require a lot of mindfulness, since all of your code is essentially tied to the interpreter's state.

           Be careful how you compare variables. You may have to append a blank or add a zero to force the internal "type" flag to be what you want it to be, otherwise you may accidentally compare a string as a number and visa versa.

        This code really, REALLY looks like it should compare zero to certain bits from a:

      <p>
        if (a & MASK == 0) ...

      <p>

      <p>
        if (a & (MASK == 0)) ...

        if ((a & MASK) == 0) ...
      </p>
      <p>

        <em>Dunno about C++, but in C# besides the bitwise usage you can use the & with logical operations as a non-shortcircuiting "and" for those cases</em>
        where the side-effects are significant. Should work the same in C/C++, although I'd be wary of using it on non-boolean objects. In that case their
        late position in evaluation order becomes useful.<em></em>

Java isn't the only language to do this... <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> does exactly the same thing by default... that's just how OO works... passing a reference object, will always have the effect of allowing changes to the object to show to all callers; that's what it means to be a reference object.

        <a href="PhpHypertextProcessor.html">PhpHypertextProcessor</a> doesn't work like this. By default, it passes objects - whole objects, not references to objects - by value.

        <em>Then C++ is treating its objects as value objects, much as an int or string would be treated.

The difference between a value object and a reference object is conceptual; the language is irrelevant to understanding the behavior difference between them. One must of course know how the language passes parameters... but that doesn't make it a Java problem.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Java doesn't differentiate between objects and references-to-objects, and because of this it has a ConceptualMismatch between variable access and variable assignment. In the above code, some operations on what appears to be a <a href="StringBuffer.html">StringBuffer</a> (but which we all know is a reference-to-<a href="StringBuffer.html">StringBuffer</a>) act on the object (such as the append function), and some operations (such as assignment) act on the reference. More confusing still are Java's compound-assignment operators (such as String's +=) which act on both the object and the reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> deals with this properly by not confusing reference objects (pointers and smart pointers) and the objects they refer to. Consequently, you need to distinguish between . and ->, and you need the & and * referencing and dereferencing operators in order to avoid this Java inconsistency. Note that what <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> unfortunately calls references are actually not references in this sense, and are just aliases.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm still failing to understand what anyone finds confusing about this, seems perfectly logical to me. Here's the gist of my understanding, just to put it on the table for analysis. Objects exist somewhere in memory, variables hold pointers to those objects. I'm going to use the term pointer in the abstract sense, not in the </em><a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> sense. Variables can either be values themselves, or be pointers to objects located in memory. When passing variables, you can pass by ref or by val (language-dependent of course), so naturally if you pass a variable that points to an object by value, then that variable is copied to create a new variable in the function, but it still points to the same object. If you pass a pointer variable by ref, then it isn't copied, it's just handed in to the function as is. Thus if you change the pointer variable to point to a new object and it was passed by ref, you change it for the function's caller too, whereas if you change a by-val pointer variable it has no effect on the caller since you received a copy of the caller's pointer. But all of this only applies to the variable, not to the object it points to. Regardless of passing by ref or by val, all changes to the object will be reflected to anyone holding a pointer variable to it. Thus passing a reference object by val appears to still pass by ref, because a reference object is a reference object, regardless of how a pointer to it was passed. Passing a pointer to a reference object by val, just makes a copy of a pointer, but it still points to the original object.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wow, that was way more complicated to explain than I thought it'd be, seems so simple when I visualize it in my head. I think what makes it easy for me is that I don't see variables as objects, merely pointers to objects. I intuitively understand that passing by val is just copying the pointer and not the object, because I know I'm not passing objects around, only pointers to them. To me, the important thing is value vs reference semantics. If I have a customer object, that's a reference object, there should only ever be one of any particular customer, though many other objects may have pointers to it, any changes to it reflect to all pointers to it. But if I have money object, that's a value object, it doesn't have identity, so I don't pass around pointers to it, I pass around copies of it. Every variable points to a different object, thus no aliasing issues. You can fake this by making the object immutable. I feel passing all values by val as the default, is the correct thing to do, I think </em><a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> does it right, in fact, even though in <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> I can pass variables by ref if I so choose, I've never found a reason to.<em> </em>

Sometimes the resulting code is significantly more verbose than the original; you are, after all, making explicit all the variable-setting that's implicit in pass-by-reference. But in a good OO design, you don't need to copy the variables out anyway, because you just call methods on the returned object, which work on the values en-masse. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>]

           Naturally it can always be avoided, but it depends on philosophy and/or context whether it is always desirable. I sometimes find that I need to add a status return to something that is already returning a scalar, and rather than creating a new object for that, I sometimes use a reference parameter.

        Keep in mind that this topic is about gotcha's, and not really about whether something is "logical". It is about being tripped up regardless of whether that tripping is from bad language design or one's own ignorance.

        <em>No, this topic is about </em><a href="LanguageGotchas.html">LanguageGotchas</a>, tripping on ones own ignorance is not a <a href="LanguageGotchas.html">LanguageGotchas</a>. <a href="LanguageGotchas.html">LanguageGotchas</a> are where the language doesn't do what you'd logically, based on experience, think it would do. Like scope in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, has C's syntax, but not C's scoping rules, or VB.Net's changing the way scope is handled from VB 6, which only scoped at the method level, not the block level. Programmer ignorance however, can't be blamed on the language.<em></em>

        I don't see why Java arguments aren't all const anyways.  You shouldn't be editing the argument in valuetypes, and you shouldn't be editing the reference itself in objects.  The compiler should tell you so - it would eliminate this whole class of gotchas, as they'd be compile-time errors.  If you need to conditionally substitute an argument, then make it a new variable.  I expect this kind of "enough rope to hang yourself" mentality in C++, but not in Java.

           Instances of classes that use interfaces behave differently depending on which interface is used. If the instance is in a dynamically typed variable (Variant or Object), the interface in use may depend on such non-intuitive things as the return type of the last function that supplied the reference to the variable. In <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>, each interface provides its own implementation of each method, and in fact, a method provided only via an interface won't even be visible unless you cast the instance to that interface type.

           <a href="ByVal.html">ByVal</a> and <a href="ByRef.html">ByRef</a> have a non-intuitive meaning when objects are involved because of the 2 different meanings of "reference" in <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>, one meaning for parameters, and one for class instances. One would think (and many smart VB programmers do) that if you pass an instance of a class with a default value property to a <a href="ByVal.html">ByVal</a> Variant procedure argument, the procedure will receive the value from the object's default value property, but this is not the case. The problem goes undiscovered for the most part, and leads to all sorts of intermittent run-time bugs. What actually happens when you pass an instance <a href="ByVal.html">ByVal</a> is that the procedure gets its own new, local reference to the instance and increments the reference count. Passing <a href="ByRef.html">ByRef</a>, on the other hand, causes the procedure to share the calling procedure's reference to the instance such that placing a different reference in the parameter variable will also be replacing it in the variable passed to the procedure argument.

           When checking Err.Number after a statement executed following On Error Resume Next, you may find an error number left from a prior statement executed in a similar fashion, even one that happened in a very distant part of the code. This is in spite of the fact that execution of many types of statement clear the error number. Avoid this by executing Err.Clear before and after such statements, or better yet, avoiding identifying errors by any other means than On Error Goto <label>.

        There are 3 other widespread gotchas in ST and there's one esoteric gotcha involving execution order with side effects, because compilers are single-pass but the language spec is triple pass. So in the example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           aStream doSomething: (otherStream jump: 5) withSomethingElse: (otherStream next)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        the jump: executes before the next. I should check out whether it actually works this way though.
