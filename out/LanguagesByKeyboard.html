        I wonder whether there is a connection between forth and python which both wear out the ':' key. <em>There is none; as such, I've amended the Python entry with a more appropriate key, as well as refined Forth's. -- </em>SamuelFalvo<em></em>

        I have to add that the letter instances are really joking as the given keys are surely not worn out more than the 'e' key.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps even the entire list is really joking.</em>

        Let's not forget that the editor also has some influence: Vim (esc, h, j, k, l) and Emacs (ctrl and meta) preferences should be revealed in the keyboard as well. <em></em><a href="EditorsByKeyboard.html">EditorsByKeyboard</a><em></em>

        <strong>Lisp Programmer:</strong> Their '(' and ')' keys are mapped to the '[' and ']' keys (although, true, you probably can't tell that by looking at the keyboard). I read somewhere that Olin Shivers has done this.

        <em>I use xmodmap to map what were [ ] { } ( ) to ( ) [ ] { } respectively. Even in non-Lisp languages, AFAICT, I use the parentheses more than the other kinds of brackets, so they get first choice of keyboard locations. c.c -- </em>DrakeWilson<em></em>

        An observation: it's apparently impossible to distinguish between C++ and XML and Brainfuck seems closely related to both.

        UnixProgrammer:	Shift, Escape, z, >, |, and / are the shiniest in the middle, with the most food residue on the outer edges. <a href="BackQuote.html">BackQuote</a> <a href="BangBang.html">BangBang</a> <a href="BackQuote.html">BackQuote</a> was so annoying to type, I made an alias for it, or else those keys would be far shinier.

        The shiniest and most used key(button) in my system is the left-mouse button, the keyboard keys have dust on them. :) No carpal, have used computers since teletypes (even punched a few IBM cards)(from my highchair). -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.200805240228.m06
