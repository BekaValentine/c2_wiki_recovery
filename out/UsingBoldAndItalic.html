        Using Bold And Italic
      </h1>
      <p>
        To add <em>italics</em> to your text, put two single quotes before the 
        italic text, and two single quotes after.
      </p>
      <p>
        To add <strong>bold</strong>, use three single quotes before and after.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you use five quotes, you get <strong><em>bold AND italic</em></strong> both at the same time.
        <em>(Way cool!  ;-)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or you can use <em>some of the </em>'second<strong> kind, (bold) inside </strong>some<em>' of the first</em> (italics).
      </p>
      <p>
        But you can't <strong>swap</strong> <em>back</em> and <strong><em>forth</em></strong> between them without closing the quotes.
      </p>

      <p>
        There was a time that to have multiple pieces of italic and bold in a single paragraph,
        one had to put hard returns into ones text so the parser understood
        what was going on. This limitation was removed with the conversion of wiki to perl5. You may still see pages whose source is formatted as such.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> What about adding alternative ways to enter strong and emphasized text? Double and triple single quotes lack the same intuitiveness as the other <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        Wiki                  Alternative<br/>
        This is <em>emphasis</em>  ==> This is /emphasis/<br/>
        This is <strong>strong</strong>   ==> This is *strong*<br/>
      </code>
