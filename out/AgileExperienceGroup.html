        Agile Experience Group
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Agile Experience Group of the Twin Cities, Minnesota, meets and collaborates to share experiences, suggestions, and ideas about moving software development efforts towards more agile, more lightweight practices.	Extreme Programming (XP), SCRUM, Crystal, FDD, and ASD are agile approaches. See www.agilealliance.com for more information.
      </p>
      <p>
        This group is open to anyone with an interest in Agile approaches, regardless of experience, location, or intent to attend a meeting. Meetings are free.

        The Agile_Experience_Group Yahoo!Group is open to the public to read and is how and where meetings get announced.  The fastest way to join is to send an email to the group's moderator and founder, Kyle Larson, like so:
      </p>
      <p>

        kylel@acm.org
      </p>
      <p>
        Please answer these questions in your email, as we have been spammed and need to validate your actual
        interest.

        Your location?<br/>
