        Lisp Code Walker Challenges
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="HomoiconicExampleInManyProgrammingLanguages.html">HomoiconicExampleInManyProgrammingLanguages</a> stated, that it were trivial to implement a code walker in <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>, which replaced every expression with a call to some timing function and a subsequent call to the original expression.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note, that unquoted expressions suffice. Quoted expression need not be taken care of, because (in the intended use of this code) they will be handled on demand by a customized version of eval.
