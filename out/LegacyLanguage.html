        Legacy Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> which is still used in production code, but only in <a href="LegacySystem.html">LegacySystem</a>s.  In other words, where the language is typcally only selected when its use is a bona fide requirement, usually due to the need to interface with zillions of lines of code that already exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PlbLanguage.html">PlbLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> (excluding Delphi, though Delphi may well soon get legacy status)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CeeShell.html">CeeShell</a>, <a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a>, <a href="KornShell.html">KornShell</a>.  <a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a> is still needed for Unix init scripts and ArCeeFiles; however these are largely being replaced by <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>/<a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>/<a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> for any serious scripting.  <a href="CeeShell.html">CeeShell</a> is rightly <a href="ConsideredHarmful.html">ConsideredHarmful</a> as a scripting language.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Maybe on the way out:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> (at least for business applications/logic; C++ probably still has a lot of life in systems programming, shrinkwrap apps, free software apps, and embedded systems)
          <ul>
            <li>
               I certainally hope not. I find C++ to be very good when I need to splice some OO onto something that cannot afford a managed runtime and all that VM goop for higher level languages.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not on the list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>.  Long abandoned for business applications and general purpose programming, Fortran still remains important to the numerical community.  
        </li>
      </ul>
