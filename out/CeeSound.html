      <p>
        Csound is basically a <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> used to create audio files; the input and output to your 'programs' consists of PCM audio data (AIFF, WAV, ... - i.e., a format using raw, uncompressed sample data). For a more thorough description, see <a href="http://www.csounds.com/whatis/index.html">http://www.csounds.com/whatis/index.html</a> . There are several distributions and implementations of the Csound compiler; most can be found through the main page at <a href="http://www.csounds.com">http://www.csounds.com</a> . (Note the 's' in these URLs.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The language itself rather resembles <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>; as one might expect, there have thus been several attempts made to implement HigherLevelLanguages on top of it.

        <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a> (I have plans for yet another of these HigherLevelLanguages, too - rather, an XML schema; the 'code' could be translated into <a href="CeeSound.html">CeeSound</a> .orc and .sco files via XSLT or something, though I plan to do it in Perl)

        I use Csound. Very good program; I even wrote plugins for it. I did invent a higher level language for the score, specifically a form of <a href="MusicMacroLanguage.html">MusicMacroLanguage</a>. For the orchestra I find the standard Csound format to be OK.
