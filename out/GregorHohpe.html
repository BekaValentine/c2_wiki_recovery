        I lead the Enterprise Integration practice for <a href="ThoughtWorks.html">ThoughtWorks</a>. Contact me at gregor(at)hohpe.com (I hope this keeps the crawlers from sending me spam).

        My focus area is enterprise integration. I have spent a few years architecting and implementing integration solutions with EAI packages like TIBCO and Vitria. More recently I started working on JMS and Web-services based integration solutions.

        <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> and <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a> got me thinking about documenting some of my experiences in the form of patterns.  Since then I have been harvesting patterns from my integration work. I workshopped my paper on Enterprise Integration Patterns at PLoP 2002 (<a href="http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2002).">http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2002).</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I posted most of my patterns material on <a href="http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com.">http://www.enterpriseintegrationpatterns.com.</a> I am trying to enhance the site continuously as this will ultimately evolve into a book on integration patterns.
