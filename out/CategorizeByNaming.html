        In this wiki we have Categories, so named by using the prefix "Category", as in <em></em><a href="CategoryWiki.html">CategoryWiki</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also under <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a>, we can find by Reverse Link Search, known as <a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a>, all the pages which have this Name on them. To put it another way, if you have a wikiWord on a number of pages, you can make a list automatically by clicking on the PageTitle of the page having the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> as a name.<em> What prevents the use of any page name as a means of Categorization?</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus if there is a page called <a href="AdoptingXp.html">AdoptingXp</a>, you can have a list prepared, automatically, via its <a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a>. Any page having the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> <a href="AdoptingXp.html">AdoptingXp</a>, anywhere on the page, will be included. When you cause the <a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a> to be displayed, you can then do with them what you might want, list them individually for reading, save them to you local drives, <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> them as a page, Print them to <a href="PaperPort.html">PaperPort</a>, Capture them in an Adobe Pdf, etc. You can also use the two search features available to prepare two more lists, one smaller and another one larger, by entering either a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>, a word, or even part of a word, like "Anti". 
      </p>
      <p>
        This can serve as your own way of categorization which will not cause concern among the group of folk who are touchy about Categorizing Pages.
