        Unit Testing Java Events
      </h1>
      <p>
        I would be interested in thoughts concerning <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing for Java Events. This problem came up when I was writing a <a href="JavaBean.html">JavaBean</a> which generated PropertyChangeEvents. I would like to write tests for those but am not sure of the best approach using <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>. -- <a href="ChanningWalton.html">ChanningWalton</a>

        I create event listeners that receive events and append them to a Vector, along with information about which method was called, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        To test a class that generates events I create a Vector, create event listeners with a reference to the Vector, register the listeners with the event source to be tested and then exercise the event source's methods.  I then check that the Vector contains the expected sequence of events.  I usually write convenience methods for this which compare a static array of objects to an enumeration of the vector's elements.
