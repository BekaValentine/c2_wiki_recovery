        Thread Local Storage
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Thread Local Storage" is global memory that is local to a thread.  That is, there is one copy per thread, instead of one copy per process.  <em>(Well yes, it's an </em><a href="OxyMoron.html">OxyMoron</a>, but please read on...  ;-)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want each thread to have its own patch of "global memory" to work on, you ask the system to allocate you a thread local storage index.  Each thread can put its own pointer in the thread local storage array, at that index.  Whenever a thread asks for the pointer at the given index, it will receive the appropriate pointer for the current thread.  Thus, each thread can allocate a chunk of memory, put a pointer to it in the TLS array at the allocated index, and treat it as "global memory" that is local to each thread.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll need to downcast this pointer and later dealloc it explicitly (if it doesn't just point back into a stack object at the bottom of the thread's stack, which is a very convenient way to handle it).  You'll also need to know that no other modules the thread enters happens to require and prepare TLS - e.g. TLS might be used for tracking transactions in a C++ STM system.
