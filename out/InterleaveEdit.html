        Interleave Edit

      <p>
        This is an edit which is placed, not at the bottom of the page, which is often preferred, but interleaved between paragraphs, when the edit has the purpose of commenting about what is just above it, or answering a question or reacting to a paragraphy just above it.

        One convention which can be used in this case is the alternating between voices in a running conversational type posting by using alternate text styles Like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you suggest a better way to comment?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You might make anonymous comments in italic, like this sentence, to suggest a different post, and a different poster.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        While if you prefer to identify your post, by following it with your user name: -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or if within a running alternation, by initials, like this: -- dn
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>When Subject or running alternation changes</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When the subject, or conversation changes, one might identify the change by the insertion of an emphasized title, as shown here, or with the insertion of a horizontal line as here (or both):
      </p>

        <strong>Preservation Of Position</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Certain parts of the page should normally be placed in absolute, or relative position:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           At the very top: The original sense, or if refactored as the page develops, the developed sense of what the page is, or has come to be. This serves to supply context and definition to the one browsing the page, as to what it is supposed to contain.
        </li>
        <li>
           The category or categories which apply to to a page, should appear at the last line of the page, ordinarily separated from the rest of the page by a horizontal line as shown on this page.
        </li>
        <li>
           Another convention is that just above the Category Section, a section can be inserted which is a list of pages which are related to the page, preceded by "Related:".
        </li>
        <li>
           A convention recently being used is one which adds, separated from the <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a>s titled "Related:", the links which are not found in C2, by a group headed by "External Links:"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>

        Related: (here a list of pages which can be browsed directly by clicking on the supplied <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a>)
