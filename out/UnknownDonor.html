      <p>
        Similar to <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>, except that the applier of the label doesn't know or cannot reassuringly determine the authorship. In general, the author themselves will put <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>, while other parties may declare existing text from <a href="UnknownDonor.html">UnknownDonor</a> to avoid "putting words" in the original author's mouth. It may seem trivial to make such a distinction, but misunderstandings have a tendency to trigger flamewars.
