        Big Thud Code Caused By Big Thud Methodologies
      </h1>
      <p>
        Today I was looking at some code.
        It looked like:
      </p>
      <code>
        main(int argc,char *argv[])<br/>
        {<br/>
        for(int i=0;i<argc;i++)<br/>
        {<br/>
        if(strcmp(argv[i],"State1")<br/>
        prog_state=state1;<br/>
        ....<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        with tons of such if/switch statements in most of the routines.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many of the critical functions were hard to find, hidden in the details needed for the program to run. After a while I came to realize that this code was created by a BigThud methodology as described in <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>'s <a href="TheAlmightyThud.html">TheAlmightyThud</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sorry, where's the evidence that this code was "created by" any methodology over another? Is a poor implementation of a parser your only evidence? If so, please try harder.</em>
      </p>

        The point I was trying to make is that BigThud methodologies produce big thud code ie code where the essence of the program is obscured by all the details. -- <a href="ThaddeusOlczyk.html">ThaddeusOlczyk</a>

        <em>"Essence of the program"...hmm. Perhaps if the essence of the </em>design<em> was laid out before the </em>code<em> was created, that would clear things up? Otherwise, what is being obscured? Implementation? Wouldn't the simplest of comments in front of files and functions lend clarity to that?</em>
