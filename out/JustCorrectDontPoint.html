        Just Correct Dont Point
      </h1>
      <p>
        A good rule that I have to remind myself to follow:
      </p>
      <p>
        When reading Wiki, you may encounter a mistake (a clear factual error, or a misspelling, etc.) such as the following.
      </p>
      <code>
        ...<a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a>, the inventor of the Java programming language, said in an interview...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You can correct inaccuracies, add more-complete information, remove redundant statements, clean up vandalism, and fix links yourself. The best thing to do is simply to correct the error and no other comment, as follows.
      </p>
      <code>
        ...<a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a>, the inventor of the C++ programming language, said in an interview...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is better style than
      </p>
      <code>
        ...<a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a>, the inventor of the Java programming language, said in an interview...<br/>
        <em>Hey, </em><a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a> invented C++ and not Java.<em></em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        No need to point fingers, berate the original poster, or add a comment. You don't need permission, and you don't need to explain. Adding a note to the page complaining about an inaccurate or incomplete statement wastes everyone's time. Even if such a comment is free of unnecessary invective, it still clutters up the page. So do statements that point out others' mistakes. Simply fixing the problem usually takes less time than does whining about it, and the result is much more valuable. The best way to <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> an error is to remove it completely.
      </p>
      <p>
        This does <em>'not</em> apply to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Matters of opinion (If someone writes "<a href="KillBill.html">KillBill</a> is a great movie", changing "great" to "terrible" is not a valid or nice thing to do)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Matters which are controversial (this has some overlap with opinion).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Any other time when you have reason to believe the original poster <em>meant</em> what he/she said.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also, use caution in <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> speech; as you are messing with the words of an individual and not text which is community property.
