      <p>
        Dave de Vos is <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a> from the Netherlands.
      </p>
      <p>
        He is very interested in subjects like <a href="AgileProcesses.html">AgileProcesses</a>, <a href="FourLayerArchitecture.html">FourLayerArchitecture</a> and <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        His main hobby is playing the <a href="GameOfGo.html">GameOfGo</a>. He has recently reached the level of 4 dan.
        He hopes that one day he will succeed in writing a strong go-playing program (something at which nobody has been successful, in spite of a 1 million dollar prize standing out for more than 5 years now)
