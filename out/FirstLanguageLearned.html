        My first was BASIC, nothing unusual. I'd say that mainly it's affected me in all the ways predicted in <a href="BasicConsideredHarmful.html">BasicConsideredHarmful</a>. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

        BASIC on the Apple II, which predisposed me in a lot of ways:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) I have no patience for compilers (which is why I love the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a> for Java)
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Reflection is no problem to me. (Heck, you had to use <a href="PokeAndPeek.html">PokeAndPeek</a> to do <em>anything</em> on those boxes! I was shocked to learn that people wrote code that <em>was not</em> self-modifying.)

        I always find discussions like [those on <a href="WhyWeHateLisp.html">WhyWeHateLisp</a>] interesting because I was one of the abnormal few whose <em>first</em> language was Lisp. I actually find it quite hard to deal with C for solving most problems, even so-called trivial ones, although I'll use C where I find it fits best (inside Unix, and when writing a small tool with a focused purpose, or when writing a small library with a focused purpose, and only for a certain domain of problems that I can WinBig by using C and leveraging Unix). I hate C for general systems stuff. Who else comes from "non-standard" programming backgrounds (a friend of mine recently confided to me that his first language was APL, and he's definitely warped like myself, only different)? -- <a href="DanMoniz.html">DanMoniz</a>

        Strictly speaking, my first language was BASIC, which I tinkered with on a Tandy 1000TX when I was around 12. I didn't manage to get infected by the programming bug, so I never got farther than tinkering around with tiny programs. My first <em>real</em> programming experience was taking CS 61A, the introductory programming course at <a href="CalBerkeley.html">CalBerkeley</a>, which covers the first four chapters of <a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a>. So unlike many other students, who had been corrupted by Pascal or C++ in high school AP computer science, I had to the opportunity to be blinded by the light of Lisp. <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> is still my <a href="LanguageOfChoice.html">LanguageOfChoice</a>, although I do most of my day-to-day programming in Java. -- <a href="JosephDale.html">JosephDale</a>

        <a href="DartmouthBasic.html">DartmouthBasic</a> on a PDP/11, then BASIC on CP/M, then <a href="AppleSoft.html">AppleSoft</a> Basic (the last Microsoft product I really liked), some 6502 machine code (couldn't afford an assembler, so I had to type things like "60 ED FD"), a little Logo (which we all hated, because you had to declare your variables before using them!), then (believe it or not) Forth, in the form of PaulLutus's GraForth.
      </p>
      <p>
        GraForth was a beautiful language: easy to understand (once you got the hang of <a href="ReversePolishNotation.html">ReversePolishNotation</a>), easy to write structured code in, and yet very close to the machine: words would get compiled down, as I recall, and the code would be put on the stack; the word itself would simply be a JSR to the entry point for the compiled code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Less than a year later, the academics got hold of me, and I learned to love Pascal (which I used commercially as late as 1995). Halfway through college, I learned C from K&R's book and a helpful 16-year-old named Explorer Bob (he'd programmed TinyMUD).

        My first language was BASIC on a Commodore Pet (at the tender age of 5 or so). While not much older, I also learnt LOGO. The first language I actually sat down and studied, though, was Pascal (the MacPascal editor was my first exposure to a syntax-aware editor, and still one of the better ones I've seen). -- <a href="RobertWatkins.html">RobertWatkins</a>.

        My first language was IITRAN, a simple PL/I-like language for students. See "The IITRAN Programming Language", R. Dewar et al, CACM 12(10):569-575 (Oct 1969). My second was FORTRAN, a step down. My third was Snobol4, an awesome three steps up. I learned all of these on my own in one year (1967) without the trauma of late nights and slow turn-around experienced by those taking computer classes. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        [<a href="SinclairZxEightyOne.html">SinclairZxEightyOne</a> <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a> was also the first language in which I did any heavy-duty programming (such as it was), though I had formerly played with TRS-80 BASIC.

I did a little Z-80 assembly, too, as well as a ZX-81 hardware interface project, before getting a <a href="CommodoreVicTwenty.html">CommodoreVicTwenty</a>, and then a <a href="CommodoreSixtyFour.html">CommodoreSixtyFour</a>. So I used CBM BASIC and 6502 assembly. I had to learn <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> for Comp-Sci in High School. Going from free-form BASIC to structured Pascal was refreshing and freeing, as I could finally do some of the things I always wanted but never had the means to.

        I was 9 years old when I first learned programming with Apple ][ BASIC. After a year, I learned 6502 Machine and Assembly language. And then I moved to C and Turbo Pascal, where I had a great difficulty changing my programming style into <a href="StructuredProgramming.html">StructuredProgramming</a>. As I became freshman in university, I studied OOP such as C++ and Java, where I had difficulty as well, moving into another paradigm. Anyway, despite of BASIC being my first language, I wasn't, hopefully, <em>mentally mutilated beyond hope of regeneration</em>(as <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a> said in <a href="QuotesOnProgramDevelopment.html">QuotesOnProgramDevelopment</a>) after all.

        Thinking about the best language to learn first, IMHO, it would be nice if the language and the environment has some sort of interaction as in Interactive Interpreted languages - such as <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, and so on. Lexically and syntactically neat and clean with consistency is very important in order to form a good mind frame and good habit, I suppose. In this vein, I don't think hybrid programming language is a good choice if he/she were to learn more languages in the future.

        My first language was Atari BASIC. It had a lot of nice features like automatic syntax-checking and built-in graphics commands. If one were so inclined, one could write an entire graphical program without one POKE, though it wouldn't have any sprites. I seemed to take to structured programming a little better, probably because I was weaned off the GOTO/GOSUB/FOR-NEXT tar pit by Turbo BASIC, which had all the control structures one needed: WHILE/WEND, REPEAT/UNTIL, and even multi-line IF/THEN/ELSE, and named procedures. It had some advanced commands to provide other ways to alter memory than singular POKEs and PEEKs, often eliminating the need for in-line machine language routines that did the same thing in more inefficient and obfuscated ways. It was also three times faster than Atari BASIC, and almost completely backwards-compatible. There was even a compiler to make programs even faster. It gave me a greater appreciation for C when I finally learned it. -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        I started with Spectrum Basic when I was about 7 or 8 but I was saved by C64 Basic. It was such a horrible and crude language that learning 6502 Assembler was the only sane course of action. Imagine a language with line numbers which forced you to use goto because you didn't have subroutines or functions. Then make it really, really slow. Then provide no abstraction of the underlying hardware so that doing anything with sound or graphics involved setting bits in registers on chips. You haven't lived till you've written Basic programs with a memory map by your side. After that kind of beginning everything else looks good by comparison. -- <a href="AdewaleOshineye.html">AdewaleOshineye</a>

        Started with 8080 & Z80 assembly. This was a "near miss" - I <em>almost</em> started with BASIC. One of my most enlightening moments was the day I examined the assembler and C output in <a href="CodeView.html">CodeView</a> together and realized, "oh, is <em>that</em> all they're doing!" Truly liberating: I realized there is no magic in the abstractions of higher level languages - it all comes down to assembly. The shrouds of mystery became gossamer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assembly gave me the grounding in "<a href="GoodTightCode.html">GoodTightCode</a>" and what's really going on in the box; <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> opened the vistas of abstraction and iterative incremental coding with factoring and discrete component modelling, and C introduced me to structure and modularity.

        I think I can up the strangeness ante somewhat. I was tempted to write qbasic, as that is what I first truly programmed in. But it wouldn't do the fact justice, that I told my teacher I knew how to program BASIC, without ever touching qbasic before in my life, and proved so by finishing all her tests successfully in the first session. The truth is that several years earlier, before I ever thought of programming a friend of my father's, who was an engineer introduced me to visual basic 1.0. I did my first VB without a single line of code. It was a slide show of images simply advancing on the press of a "next" button. I never grokked programming at the time and didn't do anything else either. But it let me jump right into qbasic, pretending I was master programmer extraordinaire. Then soon the switch of Pascal (not without writing a qbasic game that the whole school played in breaks for top scores). And I'm still at it (Delphi now). The truth is, I did object-oriented programming from the beginning; it seemed natural, even though my teacher had no clue about it. OK, my programs were 70% assembly, but that was graphics stuff. Today I write in my own languages, the compilers and interpreters still written in basically Pascal. I can't see what's wrong with it ;)

        Haven't seen this one yet... I taught myself to program (around 1990, age 10) in TI-BASIC on a Texas Instruments TI-40 console that plugged into our TV and used solid-state cartridges for software. Unfortunately it had no hard drive, and I never bothered with the system for hooking up a cassette recorder to save data, so power-off was the end of my code. I wrote a fairly large Adventure-type game, among smaller projects, all written out in pencil on notebook paper and typed in afresh each coding session. Nobody ever told me about subroutines, so I didn't use them (I don't even know if TI-BASIC had them) - it was all a mess of GOTOs. I suppose there's no worse way to learn programming concepts: at least it taught me to type fast, and to be economical with lines of code (not necessarily a good lesson). Soon graduated to a Zenith PC (MS-DOS 3.1) and was lost in the wonders of QBasic and Nibbles-hacking (4-player TurboNibbles with blinking and shifting walls!!).

        BASIC (I was born in 77). When I was 6-7, I typed BASIC programs into my sister's TI-99/4A. Even though my understanding was limited, I suspect it primed me for logical thinking.

        When I was 13, I discovered the book OhPascal and that was my first "true" programming language.

        OO programming did not come easily to me.

        So there I was with a 5" floppy, trying to make this so called game work by typing the file name in at the prompt. It didn't. After a few phone conversations, I opened the executable in a hex editor, switched some numbers here and there and voila. My next language was Logo/Turtle, Basic, Assembly, QBasic, C, C++, Java, Ruby, Small Talk and then Self. With a few side trips into Perl/Python, Scheme/Lisp, ML, and others of that sort (college made me do it... Go figure).

        Well, we started with MS QBasic at school, but we had some kind of interpreter programme before, called Roo. In it you had to program a kangaroo to draw a picture with its tail. Worse than aforementioned Turtle/Logo. Had only Jump, Walk, Turn (left) and If See Border, While Not See Border.

        SOAP stands for the (IBM 650) Symbolic Optimizing Assmbler Program. I used it in 1959. The 650 stored data on a rotating magnetic drum, containing 2000 words (40 bands of 50 words each, I think)! While you were executing an instruction, the drum was turning, so every instruction had an extra field containing the address of its successor instruction. If the successor was too close (turnwise) to the one you were executing, you missed a revolution, and your program would be <em>really</em> slow; too far, and the instruction unit had to wait for the drum to come around! That's why you needed an optimizing assembler! It also meant it was impossible to backtrack to find a problem! Bell Labs built a neat interpreter for this machine called BLIS, and I have had a soft spot for interpreters ever since! -- <a href="PaulMorrison.html">PaulMorrison</a>

        Like so many other people, I started with BASIC. I was five years old at the time, and my dad was going back to college to get a degree in information systems. We had an Apple IIgs at home (I can still remember, to this day, what the store looked like that we purchased it from, despite having only been 4 at the time), and I was watching dad, and I wanted to do what he was doing. So he pulled out a 5.25" floppy, formatted it, copied on PRODOS and BASIC.SYSTEM, and gave me the manuals. I twiddled with Pascal some (got started with that the same way -- asked my dad. It was TML Pascal, and I never did figure out how to use its much-touted graphics capabilities) but I never really learned enough to make use of the language. Lack of GOTO confused me at the time. QBasic on a 386 following that, then Visual Basic 2.0 on a 486 following that, upgrading to 3 and 6 in later years. Somewhere in there I learned some 6502/6510 assembler. C++ in high school, mIRC scripting (hey, that's some powerful stuff), TI-BASIC and Z80 assembler (for a TI-86) on my own after that, and last year I added Scheme to my list of languages. While we're sharing anecdotes, I've got a couple. I had to take a BASIC course in high school as a prerequisite to the C++ class. (They let me skip the Intro to BASIC class, but Structured Programming in BASIC was still required.) I went in knowing more about BASIC than my teacher did. She had to pull out the language reference to look up some of the keywords I used. (Tell me, just WHAT is wrong with using DEFSTR?) And then, well, let's just say that technically I don't know Java. I've never studied it. AP exams got me out of taking Intro to Programming in college, and they taught Java in that class. Yet when I took Graphical User Interfaces, our assignments were in Java -- and I got them turned in. It's amazing what you can fake with the right knowledge of C++, eh? -- <a href="CodaHighland.html">CodaHighland</a>

        Oh yeah, one more anecdote while I'm thinking about it. I booted up my old Apple IIgs a few years ago. It's still in perfect condition, though some of the floppy disks have suffered from age. I caught myself writing in Applesoft BASIC using structured programming and a few aspects of object-oriented, using arrays with and constants for array indices to simulate structures. -- <a href="CodaHighland.html">CodaHighland</a>

        First, I learned Integer Basic and Applesoft Basic on Apple II computers by hitting Ctrl+C on computers at the computer stores, and playing with the code. Subsequently, I did more playing with Apple IIs at the local library, and learned 6502 Assembly, so I could write better graphics and sound programs. Later, on an Atari ST, 68020 Assembly, Modula II, Pascal, then C. Later, on PCs, C and C++. When I got actual jobs programming, it was desktp DBMS languages - Paradox PAL, <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>, Access/VBA, then VB. Of course, occasional bash, bits of Perl, etc., along the way.

        Since then, many assembly languages. Still learning more programming languages. One of these days I'll get around to Lisp.

        I was started on the path with a programming class on Logo at the local science center. About fifteen years ago we got our first computer - an Apple ][gs - and I taught myself Integer BASIC. The first non-trivial program I wrote was a Logo-like interpreter because we couldn't afford to buy the program. Later on I read a book on C from the local library yet couldn't try any of the programs since we couldn't afford a C compiler or linker.

        Nine years ago we purchased a PC with a modem and CD-ROM drive, and I read about C++ and Java on the internet. It was amazing to me that we could actually compile programs for free. In the last four years, I've read enough to understand some Perl, Python, Lisp, XSLT, VB, among others. But I still often think in Logo. :-p
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that everyone should start with Logo. It teaches the concepts of command, paramaters, functions, loops, and recursion in a way almost anyone can understand. There is hardly any grammar to learn and it isn't complicated to read (unlike C or Lisp). Other courses tend to focus more on the syntax and libraries (esp. those on C++ or Java) of a language. Even BASIC is too complicated for a beginner with no experience programming, I think.

        I learned Logo on Commodore 64s back in the third grade. In retrospect, that was wonderful experience: It had me thinking about recursion and subfunctions starting really early on.

Later, I upgraded to a CommodoreAmiga, which used the 68000 processor, where I stuck with assembly language until I could afford a C compiler. I only switched to C, by the way, because it was "cool." I was immensely productive with plain assembly language. I, to this day, still posit that C is no more productive than plain assembly. (C++ and other OO-languages, however, are demonstrably higher level and more convenient to use.)

        <em>At the same time,</em> I was going to Mohawk Valley Community College, taking Pascal courses. Worst. Experience. Ever. (Funny, because I <em>love</em> Oberon.) Pascal has had a <em>significantly negative</em> impact on my coding; I claim that it set me back to the stone ages of programming. BASIC was positively superior to Pascal, in my experience.
      </p>
      <p>
        From there I moved into REXX programming (since AmigaOS 2.04 came with ARexx standard), and into other programming languages, like Lisps, Haskell, Forth, etc. (in no particular order).
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as impact on me? BASIC had <strong>zero impact</strong> on my ability to program. When I was working for a small code-monkey shop back in Utica, NY, we had to deliver a dentistry application using VisualBASIC 3. I found myself unable to implement certain control constructs in it easily, so I resorted to implementing a simple "virtual machine", where I had an array of integer "registers" (DIM I%(15) or so), floating point "registers" (DIM F(15)), etc. I also had used arrays for lots of other tasks, and had maintained "pointers" (indices) into these arrays. The result was working code. Yes, I programmed in a virtual assembly language, implemented in BASIC. It worked, it was pretty fast, and we got paid. Good times! (Unbeknownst to me, I had inadvertently re-invented the stack-base virtual machine, as each type of array had its own "base pointer," allowing me Forth-like control constructs.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I prefer to code in Forth, which also usually lacks higher-level data structuring capabilities out of the box. While I enjoy its structured programming capabilities, I still use the ColumnMajor database approach towards representing collections of objects that I search through often, and arrays of RowMajor structures for things which are not searched through frequently.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've found that periodically resizing arrays is not that expensive in terms of runtime as well, especially if you grow your array by an amount that is a function of what is already in use (e.g., Fibonacci growth), and of how often it grows (the longer it's been since it grew, the less likely you'll be adding mega quantities of data to the structure, so you can cut back on the growth rate).

Great fun, at the time. I then didn't have a computer to use until three years later, by which time the school had a room full of (already dated) Apple IIe computers, which gave me a chance to actually understand what I'd been typing in the first time through.

        Another big influence was RoboWar, a game where you programmed virtual robots that would try to move around on screen and kill each other. The game used a sort of stack machine assembler, like Forth without any introspection, and as a leveling mechanism each robot only could execute a fixed number of opcodes per time step. There was an annual RoboWar tournament, all entries to be included in the next release of RoboWar so people could see how the winners ticked and evolve their strategy. One of my Hypercard creations was a utility to translate infix math formulas into postfix, to help me write Robocode.
