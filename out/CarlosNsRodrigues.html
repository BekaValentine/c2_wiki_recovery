        Hello Wiki!
      </p>
      <p>
        Time has passed.  I was a WikiExPatriot for a bit but now I'm back.  For a visit or for a long stay?  Time will tell.
      </p>
      <p>
        Though I'm a Portuguese South African, I discovered <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> while living in the States.  I am now in Ireland and gainfully employed at a company that has been treating me well.  I'm coding mainly in my first love: <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> but I hope to pick up some <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> on my own time.  I'm also curious to try the Lisp-dialect, <a href="ArcLanguage.html">ArcLanguage</a>, that <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> is working on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I run <a href="GentooLinux.html">GentooLinux</a> on my home computer and <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> on my work computer (sprinkled with the many <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> programs that I like and have grown accustomed to using).  I am currently looking forward to Enlightenment 17 (see the movie to see what I mean: <a href="http://www.enlightenment.org/data/vid/e17_video.avi)">http://www.enlightenment.org/data/vid/e17_video.avi)</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that I'm less of a <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> now, but I still hope to be of some benefit to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> and the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> at large.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's good to "re-discover" <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> again.

        Hello Wiki!
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that Wiki is a great idea and tons better than <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>. Thank you, Ward.

        Within the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a>, I aspire to be a <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a> with ambitions to be a <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a>. Are there any WikiRitesOfPassage that I should know about? ;) Right now though, I'll work my way up from <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a> and ShyContributor.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently an unemployed software developer. :( So it goes. (This is a <a href="KurtVonnegut.html">KurtVonnegut</a>ism, found in his <a href="SlaughterhouseFive.html">SlaughterhouseFive</a> novel) *shrug* It's one of those intermediary stages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right now, I live in the United States of America, but I was born and raised in the Republic of South Africa and I have a Portuguese heritage. So I'm a closet sympathizer of Wiki's E.U. ontributors, while having an acquired fondness for my American friends and hosts.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have an adventurous and carefree spirit, so I am hoping that my skills and career will lead me all around the world. I am trying to realize this be applying for work throughout the U.S., the U.K, Australia, and in Ireland.

        I have been a *nix enthusiast for a long time, but I have only recently jumped in with both feet. (The last straw was <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> -- which I feel is an insult to all NT Administrators everywhere.) I am currently whetting my teeth on <a href="MandrakeLinux.html">MandrakeLinux</a> and <a href="LinuxFromScratch.html">LinuxFromScratch</a>. I am also looking for an OpenSourceProject to which to contribute. Any one have any suggestions? The <a href="MonoProject.html">MonoProject</a> has lately started to appeal to me.

        (<strong>To Elaborate</strong>:  switching from Windows2000 to WindowsXP, I dis-liked the even more impoverished command-line shell in WindowsXP and the bubble pop-ups were driving me CRAZY!  Add to that the "Reporting Back to Mother Microsoft" feature and the fact that I had to re-install three-times in the first month, I then revolted.  From then on I used Windows2000 for gaming and Linux for everything else.  What I especially like about Linux are the plethora of easily available developer tools and the range of different window-managers (desktop/explorer in WindowsSpeak) & virtual desktops (emulated by the Multiple Desktop Power Toy).  Once I finally had an operating system with abundant software and that offered me unbounded control of what was installed and what wasn't, I couldn't go back.)

        I have removed a discussion about how the grammar rule "do not end sentences with a preposition" is out-dated.  The discussion itself was interesting but it cluttered up the page.  If  I thought that there was more of an interest in it, I would've re-factored then re-posted it as a new <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a>.  If I get three votes to do it I will.

        (That grammar rule) is not as fashionable nowadays as it used to be. See <a href="http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19991013.">http://www.randomhouse.com/wotd/index.pperl?date=19991013.</a> -- <a href="JohnKugelman.html">JohnKugelman</a>

        Actually (as I just learned in Linguistics this week), that's a particle at the end. A preposition has to come before a noun phrase (this is definitional, not prescriptive - linguists tend to frown on prescriptive grammar anyway). Don't have my notes with me, but if you catch me tomorrow I can go over all the "constituency tests" that let us determine where the constituent boundaries are, and hence the parts of speech. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a> <em>(you're taking notes, right?)</em>
