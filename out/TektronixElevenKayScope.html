        Tektronix Eleven Kay Scope
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="TektronixInc.html">TektronixInc</a> 11xxx series of sampling oscilloscopes is well known among many members of this Wiki, for being an example of a successful embedded deployment of <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>.  The 11k, as it is commonly known, was a staple of the Tek product line for quite a few years.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 11k featured a <a href="MotorolaSixtyEightKay.html">MotorolaSixtyEightKay</a> processor, ample memory, and a little light on the main circuit board that turned on whenever the <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a> ran.  It used an embedded Smalltalk environment from OTI, and contrary to many doubters, performance was not an issue.  (Unfortunately, the product abandoned the traditional UI model that oscilloscopes have, and got a reputation for being difficult to use.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Smalltalk enviroment was used in several other Tek scopes as well, the 11k was the one which survived the longest.
      </p>
      <p>
        The 11k series now has been discontinued (Tek stopped manfuacturing them a few years ago).  You can still find them used (early models can be got for pretty cheap, too).  Tek's high-end scopes are now mostly PCs with special purpose acquisition and signal-processing hardware (and a customized, scope-like case).
