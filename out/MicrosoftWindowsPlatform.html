        Microsoft Windows Platform
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MicrosoftWindowsPlatform.html">MicrosoftWindowsPlatform</a> refers to the combination of <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> and a plethora of applications and tools that are often dependent on the underlying operating system, now increasingly fused with the <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the middle of the first decade of the 21st century, the <a href="MicrosoftWindowsPlatform.html">MicrosoftWindowsPlatform</a> is starting to see challenges from the <a href="LampPlatform.html">LampPlatform</a>, and the adoption of <a href="WampPlatform.html">WampPlatform</a> is also considered a serious threat by the worlds largest software company. An example of this erosion is seen in laptops that are sold in retail shops without the <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> operating system.

        The <a href="GreatestMarketingCompanyInTheWorld.html">GreatestMarketingCompanyInTheWorld</a> is now shifting its focus to attacking the <a href="MiddleWare.html">MiddleWare</a> market, a place where <a href="JavaAndDotNet.html">JavaAndDotNet</a> come together. It is a battle between <a href="MicrosoftEnterpriseComputing.html">MicrosoftEnterpriseComputing</a> and <a href="JtwoeeEnterpriseComputing.html">JtwoeeEnterpriseComputing</a>. In Aug05 a new MS Chief Operating Officer has been recruited from Walmart (Samsclub) and whose extensive <a href="SupplyChainManagement.html">SupplyChainManagement</a> expertise will be invaluable in this battle of the titans.

        In a few years time, as the "framework of the decade" (MS reference to <a href="DotNetFramework.html">DotNetFramework</a>) evolves, <a href="MicrosoftWindowsPlatform.html">MicrosoftWindowsPlatform</a> application and tools will require the use of <a href="WindowsCommunicationFoundation.html">WindowsCommunicationFoundation</a>, and other new features (e.g. Avalon) that will come with <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a>.
