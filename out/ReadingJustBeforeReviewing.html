        Reading Just Before Reviewing
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... the panel of reviewers is assembled, and
        their work is set before them.
        The goal of the <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> is to
        improve the work while validating the author.
        But reviewer input should be validated, too.
        Reviewers come in good standing because
        the <a href="WorkshopComprisesAuthors.html">WorkshopComprisesAuthors</a>, but
        reviewers should become familiar with the work so
        their specific feedback is credible.

        <strong>Everyone who critiques a pattern should have</strong>
        <strong>read it.  It's possible to critique a pattern</strong>
        <strong>from expert knowledge of the subject matter,</strong>
        <strong>but here, we presume that </strong><a href="AuthorsAreExperts.html">AuthorsAreExperts</a><strong></strong>
        <strong>and that the presentation, the "experience" of</strong>
        <strong>the pattern, is the focus of the review.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A reviewer can spend many hours thoroughly</strong>
        <strong>reading a pattern and studying for its review.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A reviewer may research references and track down
        every possible lead.  But most of the leads will be
        dead ends, and most relate to technical details
        beyond the technical scope of the review.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>On the other hand, many reviewers tend to give</strong>
        <strong>a paper only superficial review, or may pore</strong>
        <strong>over the work in real time.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        These reviewers are not only a distraction to the
        review process, but they do the author a disservice.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>If some reviewers prepare thoroughly,</strong>
        <strong>their detailed reviews are likely to swamp</strong>
        <strong>the input of other reviewers.</strong>
        <strong>The volume of well-considered input may</strong>
        <strong>easily mask the sublime insight produced</strong>
        <strong>by a spontaneous review.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reviewers should read the pattern just before</strong>
        <strong>reviewing it.  The pattern will be fresh in</strong>
        <strong>their minds;  the pattern's emotional impact</strong>
        <strong>remains with the reader.  This is sufficient</strong>
        <strong>to assess the literary and aesthetic qualities</strong>
        <strong>of a work.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*   *   *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some reviewers may read and annotate
        other author's
        works far in advance.  If the author permits,
        such reviewers may provide written comments
        to the author, but only after the workshop is done.
