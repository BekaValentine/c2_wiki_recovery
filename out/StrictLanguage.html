        Strict Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a> is one that evaluates the arguments of functions before calling the function.  Compare with a language that uses <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>, where arguments aren't evaluated till needed.  StrictLanguages have the advantage that they are currently faster.  LazyLanguages have a cleaner computational model.  For example, they don't need special code to implement conditional operators.

        <strong>Is 'C' a strict language?:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        But is there any language that is strictly a <a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a>?  Is 'C' a <a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a> - consider ((a && b ) || c )?  There may be disagreement as to what constitutes a function.  I regard both '&&' and 'for()' as functions, just they have slightly odd syntax.  If we restrict attention to <em>user defined functions</em> there are still functions which, like qsort(), take a pointer to a function, only evaluating that function later....  So is 'C' a <a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>C is a </em><a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a>.  If && and for() were functions, you would be able to get a function pointer to them.  Since you can't, they aren't.  Conditional require <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> to work correctly, which is why conditional operators aren't functions in a <a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a>.  qsort() is a strict function.  The pointer is evaluated to the address of the comparison function before qsort() is called.  Same as in strict <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a> like <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> and <a href="MlLanguage.html">MlLanguage</a> where passing functions as arguments is common practice -- <a href="NoelWelsh.html">NoelWelsh</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think being or not being able to get a pointer to the function is relevant.  Suppose instead of && I write my own function called shortableAnd( func * pFunc1, func * pFunc2 );  This function only evaluates argument 2 if argument 1 evaluates to true.  You can take the address of shortableAnd(), so by your definition it is a function.  Now I cook the compiler slightly so that && is actually implemented via shortableAnd() behind the scenes.  The compiler behaves like a C compiler (the implementation is a bit inefficient but heck we can live with that..) but your reason for rejecting && as a true function has now gone.  As I see it && and qsort are now on the same footing.  Have I sufficiently modifed C to stop it being a strict language?  I don't think so.  Saying that something is only a function if you can get a pointer to it I think is therefore a <a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>C is still a </em><a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a>.  Strictness is all about when arguments are evaluated, and not about the ability to pass functions as arguments.  For example, if I call your shortableAnd function as follows:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        shortableAnd(falseFunction, (destroyTheComputer(), trueFunction));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>does the computer get destroyed?  Yes, in C, because destoryTheComputer() is evaluated before shortableAnd is called.  In a language with </em><a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> the computer lives on.  <a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a>, which is online, has a very good discussion on <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> in chapter 4<em></em>

        Do <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> count as <a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a>s?

        <strong>Syntax for Laziness</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The page on <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> argues whether or not <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> MUST incur a significant run time overhead.  I'll leave that argument to that page. <em>(See </em><a href="StrictnessAnalysis.html">StrictnessAnalysis</a> for further discussion)<em> If some cool compiler could make that overhead comparable, say, to compiling from tokenized source code, I'd still see </em><a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> languages like <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> and <a href="CleanLanguage.html">CleanLanguage</a> taking second place on the podium.  What seems to me to be missing is a combination of internal <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> - which makes the compiler design clean and flexible - with an external presentation that is more C like - <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a>.  There have been attempts, but none has yet caught on in a really big way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> The syntax problem that is crying out for a cleaner solution is how in a 'C' like environment to distinguish between calling a function on the result of another function and calling a function to operate on a function as an argument.  If we were extending C to do this, what would be a good choice of syntax?
      </p>
      <p>
        As in <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>, you must be able to distinguish between a function as a value, and applying that function to some arguments.  E.g:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>qsort</strong> evaluates to the <strong>qsort</strong> function
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>qsort(arg1, arg2, arg3)</strong> evaluates to application of the <strong>qsort</strong> function to the given arguments.
      </p>
      <p>
        I humbly suggest you look at <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a> and <a href="LispMacro.html">LispMacro</a>s.  This problem has been addressed by a lot of researchers and elegant solutions have been found to the above problems. -- <a href="NoelWelsh.html">NoelWelsh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, strictness vs. laziness is fully explicit. All message sends are strict, there is only one lazy construct:
        making a block. Thus in something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        object1 isNil or: [object2 isNil]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        , it is explicit that <em>object1 isNil</em> is passed strict and <em>object2 isNil</em> is passed lazily.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Operator&& vs && and other variations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In C++ '||' and '&&' are functions:  operator||(a,b) and operator&&(a,b). All the operatations of the language are really syntatic shortcuts for functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But that does bring up an interesting question:  I don't know how the C/C++ "shortcut evaluation" rules interact with the function syntax of "operatorXX()" definitions.  Normally, all arguments are evaluated before calling a function.  -- </em><a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's true you can define your own '||' and '&&' functions, but these functions have </em><a href="StrictEvaluation.html">StrictEvaluation</a>, not the <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> that the built in functions have.  So the built ins are special cases, and C++ is still a <a href="StrictLanguage.html">StrictLanguage</a>.  -- <a href="NoelWelsh.html">NoelWelsh</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What about if you use 'inline' with your operator&&() definition?  If your user defined '&&' uses an if(), shouldn't the compiler be smart enough to NOT to evaluate the second argument if it doesn't need to, or is this possibility nailed by the <a href="LanguageLawyer.html">LanguageLawyer</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't know if the language allows what you suggest.  If it does then effectively you're writing a macro.  </em><a href="LispMacro.html">LispMacro</a>s are commonly used by Lisp hackers to add new control structures to the language.  I feel it's better to add a well thought out macro system (say, with hygenic macros like <a href="DefineSyntax.html">DefineSyntax</a> that is provided by the <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>) then abuse function inlining to fake macros. -- <a href="NoelWelsh.html">NoelWelsh</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Inline functions are supposed to have the same behavior as normal functions; they're not macros. So all arguments must be evaluated before checking the "inlined" code. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>
