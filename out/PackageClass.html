        Package Class
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> idiom where a class is used as a namespace, in order to implement pseudo-packages.  Some say this is unnecessary, given that C++ also has namespaces.  However, it is occasionally useful.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Consequences:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Generally, such a class will only have static members (or else be a singleton); though with the potential to turning into full-fledged objects.
        </li>
        <li>
           Unlike namespaces, which are "open" scopes (any translation unit/header/file/etc. can add stuff to a namespace and the linker is responsible for dealing with collisions), <a href="PackageClass.html">PackageClass</a>es are closed scopes.  They must be defined in exactly one place.
        </li>
        <li>
           As they are classes, you can do with them anything you can do with any other class--make them friends of something, inherit from them, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Access control works; you can have private members of the class and thus limit your external API to the public parts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>This works well enough in </em><a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> too.<em>  Of course, Java has true "packages"; which are similar to the </em><a href="PackageClass.html">PackageClass</a> (except that they are singletons by default).
