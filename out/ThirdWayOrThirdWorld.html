        Third Way Or Third World
      </h1>
      <p>
        There seems to be two ways of addressing "offshoring".
      </p>
      <p>
        One is to just allow the *new* imbalance to "take its course". The old imbalance built the privileged societies and corporations that currently exist. The new imbalance would have the privileged corporations move operations to under-privileged societies "unchecked", i.e. at the expense of the privileged societies.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second is to have the privileged societies employ "protections" in an effort to maintain the current imbalance. The obvious disadvantage is the under-privileged societies would remain so.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third way would attempt to "win-win", i.e. obtain most of the advantages of the other two approaches while minimizing the disadvantages. A couple of ideas (<a href="http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2004_03_07_patricklogan_archive.html#107920268329335102):">http://patricklogan.blogspot.com/2004_03_07_patricklogan_archive.html#107920268329335102):</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One, corporations moving operations to poorer societies should share half of their savings with those societies at large. This would be an "international tax" for the benefit of lifting up the imbalanced, poorer societies those corporations are <strong>taking advantage</strong> of.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Two, the governments of the more privileged societies should legislate incentives and investments toward "sustainable" technologies and behaviors. We obviously need to do more with less in privileged societies that currently use more than our fare share of resources that make us "privileged" in the first place, and we need to set the course for those societies that will follow in our path. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are two ways to "grow the pie" for all of us, to address imbalances that have been falling out of balance for decades with too little leadership.

        Wow. Regardless of whether I think this will work or not: It's this kind of post that gives me hope for humanity.
