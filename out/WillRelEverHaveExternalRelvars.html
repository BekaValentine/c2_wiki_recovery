        Will Rel Ever Have External Relvars
      </h1>
      <p>
        Waiting for external relvar support in <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> since 2008... will it ever become true? or is it just too hard a problem to be solved in the near future (in other words, its something better left for much later) or is it just not a priority?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd love to see it happen, and finally be able to use Rel as something more than just a nice interactive toy...
      </p>

        <em>It's a priority, but not a high priority.  It's actually trivial to implement (with certain usually-acceptable constraints), but since Rel is primarily used as a teaching tool and a working model of </em><a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> principles, development necessarily focuses heavily on those areas.  The code for external relvars is still disassembled on my workbench.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, the </em><a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> is <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, so if you're interested in external <a href="RelVar.html">RelVar</a>s you should download the source and implement them!  I'd be happy to provide advice, suggestions and guidance.  Also, I'm giving a talk on the subject of external relvars in Rel at a workshop in Newcastle, UK in early June 2011, so I'll definitely have a working implementation before then.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
