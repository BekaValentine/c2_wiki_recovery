        Hydroxic Acid
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think the name "hydroxic acid" is incorrect to name the water (H2O). Maybe it should be called (in addition to "<a href="HydrogenHydroxide.html">HydrogenHydroxide</a>", which is correct): "oxhydric acid", just like "chlorhydric acid" is HCl.
      </p>
      <p>
        The words with the suffix -hydric come from the element located at the right side of the formula, not from the left side. In HCl, the chlorine --in the right side of the formula-- generates the adjective "chlorhydric". Thus, if the oxygen is at the right side of "H2O", it should generate the adjective "oxhydric". Please tell me if you have some comments about this I have written. From Guadalajara, Mexico, Alejandro Ochoa. tradu4@hotmail.com

        Under the international standard HCl is called hydrochloric, not chlorhydric (although I guess industry sometimes uses the latter).

        <em>It is, of course, also known as </em><a href="DihydrogenMonoxide.html">DihydrogenMonoxide</a>, or DHMO.<em></em>

        Okay, you are all right. I apologize because I stated a wrong concept. It is right to call "hydrochloric acid", "hydrogen hydroxide", and something I did not know, DiHydrogenMonoxide.

        Actually "hydroxic acid" is a correct name for water. Under IUPAC nomenclature, the correct names for water are dihydrogen monoxide and hydroxic acid depending on whether you consider water an acid, which it is in some ways, but in other ways it is not.

        -Water is considered an acid and a base, making both names appropriate. In pure water, small amounts of H2O will dissociate with each other to form hydrogen and hydroxide ions, just like any Bronsted-Lowry acid or base.
