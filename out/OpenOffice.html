        The relationship between the previous version of <a href="StarOffice.html">StarOffice</a> (5.2), the current <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> (1.1.x), and the current <a href="StarOffice.html">StarOffice</a> (<a href="StarOffice.html">StarOffice</a> 7), is somewhat analogous to the relationship between <a href="NetScape.html">NetScape</a> 4.x, <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a> 1.x.x, and <a href="NetScape.html">NetScape</a> 6-7.x.

        <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a> bought <a href="StarOffice.html">StarOffice</a> from a company called StarDivision, and released the source code. The <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> project has fairly significantly modified the code, which forms the basis for the new releases of <a href="StarOffice.html">StarOffice</a>. -- <a href="JosephDale.html">JosephDale</a>

        The most refreshing and revolutionary feature about both <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> and <a href="StarOffice.html">StarOffice</a> 6 is the abandonment of the proprietary binary format for user files, so well exploited by Microsoft over the last 10 or so years, and the (re)introduction of a pure ascii format, now updated to XML. This could be the most important change in computing philosophy for many years and could begin to break the monopoly that MS has enjoyed for so long.

        <em>The next version of MS Office will also use an XML file format</em>

      <p>
        Anyone know if the two XML formats will be compatible? There is probably an infinite number of ways that XML could be used to define document structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        No they won't be same. And only the Enterprise and Professional releases will have this support, not Standard.

        Even if they are not, writing a translator should be trivial.

        <strong>It is far from trivial. </strong><a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> released the specs only to give a good impression, not because they wanted to help the competition. Still, it seems like <a href="OpenOfficeOrg.html">OpenOfficeOrg</a> post 1.1.x is doing pretty well in translating <a href="MicrosoftOffice.html">MicrosoftOffice</a> files!<strong></strong>

        After looking at moderately complicated XML schemas (such as the <a href="DocBook.html">DocBook</a> DTD and the <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> XML Specification) and looking at <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a>s machine-generated HTML output, I'm guessing that writing a translator would not be <em>trivial</em>. It would take some hard work to create and maintain (perhaps an upcoming project for <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a>?). But the XSLT stylesheets were written, imagine the rejoicing... Seamless translation between the formats, as well as output to <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a>, <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>, <a href="RichTextFormat.html">RichTextFormat</a>, HTML, PDF, <a href="YaddaYaddaYadda.html">YaddaYaddaYadda</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It would definitely not be trivial, as </em><a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a>'s XML output will apparently not contain any formatting information. And for those who claim that XML's supposed to be like HTML and not have that, please, get a clue. For WYSIWYG word processor documents, formatting information is part of the content.<em></em>

        <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> is supposed to have a scriptable <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> called UNO. Apparently bindings exist for <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and something called StarBasic. Anyone tried to script or write apps around it? If it were done right (like KParts), it could be a real boon for <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>.

        Related to <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> is the OASIS project whose aim is to come up with document standards. <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> embraces this effort.

        My wife does copy-editing and proof-reading. The material is sent to her by (encrypted) email in Word format and she would dearly love to switch to using <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a>. However, <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> repeatedly screws up the formatting and she is forced to continue using Word. For everything else we use Linux. Suggestions welcome.

        <em></em><a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> suffers from the common problem facing lots of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects. Developers are either not sufficiently motivated after a while, or get religious about the superiority of their favorite approach and cannot cooperate for the greater good. Similar to ContentGeneration at <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That having been said, the new </em><a href="MicrosoftOffice.html">MicrosoftOffice</a> can perhaps offer a new opportunity for <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a>. The significant UI changes can alienate existing users and developers. Maybe the steep learning curve of its XML will also help check the mindless migration to the next version of MSO as dictated by Redmond cashflow needs.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps. I have yet to see anything other than M$ products properly treat files generated by M$ Office products. No doubt M$ inserts all manner of kaka that only their products can interpret properly. I for one am not interested in either chasing down the land mines that M$ inserts into their output nor fixing the formatting and other problems that come up when trying to translate to <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> or any other productivity package.
      </p>
      <p>
        As much as I hate M$, I am stuck using M$ Office until my clients and development partners all switch over to something else. Oy. Imagine my joy. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        I find the later versions have less problems with MSO Documents than described previously. It's improved with each release, and they're discussing version 1 above. 3.1 is much nicer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, this is so. However, problems remain. It seems likely that this is less of an application side than a source side issue, since Microsoft is well known for burying MS-only details in their output.</em>

        <dd><em>I have virtually no problems round-tripping MS Word documents to and from current versions of </em><a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> (or rather, <a href="LibreOffice.html">LibreOffice</a>).  I haven't had MS Office around in years, and really haven't missed it except for one occasion where OO Impress advanced features didn't translate to equivalent <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a> features on export. Except in special cases, these MS Office conversion issues are pretty much a thing of the past. Of course, MS Office files really shouldn't be used as an interchange format anyway; they're really not meant to preserve formatting reliably between computers (so don't use them in e-mail or on the Web). --<a href="MarnenLaibowKoser.html">MarnenLaibowKoser</a>, 20 Dec 2012<em></em></dd>

        Does anybody know how to make <strong>"connected" arrows</strong> in O-O-Draw? There are arrows and there are connected lines, but I couldn't find something with both. The regular arrows don't "stick" to the shapes such that you have to re-shuffle them if you move the shapes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I just messed around with it (using OO 3.4.1). There are different styles for connected lines under a menu in the connected line tool or you can use the menu in the toolbar next to the pen point thing</em>
