        Multi Language Refactoring
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was musing about to architect a system, using <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>,
        and I quickly realized that I didn't know enough to do a big design up
        front. So it seems that I need to grow it organically, with unit tests,
        refactoring, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        So then I started asking myself a few more questions: Where should I start?
        should I set up just one xUnit testRunner, or one for each language? Assuming
        the former, which xUnit should I use for the base classes? (the system will
        probably be a mix of Perl, Java, C and C++ (plus a bit of Verilog to keep life
        interesting :).
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there are the questions regarding the true practicality of refactoring
        between languages. How easy is it to extract a c++ method into Java? Or
        extract a Perl superclass from a C++ blob? (I assume you first extract the
        thing in its native language, and then perform a SubstituteLanguage refactoring)
      </p>
      <p>
        I am hoping that anyone with experience with <a href="MultiLanguageRefactoring.html">MultiLanguageRefactoring</a> might
        share their thoughts on this page.

        In a way, I do a much smaller version of this with Web applications: code may be refactored across the boundary between client-side <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and the server-side language. In general, I haven't found this to be a big deal as long as you have full-stack <a href="AcceptanceTests.html">AcceptanceTests</a> in place (<a href="CucumberFramework.html">CucumberFramework</a> is great for this). In this case, it works pretty much like a single-language refactoring. --<a href="MarnenLaibowKoser.html">MarnenLaibowKoser</a>, 2 Dec 2014
