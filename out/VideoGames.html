        Video Games

        'Video Games' is the broadest category of interactive electronic entertainment, encompassing ArcadeGames, <a href="ComputerGame.html">ComputerGame</a>s, HandHeldGames and ConsoleGames.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although early electronic games first made the scene as stand-up cabinets in bars and other public places (or on University Mainframes), electronic games really hit the public when they became ubiquitous on personal computers.  The games available on PCs, though often less polished than the offerings in the arcades, were recognized as being more innovative, more technically interesting, and certainly more convenient to play.

        Currently (2004) <a href="VideoGames.html">VideoGames</a> refers almost exclusively to ConsoleGames, which have an apparently iron-vice grip on the industry.  This is the result of a complicated feedback system which can be summarized as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Console Games are more profitable
        </li>
        <li>
           More mony can be spent on their development
        </li>
        <li>
           better games
        </li>
        <li>
           more sales
        </li>
        <li>
           Console Games are even more profitable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Not to mention:  Console games are developed to a more stable platform (no need to worry how much RAM or gigaherz the computer has, or what type of graphics or sound card), they are much more difficult to pirate, and a "home theatre" system (or even a 19" set in the family room) is a much cooler (ergonomically convenient) place to play games than is a PC on a desk.  That said, many game consoles (ie the Xbox) have architectural similarities to PCs</em>

        <a href="VideoGames.html">VideoGames</a> are generally grouped by 'genre', such as Shooter, Real-Time-Strategy, Simulation, Fighting, and so forth.  Note that these are actually mechanics, not genres.  It's unfortunate that the 'genre' label has become ubiquitous.

        Despite the obvious difference in development styles, all forms of <a href="VideoGames.html">VideoGames</a> share basic principles of design.

        Noah Falstein had an excellent collection of principles

        I noticed that there was a page for <a href="ComputerGame.html">ComputerGame</a>s, but none for <a href="VideoGames.html">VideoGames</a>.  My first Wiki project is to introduce a few pages dealing with <a href="VideoGames.html">VideoGames</a> and <a href="GameDesign.html">GameDesign</a>.
