        Assume Ignorance Not Malice
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ignorance is often taken to mean not knowing something. More precisely, it is the process of willfully ignoring things. This can save time and turmoil. But beware: <strong>Ignorance looks like stupidity</strong>.

      <p>
        <em>Ignorant about ignorance, I had thought it was willfulness-neutral. A couple of local dictionaries seem to agree that one can be ignorant through accident or design.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And I was certain ignorance was willfulness-neutral, and that stupidity was willful ignorance. Perhaps the text is an example of what it describes? Though that would depend on whether it's ignorant or stupid.

        [<em>Ignorant</em> refers to a lack of knowledge or awareness. (<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ignorant)">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=ignorant)</a> <em>Stupid</em> indicates a lack of intelligence or an inability to learn, to overcome ignorance. (<a href="http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=stupid)">http://dictionary.reference.com/search?q=stupid)</a> Sometimes, our ignorance itself can make us stupid. (<a href="UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt.html">UnskilledAndUnawareOfIt</a>.) But neither term in itself implies will or intent. Moreover, in actual use, <em>stupid</em> frequently implies an <em>innate</em> inability to learn; therefore, the term should be used with utmost care in order to ward off misunderstandings.]
