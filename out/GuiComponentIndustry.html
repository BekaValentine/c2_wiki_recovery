        Gui Component Industry
      </h1>
      <p>
        A rather large industry that formed around <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, and to a lesser extent <a href="BorlandDelphi.html">BorlandDelphi</a>, in which (more or less) plug-and-play components, usually <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a> components, could be popped in and used immediately. For example, if the default "grid" component in VB was not powerful enough, such as not providing colored cells, there were a slew of vendors that provided fancier grids. The catalog grew to hundreds of widgets and libraries. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This greatly reduced the need for custom GUI programming because there often was at least one vendor who offered something close to what you wanted. The biggest vendor was <a href="http://www.vbxtras.com/">http://www.vbxtras.com/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The industry seems to have scattered some since the end of <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> and the rise of web, <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>, and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.
