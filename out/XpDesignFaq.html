        I'm about as semi-official as you can get.

        XP isn't language specific, although the things you have to do need to be 
        adjusted. Strictness of typing isn't one of the issues, although the 
        language contortions it takes to support strict typing may be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Strict-typing languages like C++ and Java induce you to declare something 
        in one place, then define it in another, then use it in a third. They 
        generally won't let you use something before you go somewhere else first. 
        It's a bit like having to pitch your tent every night before going to bed. 
        It worked well for the nomads but it's not terribly efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Types are comments and assertions. They stand as compile-time checks because the most native constraint is that a value never change types unless under programmer control. Dynamic languages crack this by always absolving the check on the assumed type.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition, most implementations of these languages are compile-link-run 
        in nature, rather than incremental compilers. This isn't necessary, but it 
        is the way things turned out.
      </p>
      <p>
        The effects of these characteristics are that (a) you have to edit in more 
        places to do any given refactoring, and (b) as your program grows, it takes 
        longer to install a change and test it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The non-strict languages, such as Smalltalk and LISP and, yes, Python, 
        throw up fewer of these obstacles. If refactorings allow you to change less 
        code, refactorings are easier, quicker, less error-prone. If you can move 
        from change to test in one second instead of 1 minute, you can make smaller 
        changes, again reducing error.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Smalltalk, there are some additional advantages. The ordinary Smalltalk 
        browsers let you find and access things in ways that Emacs people can't 
        even imagine. (Yes, I know, you can grep your source files. Smalltalk 
        actually knows what it's looking at.) Even better, the Refactoring Browser 
        actually knows how to DO the refactorings for you. It's a power tool for 
        refactoring.
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages like Smalltalk and LISP have yet another advantage. These 
        languages are written in themselves. They are reflective, which means that 
        there are Smalltalk or LISP statements that can manipulate the running 
        code. This is a good way to kill yourself, but it also means that you can 
        extend the programming environment when you need to. This isn't something 
        for beginners, but it means that you can acquire powerful and valuable 
        tools from experts, and integrate them into the IDE with ease. This, too, 
        used with good judgment, speeds your programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        The cumulative effect of all this is that a competent programmer in these 
        languages can go faster than an equivalently competent programmer in the 
        strict languages. Part of it is due to the cost of strictness, part to the 
        toolset.
      </p>
      <p>
        So ... XP is easier to do in Smalltalk or Python than in C++. It's still 
        quite doable in C++, just not as fast and not at such a small increment of 
        change.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bottom line: There's nothing "wrong" with strict typing languages. It 
        happens that they don't provide the most productive development environment 
        - arguably for many things, and certainly for XP practices like refactoring 
        and test-first design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just my opinion, of course ... but I believe a fairly expert one. And 
        semi-official to boot.

        Static typing, the way C++ and Java/C# enforce it, is negative reinforcement. The compile fails if your types attempt to think outside their box, and you are punished.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, by contrast, is positive reinforcement. When your strong but dynamic types work correctly together, the tests pass, and you are rewarded.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is why TDD with a dynamic language is often preferable to TDD with a static language _and_ static type checking.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, the Agile movement often favors the dynamic languages for the high-level code - the CommandAndControl code that runs far from the metal. The closer you get to the metal, the more important becomes thinking inside the box!

        <em>I hate to say this, but </em><a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s influence on the *Test industry is the real problem with trying to use TDD with C++ or other statically typed languages.

        High level design solutions have to work.  They don't work until they have been coded.  Coding them provides insights into design issues and ultimately changes the design.

        It lets you test them.  It lets users see and touch the growing system. It's the only act that can close the feedback loop.

        It is not now, nor has it ever been, a matter of failing to analyze the domain.  Rather it is a matter of how and when that analysis is done.  I prefer to do this analysis incrementally and iteratively concurrent with implementation.
