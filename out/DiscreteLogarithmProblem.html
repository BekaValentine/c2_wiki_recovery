        Discrete Logarithm Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        The ordinary logarithm problem: given a base <em>b</em> and a number <em>x</em>, find <em>y</em> such that <em>b</em>^<em>y</em> = <em>x</em>. So, e.g., the logarithm to base 2 of 128 is 7. This is usually done by calculating the logarithm of <em>x</em> to base 10, and dividing that by the logarithm of <em>b</em> to base 10.
      </p>
      <p>
        We can do this in modular arithmetic too. Suppose we know, for a particular choice of <em>n</em>,<em>x</em>,<em>b</em>, that there is a <em>y</em> such that <em>b</em>^<em>y</em> = <em>x</em> (mod <em>n</em>); then finding that <em>y</em> is the <a href="DiscreteLogarithmProblem.html">DiscreteLogarithmProblem</a> modulo <em>n</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This won't be possible for all <em>n</em>,<em>x</em>,<em>b</em>, but (for instance) if <em>n</em> is a <a href="PrimeNumber.html">PrimeNumber</a>, there is always a <em>b</em> that makes the problem solvable for every <em>x</em> other than 0.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem generalizes further. The integers modulo a <a href="PrimeNumber.html">PrimeNumber</a> <em>p</em> form a <em></em>FiniteField<em>; there are other finite fields (exactly one of size </em>p<em>^</em>k<em> for each prime </em>p<em> and positive integer </em>k<em>), and we can pose the same sort of problem in any of them. The fields of size 2^</em>k<em> are particularly nice to work with using computers.</em>

        The <a href="DiscreteLogarithmProblem.html">DiscreteLogarithmProblem</a> is useful in cryptography, for the following reason: suppose <em>n</em> is large; then given <em>n</em>,<em>b</em>,<em>y</em> it's easy to find <em>x</em>, but no algorithm is known that, given <em>n</em>,<em>b</em>,<em>x</em>, will efficiently find <em>y</em>. So the function that takes <em>y</em> to <em>x</em> seems to be a "one-way function", much like the one that takes two prime numbers and yields their product. One-way functions are an essential building block for public-key cryptography. The difficulty of solving the discrete logarithm problem is essential for the security of the <a href="DiffieHellmanMerkle.html">DiffieHellmanMerkle</a> key exchange protocol and the ElGamal cryptosystem.
