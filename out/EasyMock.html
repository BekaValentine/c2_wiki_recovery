        The <a href="EasyMock.html">EasyMock</a> package provides an easy way to use <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s for given interfaces in the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.

        <a href="EasyMock.html">EasyMock</a> 1.1 is available (2004-05-03), as well as a first release of the <a href="EasyMock.html">EasyMock</a> Class Extension that was contributed by Joel Shellman, Henri Tremblay, and Chad Woolley.

        When I create a JDBC MockConnection and the code under test uses this to create a PreparedStatement, both of these packages have me specify, in advance, the exact string of the SQL statement passed to prepareStatement().  There could be a lot of variation in that SQL, capitalization, whitespace, even order of columns, that I'd rather not specify in the code. What I <strong>would</strong> like to do is verify that, when the MockPreparedStatement is invoked, that the parameters are passed in the same order as the table columns are specified. What's the easiest way to accomplish this?

        Both the <a href="EasyMock.html">EasyMock</a> and <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> packages work from the basis that you define the behavior and expected use of the mock objects, let the code-under-test access them, and then ask them if the actual use met the predefined expectations. To some degree, this seems backwards to me. I have to define the behavior and use of the ResultSet, then define the behavior and use of the PreparedStatement that will return the ResultSet, and then define the behavior and use of the Connection that will return the PreparedStatement.  I'd rather define the behavior, let the code-under-test access them, and then test the actual use against expectations. Not only is that easier for me to read, but it lets me easily do conditional testing based on some criteria.

        <em>Setting expectations first has a big advantage: If actual and expected behavior differ, the mock object may provide failure information as early as possible. This simplifies finding and fixing errors.</em>
