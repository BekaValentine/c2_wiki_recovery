        Stones Law
      </h1>
      <p>
        Named after OliverStone, director of such acclaimed films as <em>Platoon</em> and <em>Wall Street</em> (not to mention utter rubbish like <em>U-Turn</em> and <em>Natural Born Killers</em>--<a href="YourMileageMayVary.html">YourMileageMayVary</a>).  Deals with conspiracy theories (see <a href="GrandConspiracy.html">GrandConspiracy</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        The law states:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Any evidence which opposes (or tends to oppose) a conspiracy theory was in fact fabricated by the conspirators, and shows just how pernicious the conspiracy really is.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The above may seem silly, until you get into an argument with a conspiracy theorist who attempts to use it against you.  At which point you should realize that you're more likely to convince a chair of anything than your opponent.
