        Sixty Minutes File
      </h1>
      <p>
        A file kept to prove one's innocence (to the interviewers from "60 Minutes") if an anticipated disaster occurs. So named by a friend who would half-jokingly add "cc: 60 Minute File" at the bottom of memos to management when his engineering decisions had been overridden.
