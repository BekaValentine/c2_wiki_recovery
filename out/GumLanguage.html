        <strong>Galactic Universal/Unified Modelling Language?</strong>

      <ul>

           <strong>"GUM != UM".</strong>

      <p>
        In many necks of our woods the fundamental idea of modeling as a declarative means of designing a system is <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>, which in days of <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> means <strong>DEAD</strong>. Even where <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> is still an ideal, UML is unable to provide sufficient generality to describe much. UML 2 seems to have made the thing more confusing and less generic. Committees are like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        So <a href="GumLanguage.html">GumLanguage</a> is not UML. It's not a way of designing code. It's a way of generating tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess there are about 10 "diagrams" in <a href="GumLanguage.html">GumLanguage</a>. There could be more if you like - they all have the same form, which is just the <a href="GalacticModelingLanguage.html">GalacticModelingLanguage</a>. All <a href="GumLanguage.html">GumLanguage</a> adds is layers.
      </p>
      <p>
        To whit: each layer is an associative directed graph of labelled boxes. Any box in a layer can be associated with any other box. Patterns within a layer's graph are each identified by a single labeled box in the layer above. Because a box or link can be part of more than one pattern of other boxes in its layer, it can be related to more than a single box in the layer above. So the overall structure is a lattice with each layer more abstract than the one below it.
      </p>
      <p>
        What hierarchy of layers do we use? Well, it's up to you. I've been thinking like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Intent:			What's wanted and by whom prioritized how?
        </li>
        <li>
           Representation:		How is each intent expressed in domain language?
        </li>
        <li>
           Architecture:			What's are the solution principles of each domain language word?
        </li>
        <li>
           Process:			How does the organization of each principle vary statefully over time?
        </li>
        <li>
           Pattern:			What's the class-oriented dependencies of each state?
        </li>
        <li>
           Class:			What's the CRC relationships of an object of each class?
        </li>
        <li>
           Data:				Where do we deploy objects, in what volumes, what loads, what bandwidth?
        </li>
        <li>
           Message:			What formats on the wire, on the disk, in memory, on screen, necessary transformations?
        </li>
        <li>
           Signal:			What empiricism generates each message? How is it sensed or analyzed?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How far do you need to flesh out one of these lattices before you start trying to satisfy the thing with machinery? Well, you do it iteratively. A slice through a Gum lattice could be called a gumtree ... which is just a way of representing an aspect qua <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a> ... and you can still generate yer sequence diagrams / CRC plays here. They're simply time-oriented gumtrees. And so on.

        <em>Re: "each layer is an associative directed graph of labelled boxes. Any box in a layer can be associated with any other box." -- It sounds like the association is the link between graph nodes, so that would just be a "directed graph". What beyond those directed links between nodes makes it "associative" in addition to a "directed graph"? Similarly, why do you say "lattice"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I say associative to distinguish the links within a layer from the links between layers, which are relational. But of course it's possible to take the relations further: a box in a higher layer could be any distinction on the layer below. Distinctions are hard to represent within traditional information structures, however. As for lattice - well, make a <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a> and then allow associative links between nodes at the same depth - you tell me what you'd call it. Matroid? Let's not go there.

        Examples? We don't need no steenkeeng examples! ;-)
