        I know a gentleman who has been a musician and band leader for years. In his 
        day, he used to pack the house with fans of great big band jazz.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, <em>the economics of big band music has changed</em>. My friend
        still does occasional big band shows these days, but when the door has been
        collected, and the musicians and roadies have been paid, he is lucky to
        break even.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does he still do it? Because he <em>loves</em> playing those old GlennMiller and
        DukeEllington and BillyStrayhorn tunes.

        When the circus comes to town, they call my friend to provide the orchestra.
        He puts together a few people and does the gig. Does he do it at cost?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course not. It wasn't <em>his</em> idea to have a circus.              
      </p>
      <p>
        He <em>charges</em> for that. The circus will either pay the going rate for a 
        top-notch orchestra or they <em>won't have</em> a top-notch orchestra.
