        No Multiple Dispatch In Java
      </h1>
      <p>
        (from <a href="JavaDesignFlaws.html">JavaDesignFlaws</a>)

      <p>
        Adding <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> to Java would necessitate massive changes to the core libraries and a completely new approach to the design of Java programs.  I think you're asking for a whole new language!  Perhaps you'd be better off programming in the <a href="DylanLanguage.html">DylanLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why would it? It would require changes if </em><a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> was <em>automatic</em>, but it ain't necessarily so. In <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, for example, you only get <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> if you ask for it, by making a generic function. In much the same way, you could apply the same rule in Java.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A compatible extension of Java with <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> is the <a href="NiceLanguage.html">NiceLanguage</a>.

      <p>
        <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> can lead to ambiguity if the methods in question take more than one argument; this ambiguity could be resolved with a set of rules for which one would take precedence, but overall, I prefer <a href="NoMultipleDispatchInJava.html">NoMultipleDispatchInJava</a>.
