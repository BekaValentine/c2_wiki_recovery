        <em>It is common in certain embedded domains (consumer entertainment electronics, consumer appliance controls, other consumer product markets) for firms to internalize this principle; that, as long as their products are less sucky than the next guy's then they must be doing okay. Not really true, of course, but it's hard to convince management of firms making 100K units per year to spend an extra dime per unit to improve the product in some barely tangible and user-invisible way.</em>
