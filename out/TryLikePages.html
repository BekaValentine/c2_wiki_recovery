        Try Like Pages

      <p>
        This is a <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a>, that is well kind of a meta category.
      </p>
      <p>
        Use it to hint to the <a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a> to try <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a>, because that likely turns up interesting links. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course you can use <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a> always anyway, but sometimes it is not so obvious, what this will bring. But a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> or other experienced <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> may guess that this is worthwhile (e.g. because (s)he just searched for an appropriate <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a>...).

        Note: I just (2005/09/06) added this tag to a page,  but I had this feeling quite often, that a tag, which I could not quite name, fit as a replacement for a not existent category. I will probably add this tag to quite a few pages when I'm <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>ing. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a>

        <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>: I have added it a few times now (2005/11/04) and would like feedback about it. -- .gz

        If you know there are like pages, why not just add a traditional "see also"?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Because </em><a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a> is dynamic.  "<a href="SeeAlso.html">SeeAlso</a>" can fall out-of-date, either because pages have been deleted, or because pages that should be referenced have been added.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           A great feature would be to find pages that have a high-correlation (in some sense) without necessarily sharing a first or last page name component.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Yes. But it would also be nice if it wouldn't simply look for prefix/suffix but also for all contained wiki words. In many cases one <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> ends with e.g. "Pattern" and another related/interesting one starts with "Pattern". -- .gz
