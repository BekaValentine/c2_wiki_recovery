        Kent                   "You're all individuals, you have to work it out for yourselves."<br/>
        (crowd in unison)      "We're all individuals, we have to work it out for ourselves."<br/>
        (crowd member)         "Wait! I'm not an individual."<br/>
        (another crowd member) "Shhhh!"<br/>
