        <a href="RemoveLineAddSameLineAgain.html">RemoveLineAddSameLineAgain</a> (RLASLA) is a refactoring where the developer removes a line of code that fails to compile, then re-adds the same line again. This refactoring is usually performed for one of two reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a> performs RLASLA in hopes that somehow their compile error is an internal compiler error, not a human/monkey error
        </li>
        <li>
           An <a href="IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.html">IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment</a> user is attempting to compensate for the IDE's erroneous AST parsing or stale byte-code cache
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        RLASLA is a RefactoringSmell, meaning that there is no context under which it can be performed (aside from demonstration purposes) that does not point to a suspicion that something else in your development environment is horribly broken.
