        Incremental Path
      </h1>
      <p>
        The way of <a href="IncrementalDevelopment.html">IncrementalDevelopment</a> (mentioned in <a href="FrequentReleases.html">FrequentReleases</a>, noting that doing incremental development needs a belief that there can be an incremental path to the goal). 
      </p>
      <p>
        The term is also used in evolutionary biology (<a href="EvolutionByNaturalSelection.html">EvolutionByNaturalSelection</a>), early on by <a href="CharlesDarwin.html">CharlesDarwin</a> himself, then specifically when addressing the problem of how complicated organs like the eye can have developed incrementally.

        An overview article on the topic is The evolutionary origin of complex features (Lenski et al. in Nature, 2003) where a <a href="GeneticAlgorithm.html">GeneticAlgorithm</a> is used to demonstrate how more complex functionalities can develop from primitive ones - after there are some primitive ones that work (that observation seems to be in line with the talk in <a href="IncrementalDevelopment.html">IncrementalDevelopment</a> about the need to get going, not get stuck). <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6936/abs/nature01568.html">http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v423/n6936/abs/nature01568.html</a> is the abstract and the full paper is available also from <a href="http://myxo.css.msu.edu/papers/nature2003/Nature03_Complex.pdf">http://myxo.css.msu.edu/papers/nature2003/Nature03_Complex.pdf</a>
