        USB keyboard from ArtLebedevStudios. Each key has a backlit, colour 48-by-48 OrganicLed display instead of a key-marking; the displayed image can be changed on the fly, and can even be animated. The keys are in a <a href="PeeCee.html">PeeCee</a>-standard 104-key US-style physical layout with 10 extra function keys to the left.  After years as a concept, Optimus Maximus first shipped in 2008, at a price of over $1500.

        The 104-key physical layout is a significant drawback; it's compatible with the standard US layout but not with several other important language/country layouts. $1500 and you're still out of luck if you want a keyboard setup that can switch seamlessly between the standard layouts for, say, the US and France.

        <em>Modifier keys can change what symbols are available. This is how </em><a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> users have been typing accented letters for years.<em> -- French </em>'PC<strong> users, on the other hand, have apparently been using their own 105-key French layout all those years. I can't imagine they'd be too happy to spend $1500 for the privilege of having to adjust to a different, non-standard layout. For that matter, spending $1500 for the privilege of having to switch from the 105-key UK layout seems like a pretty bad bargain to me. Extra fun if you're a </strong>TouchTypist on the Hungarian or Thai layouts: those layouts put letters, not just symbols, on the "extra, 105th" key. (That key sits between left Shift and the key that's marked Z in (104- or 105-key) QWERTY layouts.)

        I guess the answer to that problem would be the OptimusTactusKeyboard (no physical keys, no physical limits on the layout) but I guess the problem then is the lack of feedback when hitting each key... (I wounder how could that be solved...)
