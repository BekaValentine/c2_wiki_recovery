        I really hope this takes off. It's from Google and there is a lot of hype surrounding it, but I can definitely see the utility. I'm constantly seeing e-mail being used as a collaboration utility -- someone will write up an email describing a problem or a feature request or whatever which is then followed by fifty or so one-line responses with mixed bottom, top, and inline posting, sometimes modifying the original e-mail text. I've tried to get people to use more appropriate tools, but I bet anyone here can guess how successful that was. I can't imagine I'm the only one who sees this kind of thing.

        April 2011, <a href="GoogleWave.html">GoogleWave</a> still exists but is in a dormant stage like it's not longer developped as a separated service and you must now have an GoogleAccount to enter the service. The good thing about this is that all the PR people are staying away and you find some great Waves about education still on it.--<a href="PieterJansegers.html">PieterJansegers</a>
