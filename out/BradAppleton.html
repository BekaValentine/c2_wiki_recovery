        Brad is a "sponge" - he absorbs vast amounts of information in short periods of time.

        Gee, thanks for the intro, Mike (though I'm not sure I agree with the "sponge" part). I'll try to be brief:
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a software CM/ALM process+tools "solution architect". Basically that means I deal with development, deployment, improvement and support of CM and related processes and tools to assist in the application lifecycle management domain. I stem from a tool developoment background ("I'd rather write programs that write programs than write programs" ;-).
      </p>
      <p>
        My current interest area is the intersection between Agile Development methods and Software Configuration Management. I have a related blog at <a href="http://blog.bradapp.net/,">http://blog.bradapp.net/,</a> and a related "Agile SCM" column in CMCrossroads.com's CM Journal (see <a href="http://www.cmcrossroads.com/cmjournal/">http://www.cmcrossroads.com/cmjournal/</a> and <a href="http://www.cmwiki.com/AgileSCMArticles)">http://www.cmwiki.com/AgileSCMArticles)</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the early programs I worked on during the first decade of my career were things like general programming libraries, debuggers, version control tools, configuration management tools, problem/change/requirements tracking, test management, program analysis and comprehension, and scripts to automate all sorts of software development tasks (coding, testing, build-auditing, etc.). My primary areas of interest and expertise are in Software Configuration Management, O-O Design and Programming Languages, Unix scripting (Perl, shell, etc.), Patterns (of course ;-), and more recently, Agile Development and Enterprise Architecture.

        I'm sad to say that I don't frequent the Wiki all that much as of late 2001.
