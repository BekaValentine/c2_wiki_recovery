        Llama Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="LlamaPattern.html">LlamaPattern</a> is pattern with an ambigous meaning created to show why patterns with a single name are dangerous. If the <a href="LlamaPattern.html">LlamaPattern</a> ever becomes formalized, then all single-name patterns become useless because at best any word can become a pattern, at worst we will have widely varying definitions for any single word based pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a meta-pattern - not a <a href="MetaPattern.html">MetaPattern</a> (which is an already defined pattern). That such a discernment is necessary reinforces that <a href="SingleNamePatternsCreateConflicts.html">SingleNamePatternsCreateConflicts</a>, and why multiple words should be used in the name of a pattern.
