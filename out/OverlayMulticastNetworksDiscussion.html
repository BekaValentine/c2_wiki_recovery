        A page which had the long name:
      </p>
      <code>
        IssuesInOverlayMulticastNetworksDynamicRoutingAndCommunicationCost<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Was refactored as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A TopicalPage called <a href="OverlayMulticastNetworks.html">OverlayMulticastNetworks</a> was created
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WantedPages.html">WantedPages</a> with the following names were referenced as <a href="ForwardLinks.html">ForwardLinks</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               DynamicRouting
            </li>
            <li>
               CommunicationCost
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This was done to reduce the burden of creating a long pages with long names which end up being a <a href="BigBallOfMud.html">BigBallOfMud</a>, and from becoming a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>, since instead of dealing with pages tied to specifics only a few people may understand or appreciate, pages are created which will integrate ideas, thoughts, and overall concepts which apply to many other pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        This avoids the temptation to create what already exists all over again. What readers and writers on this wiki want is a page they can relate to. If a person has expertise and can write well about experiences and issues which have been encountered, and are likely to be encountered by others, <a href="PositiveDialogue.html">PositiveDialogue</a> may then ensue.
