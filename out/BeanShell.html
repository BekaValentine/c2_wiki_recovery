      <p>
        A great scripting, testing and debugging tool. Provides a scripting language that is "almost Java", a nice GUI, a class browser, class reloading capabilities, and a partridge in a pear tree.

        It can give you real productivity boost when you work in Java.
        Suppose that you have some new jar with the API that is unfamiliar to you.
        <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a> can introduce you to this API fairly quickly.
        Sometimes people use <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> for that purpose -- 
        just to get aquainted with API inside which they should work.
        <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a> allows you to do that with a much greater comfort.
        Just one feature -- adding classpath items inside a script -- helps a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a> can help on application design stage.
        You can prototype your application with <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a> scripts quickly
        and then transform them to real Java classes
        WHEN EVERYTHING WORKS. That's a high quality of <a href="DesignPhase.html">DesignPhase</a>, of course :)

        <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a> works very close with <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a> "design patterns": foo.bar > 42 is translated to foo.getBar() > 42 by the interpreter. Non-programmers can get their minds around the first way of writing more easily, thus <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a> is incredibly useful for end user programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NetBeans.html">NetBeans</a> provides a unified API for executing <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a>, <a href="DynamicJava.html">DynamicJava</a> and <a href="JavaPython.html">JavaPython</a> scripts.

        <a href="JayEdit.html">JayEdit</a> also provides access to <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a>.  In fact, keyboard macros automatically generate <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a> script and there's a console plugin that features <a href="BeanShell.html">BeanShell</a>. -- <a href="MarkCrocker.html">MarkCrocker</a>

        I've recently discovered this gem.  I've gone from mild interest (hmm... dynamicly typed java?), to moderate disbelief (yay... no more casting required), to severe joy (you...you...you mean I needn't stub out methods?  I don't need to completely implement the interface I'm casting to!?).  I must say, I'm really hoping that this can take off some of the sharp edges and corners of java that I've been cutting myself on as of late.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dynamic typing, transparent support for primitive types, appropriate casting to interfaces (including the all important <a href="DoesNotUnderstand.html">DoesNotUnderstand</a>, called Invoke)... this should be interesting :)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to admit one thing, however:  I hate the name :)

        one of the most useful features of this language is that it lessens the difference between classes and functions. a little example:
      </p>
      <code>
        foo(x,y) {<br/>
        bar(z) {<br/>
        print("x=" + x + ", y=" + y + ", z=" + z);<br/>
        }<br/>
        return this;<br/>
        }<br/>
        x = foo("hello", 5);<br/>
        x.bar(3);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        will print
      </p>
      <code>
        x=hello, y=5, z=3<br/>
      </code>
