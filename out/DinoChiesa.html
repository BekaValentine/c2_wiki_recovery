        Hey! I work for Microsoft.  
        I'm the lead marketing PM for the Microsoft Application Server <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/appserver/default.mspx.">http://www.microsoft.com/windowsserver2003/appserver/default.mspx.</a>  My areas of interest include Windows Server, the .NET Framework and SDK, Visual Studio, and related pieces. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I previously worked with IBM for about 4 years in a similar capacity, focusing on DCE, Encina, <a href="MqSeries.html">MqSeries</a>, Publish and Subscribe technology, CORBA, and finally, <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> and <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>. I arrived at IBM by way of Transarc, a software startup that was acquired by IBM in 1994.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined Microsoft after being convinced that most software was too hard and too expensive, and there ought to be a simpler, easier way.  I'm continuously looking for that way.  XML Web Services is a step forward.  So is managed code.

        Hi Dino. I agree with you MS software has mass appeal, partly due to pricing. Killed a few competitors along the way though. Do you see security / interoperability / bandwidth concerns going to derail <a href="SoapProtocol.html">SoapProtocol</a> based <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>? 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I am hoping you can change (or provide useful material to revive)  <a href="EjbsAndDistributedTransaction.html">EjbsAndDistributedTransaction</a>, since you expressed interest in refactoring <a href="WhatsWrongWithEjb.html">WhatsWrongWithEjb</a> in Dec04. I could act as intermediary and hope to get some opposition views as well.
        </li>
        <li>
           Also I rather like you to start improving /criticising / explaining a range of MS based offerings, and offer opinion on competitive alternatives too. I have created/maintained a sizable number of C2 pages since 2004
        </li>
