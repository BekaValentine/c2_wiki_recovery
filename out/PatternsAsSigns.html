        Patterns As Signs
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hey, did anyone go to ECOOP? There was this really <em>naff</em> talk, <a href="PatternsAsSigns.html">PatternsAsSigns</a>, by some Australian, that 
        claimed to be about patterns, but he just whinged about <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>
        and how he was evil. What do you think?

        I've read the paper and it's pretty lacking in substance - a little interesting stuff, but most of it is waffle.
