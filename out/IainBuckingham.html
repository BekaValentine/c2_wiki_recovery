      <p>
        Based in Bristol, UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        Graduated in Computer Science from Bristol University in 1995.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmed in C and C++ for a couple of years before getting a job as a VB programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently working on refactoring a >500,000 LOC and old (>10 years) VB system to give it a COM interface, so a similarly large and old C program can use it for back-end calculations.  Oh, and most of the C guys are in Hungary.  And we have to maintain our current system too.  And the customers want new functionality at the same time.  And the budget, scope and timescale are all fixed.
