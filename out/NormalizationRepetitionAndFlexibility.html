        Normalization Repetition And Flexibility
      </h1>
      <p>
        Based on a discussion in <a href="FearOfAddingTables.html">FearOfAddingTables</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> should be the primary design driver in my opinion. Some count lots of nulls as "duplication", I don't. They are simply "not there". You can't duplicate empty space. Duplicate keys count more than duplicate nulls because keys are values, nulls are lack of values.
      </p>

        Wider tables do NOT violate OAOO. By my calcs, skinny ones do because you repeat the one-to-zero-or-one keys over and over.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do wider tables violate 3NF? What about 5NF? Foreign keys are not considered a violation of </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, because they are <em>the</em> means by which references are established. Also, if you're not creating related "skinny" (ugh, I hate that term) tables, how do you enforce consistency in column values?<em> -- DV</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {DV is correct here. Your 'calculations' would only be meaningful if foreign keys are always to be counted as violations of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, which would be unreasonable. Besides: <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>. In that sense, it is most critical to ensure that <strong>facts</strong> are represented <strong></strong><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a><strong>, which means at least 3NF. My own preferences are a bit beyond that: I believe that, in an ideal database, each row in a table should represent 'One And Only One' fact - i.e. no non-trivial dependencies whatsoever (</strong>SixthNormalForm) + an additional idea of 'no assumptions' - all facts need to be explicitly represented; e.g. 'pizza place delivers vegetarian deluxe to your neighborhood' doesn't imply 'pizza place exists' unless it is either (a) explicitly encoded as a constraint, or (b) explicitly encoded as an entailment rule under exists ('exists(x) :- (x) delivers (y) to (z)'). Assumptions violate the 'One and Only One fact' rule, and they also act as semantic baggage that make the database far less flexible.}
      </p>
      <p>
        But why would nulls be counted as "duplication" but not FKs? Both FK and nulls can be virtual or physical, depending on implementation. It appears to be a double standard. And "fact" often depends on the user. <a href="EverythingIsRelative.html">EverythingIsRelative</a>. Let specific queries define the fact in the context needed. Or, put domain classification info into meta/classification tables. -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        {Nothing DV or I said implies NULLs are counted as duplication. Nulls cause their own set of problems, and we oppose them for reasons that are uniquely NULL. If <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>, nulls represent no fact. They're a hack - a placeholder for a potential fact given a conjunction of many facts as seen in 3NF. In SixthNormalForm there would be no NULLs anywhere in the database since it would be pointless to represent them except by the absence of those rows that would otherwise contain them. But to create any 'view' that joins many tables where not all facts are known, it may be necessary to specify some slots as being 'unknown' by some name or other (if one doesn't wish to compute a value for the position). This 'unknown' is exactly what a NULL represents. As a consequence, the domain of the column in the view or query is slightly different from the domain of the original fact table, because it includes this explicit NULL. I wouldn't oppose explicit and query-programmer-controlled forms of 'NULL' found in views, though I think that even in views, <em>distinct NULLs should be described as </em>'unique variables<em></em>' (as described further in response to Lars). Indeed, that's exactly what 'variables' also mean: placeholders for unknown values.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Nulls are nulls.. no one knows what they are. In your application logic, you probably duplicate the code each time trying to figure out what they are and what they do.. they aren't clear. They don't tell a story. They are simply like shrugging shoulders. Very dangerous for a computer to shrug its shoulders. Whether nulls are duplicate or not duplicate shouldn't even be discussed here. Nulls are another issue with another can of worms crawling out of them. -- worms-on-head-mind... err... MopMind
      </p>
      <p>
        {What a NULL represents can vary, just as what the number 17 represents can vary - based on context, it could be an age or part of a calendar data or  the size of a small hash table. However, that does not mean people don't know what 'NULL' <strong>is</strong>. In a database, a NULL <strong>is</strong> a special extra value  made available in each domain with the (original) intent of representing the absence of a fact. For the most part its use is in alignment with its original intent. However, the semantics of NULL as normally implemented <strong>violates</strong> the original intent, making it a hazard to utilize. This is revealed when it comes time to perform joins and queries and computations - technically, 'UnknownA' == 'UnknownB' should be 'UnknownC : Boolean', but 'UnknownA == UnknownA' should be <strong>true</strong>. So, if we MUST use NULLs, then every NULL is correctly implemented only as a <em>unique</em> NULL - or essentially a <strong>unique variable</strong> identifying a particular unknown (which, if it became known, could presumably be made to immediately percolate across all the computations performed in preparation of the view). But doing this correctly in the data storage itself is an unnecessary complexity because we don't, fundamentally, have any reason to represent NULLs directly in the <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a> - the only place we ever need them is in views. A KnowledgeBase would be a different story, where knowing what you don't know and knowing how it relates to other things you know and don't know is one of the two big facets of Knowledge that you can explicitly represent (of four - <em>know what you know, know what you don't know, don't know what you don't know, and don't know what you know</em>).}
      </p>
      <p>
        Nulls: Storing data in your application is generally what nulls cause.. usually some programmer specifies that NULL means not applicable or not entered in his application logic.. and this isn't future proof. Worse, sometimes nulls aren't described anywhere.. some database engineer just assumes everyone knows what nulls are. That is another topic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Whether empty (null) columns are "bad" and whether they are "duplicates" can be separated into two different issues. As far as duplication, empties don't violate </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> anymore than the extra foreign keys needed by thin tables. I'd even say less, but for the sake of argument I'll take a wash for now. (I like the word "empty" instead of "null" because the way existing RDBMS implement/treat nulls is poor in my opinion.) -- top<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Implemented properly, every logically distinct NULL would be a unique variable representing an unknown value and, consequently, certainly not be duplicate. The use of NULLs to represent not-applicable should be exchanged for a unique domain-value representation of not-applicable. NULLs, as implemented, are bad.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Re: 'NULLs, as implemented, are bad' - Well, that's something we can both agree on. However, we'd probably fix it differently. Somewhere there is a topic(s) dedicated to such. If I encounter them, I'll link them here. -t</em>

      <p>
        What you <em>view</em> does not matter (i.e. think as in relvars and relations, not as in two different tables with duplicate data.. or even worse, think of a pointer.. it is kind of similar, but, I shouldn't say that or open that can of worms). It could even be implemented using pointers so that you avoid the duplication at the implementation level - but worrying about that isn't important. Something that is worse than duplicating it is storing this data in your application logic and managing it there.. so now people cannot query this info! Because it isn't in a table. And if it is in a wide table, people cannot query the information about your meta data as you call it. Opening up a thin table to store the data <em>is your meta data</em> and this is what we don't seem to grok, for whatever reason.

        <em>But the same could be said about nulls. In existing RDBMS, the DBA usually has to "deal with" all those extra FKs. As we discussed in </em><a href="FearOfAddingTables.html">FearOfAddingTables</a>, maybe if the tools allowed virtualization/automation of such, it would not be an either/or choice. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {You are confusing implementation and model. A foreign key gives you a meaningful relationship between data. NULLs do not. If you are concerned about duplication on the physical layer, RDBMSs can be designed to denormalize tables and intern large key values on the physical layer. Your <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> semantics should be applied to representation of facts (<a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>) on the logical layer without concern as to duplication of domain-values.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, I am not. Meaningful information about relationships and meaningful information may be two different things, but it doesn't change the duplication argument.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {You make an assumption that I do not take for granted. Could you provide one example of meaningful information that is not about a relationship? To clarify: 'meaningful information' is information that someone could utilize to support a decision in the real world, as opposed to communications protocol overhead.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Lack of a (known) relationship can be very useful information also. When you are boarding an international air flight, the lack of relationships to "suspicious" items is what allows you to get on the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
        {I grant that this is meaningful information. But it is still about a relationship, and thus does not serve to justify your assumption. Could you try again?}

        Graphs and values are representationally-interchangeable. "Is" versus "isn't" about relationships is thus not useful. - t

        Models are in our head, and vary from head-to-head. Implementation is an objective representation of a given model, and really the only thing we can objectively compare, for good or bad. Thus, I would like clarification on that statement. -t

        Often it's a matter of possible future changes. Take the pizza example at: 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        If we assume that pizza features will always be independent of delivery location, then the suggested adjustment makes sense. But often one cannot really know. Distant delivery may mean some items get soggy or dry, and thus the store doesn't want to give that option for distant locations anymore because they want to maintain their reputation for quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first approach is more flexible even if it does introduce some redundancy. It can serve both purposes adequately. But the second (4th normal form) cannot handle one of these two cases without calling in a DBA and possibly a programmer. It performs one well but the other not at all. Thus, I'd judge the original as more flexible, but at the cost of violating OAOO. It's a matter of trade-offs. Sometimes violating OAOO is the right choice I'd have to say. (<a href="SoftwareDevelopmentIsGambling.html">SoftwareDevelopmentIsGambling</a>). Without more info on the probability of change, one cannot make a fully-informed proper call. -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        {Technically, the table in that example is <strong>already</strong> in <strong>4NF</strong> (and <strong>5NF</strong> and <strong>6NF</strong>) if pizza parlors are allowed to or capable of deciding that they'll deliver different items to different areas. Further, it's a <strong>thin table</strong> simply by virtue of not representing any conjunctive facts (i.e. it represents "(pp) delivers (variety) to (location)", not "(pp) delivers (variety) AND (pp) delivers to (location)"). I'll write up my understanding/definition of wide vs. thin tables above.}
      </p>
      <p>
        This doesn't contradict my point. When deciding what is the "proper" way to design a system, the answer often depends on intended and future usage patterns. It's not practical to keep refactoring the data as management or marketing changes their mind over time over if or what variations are allowed or not allowed. Ads are simpler if each shop can deliver the same thing, but production people may grumble that such is not practical or costly and that some shops should be allowed to exclude some items. Getting fresh avocados may be difficult for a rural shop. Such "domain battles" are common. It comes down to the kind of thing found in <a href="DecisionMathAndYagni.html">DecisionMathAndYagni</a>. - t
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [Added comment] I notice that systems intended to be sold/rented to many customers within a general niche wire their schemas for the more flexible version of possibilities even though many customers may not use such a feature. They usually don't make custom schemas for each customer. The customers who don't use the extra layers or flexible parts are stuck with schemas more complicated than they, a particular company, need. Thus, a company making pizza delivery software for many shops of different brands would probably design it to have toppings potentially dependent on (limited by) delivery location even if it makes more work for shops that don't need that dependence. Or perhaps make a config switch to shut it off from the user perspective, but the internal table management is still more complicated. I recommend <a href="SimulationOfTheFuture.html">SimulationOfTheFuture</a> to help with such decisions in general. -t

      </ul>
      <p>
        {I'll grant that any decision depending upon foresight is 'gambling'. Whether or not it is practical to refactor over time really depends upon which tools you have available to you. A great deal of the 'refactoring problem' (<a href="CodeChangeImpactAnalysis.html">CodeChangeImpactAnalysis</a>) lies with SQL's model for <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a> and DataDefinition, the lack of runtime adaptivity, the associated straggler updates problems and so on. SQL relies upon a bunch of hacks for trigger-based mutable views. Solving many such runtime flexibility issues in a secure and generic manner has been of considerable interest to me (far more so than issues of normalization).}
      </p>
      <p>
        We have agreed that if tools made it easier to have multiple viewpoints, both "wide" table and "narrow" table views, then it's not an either/or choice and each view can be used per feature/application/user convenience. Unfortunately, most RDBMS don't support such well, especially on the "write" side of things. Given the limits of existing tools, I lean toward lower normalization.

            <li>
               This claim of yours is not justifiable. First, if it ever turns out you need the flexibility, then the Pizza example <strong>is already in 6NF</strong>, so there isn't a case of "lower normalization" buying you flexibility. Further, if you decide that tables are too wide based upon duplication of values (<a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> of values) you would certainly have attempted to split the table even when it shouldn't have been split based on massive duplications of names and such - keep in mind that the multi-valued normalizations are already encouraged in ERM. In any case, the pizza example constitutes a 'thin table' since the fact it represents has no top-level conjugations (see 'narrow table' definitions, below).

                <li>
                   <em>So it "depends on the domain" whether the duplication is "legitimate". Thank You.</em>

                <li>
                   That isn't an entirely correct interpretation. It depends on semantics of a table row and domain constraints whether there is any "duplication" in <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> representation of facts at all - there is never an issue as to whether there is 'legitimate' duplication if there simply isn't any. And basing your decision on '<a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> of values' is STILL a bad decision.

You can't just throw a scenario on the table, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, and <em>pretend</em> it supports what you're saying. You've certainly failed to demonstrate any negative quantifiable or qualifiable trade-offs, and the various normalization forms have always considered the domain - anything from 2NF+ involves domain semantics and domain functional dependencies. Perhaps we should demand you prove competency that you even know what you are talking about.

                   They are sufficient when dealing with <strong>already</strong> formalized computational models, such as programming languages and CPUs. We know exactly how these things interact, down to the hardware level and up to the high-level programming languages - i.e. we can assert that the mathematical models of these are as close to perfection as any model can achieve, and those cases where it isn't constitute manufacturing flaws or compiler bugs. Knowing this, we can, in fact, use math and logic for 80%+ of all observations. The only ones it can't touch are psychological and statistical observations over human users and politics (e.g. noting that humans lack perfect foresight, and humans make typographical mistakes and logic errors, and that every human ever observed does so - we've never, in fifty years, found a programmer that gets everything perfect on the first try, and noting that businesses prefer 'plug-in' programmers, and noting that most humans don't like learning many different languages creating <a href="StumblingBlocksForDomainSpecificLanguages.html">StumblingBlocksForDomainSpecificLanguages</a>). These observations are necessary to help shape policy and language-decisions, and they can't be diminished... but they also rarely need to be quantified (qualification is generally sufficient to make appropriate decisions - even if we DID quantify these things, there is simply NO place we could ever plug in the numbers). Your own 'ideal' regarding the use of empirical observation in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> fields is one I consider entirely naive.

        I suggest this definition of 'wide' table (also <a href="GodTable.html">GodTable</a>) and 'narrow' (thin/skinny) table, which reflect how I've been using them thus far:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>WideTable<strong>: A 'wide' table refers to any table for which rows represent 'conjunctive' facts or relations. A traditional 'entity' table from </strong><a href="EntityRelationshipDiagram.html">EntityRelationshipDiagram</a> and <a href="EntityRelationshipModeling.html">EntityRelationshipModeling</a> is a particularly common example of this, consisting of (entity-id, attribute1, attribute2, ..., attributeN). One can note that there is no inherent or functional relationship between, say, attribute1 and attribute2 except as they both are aspects of whatever 'thing' in the world is identified or named by entity-id. As a consequence, this table can be said to contain conjunctive facts, essentially of the form <strong>isEntity(fred)</strong> <strong>AND</strong> <strong>attribute1</strong>(fred,fred's attribute1) <strong>AND</strong> <strong>attribute2</strong>(fred,fred's attribute2) <strong>AND (... so on ...)</strong>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>NarrowTable<strong>: A 'narrow' table refers to any table for which rows represent realizations of (strictly) </strong>exactly<strong> one abstract proposition; that is, records cannot represent any 'conjunctive' facts. Every 'column' in the table must be critical to the representation of a <em>single</em> fact. Note that </strong>there is no inherent limit on the number of columns in a 'narrow table';<strong> all limitations are based on the semantics of these columns with regards to representation of data. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        While 'narrow' table isn't defined in terms of normal forms, there is only one normal form guaranteed to be a 'thin table': <strong>6NF</strong> - which forbids join dependencies on <em>any</em> proper subsets of attributes. <strong>5NF</strong> still allows for join dependencies so long as those are implied strictly by the candidate key(s). Any table in 6NF will be a Thin Table. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But thin tables can be a lower normal-form so long as they don't semantically represent multiple facts... e.g. in the pizza-delivery table in the wikipedia <strong>4NF</strong> example <em>(pizza-parlor,pizza-variety,delivery-area)</em> (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form),">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fourth_normal_form),</a> the fact represented at each row is <em>(pizza-parlor) will deliver (pizza-variety) to (delivery-area)</em>, not <em>(pizza-parlor) will deliver (pizza-variety) AND (pizza-parlor) will deliver to (delivery area)</em>. The latter of these would be a semantic violation of 4NF. It is worth noting that if the wikipedia's <strong>4NF</strong> example had even one <em>actual</em> case of a pizza-parlor delivering a different pizza based on delivery-area, it would prove the table was <strong>already</strong> in <strong>4NF</strong> (and it would also happen to be in <strong>5NF</strong> and <strong>6NF</strong>). It is very likely that any examples <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> or others can come up with regarding these 'semantic' future changes are <strong>already</strong> thin tables, and would (often) <strong>already</strong> be in 6NF if they fulfilled that 'special' exception that just hasn't been bothered to show up yet. (However, I'll later go into a full change-analysis later that shows that failing to make the 'correct' assumption here still leaves the NarrowTablePhilosophy quite flexible, and certainly no less flexible than wide-table philosophy.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be clear that we all work with at least some thin tables - even <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> certainly uses thin tables for most or all of his one->many and many<->many relationships, since doing so is part and parcel to <a href="EntityRelationshipModeling.html">EntityRelationshipModeling</a> as it is traditionally taught. When using a 'thin-tables' approach, one actually uses it as a higher-priority design criterion
      </p>
      <p>
        The most common 'wide' tables in use by well-trained or experienced DBAs are exactly those corresponding to the 'Entity' tables, which (as mentioned in the above example) tend to contain an 'entity-id' then a sequence of One->(Zero|One) attributes. In the cases of 'Zero', these large Entity tables result in NULLs being placed in that location of the column (NULLs that don't even work correctly, no less... but that is a discussion for another page, or perhaps the top of this one...). These clearly represent conjunctive relationships. It is worth noting that 'thin' tables will never have an 'entity' table that carries more than <strong>just</strong> the identifier - all it can have is <strong>isEntity(</strong>fred<strong>)</strong>. It can't say anything else about fred because then it would no longer be a 'thin' table. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Now to represent two basic philosophies:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>WideTablePhilosophy:<strong> Wider is better. If it makes cars more stable, and it works for my kitchen table, it will also work for my RDBMS. Wherever possible, conjugate as many facts as possible into a single table. 'Entity' tables, especially, are fine targets for adding new columns. NULLs aren't too painful; even though they could be implemented better, I can live with them. Optimization is important - if I break tables up, I'll need to join them together later, and joins are expensive. Joins are not so expensive to justify allowing one->many and many<->many relationships into the table, though. And I like having <em>everything</em> under just one name - sure, there are dozens or hundreds of columns, but I can access it all by requesting the table and 'drill down' by specifying whichever columns I want. To me, that beautiful, wide-table almost IS the database. Besides, I'm comfortable with this - it all seems 'simple' to me. I made it work for my last project; I can make it work for my next one. I'll pay no attention to those noises from the men in the ivory tower - they're doing some sort of collective </strong><a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> and I really don't want to look too closely; besides, I have a headache.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things the <strong></strong>WideTablePhilosophy<strong> person doesn't say: When making my arguments about simplicity, I'll just ignore those columns I shaved off to avoid sticking one->many and many<->many relationships in the same table as 'special exceptions' to my philosophy - <em>everything important</em> is one->(zero|one) anyway, so I can usefully 'drill down' and access <em>all</em> the important stuff. Hmm... you know that tendency we wide-table people have for adding "just in case" columns just in case someone needs to add some data we hadn't thought of? yeah, the columns that confuse the fsck out of everyone. Ignore it. Oh, and don't pay attention to how I go scrambling about at the beginning of every project attempting to figure out all the attributes I'll need - I don't think you could possibly do any better because I've never imagined a world any different. Also, I've occasionally noticed that when I need to make changes and I add a column to a wide table, or split a column because I later learn it is a many<->many or one->many relationship, I often need to go back and edit every query in the entire world that does an insert or update to my table. But that's okay... I control all the queries anyway. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and for the moment, I'm going to call 'bloat' on anything related to integrity, security, temporal data and other metadata, etc. 'bloat' because they've never entered my thoughts before and it's easier to ignore them than it is to conclude I should have been thinking about them all along (and my darwinian protect-my-food-source fish-genes are doing a lot of this talking for me). Besides, they must have significant trade-offs... right? Right?!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong>NarrowTablePhilosophy:<strong> </strong><a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>, and facts, themselves, should receive <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> treatment in databases - in particular, they shouldn't be shoved like sardines into a tiny tin table. Ideally, every fact should receive the exact same treatment - this keeps things pure and simple. It just turns out there are a very great many advantages of doing this. Among these advantages: (1) there are never any NULLs, (2) there are never any update anomalies & integrity constraints never need application support, (3) there's suddenly plenty of space to add a lot of meta-data about each and every fact... in particular, to the right of that fact in the table, supporting: (3a) bitemporal databases (time entered, time deprecated, time true start, time true end), (3b) per-fact read & deprecate security (via capability requirement), (3c) derivation information - how the fact was acquired (e.g. derivation tree or agent that added it), (3d) truth-values (and <em>real</em> support for <a href="OpenWorldAssumption.html">OpenWorldAssumption</a>), (3e) confidence-values (and <em>real</em> support for knowledge bases and expert systems). (4) Better concurrency for most transactions due to finer grain - those that don't update the whole panoply of tables will only touch a few tables thus reducing need for waits or chance of time-space collision for optimistic transactions, (5) Thoughts less influenced by 'optimize now!', (6) <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> compliant - and sufficiently flexible refactoring or changes even at runtime (e.g. if the pizza-parlor delivery example had been broken down into makes(pizza-parlor,pizza-variety) and delivers(pizza-parlor,delivery-area), then we later learn that not all pizza-parlors deliver all pizzas to all places, we simply create a new table deliversPizza(pizza-parlor,pizza-variety,delivery-area), populate it with the join of the original two tables, then turn those original tables into views on this new table - all as a single transaction - supposing we don't want to get creative about it and have "relations" that are partially extensive and partially derived (which is fully legit in the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>)), (7) Easy and very well-proven model to support infinite relations (logic functions, essentially - often exactly what you'd see in a <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> language) and even update tables by use of logical union or additional statements of entailment, (8) relations-as-types if you want them (infinite unary relations can easily operate as types, and vice versa) thus homogenizing even the concept of 'domain' - especially in combination with higher-order relations (relations that contain relvar names or relation-descriptors themselves). (9) More efficient, precise, and meaningful applications of 'triggers' - in particular, triggers NEVER used to maintain integrity (because they aren't needed for that task), and triggers could always be extremely precise as to which tables they need to touch and watch for updates. (10) Homogeneity of representation - 'one->many' and 'many<->many' relations are given exactly the same <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> treatment as 'one->(one|zero)' relationships, meaning that people don't have any chance of acting like the simple-minded <strong>Wide Table Philosophy</strong> persons that begin thinking a 'single' table carries everything of importance and they can reach it all by 'drilling down'. Add this to relations-as-types, and <strong>everything</strong> becomes homogeneous <strong>except</strong> for values (domain values). If you add relation-values, then everything is 100% homogeneous and a full <a href="SymmetryOfLanguage.html">SymmetryOfLanguage</a> is achieved (and we 'academics' can toss bones near a monolith and let the <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> begin).
      </p>
      <p>
        Things the <strong></strong>NarrowTablePhilosophy<strong> often forgets to mention: There aren't any RDBMSs that make the thin-table approach optimal, yet - we need, in particular, query and index-optimizations to pre-join or denormalize tables at the physical layer (these optimizations are already well known and mathematically proven) and the ability to easily add tables (as easily as we currently add </strong><a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s or new rows to a table - including support for transactional addition of rows and manipulation of views) and extend 'views' (e.g. adding new entailment-facts to 'exists(x)'). Current RDBMSs simply won't do. Also, we'll need a good <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a>, and the RDBMS will need to keep a lot of information about which tables it has and their relative constraints, such that we can easily construct useful 'views' for the user (update-able views, ideally). Tools like this exist, but nothing that anyone would consider of great quality. In particular, the ability to rapidly construct, edit, and destruct views is quite important, and editable views need to make clear which columns can be edited because they have a variable associated directly with them (you can't edit a column that is the result of certain forms of calculation). Finally, we really, truly, honestly need to replace the DML & DDL; SQL is awful, period, but even more so for the <strong>narrow table philosophy</strong> - joins need to be syntactically cheap and very easy to both write and comprehend, and support for relvar names and complex types (including relation-values) would be highly appreciated. The best query languages for Narrow tables seem to be those developed initially for <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> languages, such as <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a>, <a href="MercuryLanguage.html">MercuryLanguage</a>, and <a href="DataLog.html">DataLog</a>. So, basically, we're asking everyone to ultimately trash or significantly update: (a) all the RDBMSs, (b) all their knowledge of the most common DDL/DML in this world (SQL), (c) any training they may have received in <a href="EntityRelationshipModeling.html">EntityRelationshipModeling</a>, etc. - of <em>course</em> this idea is going to be popular!  
      </p>
      <p>
        We <strong></strong>NarrowTablePhilosophy''' people view 'homogeneity', 'purity', and '<a href="SymmetryOfLanguage.html">SymmetryOfLanguage</a>' as 'simple'. We think the <strong>Wide Table Philosophy</strong> people don't really grok 'simple', certainly not as Einstein meant it, no matter how much lip-service they pay to it. We 'academics' are of the opinion that you'd find our changes great once they were in place - we believe that even <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> would think them simple and great and wouldn't be able to imagine using wide tables if the <strong>narrow table philosophy</strong> had already been incumbent when he received his training. We <em>know</em> that overturning any incumbent and established base is so difficult that you generally need something <em>many times</em> better than the current solution to do so... or enough money to market it as many times better - we know this because we run into this wall over and over and over and over. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fortunately, <strong></strong>NarrowTablePhilosophy<strong> <em>actually is</em> many times better, subject to the proper automated optimizations, access to an even semi-decent </strong><a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a>, and selection of a massively better DML/DDL. This is especially true when it comes to meta-data, which will become more and more important to businesses (as they learn about it) and pretty much every other domain - it is of extremely great import for data mining, for example. It is also especially true in a wide array of domains that RDBMSs have had a difficult time penetrating. I have no doubt that <strong>Narrow Table Philosophy</strong> will very likely be victorious. Unfortunately, it looks like we won't be receiving help from the fish-brained people.

        <strong>Relative Costs of Change:</strong> (under construction)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>(Meta) Definitions and Assumptions:</strong> (since <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> somehow held the ridiculous notion that 'fingerwise-editing' considerations were valid) [I was simply restating my interpretation of your statements. Your metric is not clear.]
          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>deployment:</strong> A schema (or API of any sort) is 'deployed' after there is code outside of ready control that depends upon it. This can, depending on the situation, include application code deployed to client machines, code written by groups other than the DBA, or even code with tight Q&A related to a code-freeze. Deployed code resists change in a real dig-in-your-heels sort of way, no matter how rational the change - people refuse to update clients, it takes a long time to tell people who have written code that touches your database what has changed, it is difficult to fix server-code for the new schema, etc. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>cost assumptions:</strong> The cost of performing a change to a schema is dependent on many things. Prior to going live or deployment, it can be considered near free - one is just moving boxes around on a single piece of paper describing the schema, and one has not meaningfully 'shared' this piece of paper with anyone else so there is no need to keep anyone else up to date. Once a database is live - has real data - there is an additional cost of creating the actual change within the database - e.g. performing the necessary join and inserting the necessary data; this, in the context of everything else, is a relatively minor cost. Further, one must repair local queries, views, insert/update statements, procedures, triggers, local application or server code, etc. - and ultimately test these changes - in accordance with the new database schema. This can actually be quite expensive, especially since it may require changing unit tests and running them with the new schema and so on. And once a schema is <strong>deployed</strong>, the cost for a change becomes remarkably high - the cost of the edits themselves become only moderate relative to the cost for communicating the need to edit or getting permissions to perform the edit. After deployment, the cost of change can be considered nearly prohibitive if the change 'breaks' existing code, but if one must break code then it is the <em>number of times</em> one breaks the code that really determines cost (whether or not it breaks 'badly').
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>sharing:</strong> In the very best case, you can assume that just you or you and the people in a small, tight-knit group are the only persons writing queries for your schema - this applies to a common but fundamentally limited class database scenarios. In this case, you have the ability to hand-check all queries of the database, to enforce certain coding styles, to enforce usage through a particular API, etc. In the broader sense, however, databases can be made available for querying by people outside your control - e.g. business partners. This creates an example of a 'deployed' schema, but has the additional and significant effect that you cannot assume good programming habits on the part of the database users. In fact, you can probably assume the opposite: sloppiness, laziness, fragile code, etc. In these cases, any defense or protection that can be acquired by 'good' programming habits can be defenestrated. E.g. for 'wide' tables, you can eliminate some changes required on 'removal' of a column by ensuring you <strong>always</strong> use 'select explicit,columns' and 'insert into table(explicit,columns)' instead of 'select *' and the generic 'insert'. This does NOT make the wide-table solution equivalent to the narrow-table solution; it only means that the wide-table solution can, with effort and self-discipline, be made "no worse" than the narrow-table solution for a <em>limited</em> application of that scenario.

          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong></strong>WideTablePhilosophy:<strong> Find the appropriate entity-table. Add a new column and initially load it with a default value (NULL in the case where NULLs are allowed). Then update this table against a join of this table and the one with the new data (if one is available), diligently specifying all the columns from the original entity table (maybe dozens) and the new value from the table containing the new value. If there is no table of values, then just add a new column and add any known values by hand. After the new column is added, visit every piece of DML in the world that inserts or updates to this table and make sure it takes the new attribute into account. Also check regular queries if any of them are known to be sensitive to the addition of columns. </strong>DBA Cost:<strong> Table update, New query to perform join, Cost to check all queries in existence.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong></strong>NarrowTablePhilosophy:<strong> Add a new table </strong>newAttribute(<strong>e,attr</strong>)<strong> and load it with the known set of values (if one already has a table of the values, that would be quite easy, since everything you need is there. Then declare the appropriate constraints: newAttribute(e,attr) requires isEntity(e); newAttribute(e,attr) has candidate-key(e), etc.  (Or, as a flexible alternative, specify 'isEntity(e) :- newAttribute(e,_)' depending on whether you want dynamic entities or static entities.) In the one->one case, either add an 'explicit' assumption (e.g. assume(attr,value) :- newAttribute(e,attr),known(e),unknown(attr) - representation depends heavily on DDL) or attempt to add a requirement that 'isEntity(e) requires newAttribute(e,attr),known(attr)' and find the necessary data for the failure cases. </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Cost Comparison:</strong> Populating the data is (slightly) more expensive for the wide-table solution due to the greater amount of text needed to create an update query that accounts for the data already there, though use of good tools can reduce the data-population costs to near equal. The narrow table solution always requires specification of constraints, but this is also easy with good tools (e.g. one-lineing the constraints, foreign-key specs, and defaults - especially for very common patterns like this one, such additions would be near trivial). The great difference in cost comes for the <strong></strong>WideTablePhilosophy<strong> after deployment. If the schema is widely deployed, the cost of checking any queries including insert and delete queries could be prohibitive. These costs in the </strong>WideTablePhilosophy<strong> can be mitigated by addition of "just in case" fields, with a trade-off semantic cost of adding confusion and undocumented 'features' to the system (especially if multiple pieces of data are conjoined into one string in one just-in-case field). Prior to deployment, costs are not meaningfully different; post-deployment, narrow table solution wins hands down.</strong>

          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong></strong>WideTablePhilosophy:<strong> If you delete the column in the entity-table, you'll need to touch all SELECT* and general INSERT queries to ensure they don't break along with any that explicitly SELECT or UPDATE the attribute. Alternatively, you can allow it to remain around as cruft.</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong></strong>NarrowTablePhilosophy:<strong> For this one you'd have a unique table for the attribute, and you'll only need to touch those DML statements that query, insert, or update to that table. Alternatively, deprecate the table (logical delete in a bitemporal database) so it just comes back as 'empty'. </strong>
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Cost Comparison:</strong> Post-deployment, the wide table solution has a strictly greater potential for cost, though intelligent design of queries can help minimize this cost and keep it near-equal to that of the narrow table solution. If any inserts or queries or application code needed touched after adding the attribute, one will <em>certainly</em> need to do so again upon removing the attribute. The narrow-table-solution has the advantage that one never needs to touch existing queries when adding the attribute (since the table is unknown initially, no queries could possibly be affected) which means that you only ever, very strictly, need to touch the queries that were modified or created to explicitly include the attribute after the attribute-table was added. This, overall, results in much better cost prospects for the narrow table solution. However, with some care and attention, the cost for deletion can be reduced to approximately equal in the wide table solution. Pre-deployment, costs aren't meaningfully different. And letting cruft build up has the same cost either way: zero for the DBA, and some potential confusion for everyone else.

        It is a table with only a few columns.. for example consider a bitmask table or the one demonstrated in <a href="ConstantTable.html">ConstantTable</a>. It is narrow or thin because it only has very very few columns (usually less than 5). But, this leads to <em>table</em> thinking instead of <em>relvar</em>. What does one call a tuple that only has two positions in it? We have to at least name this as some sort of pattern. I prefer thin or narrow over <em>skinny</em>. It's harder to say something like <em>that table that Darwen uses in that PDF file</em>. Rather it is easier to say something like <em>thin table</em>. But, if we can find a better name, I'm all for it. It still needs to be patterned, regardless.

        <em>Why five columns? Why not six? Or three? There is already a term for this quantity -- degree. A tuple with only two positions in it has a degree of two.

        myIsam doesn't support (or didn't for many many years) foreign keys and cannot be normalized. It is a spreadsheet (I'm just dissing it). As for what a wide and thin table is.. well in real world examples when we normalize: typically we take some data and put it into a narrow table compared to the table which we are normalizing. We start putting some data into smaller tables (compared to the other table). That's just a point of reference, that when we normalize, generally, more narrower tables are made, and hence not as much width in those tables versus the major table we were normalizing. These narrow tables may grow with time, and will need to be once again normalized - and most likely after normalizing there will be more narrower tables than before when unnormalized. Maybe it can be explained in <em>degrees</em> instead of narrowness and thinness.

        <em>Normalization is unrelated to the presence or absence of foreign key constraints. As long as JOINs are possible (and it would be a pretty useless SQL or relational DBMS that didn't permit JOINs), normalization is viable.

           2NF and higher are constraint-dependent, at least on the semantic constraints (whether or not those are ever explicitly represented in the database). This doesn't contradict you, of course, but it's worth pointing out.

           And I'll note that 'physical implementation' is also independent of the 'result of normalization'. Were I designing an RDBMS, I'd make it easy for the database to decide upon or take suggestions to perform denormalization-based optimizations (i.e. data existing in the physical-layer in a pre-joined fashion but logically provided in the original table design fashion). This would (where the optimization would actually be selected) reduce runtime join costs and possibly storage costs where primary keys are shared by many tables as foreign keys into another, and NULLs in the physical layer would not compromise the logic layer.

           It is true that constraints are an important part of databases. DV has said nothing to deny this. However, database constraints ('Consistency' or 'Integrity') are still a completely separate issue from normalization. Atomicity, Isolation, and Durability are also distinct from normalization. They are no less important for being orthogonal; they're simply independent.

        There appears to be some misunderstanding here. I have in no way deprecated database constraints. They are vital. However, they have nothing to do with normalization.

      </p>
      <p>
        I'd argue that 'failure to normalize' IS promoted by typical database system lack-of-features (or, more accurately, normalization is discouraged). In particular, the lack of powerful and assured physical-layer optimizations that cross tables can make it difficult for algorithmic-complexity-aware programmers to further normalize even in the face of potential errors. Most systems-language programmers need <strong>guaranteed</strong> optimizations, like guaranteed <a href="TailCallOptimization.html">TailCallOptimization</a>, before they feel comfortable <em>trusting</em> the system to 'get it right'. I certainly do. A very common perceived (and generally accurate) optimization is that denormalization on the logical layer (or, equivalently, resisting higher-level normal forms) will result in the same structure on the physical layer, and that by this one avoids costs for joins that would be required if the tables were further normalized. However, if one could simply <em>suggest</em> the Database to effectively 'denormalize' certain tables at the physical layer or otherwise be prepared for a great many join-queries over a certain common subset of tables in such a manner as <em>they could ensure</em> the costs of joins on certain other tables were exactly O(1) rather than O(N) (which would be typical of a join of two tables hash-indexed on the same key) or O(N*log(N)) (which would be typical of a join of two tables tree-indexed on the same key), they would then feel comfortable using the higher level normal forms. For someone who wants the ability to dynamically add new tables of data, this would be even better if the database could simply figure out such optimizations based on the queries it sees. This could be done by any number of mechanisms at the physical layer, of course - e.g. having the same index carry pointers into several tables, and having the query-optimizer take full advantage of this; 'physical layer denormalization' refers only to ensuring that once a shared primary key is found, that joins using that key would cost no more (at least algorithmically) than would having constructed the same logical denormalization in the first place. I strongly suggest you design cross-table optimizations into <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>; the degree to which automated optimizations shape and influence higher level code is not something many designers think about, but it is significant, so optimizations ought to make doing the 'correct' thing the 'best' choice.

        <em>Duly noted. In stating that "failure to normalize is not due to a limitation of any database product", etc., I meant that failure to normalize is not due to lack or presence of (say) foreign key constraints, or any other typical DBMS construct. Any modern DBMS will let you create precisely the tables/relvars you want, whether based on a fully-normalized design or not. However, performance is indeed a concern, and perhaps sometimes </em>overly<em> a concern. For example, I once worked on an interactive database-driven desktop application with an expert data modeler. She studiously normalized the logical design to at least BCNF, then denormalized the implementation back to effectively 1NF on the mistaken assumption that desktop DBMSes (the Jet database engine, in this case) couldn't possibly be fast enough to support JOINs in an interactive context. She wasn't convinced otherwise until I implemented the design in BCNF and demonstrated - on real data - that the response times were more than adequate. Given her mainframe background and lack of PC experience (at the time) I suppose this isn't surprising. But I digress. The </em><a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> currently implements <em>no</em> optimization, and guarantees the worst possible performance in every case. JOINs between two relations, for example, are O(N*M). This is partly due to premature optimization being the root of all evil, and partly due to my intent to use Rel as a research platform for exploring various ideas I have for database optimization. For the educational settings in which Rel is currently used, that's turned out to be perfectly acceptable. For practical applications, I will have to implement some reasonable amount of optimization.<em> -- DV</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that "Premature Optimization is the Root of all Evil" applies only to <strong>hand-implemented</strong> optimizations (like your expert data modeler did with her design). Nothing about the rule applies to automated optimizations, and you don't need to optimize your optimizer-code to get the full benefits. However, I agree that it can wait until Rel is being shifted towards production settings.

        Please clarify this. A given query needing to reference column X is generally independent of the wide/thin model. Thus, the need to rid it from a query is the same regardless. The usage of X is due to a domain task need, not the underlying table model. For example, if a tax verification task needs social-security number, that is because there is a business need for it, regardless of which table or data model its stored in. If we later don't need it, then we clear out the reference either way. If we are using asterisks, then its usually a situation where we wouldn't change it anyhow.

        <em>While the usage of X is a domain thing independent of the underlying table model, the layout or location of X within the table model will depend on which philosophy is being followed.

(See also the approach to having added X to begin with.) If you think about it, after you delete a column from a 'wide' table, you certainly need to run around and touch all the queries that update or insert to that table, and you would be wise to touch even those that query it just to be sure you missed nothing. Since this is a 'wide' entity table, that means every query associated with that entity. Compare this to the NarrowTablePhilosophy, where you have a unique table essentially attrX(entity-id,x-value). You only need to touch the queries that insert, update, or query table 'attrX', and since 'X' has been determined to be <em>unnecessary</em>, there aren't likely to be many queries, updates, or inserts that target 'attrX' explicitly, which means you can get away with deleting 'attrX' without too many worries even if you don't do a search for queries related to X - this is especially true if you added attrX recently and have no reason to believe it in use. (Note that timing doesn't help the WideTablePhilosophy people since they had to touch all the inserts and updates for the entity-table even when adding X in the first place.) Anyhow, this gives NarrowTablePhilosophy an advantage when removing X in most cases (fewer queries to touch), and an even stronger advantage in special cases (recently added). Does this help clear things up? (If so, I'll move this clarification text above.) Do you still have reason to dispute it?<em></em>

        There seems to be a misunderstanding somewhere here. Let's start from square one. When I am designing a task for an app, I ask myself, "what pieces of info do I need from the DB to carry this task out? Hmmm, I need X, Y, and Z to do the necessary computations". Whether X, Y, and Z are in one table or 3 does not affect the task's need for these 3 items. The decision to use XYZ is NOT based on schema design. If the task needs these 3 items then it needs these 3 items. If they were not in the DB, then the task would have to get them from a user prompt or a file maybe. They are "necessary inputs". Removal is the same. It's true we may end up touching a different query or sub-query in a given task, but we still have to change our queries within the task. -- top

      </p>
      <p>
        No I am not. A distinction needs to be made between having to change the routine/task and having to change an existing query. From an finger-wise editing standpoint, the effort to remove a column from INSERT query A (wide) versus having to delete INSERT query B (thin) is about the same. It's a wash. (The cost of having to have multiple insert queries will ding other metrics.) If you are not counting finger and eye movement as your metric, then what are you counting?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Only if you simultaneously assume (a) full control over the queries (i.e. none of them run on a client's machine to which you don't have access), (b) ready access to edit them, (c) file location and access time ~= 0, (d) edit-time >> 0, should 'finger-wise' editing standpoint even come into place. And it should be clear that 'd' is firmly violated in this case. I must laugh a bit, I find it almost ludicrous that you even mention it. Post-deployment costs are high on a per-change basis. The wide-table philosophy is hurt relative to the narrow-table-philosophy because the wide-table-philosophy can require making changes to programs completely unconcerned with 'X' (generic inserts and selects PLUS those that explicitly touch X), whereas the narrow-table-philosophy guarantees this isn't a problem (you only ever touch the table with X if you actually want X).</em>

        You seem to be talking in generalities that have a lot of unstated assumptions behind them. And, I am NOT "dictating" that finger movements etc. be the prime metric; I am just trying to figure out what metrics you are actually using to compare by stating my assumptions and then letting you correct them.

           I find it wishy-washy and non-committal. At points you seem to be suggesting that merely the need to change is sufficiently costly because of all the bureaucracy that goes with it. Thus, "have to make any change" seems to be your metric. That's an okay start, but you still are not communicating why skinny tables would prevent more changes. Like I keep saying, which resources are used by a program/task is mostly driven by info need, not the source of the info. -- top

        <li>
           <em>I've only started filling in the list above. Post-deployment, costs indeed are largely determined by the need to make any change. And your claim that "which resources are used by a program/task is mostly driven by need, not the source of the info" is correct, but largely irrelevant: necessary changes to programs or tasks as a consequence of altering the source ARE, both in practice and (trivially) from definition, driven by changes to the source of the info and determined by use of those sources.

           Let's start with something specific: can you provide a single specific biz-logic scenario where a removal change would be required in the wide-table solution but not the narrow one?
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Easily. Add a random one->one attribute to 'publication' such as, perhaps, the boolean for 'hardback'. Then decide that it isn't needed, or needs to be replaced with something that allows more readily for 'electronic|softback|hardback'. For both the narrow solution and wide-table solution, any queries that explicitly needed this 'hardback' column will, of course, need to be touched. However, </em>'in addition to those<em>', any wide-table solution, task, or application that performs a 'select *' or a generic 'insert' will ALSO need to be touched; application-code is often fragile and can break if an unused column is removed or inserted. Therefore, there are changes required after a removal from the wide-table solution that are not required after a removal from the narrow one. Admittedly, you can avoid these particular costs (for the removal case in the wide-table solution) IF you control all the application code and the queries within it and you fastidiously ensure that there are NO generic 'insert into table values ...' (and you always use 'insert into table(attr1,attr2,attr3) values...' instead) and that there are NO generic 'select * from table' placed anywhere near fragile code. But that would require small projects that are not widely representative of the use of relational databases.</em>

           See example at <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a>: "Paperback Gone". I don't see the wide table creating more update spots under a variety of variations. You seem to be complaining more about asterisks than wide tables. (Let's save the asterisk debate for another day). Also, small apps are more common than large apps such that the total lines of code is probably roughly even between them. But, app-size is not an issue here yet anyhow.

        <strong>Conversion Tax?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is an issue that is being ignored above: <strong>wide tables fit the user usage patterns better</strong>. The user view of the data tends to fit the wide-table philosophy, and thus there are <strong>less translation/conversion steps</strong>. It is somewhat analogous to the OO/relational impedance mismatch where the "shape" of objects being different from relational tables creates the need for a messy translation layer. For example, most <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> edit forms save to just one wide table and we thus need only one insert statement. With thin tables, such a form would have to write to multiple tables. (I assume that you are not suggesting a thin-table-friendly app redesign.) Some RDBMS have updatable views, but these complicate the design, and may be slower. Plus, if you have a view that maps thin tables to the user view (wide), then you have <strong>two</strong> places to update if you add or remove a column from the "entity" view: one in the actual table, and one in the view. Under the wide table, you only have to change the single table itself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a general rule: The closer your internal idioms match domain/user-side idioms, the simpler the design.

        <em>Consider a situation where your </em>'users<strong> are viewing a website that offers services to several </strong>states<strong> in the </strong>USA<em>'. Customers want to find all the cities available in Michigan that your website serves. A wide table doesn't help. You should have your cities in normalized form. It all depends what your users are doing. Consider your customers want to find all the cities that your website has available that start with the letter 'H' in Michigan, because they can't remember the exact name of the city but remember that it might start with H. A normalized table that has cities related to state helps here. Some huge wide table CRUD screen is poor view for many situations - and one should not design his databases so that they map to some huge ugly wide CRUD screen that customers have to put up with. At least, most clearly designed web GUIs use things like checkboxes, edit boxes, text areas, etc that are not thrown in some horrible CRUD screen. Rather they should be placed on the page downward in a nice way.. such as the way people fill out forms on the web where they submit data.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I get the feeling that the type of applications you design are huge wide CRUD screens where people directly enter boolean values and NULLs, instead of using eye candy like check boxes, radio selections, drop downs, etc that are spread on the screen in what is called a </em>'view<strong> or </strong>GUI<em>'. Do you really let people enter the data into the database directly, without any eye candy and human interface? What happens when these humans have to view all the cities in a certain state only? Your wide table ain't gonna match up to what the human needs. </em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If your application is one huge ugly CRUD screen where people enter booleans and prefer scrolling sideways instead of downward (very inhuman) then I can see where your viewpoint is coming from - actually, I can't see where your viewpoint is coming from - as it sounds like the type of apps you develop are excel spreadsheet views of everything, and it makes little sense to me.. since most GUIs are not like one huge ugly excel spreadsheet spanning 3 pages wide. Most GUIs are for humans that like to search things, update pieces of things, find cities available, find facts relating to certain data, etc. Consider even Midnight Commander when you open up the dialog box to view available chMod commands - these bitmasks/mods should be in a thin table or an enumeration, not shoved in some wide table that we cannot sanely access, since the bitmasks are hidden away and cannot be queried in their own bitmask (thin) table! </em>

        <em>I think your CRUD application experience has distorted your entire view on what the relational model and normalization is all about.

But if the user ever wants to query what states we sold chocolate bars in.. they are better in their own (thin) table for the view. So the argument that thin tables are worse for the view is nonsense when you are querying the data and searching it - which frankly lots of applications do. And, I can't say I've seen many poorly designed apps that allow one to view the entire wide table as one huge wide screen where I have to scroll sideways 5 pages.</em>

So again, the view of a thin table helps when we want to query the homes, since the homes relate to the homes, not the chocolate bars or the person's first name. So the view, being flexible, rather than fixed.. is better when it can access normalized data.. crud screens seem better for fixed wide spreadsheet style views. I've always thought of databases as flexible - create any view I want. You seem to map the data to the application. But what happens when you need to grab statistics about what relates to what?

        <em>For the narrow table solution, there are strictly fewer cases; all those that include 'd' must do so explicitly by including 'fooD' and are equivalent to the wide-tables that explicitly request 'd'.

Where the DBA cannot (or through lack of foresight </em>does<em> not) rule those out by demanding certain coding standards be adhered to (which, as you note, is the case often enough to be worth mentioning), the narrow table solution is better.

            <li>
               You must think me remarkably dense if you didn't believe I <em>already know</em> about explicit columns on inserts after reading the final two wide-table insert cases I had written above. The ability to do this doesn't make the problem case disappear.

            <li>
               Indeed - places where 'd' is <strong>explicitly</strong> referenced would be there for both wide-tables and narrow-tables (via 'fooD'), and therefore thin tables are no worse than wide-tables in these cases. This was mentioned above.

           Further, I often use insert-statement generators that automatically skip empty/blank columns. SQL is pretty good about not requiring you to mention columns not used (but sucks in other ways). There would be one "save" reference either way for the INSERT scenario that would have to be removed. Or are you counting the fact that for INSERT statements you have two places in a given statement for the widie - the name before the Values clause and value itself. You are indeed right about this. However, this is a flaw of SQL syntax because it should allow UPDATE-like pairing. And again I often use statement generators that limit it to one statement per column. I'll give you minor points on that, but only as a syntax design flaw in SQL. -- top

               Sigh. Waving your arms a bit and claiming some self-discipline doesn't make the basic issue go away. Self-discipline only helps your case so long as you are the only person who ever writes queries for your schema. And, no, the finger-wise editing shit related to SQL syntax and two places for removal of the 'd' column are so minor that I'm not even counting them.

            <li>
               <em>If you are not counting it, then what are you counting for INSERT scenarios to claim advantage on #4? (You are right about counting the clause generators. My bad. But, others have mentioned IDE's, I would note.)</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Fundamentally, there is always the potential of someone performing such an 'insert' as seen in sub-case 4. This can happen out of laziness (for really-wide tables, specifying all the columns twice may be too much a hassle). This can happen for a number of other reasons (preference of programmers outside your control, for example - you can't stop other people from doing things you consider stupid any more than all my reasoning power can prevent you from doing things I consider stupid). This 'INSERT' code breaks when you delete column 'd' even though it could have been written so it wouldn't break. This means that narrow-tables are <em>better</em> - more advantageous - in these specific situations where they prevent this pointless breakage, such as when the DBA lacks full control over all the queries; see also the <strong>sharing</strong> section under assumptions and definitions, above.

               <em>I thought you said you were not counting the "splitness" of INSERT syntax. Have you changed your mind, or am I misreading the above? I don't care if you do, I just want to make sure thats the case.</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   The finger-wise editing of the 'split' INSERT syntax is not counted as a significant cost. However, the tendency for people to lazily perform the insert with all the columns is real and has a significant impact on code-change costs.

                <li>
                   That 'psychology' backpedaling of yours isn't very strong. The <strong>reason</strong> people use 'select *' doesn't matter - the issue of laziness is merely illustrative to help you grasp that people can and do apply many different solutions to the same problem for reasons you might disagree with. Heck, some might even do it even for reasons you'd initially agree with (<a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> - some interpret 'select *' as 'simpler' than 'select a,bunch,of,columns'. If it breaks later, they say, you can fix it later - even post-deployment... just call everyone using your database up and force them to change their code! You often promote behavior in the name of simplicity that I consider simplistic in the greater context.) What matters is that the removal of column 'd' <strong>can</strong> break code that never <strong>explicitly</strong> touches 'd' - not even to print it. This also means that 'd' isn't even available for searches via refactoring browser, and you can't be sure that removing 'd' only requires you touch code that explicitly touches 'd'. In the narrow-table solution, even if programmers habitually loaded all the tables with their query, you'd always have explicit mention of the table 'fooD' in any code that might break because 'fooD' is removed.

                   Eh, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, you obviously didn't think that one through. The asterisk is NOT helping here; or, more accurately, the ONLY help it is providing is saving a few keystrokes in the initial creation of the query, which just happens to be an entirely different scenario than the one under fire. Queries that explicitly request columns associated with app-code that does NOT "use" the removed column ALSO do not have to be altered when you remove the column BECAUSE they never request that column in the first place. Therefore, come time to remove the column, the 'select *' offers you NO ADVANTAGE over such code. This just happens to include all the narrow-table code that doesn't require the column. In addition, you're (in a remarkable display of stupidity) assuming all cases of 'select *' are sub-case 2 - that application code is ALWAYS 100% robust and can ALWAYS survive the removal of a column without breaking. Not only is this trivially false (I've seen plenty counter-examples and could write some in a jiffy if you really need it); it isn't even uncommon. There are many cases where you have to alter the routine when the app code itself does not "use" the removed column because the app code <em>breaks anyway</em> after that column's removal. While the asterisk might help a tiny bit in the initial scenario of writing the query in the first place, when it comes time to remove a column it is objectively <strong>no better or worse for every single case</strong>. And, sure, not all scenarios are equal in frequency. But that fact doesn't help YOUR point in any way.

                   Ah, so it all comes down, for you, to finger-wise movements. I'll give you that the asterisk saved you from moving your fingers to touch the query statement. Instead you just need to handle broken application code - sometimes even application code that never touches 'd'. But don't mind that!  You saved the time it takes to delete "d," from "select id,a,d,e"! That's <strong>surely</strong> a significant boon relative to the costs of either fixing the application code to exclude 'd' and dealing with the extra complication - the potential for broken, fragile application code that never used 'd' in the first place! Pffft. As I said, finger and eye movement metrics don't count for much - not unless you can offer good reason for them to be significant relative to the costs of finding the right code to fix and the even greater (post-deployment only) cost of acquiring capability to fix it. If you were to ask: hand-entry of data would be significant, as would hand/eye repair of rows that failed a translation due to poor logical consistency and excessive use of poorly implemented NULLs. Deleting an extra "d," along with a bunch of OTHER scattered uses of "d" in application code associated with the query? Not so much - it's just one extra place to touch, in a highly associated grouping of code (query + response handler), <em>of at least two</em>; it is not even algorithmically significant! It, quite simply, doesn't even begin to make up for costs of fixing application code that breaks simply because it used 'select *' and was a little on the fragile side (e.g. using column offsets, or storing to a fixed-width array of strings).

                   I've never used psychological arguments as a metric, just to help illustrate a reason you can't casually dismiss a valid metric that you had been fastidiously ignoring. My metric is asymptotic cost of change per scenario, measured in both potential and necessary (potential >= necessary). In practice, this is closer to volume<strong>s</strong> of code that need changing - not absolute number, but relative portions. The cost of having to edit code in one solution that would not need edited in the other is a great deal higher by this metric than is the cost of having to delete one additional "d," along with at least one explicit use of said 'd' in application (indeed, the 'd,' is cheap and has no effect on asymptotic cost at all). You are, perhaps, used to thinking in 'finger-movements' so you attempt to translate what I'm saying into it - I suppose if you only have that hammer, everything looks to you like a nail. The cost of changing a volume of code internally is, in post-deployment situations, often less expensive than achieving the capability to change it (which may require contacting all sorts of people who have written queries for the database). In pre-deployment (or non-deployment situations), the cost of changing each volume of code and performing all unit-tests and passing everything is pretty much the sum of the costs (albeit not minor). I do assume that queries are written to go along with application or other code that utilize them. As a general consequence of that, fixing the queries themselves is a tiny fractional cost of fixing the application code, firing up the appropriate development environment, and testing the change via any unit tests or analysis. When you keep tooting your horn about a <strong>tiny</strong> savings in a <strong>tiny</strong> fractional cost of the total change, I keep rolling my eyes and yelling at you; it's penny-wise and pound foolish. The relative <em>potential</em> cost of having to change application code that breaks that never even touched 'd' is far, far greater than any such savings.

And changing application code is considered among the most expensive impacts of change, so it's hardly a good thing; it's especially bad where the app-code breaks because the 'd' column is missing even though it wasn't using the 'd' column explicitly (i.e. sub-case 1).

This means they'd be of equal cost to the wide-table solution in those cases where 'd' is required for domain purposes. HOWEVER, you're forgetting to add to the wide-table costs all the post-'select *' application code that <strong>doesn't</strong> use column 'd' but breaks anyway when 'd' is removed (i.e. sub-case 1), and all the 'insert into foo values' code where column 'd' was included but was not part of a form or anything (sub-case 4). You cannot legitimately drop said things even if you use great self-discipline and always select/insert by columns, because DBAs for wide-tables are not always in the position to control all query code.

               I'm not following. There are plenty of <strong>nicknames</strong> for factors, I don't dispute that; but the existence or lack of a nickname doesn't make the factor "weigh more" or an official canon. Some nicknames are used more simply because they are mentally catchy and/or easy to remember, not necessarily because they are more important. "Bloat" is also a nickname for violating parsimony and/or code-size conservation, by the way. I didn't invent/introduce the term "bloat" into coding circles. <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> is also closely related to "bloat", and I didn't invent that either. If a wiki topic focuses on a specific kind of bloat, then it's rational to call that topic "bloatX" or "bloat and X" or the like. I'm not doing anything weird or odd.

Thus, it may just be different domain or specialty experience. Further, the fact that "narrow" tables are relatively uncommon suggests that <strong>others found them a pain also</strong>. There's also the possibility that it's a <a href="TechniqueWithManyPrerequisites.html">TechniqueWithManyPrerequisites</a>.

        I have already described these in the various "table width debate" topics. In the name of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, I do not wish to repeat them. It would perhaps be nice if I provided topic names and/or page-anchors, but I'm not going to do that today.

        Sigh. Fewer joins, and simpler insertions and updates are two. Smaller name-space of tables is another. I realize name-space-size may be a subjective preference or differ per mind, but I work better with a smaller name-space, all else being equal. We've been over these already. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        {If smaller namespace, fewer joins, and simpler inserts/updates are the deciding factors, then why normalise at all?}
      </p>
      <p>
        To rid data duplication. Fully de-normalizing also makes inserts/updates difficult because then we have to manage data duplication. And if your tables fit domain nouns closely, then there is smooth and/or natural mental mapping between domain nouns and tables: employees, vendors, paychecks, orders, help-desk-tickets, etc. Heavy normalization clutters up the name-space with piddly attributes mixed among primary domain nouns.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Just ridding data duplication generally gets you to BCNF.  Do you then consider the anomalies that can result from not achieving higher normal forms to be worth it?}
      </p>
      <p>
        I would consider such on case-by-case basis rather than Always-Do-X. I do believe you are exaggerating the frequency of the "anomalies" you talk about; or else your specialty areas bring you to different problem ratios. They are infrequent compared to other problems in my personal observation.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Considering them on a case-by-case basis is reasonable.  You did not appear to be advocating considering normalisation on a case-by-case basis; you appeared to advocate no higher normal forms, by strongly arguing against "thin" tables.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see that in my text. For example, near the top, I say <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> should be the <em>primary</em> factor. I didn't say "only" factor. If you find a problem phrase, point it out at the spot of the problem and I'll cheerfully review it.

      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen a wide mix. Big telecoms and power utilities I did contracts for had dedicated DBAs. Most Oracle shops do as Oracle is usually used for bigger projects (as it costs an arm and a leg) such that a dedicated DBA is almost necessary. -- top

However, I've also found similar problems with dedicated graphics designers who don't know a thing about HTML or programming or templates or databases (and some don't even know how to properly write emails, they only know graphics, etc). I guess I come from a smaller/medium project size background but even on larger projects the communication between developers and the database admins (who are usually developers too) must be very tight in order for the project to work out.</em>
      </p>

        [I'm afraid I'll have to back top on this one, sort of. I currently work at a company that has at least two full-time DBAs, and they are busy enough that asking them to write the applications as well would be counterproductive. My previous employer didn't have any, but several of our clients did, and only one also had time to spend writing applications. The only one that had any free time was the one using Oracle.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you use the word "afraid" because you think I might let it go to my head, expanding my ego, making me more arrogant and annoying? Nah, never happens. See, I started out fully arrogant and annoying to avoid such drift ;-) -- top

        <em>I still have my doubts - for example, the companies these people work with - do they have employees that spend all their time on C2 wiki and just pretend to be programmers and DBA's?

That includes myself, although </em><a href="IveLeftToCode.html">IveLeftToCode</a> is a good pattern to follow when your company decides it needs a dedicated DBA - because maybe the developers just aren't working hard enough.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What I have trouble seeing, is how a DBA can modify a database without notifying all his programmers and all his application programmers (which may take just as much work as if he was a developer himself and could navigate through the code in his mind and on his screen). i.e. they must be a very tightly nit development team - no matter if wide tables or thin tables are used. If a dedicated DBA modifies the database, it doesn't matter whether the database is fully normalized or not - the developers still need to be very carefully notified and extremely cautious that the application isn't broken. In cases such as where you have an un-normalized wide table with Image1, Image2, and Image3 instead of an images table, its even worse for the application BTW.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [One can use views. In the RDBMSs I've used, the applications can't tell a view from a table (unless they look at the meta data). As such, the DBA can create views that present the data the way the application is expecting while still allowing the DBA to control the way data is actually stored.]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>(For database retrievals, this is generally true. For database updates, VIEW support is variable. Some DBMSes do not allow VIEW updates at all, others implement updates according to vendor-specified internal rules, and some require the database developer to specify explicit rules, i.e., what INSERT, UPDATE, and DELETE mean when applied to a given VIEW. There is not yet a universal set of VIEW update rules that will allow any reasonable VIEW to be treated as a virtual table. This is still a matter of academic research and debate.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
          [While universal rules would make the job of setting up and maintaining those view easier, it isn't necessary to solve the problem (how to change the database without modifying all programs). All you need is a database with updatable views, even if specifying how to update is proprietary and manual. Obviously the solution doesn't work if the RDBMS doesn't support updatable views in any form.]
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>(What I forgot to mention was that among DBMSes that implement vendor-specified internal rules, it is typical to find VIEWs which should theoretically be updatable but aren't updatable at all, and DBMSes that support user-defined update rules are (unfortunately) rare. In short, using VIEWs to isolate applications from the database is often impractical in update contexts.)</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        {As I understand it, one job of a dedicated DBA is to receive change requests complete with valid technical reasons, sit on them for a few days (or weeks), then tell you 'NO!' for a bunch of valid political reasons. Or... at least that's my understanding after having worked with one. DBAs won't often be modifying the logical database - not without cooperation of the programmers. It is almost certainly NOT a good idea to have a full DBA sitting on the database in the infancy of the application or service, though it is likely smart to have someone (be it a good programmer or DBA) who understands both the relational model and the implementation & optimization & logical consistency details.}
      </p>
      <p>
        [The DBAs I've worked with have had security and performance as their primary jobs. The stuff involving schema changes is a very small portion of it, and was always developer driven, with the developer responsible for identifying points where the change would break the applications.]
      </p>
      <p>
        A "good" DBA will ask good questions and explain their reasoning well rather than just say "no". Good designs will consider and balance BOTH the here-and-now app-specific requirement AND the longer-term view that (useful) data tends to outlive applications. It should be a lively give-and-take.
