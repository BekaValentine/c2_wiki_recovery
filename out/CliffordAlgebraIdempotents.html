        Clifford Algebra Idempotents
      </h1>
      <p>
        Idempotents are important in <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>. They are quantities which square to themselves i.e. for some <strong>p</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>p</strong>^2 = <strong>p</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The obvious ones are 0 and 1, but there are others. Consider a unit vector, which I will call <strong>e1</strong>, though I would prefer the 1 to be a suffix.
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong>^2 = 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        so that is not idempotent. Instead look at <strong>p1</strong> = (1 + <strong>e1</strong>)/2, which is idempotent.
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>p1</strong>^2 = ((1 + <strong>e1</strong>)/2)^2 = (1 + <strong>e1</strong>)(1 + <strong>e1</strong>)/4 = (1 + 2<strong>e1</strong> +1)/4 = (1 + <strong>e1</strong>)/2 = <strong>p1</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now try <strong>p2</strong> = (1 - <strong>e1</strong>)/2, which is also idempotent.
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>p2</strong>^2 = ((1 - <strong>e1</strong>)/2)^2 = (1 - <strong>e1</strong>)(1 - <strong>e1</strong>)/4 = (1 - 2<strong>e1</strong> +1)/4 = (1 - <strong>e1</strong>)/2 = <strong>p2</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now try
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>p1 p2</strong> = (1 + <strong>e1</strong>)(1 - <strong>e1</strong>)/4 = (1 + <strong>e1</strong> - <strong>e1</strong> -1)/4 = 0<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        so that the product of <strong>p1</strong> and <strong>p2</strong> is zero.  This makes the <em></em>BinomialTheorem<em>, as usually understood, very simple. If </em>a<em> and </em>b<em> are scalar constants then</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        (<em>a</em> <strong>p1</strong> + <em>b</em> <strong>p2</strong>)^n = <em>a</em>^n <strong>p1</strong> + <em>b</em>^n <strong>p2</strong> <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        as all the other terms are zero, containing at least one of each of <strong>p1</strong> and <strong>p2</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is the use of all this?  Well <strong>e1</strong> can be represented as the difference of <strong>p1</strong> and <strong>p2</strong>.
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong> = <strong>p1</strong> - <strong>p2</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        so that the previous result can be used to show the structure of the powers of <strong>e1</strong>. 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong>^2 = (<strong>p1</strong> - <strong>p2</strong>)^2 = 1^2 <strong>p1</strong> + (-1)^2 <strong>p2</strong> = <strong>p1</strong> + <strong>p2</strong> = 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This can be extended in various ways. It works for negative powers, where the expression in terms of the <em></em>BinomialTheorem<em> </em>
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong>^-1 = (<strong>p1</strong> - <strong>p2</strong>)^-1	 -- (1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        cannot be manipulated directly because neither <strong>p1</strong> nor <strong>p2</strong> can be inverted. However, <strong>e1</strong>^-1 can be evaluated, see below, but not following directly  from (1), giving the result
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong>^-1 = 1^-1 <strong>p1</strong> + (-1)^-1 <strong>p2</strong> = <strong>p1</strong> - <strong>p2</strong> = <strong>e1</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        showing that <strong>e1</strong> is its own inverse.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have an extended version of this called <strong>Vector Exponential</strong> on my web site: <a href="http://www.ceac.aston.ac.uk/research/staff/jpf/clifford/vecexp/index.php">http://www.ceac.aston.ac.uk/research/staff/jpf/clifford/vecexp/index.php</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Proof of why it works for negative power -1</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As <strong>e1</strong>^2 = 1 the characteristic polynomial of <strong>e1</strong> is 
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>m</em>^2 = 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which has roots <em>m1</em> = +1 and <em>m2</em> = -1
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact (see Snygg) <strong>p1</strong> and <strong>p2</strong> are the eigenfunctions of <strong>e1</strong> given by
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>p1</strong> = (<strong>e1</strong> - <em>m2</em>) / (<em>m1</em> - <em>m2</em>) = (1 + <strong>e1</strong>)/2<br/>
        <strong>p2</strong> = (<strong>e1</strong> - <em>m1</em>) / (<em>m2</em> - <em>m1</em>) = (1 - <strong>e1</strong>)/2<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and also
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>p1</strong> + <strong>p2</strong> = 1				--- (1)<br/>
        <em>m1</em><strong>p1</strong> + <em>m2</em><strong>p2</strong> = <strong>e1</strong>			--- (2) <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Multiplying (2) on the left by <strong>p1</strong>, right multiplying by <strong>e1</strong>^-1 and dividing by <em>m1</em> (scalar and nonzero), and using <strong>p1 p2</strong> = 0, then 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>p1 e1</strong>^-1 = <strong>p1 e1 e1</strong>^-1/<em>m1</em> = <strong>p1</strong>/<em>m1</em>	--- (3) <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Similarly, multiplying (2) on the left by <strong>p2</strong>, right multiplying by <strong>e1</strong>^-1 and dividing by <em>m2</em> (scalar and nonzero) 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>p2 e1</strong>^-1 = <strong>p2 e1 e1</strong>^-1/<em>m2</em> = <strong>p2</strong>/<em>m2</em>	--- (4)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Adding (3) and (4)
      </p>
      <code>
        (<strong>p1</strong>+<strong>p2</strong>) <strong>e1</strong>^-1 =  <strong>p1</strong>/<em>m1</em> + <strong>p2</strong>/<em>m2</em> <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and because of (1), the result is
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong>^-1 =  <strong>p1</strong>/<em>m1</em> + <strong>p2</strong>/<em>m2</em> <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Check</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1 e1</strong>^-1 =  (<em>m1</em><strong>p1</strong> + <em>m2</em><strong>p2</strong>) (<strong>p1</strong>/<em>m1</em> + <strong>p2</strong>/<em>m2</em>) =  (<em>m1/m1</em>)<strong>p1</strong> + (<em>m2/m2</em>)<strong>p2</strong> = <strong>p1</strong> + <strong>p2</strong> = 1	<br/>
      </code>

        He shows how to find the expression of a Clifford Variable as a sum of multiples of idempotents.

        This all depends on something which Hestenes mentions, in <a href="HestenesOerstedMedalLecture.html">HestenesOerstedMedalLecture</a> at the bottom of page 16, as a misleading piece of teaching: "it is meaningless to add scalars to vectors". This was one of the comments I had when I circulated the <strong>Vector Exponential</strong> to my colleagues as a Christmas greeting.
