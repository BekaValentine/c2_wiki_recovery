        Clamato is a <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> dialect implemented in  <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> by <a href="AviBryant.html">AviBryant</a>.

        Clamato is a Smalltalk dialect that is designed to operate within the <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> runtime. (For non-Canadians: “clamato” is what you get when you add clams to tomato juice. Some consider this an unholy mixture; others, a tasty treat.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Clamato is still experimental and changing rapidly. The following things are true for now, but might not be tomorrow:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Clamato is self-hosting, in that it can compile itself to efficient <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, entirely within the web browser. It uses a parser library based on Lukas Renggli’s PetitParser. Smalltalk constructs (eg: temps, instance variables, message sends, blocks) generally map one-to-one to their <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> equivalents (respectively: local variables, object properties, method calls, functions).
        </li>
        <li>
          There are several departures from Smalltalk’s syntax and semantics. The most notable of these are: no explicit returns, 0-based indexing, no metaclass hierarchy, special syntax for instance variables.
        </li>
        <li>
          Clamato includes an (incomplete) interface to the JQuery <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> library, along with a Seaside-like HTML builder.
        </li>
        <li>
          Cæsar is a system browser built on all of the above. Like Clamato, it departs in a few notable ways from traditional Smalltalk browsers, but retains their spirit.
