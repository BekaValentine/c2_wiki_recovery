        Cons Cell
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>s are the building blocks of lists in <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a> can be thought of as a structure that can refer to two other things. The "other things" can be either a <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a> or an <em>atom</em>. (In <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>s, anything that is not a <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a> is an atom -- strings, numbers, symbols, etc.) For irrelevant historical reasons, the first of these two things is referred to as the <strong>CAR</strong> of the <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>, and the second is referred to as the <strong>CDR</strong> of the <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental constructor is CONS.  Thus, in typical <a href="LispNotation.html">LispNotation</a>,
      </p>
      <code>
        (cons 1 2)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        evaluates to
      </p>
      <code>
        (1 . 2)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which is the <a href="DottedPairNotation.html">DottedPairNotation</a> of a <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a> containing the value 1 in its CAR and the value 2 in its CDR. (<strong>cons</strong> is a primitive built-in function of Lisp; it constructs <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>s.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The atom <strong>NIL</strong> has a special meaning when used in a <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>; it denotes "nothing". Lists can be built from <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>s as follows: 
      </p>
      <code>
        (cons a (cons b (cons c NIL)))  == (list a b c) == (a b c).<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The form
      </p>
      <code>
        (a b c)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        is just a pretty representation of
      </p>
      <code>
        (a . (b . (c . NIL)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Such a list is known as a <em></em><a href="ProperList.html">ProperList</a><em>.  The CAR of the first </em><a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a> in the list refers to the first element of the list. The CDR of the first <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a> refers to the tail of the list, which, in a <a href="ProperList.html">ProperList</a>, is itself a list. When the CDR is NIL, then you've reached the end of the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        This explains why CAR and CDR [Also knowns as FIRST and REST, in <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>]
        behave as they do: they extract the first or second part of a <a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>,
        respectively.  If that cell happens to be the first cell of a list, the
        CDR extracts a whole sublist, which then is the <em>REST</em> of the original list.
      </p>
      <p>
        This incredibly simple and ingenious representation is amazingly powerful.
        Lisp takes the idea to the extreme, by representing lisp programs themselves
        as lists, allowing Lisp to construct or analyze lisp statements very easily.
        This lends the language an amazing recursive, introspective flavour not 
        duplicated in any other language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They sound more like the building blocks of binary trees than lists.  Is "</em><a href="ConsCell.html">ConsCell</a>" another name for "node"?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, it's just a funny name for a node of a binary tree. What's intriguing about <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>s is that <em>everything</em> can be built up from binary trees of atoms. That includes both data and code -- <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>s can treat code as data to an extent that you won't see in any other major branch of computer languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, another way to look at it is they are the nodes in a singly-linked list. I also want to point out that it's a bit of an overstatement to say that <em>everything</em> in Lisp is built out of cons cells. <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, supports a rich array of built in datatypes such as arbitrary magnitude integers, hash tables, multidimensional arrays, streams, etc. which are <em>not</em> built out of cons cells. Which is not to say that lists, trees, and other data structures built out of cons cells aren't quite convenient. And it is true that Lisp source code is parsed into lists built out of cons cells (which is important because <a href="LispMacro.html">LispMacro</a>s can then operate on those lists at compile time to generate new code which is then fed to the compiler.) -- <a href="PeterSeibel.html">PeterSeibel</a>
