        Performance Without Appraisal
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is Chapter 9 of <em></em>TheLeadersHandbook<em> [ISBN 0070580286] by </em>PeterScholtes.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of discussion on PerformanceAppraisals, bonuses, and rewards occurred on the Extreme Programming yahoo mailing list. Lot of concerns and questions raised there can be found in this chapter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Scholtes explains why Performance Appraisals do not contribute to a company, and suggests ways to migrate to a system without Performance Appraisal.
