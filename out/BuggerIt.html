        Bugger It
      </h1>
      <p>
        A quintessentially Australian expression. A slightly more robust version of StuffIt (the curse, not the Mac compression program), about on par with ScrewIt, and distinctly lower in offensiveness than EffYouCeeKay It.
      </p>
      <p>
        Useful for substituting in <a href="WarStories.html">WarStories</a> for the incredibly longer string of curse words you really said at the time.
      </p>

        <em>I've heard this plenty often enough in the UK to be sure that, even if it's quintessentially Australian, it's not exclusively Australian.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe not - but I think the expression "Bugger this for a joke!" (to show frustration or exasperation) is pretty-much Australian.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Northern UK idiomatic equivalent is "bugger this for a game of soldiers", not sure why.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also SodIt and "sod this for a game of soldiers".  This figures given the common basic meaning...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And to bring it full-circle, "Sod this for a lark" is an Aussie phrase with the same meaning.</em>
      </p>

        I thought it was a UK expression. Used on almost every page in the <a href="DiscWorld.html">DiscWorld</a> books of <a href="TerryPratchett.html">TerryPratchett</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Next you'll be telling me Morpork (an Australian bird) is quintissentially British 'cos Pratchett wrote about it.  I think he may actually have visited Australia once or twice :)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        - <strong>Morepork</strong>s are New Zealand birds!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think you'll find it's 'Bugger this', or 'Buggeremmilleniumhandandshrimp'. :) Anyway, as stated above,it's quintessentially Australian, not exclusively Australian. Certainly the verb 'bugger' is multicultural.</em>
