        Quick Hack Therapy
      </h1>
      <p>
        Yesterday I wrote a little <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> program to convert a configuration file from an old format to a new format: about 100 lines, mostly just reading lines, running them through regexps and outputting XML.  I'm putting it in the repository in case somebody else wants to see it, but I doubt it will have to be used again.
      </p>
      <p>
        It probably qualifies as a quick hack: there is no abstraction in the data, just dictionaries of lists; several special-cases hardcoded in; and it's not split into methods.  If I kept at it for a few more minutes I'm sure I could make it easier to understand and more reusable.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the time being I'm chosing not to do that, and finding that quite an interesting experience.  I think for me it is therapeutic to remember that some programs must be cleaner than others; that I can refactor next time I work on it.  In some ways the program is simpler when it is a hardcoded text-processor than it would be if it parsed the old file into objects, manipulated those objects, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand it would be terrible if a 2kloc program was written in the same style, and I can't rule out that somebody will later need to extend it.  I like to think that if that person is me I'd split it up and refactor during the changes.
      </p>

        What do you think?

        Great topic.  It can be difficult to learn which programs need to be OO-normal and which can be denormalized.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started out wanting to apply everything I know about OO to every program I wrote.  So, even when writing a quick hack, I'd spend time making it a somewhat less quick hack.  If I parsed command-line arguments, I'd have an object for it.  If there was an object in the problem domain, I'd make an object for it.  And so on. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My extreme OO behavior cost me time, but I got away with it because I type very quickly and can belt out lots of code in a short amount of time.  The main reason I did it was to instill OO habits, to make creating and using objects second nature.  That worked: overusing OO is a great technique for learning it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advent of refactoring as a conscious strategy has given me a good tool for deciding when to engage in normalized OO and when not to.  First <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.  That might mean parsing the command line right there in main.  Then refactor until it's Good Enough.  When writing the one-off program, Good Enough means I will understand it when I come back to it in a day or two or 10 (my experience shows that most one-offs are really run 2 or 10 or 20 times before discarding them), but I will leave any smelly code that's not actually putrid.  When writing production code, Good Enough means that it has the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>.  Only the faintest smells allowed.

        It is important to remember that <a href="LearningMeansMakingMistakes.html">LearningMeansMakingMistakes</a>.  When I was
        learning OO programming, I acted like <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a> and made the mistake of
        overabstracting, which was fine since I was trying to learn how to abstract
        and was not trying to produce code as fast as I could.  If you want to produce
        code as fast as possible, over-abstracting is even more dangerous than
        underabstracting.  Now I'm trying to <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>
        and I imagine that I will sometimes do something to simple to work.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you write a script once and it gets used for years without ever needing
        to be changed, it doesn't matter how readable it is.  I think it is fine
        to write quick hacks and then to refactor them when you have to change it.
