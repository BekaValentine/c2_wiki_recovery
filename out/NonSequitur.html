        Latin for "(it) does not follow". Applied to a statement that's supposed to be a logical consequent of a line of reasoning but in fact is not. Technically, a <em>non sequitur</em> is a superclass of many logical fallacies for which a putative consequent doesn't follow the precedent, such as <a href="UndistributedMiddle.html">UndistributedMiddle</a> and <a href="ArgumentByAnalogy.html">ArgumentByAnalogy</a>, but use should be restricted to consequents that don't fall into another class. For example, in the argument: "Socrates is a man and men are mortal, therefore Socrates is dead," the fragment "Socrates is dead" is a <em>non sequitur</em>. The greater the apparent randomness of a supposed consequent, the more likely to be accurate is the appellation.
