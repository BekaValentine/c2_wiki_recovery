        Multiple Document Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MultipleDocumentInterface.html">MultipleDocumentInterface</a> is a Windows term for an application in which several documents can be open at a time within sub-windows of the main application window.
      </p>
      <p>
        An alternative would be a SingleDocumentInterface, in which each application window can contain only one document, but there can be multiple application windows open on the screen to display several documents at once.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the Macintosh interface (OS 9 and OS X) is neither SingleDocument nor MultipleDocument; rather, it's a sort of blend of both, because there is only one menu bar for the entire application but each document window is independent.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MultipleDocumentInterface.html">MultipleDocumentInterface</a> is often preferable because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The application can provide ways of arranging the document sub-windows to make it more convenient to view them or exchange data between them. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The application can let the user perform operations (e.g., search & replace) on multiple files simultaneously.
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a single menu bar for the entire application. The document windows typically do not have their own menu bars, saving space when there are multiple documents visible.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="MultipleDocumentInterface.html">MultipleDocumentInterface</a> is often <strong>not</strong> preferable because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Though the application window makes it more convenient to exchange data between documents within the same application, it makes it more difficult to exchange data between documents in different applications.
        </li>

           Resizing a multiple-document window takes several steps: first you have to resize the application window, then you have to move and resize the document sub-windows within the application window.
        </li>
        <li>
           When you need to resize the application window, you often end up obscuring some of the document sub-windows. Often, the application window puts up a scroll bar to deal with this, but that means there is an application-window scroll bar as well as a scroll bar for each document window -- a situation that is confusing for newbies and inconvenient even for experienced users.
        </li>
        <li>
           When a document window is zoomed to full size, Windows often blends its title bar with that of the application window, resulting in a confusing situation in which there are two sets of window controls on the same window -- the application's and the document's. Many newbies don't know how do distinguish the two.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        MS encouraged developers to use <a href="MultipleDocumentInterface.html">MultipleDocumentInterface</a>, then they told developers to use SingleDocumentInterface because MDI was too confusing; now I think they're back to MDI again.
