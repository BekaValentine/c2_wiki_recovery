        Errors In Constructor
      </h1>
      <p>
        Out of curiosity, why is it considered bad practice to put "significant processing in a constructor"? It's like an on-start event and/or a main routine (or could be). Is that a language-specific recommendation tied to an implementation flaw or compiler design oddity? 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I think its pretty similar rule to "don't put too much in <em>any</em> method (function, file, package, module...) <a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a>}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I didn't put too much code in it. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>How do you know?  It's similar to "don't put too much in any thing", but a constructor invocation is special in that there's no possibility of returning an error code directly, and throwing an exception results in a null instance.  That's precisely what this whole page is about.  Do you want to have to test for 'null' or risk null-pointer exceptions?  Do you want to deal with possible zombie instances that are only partially initialised?  If not, make sure the constructor can always (within reason) succeed.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Addressed already below. Note that if you choose use the "big constructor" approach, which is not forced on one, you don't even typically need the result object so it would not matter if it's half-ass. You are making a mountain out of molehill. Essentially if you do it all at once, you don't need the result and thus a zombie object makes no diff. If you do it in steps, then it's no longer a "big" constructor. It's a <strong>self-solving problem</strong>. -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If the result object is "half ass", you still need to know about it, as it probably has a bearing on whether the operation the constructor does succeeded or not.  Getting that error information back to the caller is more complicated and more fragile when using the "big constructor" approach, as shown in the "Thelma" and "Louise" examples at the bottom of the page.  As for making a "mountain out of a molehill", I merely answered your original question -- why it is considered bad practice to put significant processing in a constructor.  I explained the reasons; you argued about it.  You could have answered "Oh" and left it at that, so I don't think it's me doing the molehill mountaineering.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why do I "still need to know about it"? Let's not duplicate the Louise debate up here in the name of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Don't you think the caller needs to know that its invocation of a 'sort' operation failed, and maybe why?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't see the relationship between these two. There are multiple ways to get error info, and having a COMPLETE result object is only one. We have at least these 3 options available to a designer/user, which may not be mutually exclusive:
          <ul>
            <li>
               1. Error info is given during an error handler inside the constructor.
            </li>
            <li>
               2. The operation fails, but a "zombie object" still exists to examine. (It may still have error and/or state info inside.)
            </li>
            <li>
               3. A try/catch wrapper over the entire initializer. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, and the issues with these approaches are discussed below.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>It complicates detecting, catching, or otherwise handling failures in the constructor.  Do you throw an exception and wind up with no instantiation and possibly no way to inquire further as to what caused the exception?  Or do you not throw an exception and make the instance status available for inquiry via some method but require that the object-user check it?  If you assume constructors will always succeed, it's trivial to have methods either return a status or throw an exception.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I much prefer exceptions to "zombie objects". If the object didn't complete construction then it shouldn't still be walking about. Saying construction should always succeed is a mistake. IMHO <a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a>}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Construction should always (within reason) succeed.  Construction is exactly what the name implies -- construction, i.e., initialisation.  If you're using the constructor for processing, that increases the risk of creating "zombie objects" or even nulls, which are worse than a zombie object, they're outright dead.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {And I think you're elevating a Design Rule of Thumb into a Must Do. I'm disagreeing that a constructor should always succeed and I don't agree you've reduced complications by having partially constructed objects. I have to test for null you have to test for partial construction. <a href="NickKeighley.html">NickKeighley</a>}

        <li>
           <em>As I said on the page that spawned this one -- to which the first sentence on this page is a response -- putting fail-able operations in a constructor is "considered bad practice", so avoiding it is by definition a "rule of thumb" rather than a categorical imperative.  And I'm </em>'not<em>' arguing for having partially constructed objects.  Partially constructed objects are as bad as non-constructed (null) objects.  I'm arguing for having constructors that, within reason, should always succeed.  Why shouldn't constructors always succeed, within reason?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Constructors shouldn't always "succeed" because sometimes they cannot successfully construct the object. Consider a Database object, if it fails to connect to the underlying DBMS (DBMS down, Network down etc) then you don't have a valid Database object. You can *pretend* it worked and add IsItReallyInitialised() and WhyDidntItInitialise() methods but you essentially have a partially initialised object that is going to be a pain throughout the rest of your application. NK}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>You shouldn't be establishing a database connection inside a constructor.  That should be done by an explicit open() method, which may be implicitly invoked -- if the database connection isn't open -- by the methods that access the database.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Who said anything about databases? I didn't bring up databases here. In some cases we may indeed want fastidious and/or custom handling, in others not. Let the designer decide how fastidious they want handling to be; I offer a choice. (We could have an onDBerror handler method, I would note. Also, there are systematic techniques for handling routine data errors to avoid reinventing a jillion handling wheels, but that's another topic.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Our correspondent brought up establishing a database connection as a possible failure-prone activity that a constructor could perform.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't see it significantly different a style of issue than say running out of RAM during sorting at this point. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It's exactly the same kind of issue, with the same response.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The typical <strong>design choices</strong> that come to mind are:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Handle the error at the specific spot of likely triggering, such as when a query is issued to a database or when more memory is requested (if using say C).
        </li>
        <li>
           Have API-level handlers handle it, such as the on-x-error methods shown below, in which the API user would put in their own handler logic.
        </li>
        <li>
           Let some outer try/catch block set handle it, if available in the language.
        </li>
        <li>
           Let the system-wide handlers handle it, which is typically one of those:
          <ul>
            <li>
               The built-in system handlers, perhaps if the following option doesn't "override" them:
            </li>
            <li>
               Custom system-wide handlers, per error category, if the language allows.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           (Choices not necessarily mutually exclusive)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>In general terms, all of those options are already discussed on this page.  As noted above, the database connection scenario is no different from running out of RAM or any other error that might occur inside a constructor.  Perhaps our correspondent mentioned it because he frequently uses some class that establishes a database connection in its constructor.</em>

        <li>
           <em>No, in general it doesn't.  There isn't any processing you can do inside a constructor that you can't do outside a constructor, and but processing inside a constructor conflates initialisation with execution.  Obviously, there may be reasons to violate this guideline (e.g., initialisation that requires processing) but it should not be considered a normal case for the reasons described on this page.</em>

           Typically API's for application devs you don't have a <strong>"lone function" floating around</strong>. The "sorter" API would typically be part of something bigger:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        class x extends CollectionProcessor {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        method comparer(x,y) {...} // sorting collation<br/>
        method filter(row) {...}  // similar to SQL WHERE clause (optional)<br/>
        method formatter(row) {...} // format output row (optional)<br/>
        }      <br/>

        <li>
           Granted, for <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> you might want a smaller granularity. (If our topic is splitting, then perhaps it needs a re-org)

      <ul>

           This seems somewhat similar to our "modularization" discussions in <a href="NodeJsAndHofDiscussionTwo.html">NodeJsAndHofDiscussionTwo</a>. Like I said above, it's common and natural for there to be a <strong>"kit" of related services</strong>. I agree that in <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> more granularity may be a better fit, but for app devs, pre-packaging is often a better fit so that it's more like paint-by-numbers: fill in methods you need and skip those you don't. It's almost like the code side of filling out a <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> form. It may add bloat compared to the high granularity approach IF using high granularity, but the flip-side is that the relationship among services is more grokkable to typical devs (in my experience/observation).

        I'm not sure what you mean. It sounds like a specific debugger, error message, and/or stack trace listing may be poorly designed in a given language or tool, rather than an inherent fault of "big" constructors.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No debuggers, error messages, and/or stack trace listings are involved.  With a "heavy" constructor, you've got this...</em>

      <p>
        In my domain, I'd rather the language be designed to be human-friendly rather than machine friendly. Perhaps an interpreter/compiler hint can be provided to skip certain checking to gain speed in special situations (the downside being unhelpful error messages etc. if something goes wrong.) -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This has nothing to do with gaining speed, and everything to do with making coding as human-friendly as possible.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess I am not understanding your point. A code sample for a semi-realistic scenario could maybe help.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is a semi-realistic scenario.  If it helps, replace the class name "Processor" with "Truck" and the method names with stuff about wheels and engines and trailer hitches.  It won't change anything; it's idiomatic Java/C# OO.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I still don't know what you are trying to achieve. Trucks and wheels don't necessarily generate exceptions. If there is a pattern to object errors, there may be better ways to deal with them, such as onErrorTypeX methods, but the devil is often in the domain details, which are not available here. And I am not sure what you are comparing to what. What specific quantity or aspect does the alternative improve? Less exception types that have to be handled? Less code per exception type that has to be handled? Better grouping of exception-handling code?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ok, replace "Processor" (or "Truck") with "Sort".  The general principle is that it's generally easier to keep error-generating code in methods and use the constructor for initialisation.

      </p>
      <p>
        What situations? The best place to put or handle a given exception is dependent on a lot of things, such as domain context and intended usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't know what situations, that's why they're "special".  In other words, apply the general principle unless you have a good reason not to.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A "general principle" given without clear justification and not tested against realistic scenarios is not something I want to rely on.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The justification is provided in the examples above, including within the comments.  As for realistic scenarios, they're as realistic as they can get.  I've illustrated constructors and method calls, which are exactly like those found in every C# or Java program.  You can even copy the code into </em><a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> or <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> and run it, if you create a simple Processor class that implements the methods, constants and constructor shown in the examples.  Other scenarios would differ in little more than identifier names; there'd certainly be no change in approach because C#/Java only provide so many ways to directly invoke constructors and methods wrapped with or without exception handlers.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, I don't understand what you are comparing. You say Thing A is better than Thing B, but only show an example of Thing B. Nor are you specifying what factor(s) you are measuring between them, such as "less code", "better grouping of exception handling code", etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you have a constructor that throws an exception, you wind up with no instance.  Therefore, you can't query the instance (because there isn't one) to see what went wrong with it.  If you have a constructor that fails internally but doesn't throw exceptions, it can't return an error code.  Therefore, it has to store the error code in the instance and you have to query the instance on every method call to see whether the instance is in a valid state or not.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, if constructors always succeed, you can trap exceptions on a method-by-method basis and continue to use the instance and/or individual methods can return error codes without you having to check before every method call to see whether the instance constructed successfully or not.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore, error handling is easier if it's based around methods rather than constructors.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay, that explanation makes a bit more sense. But much it still seems a language-specific issue. Couldn't it be handled as such?
      </p>
      <code>
        try {create object or class X}<br/>
        catch (e) {print("[?],[?],[?]",e.errorMsg,e.errorCode,e.methodName);}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If it's truly a common issue or concern, then objects could be given an optional onStartError method that can be used to define custom problem handling during constructors. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sure, you can do that, but if 'e' is nothing but </em><a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a>, where was the error and what caused it?  Alternatively, you can use a set of fine-grained exception handlers (having pre-defined a set of classes inherited from Exception, of course) but that makes the error handling more complex.  Either way, you've presumably got to go back and try instantiating the class again, which adds yet more complexity and potentially performance overhead.  Adding an 'onStartError' method would work, but it's more complexity in a different direction.  Why not avoid all that and use the constructor for its intended purpose -- initialisation -- and put processing in the methods?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you're trying to pack all the processing into the constructor in order to avoid calling a method, aren't you kind of trying to un-OO the OO?  In a sense, an object that only does processing in the constructor, and nowhere else, is the same thing as a procedure.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you mean it can act like a procedure, sure. Making it flexible means it can act like a variety of block-related things. Remember, one of the goals is leveraging developer's existing knowledge of OOP for a variety of things rather than learn and/or switch back in forth between different "kinds" of things. Further, often other methods would be defined for other purposes. Our examples tend to over-simplify things to keep the examples simple. And we can sub-class to create "templates" to factor app-specific commonalities. And in the example, it's more like defining an event than a procedure; a comparing routine that is "fired off" when the sorting system needs it. It's not run once.

        As far as <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a>, if the compiler/interpreter generates an error, there should never be a "<a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a>". All errors should generate an error info object ("e" in the example). If not, it's bad language/interpreter design.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> does generate an exception object containing information about the attempt to call a method on a null reference. What it doesn't do - and can't, practically, do - is tell you where the null came from in the first place. The actual <em>source</em> of errors is the source of that null, so a <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> object is often not valuable. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not following you. What's an example situation of a hard-to-detect "problem" null?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Anything along the lines of:]
      </p>
      <code>
        someMethod(arg) {<br/>
        arg.doThing();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        [If null is passed into such a method, a <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> is the result; it's therefore advisable to check all object references for null before invoking methods on them, in all code that invokes methods. Of course, determining that arg is null doesn't help you figure out <em>why</em> it's null and therefore doesn't help you fix your code. -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see how the alternative would make debugging such easier. (Languages arguably shouldn't allow Null's to begin with, or at least not allow Null objects. I find the concept of Null ONLY sufficiently useful for numerics. Or allow a "required" indicator on parameter definitions, somewhat similar to <a href="ColdFusionLanguage.html">ColdFusionLanguage</a>'s CFargument's "required" attribute, to indicate that blank/empty/null parameter "values" are not allowed for a given parameter. If a null object is passed, then the stack-trace tells you what sent it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are languages that don't allow nulls, or that make them safer, such as </em><a href="NiceLanguage.html">NiceLanguage</a>.  In languages like C#, Java, C++, etc., a good way to avoid nulls is to put processing in methods and reserve constructors for failure-proof initialisation as suggested above.  Thus 'Processor p = new Processor()' should always succeed, which means p will never be null.<em></em>

        Note we could design the class/object/API such that the "running" of the sorting is optionally delayed if the developer feels they wish to separate the steps for better error handling, at the possible expense of more code. Sometimes you want succinct, sometimes you want fastidious.

      </p>
      <p>
        Better than what? You complained the "conventional" way was too verbose. Often there are tradeoffs such that being compact and being error-handling-friendly may conflict. I'm offering a choice to <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> which factor they want to optimize for. Are you claiming HOF's give one the best of both worlds?

        <em>So far, that seems to be the case.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have not seen a clear demonstration of that, although comparing methods to HOF's or classes to HOF's is apples to oranges. Anyhow, It doesn't sound like a significant practical problem to me and I won't continue being curious about it. If some variable or object being fed into a sorter keeps going sour for whatever odd reason, you study why and come up with a plan to remove the problem, or catch it earlier. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>See </em><a href="FunctorVsClosure.html">FunctorVsClosure</a>, which makes the "apples to oranges" comparison you've described.

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't see where it addresses debugging difficulty, and I don't see why "confining errors to methods" does any magical debug helping. If you really want to communicate this alleged issue to me, you'd probably have to create realistic bug-causing situations under both designs and present realistic stack dumps and/or debugging sessions steps with numbered steps and numbered lines and descriptions that reference the numbered steps and numbered lines. Heavy details and heavily reality and heavy numbering/counting/labeling are helpful when making clear documentation so as to not leave out some unstated assumption without realizing it. You see, I cannot read your mind. (Complicating this is language-specific design issues.)

        A bad collection (to be sorted) should be caught before attempting to sort it, I would note. It's not the sorter's job to detect and explain a missing or null collection, which per above perhaps shouldn't even be allowed to exist in languages. You declare any empty container (zero nodes/rows), and then fill it up with some other process such that the sorter will ALWAYS get a collection with zero or more nodes under every coding situation. (I suppose you could pass it the wrong type, such as an integer, but that's a type-checking issue.) If you claim HOF's are a work-around to Java's flaws, I won't bother challenging it because I'm not interested in that.

      <p>
        <em>HOFs aren't a work-around to "Java's flaws".  As I already explained above, but here it is again...</em>

        <em>Imagine the following code:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Processor p = new Processor();<br/>

      <p>
        Case 1. <em>If you allow the constructor to throw exceptions:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The value of 'p' will be null. Therefore, you've got null to deal with, potentially everywhere 'p' is used.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The value of 'p' will be null. Therefore, you can't invoke any method belonging to the instance to inform you what happened, because there's no instance.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>You can use multiple custom exception types and multiple handlers to provide fine-grained exception handling, but if the constructor is complex, it may require an awkward proliferation of exception types and associated handlers in order to provide sufficient detail to act appropriately on a failure.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The only way to recover from such an exception is to invoke the whole constructor again.</em>

           How is this different from an old-fashioned function call?

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Instance construction involves two operations, allocation of a new instance, and invocation of a constructor on that instance.  If an exception is thrown by the latter, the former is undone, with the result that any partial work done by the latter becomes inaccessible.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So? I'm not seeing what practical problem this MUST cause. The new instance can be seen as a bonus byproduct. Why complain about a bonus? Yes, if you rely heavily on the "result" instance, it can cause problems, but that's the same with a function result: The more an app depends on the result of the function, the more problems caused by the function's failure. I don't see how HOF's magically gets one around such a trade-off. Some stuff produces stuff, and some stuff only changes stuff, and some stuff produces stuff but that produced stuff is of only minor value. If you depend on stuff coming out, then failure of the stuff producer causes problems. If you don't depend on stuff coming out, then failure of the stuff producer does not cause any known problems related to the stuff that did or didn't come out. Stuff Dependency 101. -t

           <em>I was indicating the difference between instantiation and "an old-fashioned function call" purely in terms of error handling.

If you're using C# or Java (or similar languages), just define a static method somewhere and invoke it.  Then it </em>'is<em>' "an old-fashioned function call".

           I suppose you could argue that the technique shown normally produces an object while the HOF version doesn't. One could argue that's a waste of memory and/or name-space, but that appears to be a different subject. (I can't find a need for mass quantities of HOF's in my domain. Other domains may vary.)

           <em>Yes, that's it -- it's a waste of memory, name-space, and CPU time.  You could simply use an ordinary function call.  However, in and of itself, an ordinary function call isn't an alternative to using HOFs/lambdas.</em>

           Re: "Why not just use a function call?" - 1) Ordinary function calls cannot pass blocks (without using unfamiliar HOF's), and 2) The object/class gives a framework with multiple possible "run" techniques, such as the examples above that give the API user a choice of "instant" run or delayed run in the same object, and 3) we may have other methods for other purposes, such as a row/node "filter" criteria method. (HOF's could be used for that, but it's usually awkward syntax, and doesn't allow a "template" approach whereby one can subclass and override methods they want to change.)

        Why stick to conventional languages? The original discussion didn't limit the target languages. I'm just asking for a fuller and realistic example that demonstrates the alleged flaw in a <strong>concrete</strong> way. (You can even do it in a conventional language, with the caveat that relying on language-specific features may limit your point.) Apparently that's asking too much around here, where it's customary to sound like a vague round-about befuddled professor. This topic is nothing more than a huge lesson in miscommunication.

           <em>Until "later" comes, the questions remain.  Whether there are "show-stoppers" or not is hard to tell given that the semantics of your language are ambiguous and unstated.

For another, it's not clear how you distinguish defining a non-instantiated class from instantiating a class, or even if you do distinguish them.  The possibility that your class is actually a prototype instance appears to be something that we gleaned, rather than something you defined, leaving one to suspect that you are not clear on the distinction between classes and instances.

           The issue is relevancy to practical issues.

           <em>Since any "real" example is structurally identical, it obviously causes precisely the problems described above.  Here's something realistic:  Imagine you have a class called Downloader with a constructor Downloader(string URL) that downloads the content at the URL to temporary storage, and then allows us to read the content via a 'string getDownloadedContent()' method.  The constructor can fail because the URL is malformed, it can fail because the URL is inaccessible, it can fail because the URL is accessible but the download failed part way through, it can fail because we don't have permission to write to temporary storage, it can fail because the temporary storage area fills up whilst we're writing the URL content to it.  There are probably more failures that can happen, but those are plenty.  If the Downloader constructor throws an exception for any of the errors, then Case #1 applies, above.  If the Downloader constructor encounters errors but doesn't throw an exception, then Case #2 applies, above.  If the constructor simply takes note of the URL -- which should never fail -- and getDownloadedContent() does all the processing, that's Case #3, above.</em>

        <li>
           That's better; something concrete and realistic (although arguably not HOF/block-related). There are many approaches to error handling and how an API and/or language deals with it. If something can throw a wide variety of fairly common errors, than try/catch blocks may not be a good way to address them. (Arguably, try/catch blocks are a bad language feature to begin with.) One approach is to create <strong>handler methods</strong> such as onError for a catch-all (not necessarily mutually exclusive with detail ones), onUriError, onResourceFullError, onIoError, onAccessError etc. I'm assuming the object is successfully created for all these scenarios. (Some way to optionally let the "the system" handle it with a default error-and-halt should also be available, and perhaps be what happens if no "onError..." methods are populated. ) The approach chosen depends on intended use, shop/language/API conventions, etc. Do we want a Cadillac API or a Chevy API?

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The on-x-error methods provide simple, convenient, and optional slots to easily put custom error-handling into. It's as close as one can get to paint-by-numbers in coding. As far as how and when to propagate errors, that's a rather involved topic with lots of different approaches and philosophies and domain issues. I don't wish to delve further into that at this time.  As far as "what do you gain", I already addressed that. In short, developers can leverage existing OOP knowledge without having to dabble in FP, and they get flexibility in terms of multiple possible "run" techniques and multiple possible/optional methods, inheritance for reuse of common methods/attributes, and/or future expansion beyond what function/method parameters alone are good at.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I don't think it's app- or domain-specific, because it applies to the general strategy of using overridden methods to handle errors in a constructor.  It requires that the methods are fully capable of correcting the error, and/or they can return error information to the context that invoked the constructor.  Both of these are theoretically possible in any OO language, but not necessarily easily or without pitfalls.  It's easier in languages that support inner classes or some equivalent because the on-x-error methods can reference the outer environment (i.e., a class in which the class with the on-x-error methods is defined) directly.  If the class with the on-x-methods is a top-level class, you're pretty much forced to access global variables or singletons (bad for all manner of reasons) in the on-x-error methods, or you require a high degree of coupling -- like passing a reference to the environment calling the constructor into the class with the on-x-error methods.  Perhaps a little scenario and some pseudo-code would help clarify what you have in mind, but I think a simple explanation would help more.</em>

           I don't know how you are measuring "more complex". It takes longer grokking time to understand what one is looking at for yours. And your what-if situation is relatively obscure. If you encounter such in the field, you fix so it doesn't happen again. For <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> perhaps blue-moon nested error-handling-level issues are more important because a given piece of code is ran far more times than most custom domain software, but not for most custom biz software. Use try/catch and/or declare/run separation (above) for those rare situations where it matters enough. And I only used 2 paradigms, you use 3. It's generally <strong>harder to grok the intermixing of 3 paradigms</strong> over 2 (for typical devs), unless it gains one significantly more in some other metric. You seem to be arguing for a swiss army knife with 15 blades instead of 10. I argue that 15 delays the blade selection decision process in such a way that more time is wasted on grokking delays or selection-confusion errors than that saved by having blades that are somewhat more optimized to a given task (having more), on average. <strong>Errors caused by mis-grokking the code during code writing or maintenance probably will cause more total problems than nested error handling shortfalls.</strong> Again, you are optimizing symbols over grokking. -t

Your arguments for it so far are very weak in my opinion, just like the early OO pushers pushing for OO domain modeling, making up improbable change pattern claims and other errors in judgement.

What's notable is not that <a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a>s and <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> exist in popular languages, but that programmers now use them without question.

           I never claimed "better". Where did you get that? Back to the Swiss army knife analogy, I'm only claiming a knife with 12 blades is <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> rather than introduce a knife with 15 to have more choices of blades which may result in blades that may be a somewhat better fit to a given situation, BUT at the expense of a fatter knife. Typical developers will get confused by too many paradigms/language-idioms in my observation (yes, I know you disagree per your observations, you don't have to state so).

           <em>So your argument is that your hypothetical OO language could actually be worse, but at least it doesn't use HOFs/lambdas?

           Yes, it could be slightly worse, I will concede, with the <a href="WaterbedTheory.html">WaterbedTheory</a> tradeoff that we are using less paradigms/language-idioms. (In the swiss-knife analogy, fewer blades will typically mean that the fit-to-task of the selected blade will on average be lower, assuming the optimum existing blade is selected.) And one cannot get rid of functions without getting rid of methods. It's possible to only use methods, but they may often "look like" what's typically called "functions". Anyhow, I'm comparing OO to HOF's, not OO to functions. The <a href="AlgolFamily.html">AlgolFamily</a> idioms are more or less stuck in stone at this point, for good or bad. Perhaps it's <a href="QwertySyndrome.html">QwertySyndrome</a>, but I don't have a second copy of Earth to test that on. God won't let me play with his copy yet.

        I suspect you feel this is a "huge lesson in miscommunication" because you lack some of the background knowledge about writing on non-academic subjects.  Again, a good reason to do some reading on how-to-write, especially with regard to making useful examples.

        <em>Beyond engaging in an appropriate degree of review and reflection to achieve the nominal level of clarity expected of all writing, I have no interest re-training to become your personal technical writer.  My usual audience is a mix of beginners, experienced technical people (i.e., "non-academics"), and academics.  I note that out of all of them (and there are quite a few of them), you are the only one to consistently have difficulty with my explanations.  Therefore, if you can't understand them, it's up to you to find supplementary material.  It's not up to me to provide it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And I've seen good writing, and yours is not it by far. (Although, I will consider the possibility that different writing/teaching techniques may match up better to different minds such that a communication technique that works well for one person may not work well for another and vice verse.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course my writing isn't good.  Like probably everyone else here, I'm not a technical writer.  I'm a programmer and academic.  If you can only understand writing done by a professional technical writer and can't understand writing about your field from one of your peers -- writing that many of your peers, including those with presumably much less experience, can understand -- then the problem is yours.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For one, I have not seen a decent survey. Second, I'm not your peer because I am not an academic. Anyhow, I personally find your writing style difficult and frustrating. If others love it, so be it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You might try reading what I write more than once.  It's technical writing, not a novel.  Sometimes it takes more than one pass to understand something.  Sometimes it takes a stronger background in the subject material, so you need to do some googling and read something else before coming back and trying again.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My rule of thumb is 3 passes before I give up. If I don't know what you are getting at after 3 passes, then it's rare that 4+ will do the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That explains so much.  If that's how you've treated complex or novel technical material throughout your education and career, it's not surprising that your knowledge about many subjects is superficial.  Novel ideas aren't understood immediately, or even in 3 passes, unless they're trivial.  20 passes may be more appropriate, often accompanied by trying relevant math and/or code on your own.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I meant for colloquial material, not equations or what-not. Your writing is not about novel things. It's just...bad. If you mean your writing <em>style</em> is "novel", then perhaps I agree. But based on past experience with YOUR writing, volume of repeat readings is not the solution to deciphering it. If 10 rereads didn't work several times in the past, why would it start working now (for similar material)? One definition of "stupid" is doing the same thing repeatedly but expecting a different result from the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Even colloquial material with which you're not familiar is (by definition) novel.  If you could point out what is bad about my writing, then perhaps I can correct it.  However, increasingly it appears that the problem is not my writing style per se, but a result of my assumption that you are an experienced OO and functional programmer -- at least to roughly the degree that I am, and that most of your correspondents appear to be -- and that your criticisms of language features are based on your extensive experience of both paradigms.  Is that not the case?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Past attempts to analyze your writing style generally leads to topics similar to <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> and/or <a href="FractalVagueness.html">FractalVagueness</a>. In general I tend to view programming as a process of human minds, while you view it as direct symbolic analysis and patterns. I approach it like a sociologist and economist and you approach it like a mathematician. Our reference points are simply too different. And I fully admit I am NOT an experienced FP programmer. I've explained the reason somewhere on this wiki already. Does your writing assume heavy experience in FP?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It assumes a moderate experience of FP.  It assumes a moderate experience of OO.  I suspect you experience </em><a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> and/or <a href="FractalVagueness.html">FractalVagueness</a> due to your relative inexperience in both FP and OO.  I'll endeavour to make my explanations not assume as much experience, and it's true that I approach code mathematically.  To me, it <strong>is</strong> mathematics.  Social and economic issues are certainly relevant, but I consider them part of <a href="ProjectManagement.html">ProjectManagement</a>, not the code itself.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Code is language for (mostly) communicating ideas to and among humans. <a href="ProjectManagement.html">ProjectManagement</a> involves code and coder management. You cannot separate them because grokking is an economic issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sure you can.  Most of this Wiki, and any programming language reference guide or manual is proof that you can separate them.  How many of those texts rank features in terms of how hard/easy they are to grok?  How many programming textbooks have a chapter on how the difficulty of understanding certain programming concepts described in the book will have an impact on some future projects' ability to integrate that code into applied projects?</em>

      <p>
        "Can" doesn't say anything about economics. A shop "can" write all code in <a href="BrainFsck.html">BrainFsck</a>, for example.

      </p>
      <p>
        Do you think it helps your understanding of the general industry of software to ignore factors that are hard to study or that don't interest you? Don't you think you'd be more well-rounded if you paid more attention to a wider variety of factors? You are the Greek in the <a href="EvidenceEras.html">EvidenceEras</a>, stagnating at the on-paper stage. I suppose I also cherry pick what I focus on based on interest, but at least I admit it's because I'm less than perfect rather than because some universal rule of logic says it's not important.

        I do believe the most important future discoveries will come from the study of <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> and NOT on teasing about symbols on paper.

      <p>
        Let's assume a menu option in a GUI desktop app sorts the text lines of the current active document. When the menu option is selected, the current contents are copied to a work file, such as the "temp" directory. (Copy step not shown). If the function below returns True, then resulting work-file contents becomes the active document, else it's ignored (not shown, possibly to be overwritten via a future operation, or deleted when app ends).
      </p>
      <code>
        func sortWorkFile(workFilePath, foo): Boolean {  <br/>
        var msg = "";  // error message<br/>
        class fsort extends fileSorter {  // to define AND run sorter<br/>
        main(workFilePath);  // constructor, run sort (optional)<br/>
        method comparer(x, y) {if (foo) {...}} // collation criteria<br/>
        // optional error handlers<br/>
        method onUriError(e) {msg="Problem with file path used for work files";}<br/>
        method onResourceFullError(e) {msg="Unsufficient disk or RAM space.";}<br/>
        method onIoError(e) {msg="Problem reading or writing work file.";}<br/>
        method onAccessError(e) {msg="Problem with file access rights for work path.";}<br/>
        method onOtherError(e) {msg="Uncategorized error: " + e.descript;}<br/>
        } // end-class<br/>
        if (isBlank(msg)) {<br/>
        return True;  // no errors<br/>
        } else {<br/>
        win.popUpMessage(msg + " Operation cancelled.");<br/>
        return False;<br/>
        }<br/>
        } <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Keep in mind we are NOT obligated to use the On-X-error methods for error handling. If a language supports it, Try/Catch style can be used instead, per coder choice. I am not necessarily recommending the above API design for all intended uses or domains. Although, it may make a nice language-wide design for all non-trivial library operations to support this kind of convention.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example "Louise"</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        func sortWorkFile(workFilePath, foo): Boolean {  <br/>
        class fsort extends fileSorter {  // to define but not yet run sorter<br/>
        method comparer(x, y) {if (foo) {...}} // collation criteria [1]<br/>
        } // end-class<br/>
        var msg = "";  // error message   <br/>
        switch (e = (new fsort()).sort(workFilePath)) {  // run sort<br/>
        // optional error handlers<br/>
        case fileSorter.onUriError {msg="Problem with file path used for work files";}<br/>
        case fileSorter.onResourceFullError {msg="Unsufficient disk or RAM space.";}<br/>
        case fileSorter.onIoError {msg="Problem reading or writing work file.";}<br/>
        case fileSorter.onAccessError {msg="Problem with file access rights for work path.";}<br/>
        case fileSorter.onOtherError {msg="Uncategorized error: " + e.descript;}<br/>
        default {return True;} // no errors<br/>
        }<br/>
        win.popUpMessage(msg + " Operation cancelled.");<br/>
        return False;<br/>
        } <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that it's slightly simpler than "Thelma" and it doesn't rely on potentially fragile method overriding to support error handling.  Note that example Thelma appears to be missing the instantiation of 'fsort'.  If we assume it's somehow implicit, remove '(new fsort())' above.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not clear what 'foo' is intended to do.  Using a lambda expression, I'd probably do something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        func sortWorkFile(workFilePath, comparer): Boolean {  <br/>
        var msg = "";  // error message   <br/>
        switch (e = fileSorter.sort(workFilePath, comparer)) {  // run sort<br/>
        // optional error handlers<br/>
        case fileSorter.onUriError {msg="Problem with file path used for work files";}<br/>
        case fileSorter.onResourceFullError {msg="Unsufficient disk or RAM space.";}<br/>
        case fileSorter.onIoError {msg="Problem reading or writing work file.";}<br/>
        case fileSorter.onAccessError {msg="Problem with file access rights for work path.";}<br/>
        case fileSorter.onOtherError {msg="Uncategorized error: " + e.descript;}<br/>
        default {return True;} // no errors<br/>
        }<br/>
        win.popUpMessage(msg + " Operation cancelled.");<br/>
        return False;<br/>
        } <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then sortWorkFile is invoked something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        sortWorkFile("/tmp/", (x, y) -> x.compareTo(y));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that the 'comparer' is passed into sortWorkFile (and then fileSorter) as a lambda expression, and fileSorter.sort(path, comparer) is assumed to be a static or "class" method.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that none of these examples show how what's being sorted (lines in a document) are referenced by the fileSorter.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[1] Foo was only intended to illustrate some minor parameter that has a minor impact on collation. Typically one passes in a switch or two for miscellaneous things, such as maybe "ignoreCase". I agree that passing in the comparer logic is more general than setting a switch, but that also makes the interface more complex. An ignore-case parameter is instantly recognizable, while a comparer operation may confuse or delay the coder studying the API doc. It's arguably a HOW instead of a WHAT.</em>
