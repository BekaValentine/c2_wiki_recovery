        <a href="CategoryWikiReflection.html">CategoryWikiReflection</a> is for pages which are a reflection of experience of <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a view being expressed which is that this is a trivial category which is the same as <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a>. I dissent from that view, on the grounds that reflection is personal testimony on what the wiki means for someone. That can be as a result of looking at the historical pattern, or it could be more immediate experience. I think it is worth capturing that and sharing it. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
