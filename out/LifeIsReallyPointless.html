        Perhaps, but you get to invent your own if one is not supplied.

        Someone needs a <a href="CynicalRelease.html">CynicalRelease</a>.  I read this a cyanide release.

        This is the inversion of the "What's the <a href="MeaningOfLife.html">MeaningOfLife</a>" question. If you answer it with one statement, you are automatically wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll make sure to use two statements then. <em>I think one and a half is acceptable - like "What's the </em><a href="MeaningOfLife.html">MeaningOfLife</a> . . . It's love. It's also other stuff"<em></em>
