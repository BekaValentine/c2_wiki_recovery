        Languages with something from every programming paradigm, style, era, whatever.

        The <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> is an paradigmatic example of this:

        The <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> supports several programming paradigms as well, but there's only one (syntactic) way to do each; see <a href="PythonVsPerl.html">PythonVsPerl</a>.

        LispClos and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> are also heading that way.

        <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> (not LispClos), is not <em>heading that way</em> --- it's <strong>been</strong>
        that way for twenty years.  <em>And</em> you don't need the godawful line noise
        syntax.  And you can usually read your code the next day.  --<a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a>.

        It is.  Perl made sense in its original form, gluing together some often used unix tools for system administration tasks.  As a general purpose language it touted 'flexiblity' as a killer advantage.  However, as noted here, Common Lisp is simultaneously more flexible, more powerful (vastly), faster (vastly), and maitainable (vastly) than perl....
