        Benjamin Hoff seems to have a problem with academics. He gets all hot and bothered about trade languages, for example.  It gives the vague impression that he still bears Princeton University a grudge for not letting him in as an undergraduate, which seems like a stark contradiction to much of the message of <a href="TheTaoOfPooh.html">TheTaoOfPooh</a>.

        Yeah, I noticed that too. I first read TTOP at an impressionable age, and found it to be a wise and witty book. A few years later, I tried to re-read it and found it patronizing, anti-intellectual, and twee. -- <a href="TomKreitzberg.html">TomKreitzberg</a>

        I read and enjoyed it, although it was a bit too much of a muchness.  I read the Te of Piglet also, just to see.  That was OK, although more of the muchness and not.  I do enjoy how he pulls value from the different characters in Poohland. -- Alistair

        In TTOP I got the impression the Hoff did not like "Ivory Tower" academics. Not so anti-intellectual that it bugged me, but enough that I noticed. I found the Te of Piglet to be very annoying, more of a rant against stuff Hoff doesn't like, and have never reread it. If I could I would un-read it, and wipe it from my mind. I am still amazed at the difference in the two books. I give away copies of TTOP and warn people to not read the sequel. -- <a href="KenMegill.html">KenMegill</a>

        It has been years since I've seen my copy of the book, but my favorite bit goes something like this:

        I have a small problem with Hoff's stuff. Simply, it's nowhere near as good as <a href="AaMilne.html">AaMilne</a>'s stuff. Reading Milne directly will teach you ever so much more about taoism than reading Hoff. But adults often read Hoff and don't read Milne. <a href="TiddlyPom.html">TiddlyPom</a>. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        I haven't read it, but I have an inherent scepticism about the value of any philosophy put about by a bear who starts each day being dragged downstairs by the legs, and hasn't thought to question it.  <a href="ChangeYourOrganization.html">ChangeYourOrganization</a>, Pooh.

        <em></em><a href="AhHa.html">AhHa</a>... it's not about what Pooh espouses himself.  It's about what a reader can discover while reading about Pooh.  It is a more meaningful enlightenment to realize that Pooh needs to ChangeHisOrganization (simply because he <strong>doesn't</strong> realize it), than it would be if Pooh looked right at the reader and said, "If you're in a bad situation, change it".<em></em>
