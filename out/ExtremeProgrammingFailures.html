        Extreme Programming Failures
      </h1>
      <p>
        Where has extreme programming failed?
      </p>
      <p>
        First, what's failure?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Team is 'essentially' doing XP practices
        </li>
        <li>
           It's past the release planning game (we're not talking about infeasible projects)
        </li>
        <li>
           Preferably it's had a couple iterations or more
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        One failure might be: "the software was never able to be brought to a releasable state"; another might be "we started the practices but couldn't sustain them".
      </p>
      <p>
        I've heard plenty of theoretical arguments about where XP is "out of its zone" e.g., large team, life at risk, distributed team, etc. How about some projects that <em>should</em> have succeeded but didn't?

        While <a href="ExtremeProgrammingFailures.html">ExtremeProgrammingFailures</a> and <a href="XpFailures.html">XpFailures</a> may seem like redundant pages, it seems that this page discusses failure to use XP properly, whereas <a href="XpFailures.html">XpFailures</a> highlights projects that used XP but failed.

        Need to split into these areas:
      </p>
      <p>
        Tried to do XP but didn't do it very well.  No fault of XP that it wasn't whole heartedly applied. (FailedToImplementXp, maybe)
      </p>
      <p>
        Diligently did XP but the project failed anyway.  Shows a shortcoming of XP. (WhereXpFails, perhaps)
