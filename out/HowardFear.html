        Signing work here seems to be the right thing to do, so now that I've actually commented in a page, it seems I should have a personal page.

        I've been lurking here for many years.  Long enough to remember when
        <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> first started posting about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.
        My passion is creating superior software development teams - which include
        not just the programmers, but the testers, writers, and everyone else
        who contributes to great software.

        My philosophy is simple, effective software development is a product of
        culture, skill, and process at the individual, group, and organizational
        levels.  As a manager and a change agent, my role is to facilitate
        improving them all..
