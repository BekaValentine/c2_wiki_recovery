        Popularity can be a good indicator of quality (i.e. free markets determine which businesses are popular and which aren't), but popularity is not always an indicator of quality.

        <em>My point is that the opposing side trashes the scientists as biased without considering similar forces on their human sources. If all experts are biased by their funding sources, then ALL public claimants are suspect sources, not just scientists.
