      <ul>
        <li>
           Listening (see <a href="HearWhatYouSay.html">HearWhatYouSay</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           If what the client is doing isn't working, tell them to do something else (<em>anything</em> else).
        </li>
      </ul>

        Yes; very much so.  [...on the "Listening" point.]
        Something I learned early on...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Come up with some excuse to talk to all the department heads in private.  (We used "document the information flow through the enterprise," and had a CASE tool to help do this.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ask each one of them "what should be changed in this organization?"  And other similar questions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Summarize and present these ideas to top management.  Odds are, most of these ideas are new to them -- in spite of being top items for their immediate reports.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Our consulting engagements were a lot easier and more successful once we started doing this.
