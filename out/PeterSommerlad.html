        It has been really some time since I last visited Wiki. (still true,
        we run our intranet wiki for our projects and I still like to thank
        Ward for his great invention. it is the SimpleThing that counts.)

        As some might see I have left Siemens 1997 and joined IFA Informatik. There I took over
        <a href="ErichGamma.html">ErichGamma</a>'s position, who is now with OTI/IBM in Zurich.
        In 1999 four partners and I bought the shares of IFA and
        renamed it to itopia[1]. We were doing e-business consulting
        and solution development based on an inhouse framework.... (so much for the advertising)

        After severe illness diagnosed in 2000 (leukemia), treated with a stem-cell(bone marrow) transplantation in 2001, and about two years of recovery I am up and running again. I joined SYNLOGIC with my development team from itopia in February 2003 but things that year didn't run well. I quit April 2004, looking for some new challenges.
        I will become a professor at HSR Rapperswil (<a href="http://www.hsr.ch)">http://www.hsr.ch)</a> a technical university in fall 2004.

        I am using the time available now for writing and editing a book on <a href="SecurityPatterns.html">SecurityPatterns</a> together with <a href="MarkusSchumacher.html">MarkusSchumacher</a>, EdFernandez, DuaneHybertson and <a href="FrankBuschmann.html">FrankBuschmann</a>.
