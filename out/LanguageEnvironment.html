        <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> <a href="IbmCorporation.html">IbmCorporation</a> has this (new since Y2K?) <a href="LanguageEnvironment.html">LanguageEnvironment</a> terminology that arrested my attention recently. A colleague of mine was responsible for introducing a new version of <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>, which has warnings about new (could be indeterministic) compiled behaviour for this legacy language. And it was described in a migration planning guide for the <a href="LanguageEnvironment.html">LanguageEnvironment</a>.

        After looking at the <a href="ForDummies.html">ForDummies</a> material at  <a href="http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/le/conference/pdf/Sf8201.pdf">http://www-1.ibm.com/servers/eserver/zseries/zos/le/conference/pdf/Sf8201.pdf</a> , I come to conclude that it has similarities to <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a> (CLR).
      </p>

        Am I far off on my guesses that followed? It appeared that sometime in the late nineties the software vendors (IBM, MS, etc) got convinced by academics that they needed this <a href="LanguageEnvironment.html">LanguageEnvironment</a> thing to get programming languages meet the needs of a globalized economy. And for that to happen, the research computer scientists must have trained the IT graduates of the eighties that such environments are essential to continued software productivity.

      <ul>
        <li>
           has the Unixes and Linuxes got this <a href="LanguageEnvironment.html">LanguageEnvironment</a> thing
        </li>
        <li>
           is the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> adequately serving the needs of a <a href="LanguageEnvironment.html">LanguageEnvironment</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
