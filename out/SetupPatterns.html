        <strong>Abstract</strong>

      <p>
        After you create your application, how do you install it on a customer's system?
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating the installation software for a product is a necessary task that
        can be very time consuming.
        Problems that occur when creating a setup.exe program can often be traced back to
        project planning and configuration management.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following patterns have emerged from work on products that run on Windows NT.

        <li>
           Associate Include Files With Components
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Overview</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The files which are ultimately installed on the customer's system are typically copied from directory to directory
        as they undergo transformations such as compilation, compression, and de-compression.
      </p>
      <p>
        The installation process may be modeled as a data flow, where the files flow from place to place.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           repository (Code Management Vault)
        </li>
        <li>
           buildroot (Build Directory)
        </li>
        <li>
           setuproot (Installation Working Directory)
        </li>
        <li>
           media (typically CDROM or floppys)
        </li>
        <li>
           targetroot (Target Directory on customer's system)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        The files are "gotten" out of the repository,
        compiled in the buildroot,
        copied to setuproot,
        compressed onto media,
        and decompressed off of the media onto the targetroot.

      <p>
        I recently discovered that there is a good description of how one might organize project files and directories in the excellent book:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign.html">LargeScaleCppSoftwareDesign</a>, by <a href="JohnLakos.html">JohnLakos</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        He uses a naming convention to associate files in the include directory, with packages. I prefer to divide the include directory into subdirectories, one for each package.
