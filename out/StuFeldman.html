        <a href="StuFeldman.html">StuFeldman</a> invented the <a href="MakeProgram.html">MakeProgram</a> in 1979.  If you have read <a href="GraphTheory.html">GraphTheory</a>, his algorithm solves ALL <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a> problems.  All of them.  The trick is to accurately describe the graph.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you start writing Makefiles and reading those of others, you find that the computer is learning from you and teaching you at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been said that Stu's <strong>make</strong> is the first great stride in <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> with software.  Are there other strides?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Who said that? Lots of us have done strange and wonderous things with </em>'make<em>', but I don't offhand recall any interesting AI uses to date, even if it is theoretically possibly to do something along those lines.</em>
