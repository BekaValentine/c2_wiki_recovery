        Polite Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        How many times when you are involved in a conversation, dialog, or other activity have you been annoyed by an impolite interruption? It is generally agreed that civil behavior normally excludes such behaviors. It is no less important in the software realm. Attention should be paid to what has been called the <a href="PoliteInterface.html">PoliteInterface</a>: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.asktog.com/columns/012dialogGuidelines.html">http://www.asktog.com/columns/012dialogGuidelines.html</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The development of such an interface which would be universal which would allow the prioritization of threads running on your machine and the positioning and if overlays are used, which frame, window, etc., is On-top. Included in such an interface should be some ExclusionProtocol which would exclude certain annoying objects such as spam and uninvited presentations crossing your desktop. It would be a far better thing if the agreement on polite interfaces would be arrived at by computer professionals exercising self-controlled procedures implementing such software behaviors rather than waiting until an authority such as a government regulation applies restrictions which may also inhibit "wanted interruptions" via user-selected filters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Violation reporting should be built into the <a href="PoliteInterface.html">PoliteInterface</a> so that behaviors of the Software not wanted by the user may be temporarily or permanently excluded or deactivated. <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>s that can be configured to allow a single window, or a maximum number of windows to be displayed, is one example of the implementation of a <a href="PoliteInterface.html">PoliteInterface</a>. When impolite interruptions occur, a notification mechanism for reporting the annoyance to the internet provider or program supplier should be included.
