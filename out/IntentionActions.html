        Intention Actions
      </h1>
      <p>
        A feature of several current ide's (including <a href="IntellijIdea.html">IntellijIdea</a> 3.0, and <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> 2.0), which I find really nifty. It's the next step after <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> and <a href="TestFirstProgramming.html">TestFirstProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple example:
      </p>
      <code>
        class A{<br/>
        void foo(int i){<br/>
        String s = <strong>bar</strong>(i);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The IDE marks the bold section red because A does not have a bar() method, and won't compile. Place your cursor on the offending code and make the appropriate guesture (key combo or button click) and select "Create Method 'bar'".  Poof, the IDE fills in a skeleton method:
      </p>
      <code>
        private String bar(int i)<br/>
        {<br/>
        return null;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Hit tab a few times to select the defaults (or change them if you like) and you're done. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Lesser IDEs just stop at marking an error and you have to fix the problem yourself.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good ide will have <em>several</em> intention actions for all kinds of different scenarios, including surrounding a method call with try/catch, adding exceptions to method signatures, creating classes, removing unused imports, adding/removing type-casts, adding return statements, changing the type of a method, creating fields from parameters in constructors, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other cool thing is that it changes your style of programming (similar to the change experienced when switching to <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>). You tend to write what you want, then use Alt-Enter to make it compilable. In most cases, a good editor does just what you want.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could this lead to a style of programming called <a href="DeclarativeProgramming.html">DeclarativeProgramming</a>?
