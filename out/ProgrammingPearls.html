        [ISBN 02-0165-788-0] Not to be confused with the book <em></em><a href="ProgrammingPerl.html">ProgrammingPerl</a><em>, originally by </em><a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a> and <a href="RandalSchwartz.html">RandalSchwartz</a>. Programming Pearls is a handy book for code tuning, performance enhancements and general troubleshooting. Before I mess with a working program, I look here first for advice. This book is part of the ever-growing <a href="PatternPerson.html">PatternPerson</a> <a href="GreatBooksList.html">GreatBooksList</a>. -- <a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a>

        Reading this book convinced me that I need a new job. I read the book and thought, in quick sequence: great stuff, good book; wait a minute, this material has no connection with my work, what a scam; I wish it did, though; so, hang on, this <em>is</em> good stuff, so my job must suck.
