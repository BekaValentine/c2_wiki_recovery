        Hello, I'm Mike Kent.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a 'core' programmer for A Large  Company (Not! based in Redmond) whom shall remain un-named here.  We write medical office management software.  If the doc needs it automated, we do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our software is mainly written in C, has grown organically over many years from a code base that was originally converted (by me) from BASIC (no kidding), and could really use certain XP concepts.  Despite this, we are the top seller in our market.
      </p>
      <p>
        Amoung other things, I'm responsible for maintaining/extending our VCS (version control system), which is based on CVS, and consists of commands written in Python which form wrappers around CVS and formallized our code change policies.  Very specific-to-us sort of stuff.
      </p>

        Python has renewed my interest in progamming, after having felt burned out for a few years.  It is a beauty to work in.  Highly Recommended.
