        A category for pages that should be referred to <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the ideas is to gather data to see if it's justified to ask Ward to provide a special link syntax for <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>. While this site is not necessarily committed NeutralPointOfView (but informed and well-argued opinion and insight is more appreciated here), there are topics that are perfectly suited for encyclopaedic, NPOV treatment. It would be foolish to try to duplicate the effort on <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, but we need to link to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the recommended pattern is to create a C2 wiki page that contains just the link to <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, a horizontal line separator and <a href="CategoryWikipediaLink.html">CategoryWikipediaLink</a>. If later, Ward finds it justified to provide a NearLink for <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> it will be easy for <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> to refactor such links. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        cf. <a href="CategoryExternalLink.html">CategoryExternalLink</a> for discussion on a similar idea.

        So I want to encourage contributors to defer to <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> as much as possible, in order to avoid  many problems like duplication of effort, redundancy in content, lack of focus and dissipation of energy, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But</strong> if somebody feels that there is something insightful or an intelligent <strong>and informed</strong> opinion <strong>in addition to</strong> what is already written on <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, then probably C2 is a good candidate to host such content. If such is the case, then please delete <a href="CategoryWikipediaLink.html">CategoryWikipediaLink</a> from such a page. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        <em>I'm rather doubtful about this - not many pages merit it, and it seems more like an excuse for removing material that may be factual but is arbitrarily deemed of little worth here. Also, it's extremely unlikely that Ward would introduce a new syntax just to allow a short prefix for a Wikipedia url. --</em>AnonymousDonnor<em></em>

        Yes, removing material that is of little worth here. There's already much better material at <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, so why would C2 bother ? <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. For example, you restored the "material" in <a href="JamesClerkMaxwell.html">JamesClerkMaxwell</a> ? What's its value here ? To show that at some point somebody felt like copying a few phrases from an encyclopaedia to c2 and create one irrelevant page ? The energy and acrimony with which non-value is defended never ceases to amaze me. --Costin
