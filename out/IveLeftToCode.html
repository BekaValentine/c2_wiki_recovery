        <a href="IveLeftToCode.html">IveLeftToCode</a> is when one decides that a lot of yapping is occurring but not much coding.
      </p>
      <p>
        Time to put your code where your mouth is. take a break from talking.. for a few days, hours, or even months, years.. and write some code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Talk is cheap.

        <em>Gone?  But this person was hilarious.  When he was talking in </em><a href="QompItself.html">QompItself</a> about how he didn't want to do QoMp, The long-standing page <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> was pointed out to discuss that very topic, but he took it personally and created the <a href="UgLyPeople.html">UgLyPeople</a> page.  That's epic lulz amirite?  Incidentally, I code most of the day and wiki to take breaks from it.<em></em>

           Hey I didn't take insult to it. In fact I thought the <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> page was hilarious and created a sister page that was equally or lesser hilarious.. As for being gone.. I take long breaks to code.. but this person is never "gone gone".  Code and articles live on for at least 100 years past death anyway.
