        Stop When You Know What Happens Next
      </h1>
      <p>
        People in many professions -- computer programmers certainly among them -- sometimes have difficulty leaping right into their work at the start of the day.

Probably not as famous as Hemingway, but a nice chap) and he said a similar thing: when you stop overnight, stop halfway through a sentence. That way, when you get up in the morning, you know the first thing you need to do, and by the time you've finished that sentence, you're back in the flow... --<a href="KatieLucas.html">KatieLucas</a>
