        Mostly Harmless
      </h1>
      <p>
        A book by <a href="DouglasAdams.html">DouglasAdams</a>; the fifth member of the <a href="HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy.html">HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy</a> trilogy(!), and the first to contain all new material (the first three books were based heavily on the radio series).
      </p>
      <p>
        The title comes from the original radio series.  In <em>The Hitchhiker's Guide To The Galaxy</em>, the original entry in the guide for <a href="PlanetEarth.html">PlanetEarth</a> is <em>harmless</em>.  Ford Prefect was a researcher for the guide who meant to visit Earth for 2 weeks and got stuck for 15 years.  During this time he wrote a huge and magnificent entry for planet Earth, which after some editing by his superiors was rendered in the next edition of the book as <em>mostly harmless</em>.

        Adams' <a href="WholeSortOfGeneralMishMash.html">WholeSortOfGeneralMishMash</a> is the most significant event to hit OO modeling since the <a href="HuntingOfTheSnark.html">HuntingOfTheSnark</a> (see <a href="PoemsAboutMethodology.html">PoemsAboutMethodology</a>).

        Totally turned a bit of idle beer discussion into a serious ontology and modeling paradigm.

        Yup.  It permits me to write stuff like "<em>(Actually everything</em> <strong>is</strong>
        <em>an object.  But that does not mean that everything</em> <strong>must be</strong> <em>an object.  A little ontology check.)</em>" (from <a href="TaxoMania.html">TaxoMania</a>), and mean it. --
