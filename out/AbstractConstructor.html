        Abstract Constructor
      </h1>
      <p>
        In an OOP language, an <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> is a mechanism to polymorphically produce an object of an <a href="AbstractBaseClass.html">AbstractBaseClass</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most OOP languages do not support the <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> pattern as a language feature, but rather require using <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> such as <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a>, <a href="PluginArchitecture.html">PluginArchitecture</a>, or some combination thereof.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> supports <a href="ConstructorInjection.html">ConstructorInjection</a> which is a <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is possible that you have overlapping constructor options for a given value (e.g. you need a clock, but you can choose between the local hardware clock vs. an network-time-protocol clock). At this point, <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> benefits from <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a> to select heuristically between available options (e.g. allowing user to decide between favoring performance, precision, or accuracy).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> supports data-driven object construction, since the selection of object is based entirely on dynamic input data and available constructors (potentially via plugins) rather than being based upon static code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> does not imply <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, but <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> + <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> is a powerful combination in that it allows one to return singletons and other shared objects from the <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a>. Without <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>, one would need to be concerned about figuring out when to delete a potentially shared object, which would defeat its use for singletons and shared objects.
      </p>

      <p>
        Other approaches to handling shared objects exist, such as constructing a pool of named objects then using <a href="SetterInjection.html">SetterInjection</a> to obtain references to appropriate objects from the pool - i.e. a two-pass approach that allows sharing of objects other than just singletons. In this case, <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> is still useful for data-driven construction for the pool of objects. This approach does require a little discipline - in particular, to not send any messages as part of the first or second passes. A third pass could be utilized for 'startup' procedures.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pass 1: examine object-graph representation; use <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> to produce and name each object within the graph. (Now all 'points' are loaded)
        </li>
        <li>
           Pass 2: to each object, pass the pool of objects in the configuration so that all references in the object-graph are closed. (Now all 'edges' are loaded)
        </li>
        <li>
           Pass 3 (optional): for each object, call the 'init' method (Now everything is running).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Alternative to Pass 3 is to construct a startup procedure to run later. The delay allows easily for composing multiple object graphs. <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> support for two-pass or three-pass object-graph construction <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> is quite useful for achieving the latter half of <a href="PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition.html">PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition</a> in <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>.
