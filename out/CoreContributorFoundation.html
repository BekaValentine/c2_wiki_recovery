        Online communities often experience similar problems within similar contexts.  Often the solutions to these problems are alike.  Here is a simple example of a proposed pattern:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Name:</strong> Core contributor foundation
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong>  A new community focusing on a specific topic.  Most members are interested in the topic, but are not greatly committed to the new community.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong>  Not enough material to hold people's interest.  Several members plan to leave the community soon.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If contributions are infrequent, readers may stop looking for new material.
        </li>
        <li>
           With fewer readers, contributors may not feel the community is worth the effort of creating material
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a core group of people dedicated to the new community.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong>  Core members of the community share the effort of contributing a consistent flow of material.  When some core members are unable to contribute, others contribute more to maintain the flow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong>  A consistent flow of material is maintained, attracting a larger group of readers.  Non-core contributors have examples of good material which they can emulate and build upon.  Core contributors may feel that they are overworked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>, 1995-1996.  Several authors were directly invited to help build the community.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="OrgPatterns.html">OrgPatterns</a> wiki.  <em>(Insert text why this fits the pattern.)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a>.  Has an "editorial team" who often contribute news items. Most are contributed by slashdot readers, rather than its administrators.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CoreIdeology.html">CoreIdeology</a>. An strong organization is kept strong with a core ideology. (Is this an example? It is more a relation to another topic)
