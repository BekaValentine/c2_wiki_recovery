        I am a software engineer at Google. Before then I was CTO and cofounder of Popular Power, an Internet metacomputing company. I used to be a student at the MIT <a href="MediaLab.html">MediaLab</a>, I have a fair amount of information over there.

        I have built several large OO projects, including Hive (a bit like Jini, using mobile agents) and Swarm (a complex systems simulator from the <a href="SantaFeInstitute.html">SantaFeInstitute</a>). I have not drank the entire glass of XpAndPatternKoolAid, but the first few sips sure are good. I was also one of the people who implemented <a href="JikiJikiJava.html">JikiJikiJava</a> in a mad fit of programming at OopslaNinetyEight.

        I learned a whole lot as an apprentice with <a href="BillTrost.html">BillTrost</a> at <a href="ReedCollege.html">ReedCollege</a>. I'm part of the BoDo gang with my friends <a href="JosephKiniry.html">JosephKiniry</a>, <a href="MarkBaker.html">MarkBaker</a>, and RonResnick. We run the <a href="DistObj.html">DistObj</a> list.
