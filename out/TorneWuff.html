        As regards <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>: My legal name is Richard Coles. However, I use 'Torne' in pretty much every situation (<em>but not to my bank manager</em>) - it is not an online 'nick'. It's analogous to someone who is called Thomas asking to be called Tom, with the exception that my preferred name is not in fact a contraction. It got discussed on <a href="RealNamesPleaseDiscussion.html">RealNamesPleaseDiscussion</a> and someone concurred with me to the extent of adding me as an example on <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a> =).
