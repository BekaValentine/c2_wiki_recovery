        He is still as fascinated with the technology as he was 15 years ago and following the old rule: "The more you know, the more you don't know", he tries to push the area of unknown to its maximum limits (not even close yet).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why 'maximum' rather than 'minimum'?</em>
      </p>

        Judging by what's written immediately above your question, increasing knowledge implies increasing your unknown area. Therefore increasing the unknown is best done by increasing your knowledge. Clearly his objective is therefore to learn as much as possible, thereby increasing the area of unknown. (Now that your question has (I trust) been answered, you may wish to delete it and my reply).
