        The notion of trust can be extended beyond individuals obviously to other entities such as <em>trusted algorithms</em> and <em>best practices</em> - which are just <em>trusted methods.</em> Related to this idea of <strong>trust</strong> is the element of evidence that trust is warranted. How do you qualify something or someone as a <a href="TrustedEntity.html">TrustedEntity</a>? -- <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        (It's always interesting to see how things change.  This was originally named by me: "Who Do You Trust?" because that is how the question was originally posed.  The English-usage fanatics apparently changed it which reminds me of Winston Churchill's remark, something like "That is something up with which I will not put."   Ah well ... no harm done, I suppose.  Trust is a cultural thing and in short supply these days.) --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a> (July 5, 2008)

        It was said elsewhere that the reason Toyota is willing to skill transfer their <a href="ToyotaProductionSystem.html">ToyotaProductionSystem</a> (TPS) is more than what's said in <a href="TheToyotaWay.html">TheToyotaWay</a> book. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Toyota is betting competitors cannot fully harness the power of TPS, due to <a href="ImpedanceMismatch.html">ImpedanceMismatch</a> between <a href="OrganizationCulture.html">OrganizationCulture</a> in the west, and the structural pillars of <a href="TheToyotaWay.html">TheToyotaWay</a>.

      <ul>

           Build trust at all levels.

        <li>
           Take a long-term view on all issues that are important, including building trust.
