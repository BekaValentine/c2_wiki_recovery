        Erm, I code for a living in Cambridge, UK. After I found Wiki, I've been feeling better every day.

        Hi Mark (is this <a href="MarkDilley.html">MarkDilley</a>?). Yes, thanks. Would you like me to reflect on anything in particular? (I've been lurking and minor error correcting for a while. Installed wiki at [old] work too a while ago and it has become part of nature there; asked everybody to read the <a href="NewUserPages.html">NewUserPages</a>... ;) p.s. Also dead interested in the open source union work you link, I've been following up same thing from international development angle.

        <em>Hi John, yep it is me, </em><a href="MarkDilley.html">MarkDilley</a>.  I was just starting to add have-you-seen-<a href="NewUserPages.html">NewUserPages</a>" to people that I thought were new, just to give some direction.  As for the <a href="OpenSourceUnionism.html">OpenSourceUnionism</a>  OpenSourceUnion stuff, would love to start discussing it!  Best, Mark	<a href="http://markdilley.2ya.com">http://markdilley.2ya.com</a> for my wiki home.<em></em>
