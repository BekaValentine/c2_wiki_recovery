        Thesis Chapter Quotes
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm trying to find witty quotations to head each of the chapters in my thesis <em>An algebraic theory of Software Interfaces</em>. Feel free to suggest quotes on these subjects:
      </p>
      <p>
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the quotes from my Thesis chapters, and some I discarded. Maybe you'll find some of the quotes or authors useful. Actually, some of them are pretty cheesy. :-) BTW: my thesis describes on a model of interaction for distributed components, a language that can be used to describe interactions that fit the model, analysis of interactions for protocol errors and the runtime support for interactions between colocated and distributed components.
