        I am a software architect with Alcatel-Lucent in

        At the start of 2013 PatternOrientedSoftwareArchitectureForDummies was published by Wiley.  It recasts the popular book PatternOrientedSoftwareArchtiecture into the Dummies style to make it accessible to a new audience.

        My first book was published by Wiley in the 4th quarter of 2007.  PatternsForFaultTolerantSoftware covers proven techniques to improve the availability and reliability of software systems through fault handling at execution time.  It provides patterns that describe the intricacies of the techniques.
