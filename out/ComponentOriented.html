        <a href="ComponentOrientedProgramming.html">ComponentOrientedProgramming</a> or COP for short.
      </p>
      <p>
        Known examples are COM+, Delphi, <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a> and EJB. J2EE is not <a href="ComponentOriented.html">ComponentOriented</a> but marketing oriented, since its components are <em>anything that can live in the filesystem, as JSP files, XML files, EJB components, etc.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An after thought after <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> became fashionable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, even as I agree almost entirely with the above points, we had this discussion before on wiki: </em><a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a> (CBD) and <a href="ComponentDefinition.html">ComponentDefinition</a>. I proposed that components should be defined as reusable modules that present a "design time" lifecycle including interaction with an IDE.<em></em>

        Components are just objects that are all dressed up.  Some of the finery that components get to wear include (not all component models have all of these):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           APIs for introspection and the like--especially useful in languages like <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> that don't have native introspection facilities.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lots of interfaces that are of "development" concern (to facilitate GUI-builders and other such tools) rather than of "problem domain" concern.
        </li>
        <li>
           Nifty ways of crossing language boundaries
        </li>
        <li>
           Support for other domain-independent concerns (especially those useful in a distributed environment), such as transaction processing
        </li>
        <li>
           Deployable in object formats.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This isn't to say that components aren't <em>useful</em>... though I'm not sure I'd make components their own paradigm.
