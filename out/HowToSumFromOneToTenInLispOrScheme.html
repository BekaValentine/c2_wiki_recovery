        <em>The reason there are so many options for suming is because Lisp lets you express your solution in whatever way fits the problem best.</em>

      <p>
        In most functional languages, including <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> and <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, you would implement this using REDUCE. For example in <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>...
      </p>
      <code>
        (reduce + 0 <list-of-numbers>)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To get the list of numbers from [1..10] then you would use the IOTA function. For example...
      </p>
      <code>
        (iota 10 1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        returns the list 
      </p>
      <code>
        (1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And so to sum a list from 1 to N you would define a new function, call it SUM-INTEGERS. For example in <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>...
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (sum-integers n)<br/>
        (reduce + 0 (iota n 1)))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (sum-integers 10)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        returns the number 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>

        <em>This solution, while elegant, strikes me as rather wasteful: you construct a list of integers just to immediately throw it away. That being said, it is certainly the preferred idiom for languages with call-by-need semantics, where the list would be constructed lazily. Using </em><a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> for example your solution would read<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        sum [1..10]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>and consecutive elements of the list would only be constructed if needed. </em><a href="CallByNeed.html">CallByNeed</a> semantics makes it really easy to define possibly infinite structures simply by "writing them down".<em></em>

        <em>Beautiful. Everyone's arguing over wasteful memory and throwaway lists, and here you go with a little math - a couple integers and three simple operations. An ounce of math is worth a pound of programming expertise...</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, it's not beautiful, <strong>here</strong>. Yes, insightful math is good, but here it is just a digression away from "how do you do things in Lisp". The math in question does not generalize to <strong>any</strong> other example loop-like construct. And surely everyone has heard the story about Gauss inventing this arithmetic shortcut at age 10....
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>So why is this always used as an example for loops, then? It's silly. Writing for-loops is boring. I always want the insightful solution.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [I "invented" this independently, although I wasn't 10 when I did it (19, I think). Does this make me as smart as Gauss? -- <em>about 10/19 as smart</em>]
      </p>
      <p>
        Does this example have a round off error? For example, does (sum-integers 3) equal 4, or 6 (as it should)? Does this code work better?
      </p>
      <code>

        (/ (* (+ n 1) n) 2)<br/>

        I don't know about Scheme implementations, but here is a transcript of a <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> session:
      </p>
      <code>
        ? (defun sum-integers (n)<br/>
        (* (1+ n) (/ n 2)))<br/>

        <em>The Scheme standard allows for rational numbers, but doesn't require them. Implementations have to provide a "coherent subset" (R5RS) of the numeric tower. In Guile, for example, (/ 5 2) returns 2.5.</em>

      <p>
        I'd have started with something like
      </p>
      <code>
        (loop for i from 1 to 10 ...)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or even the prosaic
      </p>
      <code>
        (dotimes (i 10)<br/>
        ...)<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        My point is that <em>most</em> lisp, say, >99%, looks just like code in other languages; i.e. you write it the `obvious' way. Sure, we do closures, macros, pass lots of lambdas around, but people who use lambdas to represent integers are just trying to show off and scare you. Don't let them. -- <a href="AlainPicard.html">AlainPicard</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I just don't get it. If you want to sum anything, why don't you start with
      </p>
      <code>
        (sum ...)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and if you are going to sum the first ten integers, why don't you write
      </p>
      <code>
        (sum (span 1 10) )<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ? -- <a href="NikitaBelenki.html">NikitaBelenki</a> (who doesn't actually know Lisp, but likes STL)
      </p>
      <p>
        How about (collect-sum (scan-range :from 1 :upto 10)) - that's possible in Common Lisp with series (and it doesn't waste space building a list!)
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect that as often as not when someone says "I hate Lisp!" it also applies to Scheme. And Alain's point about Lisp programs idiomatically using loops just like the C snippet doesn't apply to Scheme's idioms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I suspect it usually applies to Scheme first and foremost. -- </em>PederTowne<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think an idiomatic way of writing this function in scheme (ignoring the more efficient accumulator version) would be:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (sum-span first last)<br/>
        (cond ((= first last) last)<br/>
        ((< first last) (+ first (sum-span (+ 1 first) last)))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Which is a codified version of the recursive definition: "The sum-span from X to X (i.e. span of one number) is just X; the sum-span from X to Y (where X < Y) is X plus the sum-span of the number after X to Y." To me, and I expect to most people who're used to scheme, this is in fact "the obvious way" (and a purely functional one) to write that function.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you hate that style and think it's confusing, but want to face your hatred, then the book <a href="TheLittleSchemer.html">TheLittleSchemer</a> might help. It's a tutorial on this style of programming. Though if you're easily offended you may find its colourful style objectionable :-)

        -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        This ML type would me more inclined to do:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (sum-integers n)<br/>
        (define (sum-helper i a)<br/>
        (cond ((= 0 i) a)<br/>
        (else (sum-helper (- i 1) (+ i a)))))<br/>
        (sum-helper n 0))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        recursively, with an accumulator and a <a href="HelperFunction.html">HelperFunction</a>, like in a lot of textbooks.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In Common Lisp, the same function can be written without the outer function, thanks to optional parameters:
      </p>
      <code>
        (defun sum-integers (i &optional (a 0))<br/>
        (if (= 0 i)<br/>
        a<br/>
        (sum-integers (- i 1) (+ i a))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, I would use a more C-like appoach:
      </p>
      <code>
        (loop for ix from 1 to 10 sum ix)<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Moreover, although Scheme lacks the (loop ...) feature, there <em>are</em> iterative constructs in Scheme, namely do, named let, map and for-each, which is more than many "procedural" languages can boast. Moreover, any other looping construct is only a define-syntax away.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is sum-span with named let.
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (sum-span first last)<br/>
        (let loop<br/>
        ((count first)<br/>
        (sum 0))<br/>
        (if (> count last)<br/>
        sum<br/>
        (loop (+ count 1) (+ sum count)))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And here it is with my for-macro:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (sum-span first last) <br/>
        (let ((sum 0))<br/>
        (for (i first (+ last 1)) <br/>
        (set! sum (+ i sum))) <br/>
        sum))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Which is to say: you can program in Scheme in any style you want. You can even write C programs in Scheme if you really want to (yes you <em>can</em> fake pointers in Scheme, so that you can do things like "take a pointer to a local variable").
      </p>

        I hate the Scheme do-loop with a passion: I never could get the strange parentheses right on the first try and/or without thinking. So I came up with a nice macro, too, so I never had to think about this abomination again. It looks a lot like more conventional languages:
      </p>
      <code>
        (let ((sum 0))<br/>
        (for i from 1 to 10<br/>
        (set! sum (+ sum i)))<br/>
        sum)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It can count backwards, too. Should be the same. ;)
      </p>
      <code>
        (let ((sum 0))<br/>
        (for i from 10 to 1 step -1<br/>
        (set! sum (+ sum i)))<br/>
        sum)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It also works on lists, like for-each:
      </p>
      <code>
        (let ((sum 0))<br/>
        (for i in (iota 10)<br/>
        (set! sum (+ sum i)))<br/>
        sum)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It uses the define-syntax facility of R5RS, I used PLT-Scheme:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define-syntax for<br/>
        (syntax-rules (for in to step)<br/>
        ((for i in elements<br/>
        body ...)<br/>
        (for-each<br/>
        (lambda (i) body ...)<br/>
        elements))<br/>
        ((for i from start to end step is<br/>
        body ...)<br/>
        (let ((condition<br/>
        (lambda (i)<br/>
        (cond ((< is 0) (< i end))<br/>
        ((> is 0) (> i end))<br/>
        (else #f)))))<br/>
        (do ((i start (+ i is)))<br/>
        ((condition i) (void))<br/>
        body ...)))<br/>
        ((for i from start to end<br/>
        body ...)<br/>
        (do ((i start (+ i 1)))<br/>
        ((> i end) (void))<br/>
        body ...))))<br/>
      </code>

        Scheme doesn't come with batteries included, it's more like a box of building blocks, so you can make the language you prefer.
