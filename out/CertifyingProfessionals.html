        To make sure EngineeringProjects do not become EngineeringDisasters, Responsible Organizations employ ProfessionalEngineers who because of their certified expertise, can certify their own and others designs as being SoundSafeAndSubstantial.

        Discussion within this wiki and elsewhere question the need for Registration of SoftwareDesigners, who often are referred to a Programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are some questions one might ask:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If a programmer is designing a program to do stuff for themselves, do they need registration?
        </li>
        <li>
           If a programmer is designing a program to do important stuff for others, should the program be certified?
        </li>
        <li>
           What should the Certification cover?
        </li>
        <li>
           Shouldn't an organization producing programs for use by others certify the worthiness and reliability of their programs?
        </li>
        <li>
           Shouldn't such organizations employ people capable of such certification?
        </li>
        <li>
           Should such an organization be required to ensure safe operation in the same way as automakers are required to do so via <strong>recall</strong>?
        </li>
      </ul>

        Before asking whether we <strong>do</strong> and how we <strong>do</strong>, you should find out whether it is possible. Observing the so called professionals and big companies (and also taking into account other sources of information) I came to the conclusion that the industry of today has no means to verify the software engineering skills of a person. Besides the cheap and quick is almost always better than expensive and high quality. At least due to today's drivers of the industry.

        Yes I would like to have the certified software engineer to work on <strong>my</strong> software as well as I like to have the certified mechanic to work on <strong>my</strong> car. But I don't see how that is possible.
