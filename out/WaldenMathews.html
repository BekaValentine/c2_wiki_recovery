        <a href="MeanProgrammer.html">MeanProgrammer</a> seeking work. My main areas of expertise are in middleware and messaging frameworks, but lately I think I'm starting to grok the Web. On the scale defined by <a href="DanielJackson.html">DanielJackson</a>'s "thinkers" and "tinkers", I gravitate toward the former, which means I take more delight in "nailing the problem" than in just getting something to work. Armchair etymologist, formal modeler, senior project irritant. Don't hire me unless you <em>mean</em> it.

        Okay, I'm not seeking work anymore, so youse can all stop with the mouth watering job offers. Thank you.
