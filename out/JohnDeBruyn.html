        My on-line interests go back to the days that the Bit Net and its DOD buddy, whose name fails me this
        morning, when incubating the Internet.  I cruised the
        on-line BBS circuit and developed some strong ideas on
        the organization and integration of the components of a
        site that best serve interaction between (and among) the software programs and the users.  I also got into the
        BBS software, about five different packages, enough to run a board, and got a real feel
        for how difficult all of that is to optimize as a systems
        operator.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am excited about the potential of patterns concepts for optimizing interactive communication and also with the potential of Wiki Wiki itself, the chosen means of
        communication here, by adding collaborative,
        hyperlinked, hypertext Web pages like those being generated here to a Web site.   
      </p>
      <p>
        The closest messaging application from my old BBS/on-line 
        service days would be the message base program, Participate,
        which permitted a almost WWW threading and indexing of
        messages on a open ended message tree.  Some of you
        may recall this program on the Source which was some years ago absorbed by Compuserve.  After they captured the users
        of the Participation program it was dropped by them and it
        faded from memory.

        <strong>A couple of Internet/WWW projects</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I am now working
        to integrate email-based discussion groups, one a publishing project and the other an educational program, with Web resources.  The two most recent projects are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            An on-line symposium with law professors and expert
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        law practitioners on the future of the limited liability
        company and other unincorporated business entities.  This
        symposium had two dozen panelists who were joined by 60 other law professors and practitioners
        who took an active in the proceedings.  The symposium was presented over an email-based discussion group with about 650 subscribers.  And to other, uncounted, participants who followed the proceedings with
        their Web browsers a Web-based message area that was
        tied in to the email group.  The proceedings are being
        published (February, 1997) in the journal of the
        ABA Business Law Section, the Business Lawyer, which is
        the second most cited law journal in the world (after
        Harvard :)  You can drop into the symposium Web pages at

            The more recent project is an inter-campus law student
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        seminar group with the same email, Web-message base and
        Web page support.  The first inter-active lecture discussion in this group was lead by Tax Court Judge Stephen Swift who was assisted by a panel of law professors and practitioners.  (A
        footnote: The Judge's lecture, on Tax Litigation in the Tax Court, was picked up by a USAID
        contractor/consultant in Moscow who invited the Judge
        to Russia for a week next month (March) to help the Russian government establish corresponding procedures for the administration of their tax system.)  The home page for
        this discussion group is

        <strong>Project to adapt patterns concepts</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I will be working on a project to redesign and integrate the email and Web based discussion groups to Wiki Wiki Web and vice versa.  This will eventually involve the on-line publishing and
        educational programs just mentioned.  We plan to start this integration 
        with a couple of on-line drafting projects to which Wiki
        Wiki is particularly adaptable. <em>Go to</em> <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a> for
