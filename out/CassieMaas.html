        A computer user and developer since the very earliest 1980's using Atari Computers, PCs and Apples. This is my first attempt at using Wiki.

        I build websites but I really love to build web applications. Websites that support a company's objectives are my favorites. I love to streamline business processes using the web application as one tool of many.

        I currently have <a href="http://www.hiway17.com">http://www.hiway17.com</a> under development. It is going to turn into a community website.
