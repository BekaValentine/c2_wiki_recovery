        <strong>Summary of Criticisms Against Cucumber</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the same vein as <a href="ArgumentsAgainstOop.html">ArgumentsAgainstOop</a>, let's raise and hash criticisms against the <a href="CucumberFramework.html">CucumberFramework</a>. (and, by association, friends like <a href="LettuceFramework.html">LettuceFramework</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that not every critic will agree with all of these, nor will all proponents agree with all the characterizations given here.

      <p>
        As <a href="CucumberFramework.html">CucumberFramework</a> (and <a href="http://cukes.info/),">http://cukes.info/),</a> the stated goals are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lets software development teams describe how software should behave in plain text.
        </li>
        <li>
           The text is written in a business-readable domain-specific language and serves as documentation, automated tests and development-aid - all rolled into one format.
        </li>
      </ul>
