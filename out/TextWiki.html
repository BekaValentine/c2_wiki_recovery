        Text Wiki

      <p>
        A text wiki is one which the text presented in the html page by the browser is as close as possible to the text as it appears in the <a href="TextEdit.html">TextEdit</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of how this wiki can be made to present text in a <a href="TextWiki.html">TextWiki</a> format follow
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Example 1  ( Wrapped Text )
      </p>
      <p>
        This is an example of what a page will look like when the edited text is textonly, i.e. has no markups:
      </p>
      <p>
        It is clear that Inter-Wiki technology has 
        been delivered, and is continuing to be 
        developed, and will expand in the future.
      </p>
      <p>
        The future appears to be less Inter-Wiki
        and more Inter-Net. What has been called 
        wiki appears to be becoming the document 
        arm of Public Internet Communication, 
        meshing with threading friendly systems, 
        blogs, identity services, resource sharing, 
        and existing online communities. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Example 2 ( retained format using <pre> text </pre> )
      </p>
      <p>
        Using only one space in front of each line in the edited text results in a textual presentation in the html in which the text is caused to appear as it was in the <a href="TextEdit.html">TextEdit</a>.
