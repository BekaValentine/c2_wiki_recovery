        Vendor of the <a href="VxWorks.html">VxWorks</a> family of <a href="RealTimeOperatingSystem.html">RealTimeOperatingSystem</a>s. Also bought out vendor of pSOS (Note: The page <a href="PsosOs.html">PsosOs</a> refers to something else), which they promptly discontinued. Dabbled a bit in <a href="BerkeleyStandardDistribution.html">BerkeleyStandardDistribution</a>. Seems to buy out one obscure software tools company per quarter.

        Wants to be the <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> of <a href="EmbeddedSystem.html">EmbeddedSystem</a>s, allegedly. Like MS, are losing market share left and right to <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a>. Also like MS, are busy trying to convince the IT world that the <a href="GnuGeneralPublicLicense.html">GnuGeneralPublicLicense</a> causes global warming, cancer, acne, warfare, and BritneySpears.

           <em>Update.  Recently, WRS underwent a change of strategy.  The former CEO who advocated the anti-Linux strategy was fired, and nowadays, WRS is in the embedded Linux business; and peddles Linux alongside their existing "hard" RTOS's.  Like other embedded Linux vendors (ie </em>MontaVista), they make $$$ from tools and support, not from runtime royalties.<em></em>

        However, this firm is unlikely to disappear any time in the foreseeable future, mainly due to installed base and the fact that <a href="VxWorks.html">VxWorks</a>, while far from perfect, is so much better than anything else out there for real time development. Oh, well. Until something better comes along...
