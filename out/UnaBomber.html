In 1994, the FBI offered a $1,000,000 dollar reward for his capture (<a href="http://www.interlog.com/~vabiro/pubs/FBI_chron.htm)">http://www.interlog.com/~vabiro/pubs/FBI_chron.htm)</a> and released the famous sketch of what he was believed to look like ([FIX THIS INVALID LINK:]<a href="http://www.mugshots.org/criminals/unabomber.html).">http://www.mugshots.org/criminals/unabomber.html).</a> He was finally captured in 1996.
