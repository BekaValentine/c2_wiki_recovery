        I am a <a href="JavaProgrammer.html">JavaProgrammer</a> in Amsterdam, <a href="TheNetherlands.html">TheNetherlands</a> but I grew up in the NorthEastOfEngland. I'm also studying part-time at the Institute for Logic, Language and Computation in Amsterdam to try and satisfy my interest in <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> and <a href="NaturalLanguageProcessing.html">NaturalLanguageProcessing</a>.

        I'm trying out iterative <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> as a way of:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           coping with incomplete requirements up front 
        </li>
        <li>
           introducing automated regression tests
        </li>
        <li>
           encouraging more modular design
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I'm also studying <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> in the hope that they will allow me to generate better designs more quickly.
        <a href="TestDrivenDesignAndPatterns.html">TestDrivenDesignAndPatterns</a> is a discussion of them both by <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>.

        I used to work in manufacturing as a shop floor engineer, and part of my work involved <a href="StatisticalProcessControl.html">StatisticalProcessControl</a>. I haven't done much thinking about how techniques used in the manufacturing industry could support software engineering, but recent discussions in my regular web haunts have led me to believe that I should. More to follow I hope.

        There's some discussion on this site regarding the <a href="AnalogyBetweenProgrammingAndManufacturing.html">AnalogyBetweenProgrammingAndManufacturing</a>. As someone with direct experience of both, I would say that applications are actually quite like manufacturing processes/machines/robots: you design them, you build them, you run them (and tweak them) until no-one needs the output anymore. The programmers are the engineers - the users are the operators. So I would tend to agree with the views expressed in <a href="TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.html">TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign</a>, but I would also point out that there is more to manufacturing than merely flicking a switch. And there is more to building an executable than merely running a compiler.

        I regard it as a basic programmer's right that I should be able to,
        at any time, check out all the source code and build it. (thank you <a href="SteveBerczuk.html">SteveBerczuk</a>)

        Hey Caroline - re your comment above <em>I used to work in manufacturing as a shop floor engineer, and part of my work involved </em><a href="StatisticalProcessControl.html">StatisticalProcessControl</a>. I haven't done much thinking about how techniques used in the manufacturing industry could support software engineering, but recent discussions in my regular web haunts have led me to believe that I should. More to follow I hope.<em> - you might be interested in the </em><a href="SixSigmaDiscussion.html">SixSigmaDiscussion</a> page?
