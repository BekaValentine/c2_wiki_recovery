        Shamanic Practices
      </h1>
      <p>
        If Buddhism is about waking up from the dream,
        And Taoism is about accepting the dream,
        Shamanism is about manipulating the fabric of the dream.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the basic shamanic practices is lucid dreaming, and learning to control the events that occur in a dream state.  Armed with that, and a realisation that our day-to-day reality is another dream, dream-manipulation techniques are used to change daily experience.

        Seems similar to the <a href="ShuHaRi.html">ShuHaRi</a> idea, but I have no basis for comparison.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it gets me past my problem with Zen.  I like to build things and make things happen, and placidly sitting around is against my nature.
