        Semantic Gap
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="SemanticGap.html">SemanticGap</a> is the gap between what the user/customer can express about the problem he wants to get solved by software and the precision of a specification needed to program this in software.
      </p>
      <p>
        The gap appears because programmers usually do not have enough domain knowledge to infer the required specification details from context.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are different means to bridge this gap:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Train the customer in writing precise documents. Works best in companies that know their domain very well and have precise processes.
        </li>
        <li>
           Train the programmer in the domain. Works best when the programmer works in the IT department of the company. Over time he will learn...
        </li>
        <li>
           Propagate specification and request for further details back and forth between programmer, consultat, customer and management. Works not or rather slow.
        </li>
        <li>
           Agile methods just guess and iteratively let both sides learn and converge. 
        </li>
      </ul>
