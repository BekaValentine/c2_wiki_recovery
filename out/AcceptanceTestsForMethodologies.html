        Acceptance Tests For Methodologies
      </h1>
      <p>
        'Acceptance' in this sense means 'Easily accepted by a software development community.'

           The name of the methodology gives one a fairly good sense of what the motivation for the methodology is all about. Examples: <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a> connotes that the methodology is an attempt to unify other disparate methods. <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> fails to convey that the methodology is motivated by the desire to reduce risk (the name seems to imply the opposite at first glance).
        </li>
        <li>
           The name does not have an immediate negative connotation to most people. Example: <a href="DontCallItExtreme.html">DontCallItExtreme</a>.
        </li>

           Explaining the basics of the methodology is possible in a short conversation, or a few pages of text.

           Compared to 'chaos', the methodology increases the likelihood of delivering good software.
