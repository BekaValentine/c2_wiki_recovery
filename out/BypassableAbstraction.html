        Bypassable Abstraction
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You used <a href="CautiousBuyOverBuild.html">CautiousBuyOverBuild</a> and decided to integrate a prebuilt component or framework into your solution. The component or framework acts as an adapter to another component or framework for a subset of its functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might be developing a framework and have <a href="LayeredFrameworks.html">LayeredFrameworks</a> on top of each other to reduce a solution's complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        For whatever reason (e.g., functionality isn't suitable, unacceptable bugs or performance issues exist), you've determined that you can't use a portion of its functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you work around the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You've acquired the component or framework and can't modify its implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Component or framework providers are unwilling to make the necessary changes to resolve issues.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is easy to work around the problem rather than reinventing the solution.
        </li>
      </ul>
