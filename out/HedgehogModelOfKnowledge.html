           Perhaps knowledge is more like a spiky ball. As the body of knowledge gets larger (<em>i.e.</em> the balloon gets blown up) so specific fields are pushed further and further outwards. The domain of knowledge in each instance gets smaller and smaller, and fields get further apart. Thus each field is a spike, and there are gaps between them.  Thus we have a hedgehog.
