        Preparing For Sprint One
      </h1>
      <p>
        Like many others, I have used the principles of <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopment.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopment</a> for a number of years now. Every time I help set up a new project, I ask myself: What do I need to get into place before I begin the first sprint? <em>(A sprint is a term from the </em><a href="ScrumMethodology.html">ScrumMethodology</a> which refers to a 2-4 week work period resulting in a fully integrated release.)<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Preparing for sprint one will be the theme for the next meeting in <a href="DanishAgileUserGroup.html">DanishAgileUserGroup</a> August 28th at Capgemini in Copenhagen. I want to see if I can assemble some good preparation patterns and maybe get others to contribute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Feel free to make a contribution. Please state patterns that you have actually tried out yourself and report on your successes (or failures).

        At the Copenhagen meeting we did a workshop based on Alistair Cockburn's Reflection workshop: Based on your experiences, what would you keep? What would you try in the next time period? And where did you have ongoing problems? We split the participants into two teams. One team would prepare for kick-off for a newly started project and the other team would convert an existing project into an agile project.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the findings of the two teams:
