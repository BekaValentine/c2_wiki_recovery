        <strong>Loglan</strong>  (for "Logical Language") is a language you can use both to program computers and speak to humans. If you enjoy learning new computer languages or new human languages, you'll get a real bang out of Loglan. Loglan was the language used by humans and computers on Luna in <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a>'s <em></em><a href="TheMoonIsaHarshMistress.html">TheMoonIsaHarshMistress</a><em>. </em>

        Yes, it's a real language - and a beautiful one! See <a href="http://www.loglan.org/what-is-loglan.html">http://www.loglan.org/what-is-loglan.html</a> for a one page introduction and <a href="http://www.loglan.org/Loglan3Download.html">http://www.loglan.org/Loglan3Download.html</a> for a primer.

        Alas, <a href="JamesCookeBrown.html">JamesCookeBrown</a> (the originator of Loglan) has died.

        <strong>The Loglan/Lojban split</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The majority of <a href="LoglanLanguage.html">LoglanLanguage</a> speakers moved to the <a href="LojbanLanguage.html">LojbanLanguage</a> dialect about a decade ago. There's little structural difference between the two, though the primitives (words) are all different so they are mutually unintelligible. The split occurred when the original architect of the language wanted to make significant amounts of it proprietary, but most of the speakers wanted it to be <a href="OpenContent.html">OpenContent</a>. Anything associated with "The Loglan Institute" ("TLI") is proprietary Loglan. There is continuing talk of a rapprochement, but the languages are now so different only one can survive, and <a href="LojbanLanguage.html">LojbanLanguage</a> seems like the one with the momentum.

        Check out Esperanto (<a href="http://www.esperanto-usa.org">http://www.esperanto-usa.org</a> is a decent starting point, or call us at 1-800-ESPERANTO in the US). Considerably more speakers (approx two million, to US Foreign Service level 3 definition of "speak"). A significantly different set of design goals: learners can begin using it (reading <em>and</em> speaking) very rapidly. -- David Wolff

        Or just look at <a href="EsperantoLanguage.html">EsperantoLanguage</a> - we're trying to discuss Loglan here! Besides, the <a href="LojbanLanguage.html">LojbanLanguage</a> propaganda holds that one semester of studying <a href="LojbanLanguage.html">LojbanLanguage</a> is equivalent to three years of a natural language - and <a href="LojbanLanguage.html">LojbanLanguage</a> is related to Loglan very closely. (Actually, what we say is "One year of Lojban is as hard
        as three years of any natural language.") -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

        Interesting to find out that Loglan is a real language. I'd thought that Heinlein had made it up. Anyone ever hear of <a href="EprimeLanguage.html">EprimeLanguage</a> as formerly described at <a href="http://members.icanect.net/~zardoz/eprime.htm">http://members.icanect.net/~zardoz/eprime.htm</a> (now a <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>)? English that highlights subjectivity by banning forms of "to be." -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        Yuck. The point of Loglan is to aid communication. The point of <a href="EprimeLanguage.html">EprimeLanguage</a> is to hinder it and spread bad philosophy. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>
