        I'm a musician, theorist, and former artificial intelligence student.  I graduated from an ultra-independent program with a degree which I titled something like "patterns of recurrence in musical structure".  I'm now delving into Java in hopes of devising (or at least daydreaming more concretely about) a more musician-friendly computer-based compositional aid.  (Commonly called a sequencer.)  So far, I've written a useful little calendar application using the swing tools, and extended defaultMutableTreeNode to create a model of musical structure.

        I've also been working with the idea of developing a spoken language with a <a href="RhythmicSyntax.html">RhythmicSyntax</a> based on musical form.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also developed a 37/3 month lunar calendar that reconciles empirically with the solar one, (since calendars don't have to be predictive anymore!) and a Cosmography relating the <a href="CircleOfFifths.html">CircleOfFifths</a>, the color wheel and the months of the year.
