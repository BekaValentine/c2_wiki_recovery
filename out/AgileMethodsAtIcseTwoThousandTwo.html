        Agile Methods At Icse Two Thousand Two
      </h1>
      <p>
        ICSE '2002 was held in Orlando between May 19-23.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AgileMethods.html">AgileMethods</a> were a recurring theme at the conference. The topic stirred much discussion. The majority of the delegates maintained a neutral, mildly cautious position. A few expressed anti-agile sentiments, while a smaller minority championed agile practices.
