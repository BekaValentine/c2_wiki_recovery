        Julius Sumner Miller

      <p>
        Describe Julius Sumner Miller here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dear Julius is a kindly old physics professor who is just a little eccentric.  OK, he is really eccentric and, he REALLY got excited in providing demonstrations of Physics principals.  If you took Physics in High school since the 70's, you have probably crossed paths with his Physics Demonstrations videos. "Look! Look!!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the video was shot and entered distribution starting in 1975, Physic Demonstrations with Julius Sumner Miller was distributed by Western Instructional Television(Western ITV) in Hollywood California.  The Sales & distribution person's name is Donna Matson.

        Julius has long since joined the stars in the heavens, driven by the very forces he loved so dearly and demonstrated so enthusiastically.  His legacy truly lives on in Physics Demonstrations.
