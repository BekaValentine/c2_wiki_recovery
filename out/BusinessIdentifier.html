        Business Identifier
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Dun and Bradstreet" is a proprietary "business number". For consumer protection, it would be nice if every business had a unique government-assigned number and all ads be required to give that number. The government requires every citizen to have a unique number in most societies, so why not businesses also?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Most (if not almost all) juridictions register their businesses in a process that assigns a number.</em>
        Furthermore, all businesses can be accessed via many different types of numbers.  A few examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Very large companies tend to have their own telephone number "area code" + "exchange" (NPA-NXX)
        </li>
        <li>
          In Canada, Large Volume (mail) Receivers (LVRs) haver their own unique postal code.  The USPS has a similar ZIP+4 capability.
        </li>
        <li>
          Work is underway to create a GPS (lat, long) reference that will specifiy the location of both corporate head offices and their Retail outlets.
        </li>
        <li>
          Classified Advertising heading codes in both newspapers and yellow pages directories are numbers that can be combined with a few other bits to create unique Keys for corporations in most parts of the world.
        </li>
        <li>
           ... <em>feel free to add more since the current list is nothing more than a few easy examples that ceratinly do not include some of the more interesting instances that have significant commercial value</em>...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Obviously it is easy to craft a unique 'Key' for any Entity (Tax laws recognize both Individuals and Corporations and such)  and, in fact, many different Classes of Keys can be created.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe the real issue, therefore, becomes; What is the intended use of a Business Identifier Key (since that will determine the nature of any 'atomic' Keys that should be assigned and any Composite Keys that should be created from the Atomic ones). -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>.

        <em>Law enforcement, for one. You need to know who to investigate or who to sue. "Bob's Lead Toys, Co." could be anywhere.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Enforcement suggests employment of Observation and Surveilance while encouraging compliance with laws and regulations via sanctions, fines, and detentions.
