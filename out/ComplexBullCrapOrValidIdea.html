        Complex Bull Crap Or Valid Idea
      </h1>
      <p>
        How does one discern between between ideas or claims that are bullcrap versus good ideas for complex issues with lots of variables? Things like natural selection, economics, and technical paradigms seem full of <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s or vendor/stakeholder hype that are hard to resolve. They share the similarity of not being able to (or it not being useful to) test one or few variable in isolation. It is studying or grokking the tight interrelation of many factors that is the biggest problem.

        There are way too many Wikizens running around here claiming that their particular assertion is right, proper, and correct simply because it <em>is.</em> This is a fallacy for which all Wikizens need to be constantly on their guard. Don't be afraid to ask for validation, and by more than just some consensus of participants. Ask for multiple links, specific details of implementation, accumulated data, etc. Help Wiki reduce the Crap of Bull index.
