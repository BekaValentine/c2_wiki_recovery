        As of June 2005, it appears that Google doesn't appear to love Wiki very much any more. Pages that used to rank highly in Google's index no longer seem to. I don't know if this is due to some new change in how <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a> is determined, a change in c2's characteristics that have resulted in it being identified as a <a href="LinkFarm.html">LinkFarm</a>, or a failure (for some reason) for the Google 'bot to index c2, or what. Yahoo also seems to not rank c2 highly anymore; search.msn.com still ranks pages here highly.

      </p>
      <p>
        Either our c2 Wiki is broken or <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> has come up with a Wiki-unfriendly algorithm for indexing pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Go to Google and search, for example, for "site:c2.com microsoft slave". When there's a space between 'microsoft' and 'slave', Google should turn up the Wiki page whose title is 'Microsoft Slave'. In fact, I bet that page should show up first in the list. It doesn't show up at all. All that show up are a few "Signatures" pages, and signature pages are really quite useless from a Google-user standpoint. You'll also notice that all the entries are "Supplemental Results." That means they're coming from old indexes Google has lying around, not from Google's most recent attempt at indexing Wiki. If you look at each "Cached" page you'll see the date that each useless signature page was indexed. They're all at least a few months old instead of just a few weeks old. I don't think I've spotted anything newer than March 2005 in the <a href="GoogleCache.html">GoogleCache</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        So try searching for "site:c2.com microsoftslave". Don't you suppose you should see all the pages where dl signed himself as <a href="MicrosoftSlave.html">MicrosoftSlave</a>? You don't. The first page in the list is--guess what?--the <a href="MicrosoftSlave.html">MicrosoftSlave</a> page. That's nice, but there's no text summary and no cache. I guess it means the page was <em>found</em> but not indexed, and who knows when it was found. The search also turns up a few useless "Signatures" pages, a few old "Changes in ..." pages, and our "Long Pages" script. This useless smattering of extra results are all "Supplemental Results," i.e., they're old.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dogpile (which also reports results from Yahoo, MSN Search, and Ask Jeeves) barely provides much of interest, either. MSN Search seems to have a fair amount of success, and its results are from just a couple weeks ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe Google has been up to something in the past few months. On the other hand, the new meta robots HTML tag we've been inserting in pages might be causing some search spiders not to index our site frequently with useful results. That at least would explain why the <a href="MicrosoftSlave.html">MicrosoftSlave</a> page was found by Google but not indexed. A meta tag is only a tag. There's no guarantee any given <a href="SearchEngine.html">SearchEngine</a> will pay attention to it. Maybe MSN Search ignores it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm in favor of eliminating the "meta" tricks for a couple months and see how Google responds. We haven't been blasted by spam in some months now, anyway.

      <p>
        I'm going to go ahead and be vain here. Do a <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> for "elizabethwiethoff site:c2.com". Besides some ancient "Changes In ..." pages and "Signatures" pages, Google turns up little of interest (<a href="OrientedVsOrientated.html">OrientedVsOrientated</a>, <a href="JonThoroddsen.html">JonThoroddsen</a>, ScAza, <a href="AnandJain.html">AnandJain</a>), and all results are "Supplemental Results", i.e., <em>old</em>. Now try searching "elizabethwiethoff site:bookshelved.org". Google turns up 27 interesting, useful pages, none from its "Supplemental Results." That means the pages were indexed recently, and checking the <a href="GoogleCache.html">GoogleCache</a> you can see they were indexed within a couple weeks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Google changed its algorithm for indexing wikis, I believe its <a href="BookShelved.html">BookShelved</a> results would be just as pitiful as its c2 wiki results. Therefore, I think it's c2 wiki that's broken. Our problem might be our "meta" tricks. Or maybe our IP blocks block out Google!

        I was at Google on August 29, 2005, talking to a friend. He said the Google spiders always run around as fast as they can. Another friend (not a Google person) said that you're supposed use the <a href="RobotsDotTxt.html">RobotsDotTxt</a> file to limit the speed. In any case, there's nothing about speed in <a href="http://c2.com/robots.txt.">http://c2.com/robots.txt.</a> But the Wiki <em>server</em> has a few roadblocks to flag and stop speeders. (See the <a href="MoreAboutWikiAccess.html">MoreAboutWikiAccess</a> pages, particularly <a href="WikiAccessDenied.html">WikiAccessDenied</a>.) Maybe some months ago the Googlebot started running too fast for Ward's roadblocks and he inadvertently added it to the banned IP list. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>

Google, as far as I can tell, does not honor it.

        <a href="GoogleHatesWiki.html">GoogleHatesWiki</a> may have something to do with procedures Ward have applied to his server since Feb05. It creates lots of difficulties in various wiki related tasks that I participate.

        I scan a lot of articles / news items. The ones I think could be of interest to multiple persons are logged in a C2 page. Sometimes, I come across a viewpoint that may be different from the ones expressed and could be useful. Without a Google search, it becomes much more difficult for me to track down where I saw the first link. This is especially true for a large topic like <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> that have many pages. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

      <p>
        <a href="GoogleHatesWiki.html">GoogleHatesWiki</a> was first noticed by me (in C2 pages terms) in May05. I mentioned it to Ward around then but I did not get any feedback. My experiences in Apr05 appeared fine. DM said he noticed the same maybe a bit earlier. I do think a sharp deterioration occurred in May because I use Google search on C2 many times a day. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In Aug05, other C2 members start complaining about it. So I made another note on Wards home page. Hope something positive come out of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I too noticed it quite a while before people started talking about it in August, although I don't recall quite when. Probably most people assumed it was something temporary... for a long time... before speaking up. Multiple people have by now mentioned that they notified Ward.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Problem is, Ward is notoriously so busy with multiple things that it takes him typically a minimum of months (sometimes years, if a solution suitable to his philosophy and aesthetics is not obvious) to find the time to do things to c2 even when he's indicated they are high priority for him.</em>

      <p>
        That's funny. It never occurred to me that Ward might be at fault. I assumed that it was an algorithm change on the part of Google (I distinctly recall them intending to limit the page ranking of blogs) and flamed them accordingly (though nicely). Oh well, I hate the way robots.txt is abused anyways; I don't think I'm willing to take any excuse for a site not being archived. -- RK
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You don't need Ward to identify the problem, perhaps only to fix it once found. Perhaps we can start a Fix Google campaign to collect funds to pay a Google consultant to hunt down the problem from the inside of Google.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Aside from side issues, yeah, I agree. I think it <strong>must be a bug on Google's part</strong>, even if it turns out that Ward made some kind of Google-flagging-meta-tag mistake. To be fair, questions of meta tags and robots.txt have in fact been critical arguments in court cases that have set a certain amount of legal precedence, so I think Google should indeed be concerned - but I would still think that Google merely screwed up, here. -- Doug

        For exercise, try searching for dougmerritt earlemartin (sorry, guys). On 2007-10-17, sixteen pages show up in the Google search results. Many of them are legit returns from wikis where they both hang out. A couple pages are from the Simplewebs (see <a href="WhatIsSimplewebs.html">WhatIsSimplewebs</a>) copy of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>:

        One of the sites appears to be a legit attempt at archiving, but to play nice the archive really shouldn't get indexed:

        <strong>Eight single facts and a question, viewed from a far point of view</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The first fact</em>: I live in a far, poor but highly technologyzed country, like usually are the far and poor countries.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The second fact</em>: Twenty years ago, if I'd ask to computing related people "What do you think about Usenet News?", the usual answer was "Usenet News? But... what is it?". Today, when I ask to web related people "What do you think about Usenet News?",... I have the same answer! And when I ask them "What about Wiki?" I usually have a single "Wiki? But... what is it?". But be sure that if I ask for bogs, or weblogs, or as you want to call them, surely I'll have a lot of lighted elucidators. At far regions, thru popular magazines, technical magazines, technical supplements of newspapers, books at bookstores, TV and other mass media we are informed of "all over all new technology issues", but I'm sure that in the last two decades there was no published one line of info neither on wiki technologies, interactive usenet news nor any other truly socially useful resources.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The third fact</em>: It is widely known that, in journalistic behaviour, if some fact is never communicated, it ranks as non being.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The fourth fact</em>: Wiki and Usenet technologies enhance the individual active participation in a kind of contexts where if someone want to do (or to be) like successful people, the technology paradigm suggests him (or her) to embody into that context, while other technologies (like the useful but overstately promoted blogs) suggests to create another similar but disjunctive space. In other words, while the formers hint collaboration, the latter hints confronting competitiveness; i.e. union vs. division.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The fifth fact</em>, usually never communicated to you: The far and poor countries all over the world are usually rich in resources, human kindness and education level (spite the movies, tv series and cartoons profusely received from there), all of them in a fast impairing process higly supported by -for us- strange, selfish and awful habits and traditions subliminally suggested to our childs and young people by most of these products.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The sixth fact</em>: The country resources above mentioned are very attractive for those corps who also develop, direct or indirectly, alone or altogether, another ones like movies, tv series, cartoons, etc. And don't discard search tools, of course.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The seventh fact</em>: Any family whose members have high education and moral levels is usually well-housekeeped, because their members interact and actually interchange their opinions; and the same stands for countries, if there exist resources for this kind of interchange.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The eighth fact</em>: A model -similar to the above with countries- can be intrapolated over a single country; note that if there exist there truly useful opinions interchange tools, they remain being a risk, too.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>The question</em>: Should you do a brief estimation of the time this comment will remain here 'as is'? I'd entrust to be permanent... as a prove I'm wrong!
        </li>
