        Know How Long It Will Take
      </h1>
      <p>
        Of all the things to know about programming (or any engineering discipline) knowing not just <em>how</em> but <em>how long</em> is the most valuable.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Viability of any project is predicated on <em>how long</em> -- which may be a modifiable amount -- or not.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sometimes you just can't shorten it with more people (putting another two women on the baby project will not get it done in three months instead of nine).
        </li>
        <li>
           Sometimes the time factor and number of hands does not have a linear relationship. Organizational skills (or their lack) can directly affect it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Real success in projecting the feasibility of a programming project, after you've determined that the technology is within reach, depends on the CorrectEstimationOfEffort.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's not enough to know how long it would take <em>you</em> to do it, you have to be able to know how long it will take for <em>them</em> to do it.
        </li>
        <li>
           This means you need to have to know people (or at least <em>these</em> people) as well as the technology.
        </li>
        <li>
           Once you know <em>how long</em> you can say, "well, we could do it, but we'd all starve, so shelve it for now," and avert the kind of debacle that we all know so well.
        </li>
        <li>
           Or, once an undertaking is embarked upon, the crew doesn't have to wonder "will we win?"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A level of this skill that is consistently right is practically priceless.
