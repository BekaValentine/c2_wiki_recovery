        Functional Simulation Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Functional Simulation Programming is similar to <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> except that instead of having a sequence of real data which have to be analysed. instead the sequence is generated by a model of some sort, and the task is to generate a set of outputs at successive simulation times. The expression IncrementalComputing is also used to imply that values are recalculated when something changes. A lot of the tools developed for <a href="FunctionalReactiveProgramming.html">FunctionalReactiveProgramming</a> can be adapted for use. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
