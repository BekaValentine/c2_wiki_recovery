        Test Driven Analysis And Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        What if you could bring the same focus and rigour that <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> brings to programming to OOA/D? You would only then model what you needed to pass tests, neatly bridging the gap between agile and model-driven approaches. TDAD works best when you do it at the whiteboard, and then treat your code as the final model - which you draw upon in subsequent analysis and design sessions (ignoring any extraneous detail). TDAD borrows ideas about specification from Catalysis and slots them into a simple process.
