      <p>
        There are several programmers going by 'David Moon'. David A. Moon is one of the old MitAiLab people. He was involved with the <a href="LispMachine.html">LispMachine</a> and wrote manuals for <a href="MacLisp.html">MacLisp</a>, the <a href="LispMachine.html">LispMachine</a>, and Flavors (an early Lisp <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> system which was a precursor to <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a>). He also appears in the <a href="AiKoans.html">AiKoans</a>. He later worked on <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a>'s <a href="DylanLanguage.html">DylanLanguage</a> (and wrote the book on that too).

        <em>Detailed (or current) information on Moon seems hard to come by. Can anyone help to expand this?</em>
