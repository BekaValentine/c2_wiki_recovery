        Greetings, Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am a software developer from Truro, Cornwall, U.K. currently living and working in South Wales.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been 'lurking' here for some time (2 years?), and have finally got around to taking the plunge and contributing to this truly fantastic place. Long live Wiki!
      </p>

        <em>Welcome to Wiki, Matthew. Thanks for contributing and for 'lurking'. As a fully-fledged </em><a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a> who's proud of being a contributor and to be identified as such, you might want to make a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>. Thus all future contributions that you make will be rightfully credited to you, instead of to your IP address, thus giving you a more tangible footprint in the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a>. Just my suggestion. Again, welcome. -- <a href="CarlosNsRodrigues.html">CarlosNsRodrigues</a><em></em>

        Thanks for the welcome, Carlos. I've made my username - very happy about it!
