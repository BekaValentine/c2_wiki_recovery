        Video Documentation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Show off the software in action. Programmers hate verbose documentation, because it's like English courses, essay writing. You can never really make a <em>quick</em> point about software unless you show someone that it works. Regular documentation also has some problems like: if it's too short people will feel helpless, and if it's too long it will take a while for the user to get the point. In the case of a video, the users see wild things in action immediately. Video documentation can be combined with regular documentation (such as a <a href="UserManual.html">UserManual</a>) to offer the advantages of both systems.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="UsersCantRead.html">UsersCantRead</a> and now they might not need to.

           <a href="MarketingDroid.html">MarketingDroid</a>s can push the video.

        Problems: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Getting the people to download a video
        </li>
        <li>
           Size of the video
        </li>
        <li>
           Documenting the video? so people can find it in the first place. Hopefully they will have already found it.
        </li>
        <li>
           The code, the build, and maybe the installer all have to be frozen before an accurate video of the software in use can be made.
        </li>
        <li>
           Video is not text plus some screen shots; therefore it's much tougher to edit than, say, HTML.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's not clear so far on this page whether <a href="VideoDocumentation.html">VideoDocumentation</a> is envisioned as a screen capture of the software in action (such as created by HyperCam <a href="http://www.hyperionics.com/)">http://www.hyperionics.com/)</a> or a whiz-bang film with a script, background music, and a good looking "user" walking the viewer through some steps, or a <a href="ScreenCast.html">ScreenCast</a>.
