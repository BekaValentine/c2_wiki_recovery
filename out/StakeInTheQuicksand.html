        Stake In The Quicksand

        A metaphor for overcoming that overwhelming feeling of disorientation that arises when no aspect of the <a href="ProblemDomain.html">ProblemDomain</a> seems certain.  Just pick something reasonably certain and treat it as if it were certain.  This is the <a href="StakeInTheQuicksand.html">StakeInTheQuicksand</a>.  Don't forget that it is not actually certain, so it is still <a href="SomethingToThinkAbout.html">SomethingToThinkAbout</a>.

        Let me get this straight.  A wooden stake kills a vampire, and a <a href="StakeInTheQuicksand.html">StakeInTheQuicksand</a> kills <a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a>.  Ok, got it.

It is not a panacea, however.  Sometimes <a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a> is caused by too much certainty (unreasonable demands or excessive constraints).  In such cases I guess you need a <a href="SilverBullet.html">SilverBullet</a><em></em>
