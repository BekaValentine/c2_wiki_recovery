        Clothe Your Data
      </h1>
      <p>
        A rule in a semi-new concept in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> for making a <a href="DataEcosystem.html">DataEcosystem</a>. The idea is to <strong><em>contain</em></strong> data (in a struct or other named entity) for which you have a useful categorization (so others can use it) and maximize these groupings by finding rules which consistently represent and support the unseen relationships of data objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        This rule must be balanced with a counteracting rule: <a href="DontContainTheUnknown.html">DontContainTheUnknown</a>. If you don't have a category that represents your data, leave it naked.
