        Minor Edit

        <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> has now disabled the <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a> function on <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>. For specific discussion of that (BTW, should it be merged into here?), see <a href="MinorEditsDisabledDiscussion.html">MinorEditsDisabledDiscussion</a>.

        Many edits here by <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a>s are minor, for example -
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           correcting spelling
        </li>
        <li>
           improving grammar
        </li>
        <li>
           adding mailto: to an email address
        </li>
        <li>
           adding ISBN numbers
        </li>
        <li>
           adding a category at the foot of the page
        </li>
        <li>
           quietly excising several tonnes of pure crap
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        While such a minor edit may not be worth reading by itself, it is instructive to note that a page worth editing is often a page worth reading. The <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a> now offers an option to redirect the logging of such edits to an alternative log called <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a> which leaves <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> to record and recall useful content.

        The part of the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> script that adds the entry to <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> could add a meter similar to what you get with the diffstat utility. Big changes would have a large bar and minor edits would have almost nothing. -- <a href="PierrePhaneuf.html">PierrePhaneuf</a>

        My first reaction, now that it's been implemented, came unbidden, it was: "Oh no, now I have to check in two places to see what's been edited." -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a> (<a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        That was perhaps my third reaction. However now I am concerned. <a href="RachelDavies.html">RachelDavies</a> was just subject to some moderate-to-heavy (in my judgment) editing, but the author apparently thought it was a <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a> and not worthy of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. I think most would agree that anything beyond spelling, grammar, and categories does not constitute a <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>; but of course we do trust the author to make the right decision.
      </p>

        I guess the obvious Wiki answer is to edit <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a> and move the change to <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. :-) -- <a href="MattBehrens.html">MattBehrens</a> (<a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>)

        <em>Nope. That would break </em><a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmm, I fail to understand why. <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> is already just showing the last change to a page, whether it be a change or a <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Junkies use </em><a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>. If you truly do make a minor edit the page to push it onto <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>/<a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>, <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> will only show that minor edit. Bummer.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can always make any non-minor edit to the page to make it show up on <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. If you *really* care, you could copy the current version, restore the author-copy version, then reapply the current text as a non-minor edit.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, if someone explicitly says "I'm just doing minor edits.", I'm inclined to give them the benefit of the doubt. I'd only override a minor edit decision if you know better (than the minor-editing author) which changes should be considered minor. The quick-edits script (like <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/quickEdits?days=.8)">http://c2.com/cgi/quickEdits?days=.8)</a> may be useful for quickly checking all the minor edits for abuse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that diffs can't always be trusted, since they show the difference from the prior author (which is not always the prior edit). For instance, <a href="RachelDavies.html">RachelDavies</a> was edited by 193.132.120.73. Now, suppose the <em>previous</em> edit was 3 months ago, also from 193.132.120.73. The diff would then show all the changes from 3 months ago. (The old version in the diff (the author-copy) is not changed unless the page is edited by another user or host. Diffs are rarely useful for personal home pages that are edited mostly by one person.) -- <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>

        This is old news, but a recent <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a> of my own made me remember something that was confusing as a newcomer. In case any of you were wondering why <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> returns pages 'out of order' occasionally; pages on <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> are not reordered after a <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>, but the displayed age of the edit is updated.

        At least one <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> considers the use of "--" (as an <a href="EmDashInAscii.html">EmDashInAscii</a>) to be an "error", and accordingly changes it to "-". I find this both wrong and irritating when applied to my contributions. If <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a> is restored, the effect will be to make it even more tedious to find these changes. I prefer leaving <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> just as it is, tolerating a small amount of noise in it as part of an ongoing <a href="FixBrokenWindows.html">FixBrokenWindows</a> community value, and rely on the tension between that noise and the desired content to mitigate over-gnoming such as the <a href="HyphensAreNotDashes.html">HyphensAreNotDashes</a> minor tempest. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It would make it easier rather than more tedious. Once one is used to "-", "--" seems a bit ugly, especially if not preceded and followed by a space. It would be interesting to know just how inconvenient the </em><a href="UniCode.html">UniCode</a> em-dash U+2014 "â€”" would be.<em> -- Anon</em>
