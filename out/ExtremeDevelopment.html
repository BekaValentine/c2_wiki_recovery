        Extreme Development (XD) -- It's about Programmers
      </p>
      <p>
        The driving concern is being able to grow an XP shop more quickly.  The answer is to make the programmer the focus, not the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        XD is likely not as widely applicable as XP, but there are times when building a team is more important than the product being worked on.
      </p>
      <p>
        XD is most applicable anytime a product must be understood by a wider group.
        Frameworks, middleware, XML portals and extensible software in general all seem to qualify.
      </p>
      <p>
        XD should still be 100% XP. We're just adding a few things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Data-centric programming. The overall architecture is an XML file.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Less meta data is buried in the code but instead is abstracted into 
        visible structures.
      </p>
      <p>
        This facilitates both understanding and substantial re-architecting the overall project. Indeed, each application may have its own architecture. (Think of it as allowing for rapid refactoring on a grand scale.)
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Extensive use of components rather than OO, i.e. compositional
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        programming. Coupling is greatly reduced and generally the need for
        refactoring is less, or at least spans a smaller portion of the project. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This is the enabler of data-centric programming. But it also significantly decouples our classes. With less coupling to manage, we can now focus more on making it all easier to learn.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Open Source Software. This gives us a pressing need to keep our code
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        readable and easy to learn. Team members aren't the only ones reading the code.
      </p>

        We are using XD in a new development center in Raipur.
        Our first XD project was <a href="JxUnit.html">JxUnit</a>.
        (A tool for document-centric testing.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Our next project is actually an existing one--<a href="JxQuick.html">JxQuick</a>.
        One of the problems is missing documentation for novice users.
        (The previous version of Quick included extensive documentation.)
        Documentation could take many forms, but we found a nice XD answer: 
        focus on the needs of our next new-hire. This gives us a
        deadline (2 weeks), a target audience, and a means of evaluating
        our work.

        Interestingly, the description of XD says that it's about programmers,
        but the examples are all technological solutions.

        My coop student had a good observation about XP.  He said that he felt XP
        was less a methodology than a discipline.  By that, he meant that it requires
        a fair amount of skill and experience to pull off.  One has to adhere to
        its principles rigorously without being pedantic about following any particular
        method.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question arises, how does one build a team that is capable of being
        successful at XP?  The issues I see as a problem are:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           How do you build a group dynamic that is tolerant of change?  XP requires
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        a frightening amount of code churn.  How can the team allay fears in its less
        experienced staff?
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           How do you teach people how to refactor code?  Pair programming helps,
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        but my guess is that intelligently selecting pairs will make a big difference.
        Are there other techniques for improving this skill?
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           How do you deal with fragile egos?  Many people will feel very threatened
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        when their code is refactored mercilessly.  This can lead to intimidation
        tactics and other anti-social behaviour.  How do you transition a team where
        not so good experienced people are used to calling the shots?
