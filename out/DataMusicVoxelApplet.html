        Data Music Voxel Applet
      </h1>
      <p>
        Based on the <a href="JavaVoxelApplet.html">JavaVoxelApplet</a>, a <a href="DataMusicVoxelApplet.html">DataMusicVoxelApplet</a> is suggested as an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DataMusic.html">DataMusic</a> representations are now as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A path through a 3D voxel (<a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=voxel)">http://www.google.com/search?q=voxel)</a> landscape is identified with a single
          <ul>
            <li>
               stock-chart or 
            </li>
            <li>
               melody line
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Several paths can simultaneously be 
          <ul>
            <li>
               watched as portfolio
            </li>
            <li>
               listened as polyphony
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Different colors differentiate
          <ul>
            <li>
               stocks charts
            </li>
            <li>
               sounds
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A path bifurcation can be interpreted as	
          <ul>
            <li>
               another stock-estimate, as estimated by some algorithm (or neuronal network)
            </li>
            <li>
               another musical composition option 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Different light radiosity on the paths represent different volumes
          <ul>
            <li>
               of the stock market 
            </li>
            <li>
               of the sounds 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For better orientations, put in some lines in true perspective, representing the centerlines of the black keys of a piano-keyboard, like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        || ||| ||<br/>
        C	 <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The current trace point of a path can be represented by a beam originated in the fly-by camera and targeted at the current frequency/sound. The varying intensity of the light beam detects/reflects the radiosity of the current trace point.
      </p>
      <p>
        This orientation scheme allows correctly mapped microtones, pitch-bends and true 3D spacial sound. The different colors are mapped to different sounds.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that you can control the flight by mouse inputs in the linked <a href="JavaVoxelApplet.html">JavaVoxelApplet</a> : <a href="http://anfyteam.com/anj/voxel/anvoxel.html.">http://anfyteam.com/anj/voxel/anvoxel.html.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Who would like to program this? (My activities are focussed on developing music, based on such imaginations, not yet realized as software.)

        A 2D cut of a 3D voxel landscape, viewing a single path segment with scalable piano keyboard coordinate-lines for frequency (not necessarily in Well Tempered Scale) and volume as a chart would look like this:

      <p>
        For a Midi Sequencer/Composer module the conventional volume representation is quite handy. For voxel-rendering, the olume bars are replaced by intensities of the minipath segments between two adjacent pitch points.

        I doubt you are going to have much luck getting someone else to write the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software that <em>you</em> want.  Successful <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects are always started by someone writing software that they themsleves need.  There is not enough momentum to keep the project going, otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        If this is mere vapour-ware and you're not going to write it yourself, why are you writing about it it here? Instead post a request on CoSource <a href="http://www.cosource.com/">http://www.cosource.com/</a>

        <em></em><a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a> for this very valuable hint. Do you have experience with this system? I studied the website and I am reminded to the <a href="WikiStoneSociety.html">WikiStoneSociety</a>. Is there some relation? It could be one step towards a <a href="WikiWayOfLife.html">WikiWayOfLife</a>. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a><em></em>

        You should take a look at Cthuga (<a href="http://www.afn.org/~cthugha/">http://www.afn.org/~cthugha/</a> ). Theres a GL 3D Cthuga which looks like what you want and a 2D Java Cthuga. Its not quite what you're after but seems like it might interest you.
