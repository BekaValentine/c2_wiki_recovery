        <dd><a href="BlueBox.html">BlueBox</a> is a browser that makes scalable language creation a reality.	With <a href="BlueBox.html">BlueBox</a>, programmers write language structures known as words and post them on the Internet. As more and more words are posted in domains like mathematics, art, and finance, the language grows in richness and power. <a href="BlueBox.html">BlueBox</a> compiles documents written in these words into the technology of a user's choice -- be it Perl, Python, C++, a COM component, etc.</dd>
