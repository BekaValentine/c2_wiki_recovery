        I searched for JrandomCoder, but couldn't find it. Because this category was strangely missing. 
        Well here it is. I added some to the list.
      </p>
      <p>
        See e.g. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http:wiki?search=coder">http:wiki?search=coder</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http:wiki?search=programmer">http:wiki?search=programmer</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I added this tag to quite a lot of these and I have to say, that there is quite some redundancy or at least a very wide and finely filled range of types (from idiot over average to good and grand master).
