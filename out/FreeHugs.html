        I'm not suggesting that you hug your colleagues, bosses, underlings or customers, but respect for the person is a healthy thing.  You may disagree with their opinions, you may eventually decide that their technical expertise is not worth your time, and you may decide that you can learn nothing from them, but respect for the person should be given as a matter of course until they prove they are not deserving.

        And remember, there's <em>always</em> the chance that you're wrong.

        <em>The main issue with free hugs is not the idea - it is a great one. It seems to be that the trouble is finding the correct gender to do </em><a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> with. Laugh.<em></em>

        <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>...  there are plenty of cultures where giving a hug isn't a gender issue.

        Many of my personal friends are from Argentina, and they both hug <em>and kiss</em>, regardless of sex.  When I was first exposed to this, my <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>s made me feel very, very uncomfortable.  I've since overcome those assumptions, but only for Argentinians.  :) --SamuelFalvo

        <em>I think also Italians are this way (but they are also very mad when they are </em>mad<em>, is what I've heard).</em>

        I'm not so in favor of <a href="FreeHugs.html">FreeHugs</a> - because of raves. Sure everyone might be lovey-dovey huggy snuggly, but do you really want hordes of people recently dancing drenched in drug-laced sweat giving you hugs? It's one reason I almost always wore a rain-proof pullover. Now extend that to the everyday person you meet, and <a href="FreeHugs.html">FreeHugs</a> reveals it's true nature as a curse.

           Or, one could pull wool over one's eyes before hugging another.
