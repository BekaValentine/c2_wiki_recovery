        Xp Fixed Planning Game
      </h1>
      <p>
        Your organization is bidding for a large contract with a traditionalist organization. You intend to go XP, and they're happy with that, but they're adamant about traditional scheduling artifacts in the contract: <strong>fixed timeframes, fixed resources, and fixed scope</strong>. Oh oh, the XP <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> only does <a href="FixTimeVaryScope.html">FixTimeVaryScope</a> or <a href="FixScopeVaryTime.html">FixScopeVaryTime</a> ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Worse still, the traditionalists don't want to negotiate a contract in <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> because negotiating <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> granularity will take too long up front on a large project, and besides they want to build in enough room for the usual XP <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> as the project goes along.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Negotiate the contract in <a href="BusinessStories.html">BusinessStories</a> and <a href="ProjectCycle.html">ProjectCycle</a>s up front. Fix the binding of <a href="BusinessStories.html">BusinessStories</a> to <a href="ProjectCycle.html">ProjectCycle</a>s according to <a href="GenericityFirst.html">GenericityFirst</a> and let the traditionalists adjust this with their perception of <a href="WorstThingsFirst.html">WorstThingsFirst</a>. Then, as each <a href="ProjectCycle.html">ProjectCycle</a> occurs, negotiate it by <a href="FixTimeVaryScope.html">FixTimeVaryScope</a>: elicit sufficient <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> to fit inside each scheduled <a href="BusinessStory.html">BusinessStory</a>'s time & scope, arrange them by the usual <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> negotiation, and deliver only on those that fit. If the resultant scope of <a href="BusinessStory.html">BusinessStory</a> in the fixed schedule needs renegotiating, use whatever renegotiation processes are specified by the contract.

        Would it be possible to suck a few of the small, closely-coupled other pages into this one, at least for the time being? This page could potentially be very useful, but I feel like in its present form it can be too difficult for a reader to get an overall sense of what's going. (I know it's difficult for me, at least.) -- <a href="FrancisHwang.html">FrancisHwang</a>

        <strong>Concur.</strong> We seem to be spreading this stuff out a little too thin. I'm trying to organize and refactor the <a href="CategoryRequirements.html">CategoryRequirements</a> pages to something approaching <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> me own bad sef, but it takes a lot of work and I run the risk of misrepresenting somebody's ideas. Hopefully some kind <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> will adopt this page, along with some others like it, and convert the whole mess into something a little more concise. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>
