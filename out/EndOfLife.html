        End Of Life

        Last product in a line.'
        The product has reached the 'End Of Life' Status, what also means that support is ending or becoming expensive.

        For instance, SunOS 4.1.4 was the EOL version of the SunOS line, since SunOS was being replaced by Solaris.

        <em>I heard a rumor that for the EOL of a car body they run stainless steel plates thru the presses. This ruins & therefor retires the press molds, but it produces a gleaming steel car that needs no paint which they then auction off.</em>

        <em>I never seen one driving around, though...</em>

        I find this difficult to believe - the sale of replacement sheet metal for damaged vehicles is very profitable for the manufacturers.  <em>Sure, but still at </em>some<em> point they must set an EOL.  I mean, you can't still get OEM sheet metal for '57 Chevies, can you?</em>

        The  the 'End Of Life' Status seems constistent with the <a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a>: Life of this species, this specific materialized meme, dies because it no longer aquires the energy it needs to maintain  the order integral to its internal (?) function.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should also be consistent with the <a href="DefinitionOfDeath.html">DefinitionOfDeath</a>...
