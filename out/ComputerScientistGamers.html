        I find it interesting that most <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> majors entered the field for no other reason than to make money writing <a href="ComputerGame.html">ComputerGame</a>s.  I find it interesting now that I work on a board game website...  -- <a href="ChuckSmith.html">ChuckSmith</a>

        What is it that you've seen or heard or read that brings you to the conclusion that most Computer Science majors entered the field with the intent of going into gaming?

        From talking to my Computer Science friends... very scientific basis I know.  heh

        How about some other reasons why people studied Computer Science (or taught themselves it as a hobby)?  Please, each person add just one.

           I wanted to understand how 'mind' works - I thought it would be possible to write a program that thinks (hah!).

           Actually I, <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>, got involved in computers because I wanted to PLAY games.  In 1976, while in junior high school, I discovered <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a>, the computer game, and was instantly addicted.  Later, around 1980, while running the computer department at my high school, I discovered that people would be willing to pay me money to program computers.  (Until then, I was planning to be a traffic engineer or architect.  ;-)  Since then, I've gotten "burnt out" on games, and hardly ever play them (except in video arcades, sometimes).

           I was just *always* in CS, from the age of seven, when I was too young to have a clearly-articulated purpose.  Somewhere in my late teens I got into computational linguistics, which is where I've been ever since. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

           Everything electronic was heading towards microprocessors. You can't design a toaster today without one. <em><sigh></em> So, I became a mushhead to keep up with the <a href="EmbeddedSystem.html">EmbeddedSystem</a>s world - now look at me! -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        I find it interesting that one of my coworkers, John Knoderer, wrote the very first <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> game ever written to run on microcomputers in 1978!  -- <a href="ChuckSmith.html">ChuckSmith</a>

        It would be interesting to list some reasons you've stayed on f games did get you into programming, but you have ended up not writing games for a living.

           Fell in love with the feeling of sitting, thinking, and just sort of creating structure out of the void.  I admit to relating very closely with people who draw analogies between programs and devising magic incantations.

           A real sense of satisfaction when you get a machine to do something useful, especially when you get it down to a MakesItGoButton.

        Strange. I never thought about it that way. But I have to admit, that my very first real program was a game (on an electronic experimental kits 4-bit processor). 
        And many of my following programs revolved around games (mostly on the <a href="AtariSt.html">AtariSt</a>). 
        But my interest changed quickly to compilers and operating systems, even though I still toy around with some game ideas occasionally. 
        But for me game programming was never the reason for programming nor for the study of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> - 
        interest and curiosity for (mathematical and other) problems was.

        I actually ended up with CS degree not because of the video games (although I've tried to design a few along the way) but because the college I went too would not teach a <a href="ComputerEngineering.html">ComputerEngineering</a> degree and I didn't want to go do the EE path.  Ah, the road less travelled.
