        Trivial Task
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="TrivialTask.html">TrivialTask</a> is a task that has been done so many times that it is performed essentially by rote -- often using automated tools. The effort to complete such a task is highly predictable. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a <a href="TrivialTask.html">TrivialTask</a> can take milliseconds -- and sometimes months. <a href="TrivialTask.html">TrivialTask</a> is not a synonym for "instantaneous" (although it <em>is</em> a synonym for "easy". The phrase characterizes the predictability and effort of the task, not its duration.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, it is used in contrast to "<a href="StraightForwardTask.html">StraightForwardTask</a>" or "<a href="InventionRequiredTask.html">InventionRequiredTask</a>".
      </p>
      <p>
        Generating the read and write accessors of the attributes of a type is a <a href="TrivialTask.html">TrivialTask</a> -- and takes milliseconds using a reasonable IDE. Generating an index for a large full-text database is another <a href="TrivialTask.html">TrivialTask</a> -- and can take months, depending on the system resources available and the size of the database.
