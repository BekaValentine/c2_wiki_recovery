        Factor Cache
      </h1>
      <p>
        The idea of a factor is a component of logical design that can be treated independently of the rest of the design <em>or at least relatively so</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cache is one such factor.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong> A compiler is an interpreter with a cache.  Logically the design can be factored as an interpreter coupled with a method for caching. <strong>But</strong> Most compilers are not designed that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong> DNS name resolution uses a distributed cache.  Logically the design can be factored as a method for relaying requests coupled with a method for caching.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong> Dynamic programming is recursion with a cache.  Logically <em>(this is getting a bit repetitive)</em> <strong>But</strong> Most textbooks on algorithms don't describe it that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong> <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> can be 'derived' from StrictEvaluation by adding a cache.  <em>"the runtime overhead consists of: allocating and initializing an object, making a method call to trigger the calculation, testing for a cached result and caching the result if needed"</em>

        Help! Which design patterns is this related to?

        <strong>Advantages</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A cache can often be added as an afterthought to an algorithm 
        that runs too slowly.  This optimisation is commonly called memoisation (or <a href="MemoIzation.html">MemoIzation</a> in the US :-)

        <strong>Things to consider</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Using a <a href="HashTable.html">HashTable</a>.  Cache element expiry.  Use of random expiry can make chance of worst case behaviour negligible.
