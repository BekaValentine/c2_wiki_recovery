      <p>
        I'm a Java programmer based in Market Harborough, UK.
      </p>
      <p>
        In May 1998, I founded EJBHome, the first website to provide a free EJB implementation for developers. This was acquired by IONA Technologies in November 1998, forcing a relocation from London, England. (IONA sometimes paid <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> to fly over to help install XP, so I've got to meet Kent a few times
        for beers.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In 1997, I also founded a Java Users' Group in Manchester, England. (After a couple of meetings this was disbanded because I moved to London.)

        If you see me at conferences I am most likely to be talking about software modularization, programming techniques and style.
