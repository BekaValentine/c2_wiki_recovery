        <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a> who's interested in software process. Tired of seeing so much wasted effort, wasted money and wasted talent on software projects, I turned to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (out of desperation) and found to my pleasant surprise all the thousand <a href="LightweightMethodologies.html">LightweightMethodologies</a> (now called <a href="AgileProcesses.html">AgileProcesses</a>.)

        I live in Utah Valley (south of SaltLakeCity). I used to work at <a href="WordPerfectNovellCorel.html">WordPerfectNovellCorel</a>, developing <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a>, QuattroPro, and Presentations in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. Then I spent some time learning small company politics as well as how to build an enterprise information system in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>. Next, I established a software test team at an Internet hosting company, learning about testing (fun!), managing talented people (<em>really</em> fun!) and about company politics (not quite as fun, but still educational). I did some automated testing at a financial institution, followed by establishing another agile test team on a very large project. Currently I'm an independent consultant.

        I'm thrilled by what I perceive as the Agile methods taking the distilled wisdom of many, many years of software practice. What this means to me is I can spend my time learning and practicing concepts and techniques that other people (whom I have confidence in) recommend, thus saving a lot of my time I would otherwise spend chasing down dead ends. (Kind of like an Editor's Choice for software development process...)

        <dd>Dressage is the training of the horse for strength, obedience and suppleness. It has been an Olympic sport since 1912, and the earliest known book on the subject is "On Horsemanship" (Xenophon, 350 BC), but I have only been doing it since 1996. I have a long way to go. <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressage">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dressage</a></dd>

        Hi Kay,
      </p>
      <p>
        You said that at the end of the "XpDoesntSell" project, the XP team was laid off because of perceptions they weren't working as hard as the other development team.  How did the rest of the company go after that?  A roaring success, or another <a href="DotBomb.html">DotBomb</a>?  -- <a href="BenAveling.html">BenAveling</a>

        Hi Valerie,

      <p>
        Currently, First. I am on a new horse. I have done up to St Georges on a lovely schoolmaster, sadly since passed away. And you?
