      <p>
        When you categorize pages, especially home pages, please add a "last edited" date. Touching a page deletes last edit info, but some pages are strong candidates for an <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> tag, e.g. <a href="BenDavid.html">BenDavid</a> has no content, but <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s can't tell if it's been there for 5 minutes or 5 years. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> to preserve such information, so that <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s can go about their day-to-day work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once upon a time this was called "<strong>LastEdit</strong>", and then we had "<strong></strong><a href="PreviousLastEdit.html">PreviousLastEdit</a><strong>", which was asserted to be more correct, because when the "</strong><a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a><strong>" tag got added, that was actually the "</strong>LastEdit<strong>", and what you wanted was the edit before that.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, in the spirit of naming things properly, by what they mean, and not by a coincidence, what you really want is the <strong></strong><a href="LastRealEdit.html">LastRealEdit</a><strong>.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Suggested format:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>2005-08-16 </em><a href="LastRealEdit.html">LastRealEdit</a><em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Putting the date first allows multiple dates to be compared more easily. If this information has been lost but you still wish to find, the <a href="WikiArchive.html">WikiArchive</a> may be of use as a last resort.
