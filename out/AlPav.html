        <em>A policy I wholeheartedly encourage.

        <em>Other tips on editing:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>don't ever create a link to the page itself (ie, here </em><a href="AlPav.html">AlPav</a>); it's ugly and completely useless.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>if you can at all avoid it, don't ever create a link in a bolded title; it's very ugly.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>don't ever create multiple links to the same page in the same paragraph, one maximum; it's very ugly and useless.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>don't boast so obviously, there are plenty of ways of taking credit (eg, by signing) while appearing humble. There's an infinite variety of ways to draw attention to oneself ranging from the crude to the sublime (I should know since I've used all of them) and blatant boasting is simply not effective.</em>
