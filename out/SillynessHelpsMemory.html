        Sillyness Helps Memory
      </h1>
      <p>
        A technique whereby odd stories and silliness help people remember dry material. I use it often and it sometimes ticks people off, but if it highlights a point, it may at least by helping some readers/listeners remember. True, it may also offend some such that there can be trade-offs.

        {Indeed.  Nothing wrong with funny, engaging, risqu√©, even controversial stories.  Top's recent "stories" have been none of these.  They've been dull, sexist, and vaguely vulgar.  I have no memory at all of what they were intended to help me remember, except the fact that I wouldn't risk inviting Top to a casual barbeque, let alone a dinner party.  The guy sounds like a bit of a creep.}

        <em>Yes. But I will note that how people act when they are "anonymous" and how they act in person is often quite different. It's one of the reasons for the </em><a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a> policy.<em></em>

        I can assure you that I'm a jerk in person too :-)
