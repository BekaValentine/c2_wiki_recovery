        In 1964, students at Dartmouth College needed better access to computers and a simple, effective language to write computer programs. First, John G. Kemeny, who was the chairman of the Department of Mathematics, and Professor <a href="ThomasKurtz.html">ThomasKurtz</a> created the Dartmouth Time-Sharing System, one of the first time-share computer systems in the United States; then they created BASIC computer language so students could write programs to run on the General Electric GE-225 mainframe that was the heart of the system.

        It was one of the first languages designed for real-time interaction as opposed to the batch systems. Some have called it "interactive Fortran". To facilitate this, it used line numbers so that <a href="TeleType.html">TeleType</a> users could change lines simply by retyping a line with the same number. (This was before advanced text editors, and CRTs had yet to become a common computer interface.) When one was done entering lines, they would type RUN to run the program. This simple editing convention was one of the reasons for its long-standing success as a training and hobby language. One did not need to learn an editor in addition to the language.

        I had an opportunity to buy an original manual for <a href="DartmouthBasic.html">DartmouthBasic</a> for a buck at a book sale, and for some unfathomable reason I passed, which I regret as I like collecting such arcana. -<a href="DavidBrantley.html">DavidBrantley</a>
