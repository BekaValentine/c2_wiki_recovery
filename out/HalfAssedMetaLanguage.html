        Nothing on this page seems to discuss a "<a href="HalfAssedMetaLanguage.html">HalfAssedMetaLanguage</a>" (see discussion below), so either the page title is a poor one, or else mention of an example of the title is still waiting to be added.

        If it were Turing-Complete, it would open the door to security problems. Most web-sent attacks/viruses use Turing Complete holes. Besides, if you want Turing Complete HTML, try <a href="AllaireColdFusion.html">AllaireColdFusion</a>.

        I'm sorry, but aren't we confusing data description languages with computation languages?  HTML and XML's true nature is to describe a data.  Complaining that HTML or XML are not <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> is like complaining that apples aren't very good oranges.  Any data can be interpreted as a program within the right context and the reverse is true.  However, the purpose of HTML and XML is not to compute. --<a href="JosephCoffland.html">JosephCoffland</a>

        I'm not altogether sure that HTML actually earns the "language" moniker.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've had markup systems for a long time, and converting the markup tokens to "words" with "parameters" doesn't really change what's being done:  basically StateOn, StateOff switching related to formatting and navigation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tokens like <head>, <font>, <table> and so on don't make it a "language" because they look like English.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've used markup systems that allowed font specification, color, pitch, spacing, bold, underlining, italics, centering, widow/orphan control, external document inclusion, conditional inclusion, limited arithmetic, and specific blend of coffee without ever using anything that resembled a word -- and I would never have called them languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or it may just be that I've not been willing to allow a broad enough meaning for "language" -- after all, nobody else seems to have a problem using that term to refer to things that (for me) fail that test.

        We don't have to invoke <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> to see that more thought and care with definitions is called for here. You already know the difference between a "programming language" and a "human language", so you already know that the unqualified word "language" is ambiguous.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are lots of other kinds of languages. HTML is not a programming language, no question about it, however formally any language is a set of symbols plus rules specifying how they can be sequenced, so in that formal sense, indeed all of those text-based markup systems you used are "languages".
      </p>
      <p>
        There's of course a question of what can and cannot be done in a language. HTML is not <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a>. Neither is a regular expression (although regular expressions do in fact specify a "regular language"). <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> is not <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> (although TeX turns out to be). Yet <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> and regular expressions are very useful indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        As Joseph points out above, it also tends to matter what the intended use of a language is. TeX is <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a>, but it's not intended to be used for general computation, it's intended to create documents.
