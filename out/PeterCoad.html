OI then morphed into <a href="TogetherSoft.html">TogetherSoft</a> with Peter are the CEO & President.  He is no longer CEO, instead he is Chief Strategy Officer.

        Just found this nice quote from <a href="PeterCoad.html">PeterCoad</a>!

      <p>
        "JDH: What are the three most serious mistakes you find clients making? 
      </p>
      <p>
        PC: Three people mistakes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           not working with domain experts, 
        </li>
        <li>
           not having a <a href="ChiefArchitect.html">ChiefArchitect</a>, and 
        </li>
        <li>
           not working with a core design team.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And four process mistakes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           not using a feature-driven process;
        </li>
        <li>
           not delivering frequent, tangible, working results;
        </li>
        <li>
           not budgeting for improving some; and 
        </li>
        <li>
           not budgeting for throwing some away.

        <em>Verrrry Interesting!</em> XP has features to avoid all of these "mistakes" except the <a href="ChiefArchitect.html">ChiefArchitect</a> one. Of course, at any moment, someone may be leading the design, but an XP [core design] team definitely has no chief. I'd like to interrogate Peter on that one.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
