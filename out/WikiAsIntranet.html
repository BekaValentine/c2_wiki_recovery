        <li>
           <strong>no simple layout</strong>: Before trying it, they wanted to make sure that wikis allow background images, a fancy navigation bar, and an editable product list in a side bar.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>oops, wrong culture</strong>: The organisational culture needs to be one of information sharing.  In an XP environment I am sure a wiki would thrive, elsewhere it may starve.  My experience was that people tried it once but it did not change the way they work.  I now use a personal wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>the hundredth monkey</strong>: In my experience, (not XP environment) the use rose exponentially when there was enough contributions and contributors.

        Wiki as part of the intranet. Works here. Infected the R&D dept, then the IT dept.

        I would imagine that corporate wikis would work best in smaller environments. Does anyone have any experience with a large organization like a University or government?
