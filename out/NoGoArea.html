        No Go Area
      </h1>
      <p>
        Areas of an artifact that are off limits for one reason or another.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reasons include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           nobody fully understands the artifact (e.g., the artifact was acquired externally, or the original developers have left the scene)
        </li>
        <li>
           The artifact has so many tendrils that any change risks collateral damage
        </li>
        <li>
           The original author is still around, and for various reasons others don't dare touch the artifact (e.g., the original developer is vengefully protective)
        </li>
        <li>
           The culture confers ownership to the last person to touch an artifact (AKA <a href="StickyFingers.html">StickyFingers</a>), and nobody <em>wants</em> that particular ownership
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A classic example of a <a href="NoGoArea.html">NoGoArea</a> is the ParagraphEditor in SmalltalkEighty. At the time it was written, it broke new ground in multi-font text editing. Ten years later it was a wheezing pile.

      <p>
        I see here a problem in people/culture. Team does not have enough courage to change annoying things; so, the team will most likely fail in other areas too.
