        An <a href="IdeaLanguage.html">IdeaLanguage</a> is a generalization of a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>, in which the tokens don't have to be patterns, but can be other forms of idea (see <a href="IdeaForm.html">IdeaForm</a>).

        <em>Are there any languages where the "tokens" aren't also ideas?  Aren't all languages "idea languages"?  Isn't this redundant?  Isn't this redundant?</em>

      <p>
        Seems like it. It seems to be referring to something on <a href="IdeaForm.html">IdeaForm</a> that says "Ideas in the soon-to-be-published <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> Professional Services <a href="IdeaLanguage.html">IdeaLanguage</a>", but of course there are no references to this on the gemstone site.
