        I think we're finally getting to the point where we're able to identify recurring criticisms of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, some more valid than others.

        A common failing in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> projects is the often inappropriately large <a href="FocusOnCode.html">FocusOnCode</a> - most IT projects are actually a small part of some larger business project. XP tends to attract people who have little or no interest in understanding business problems. This is not <a href="VanillaXp.html">VanillaXp</a> as practied <a href="ByTheBook.html">ByTheBook</a> but a side-effect of the kinds of people XP seems to attract
