        Principles For The Next Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you have to start from scratch, what principles and features should be embodied by a new wiki:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Openness</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Within limits since newcomers don't need the ability to delete paragraphs, merge paragraphs, delete pages, create more than 10 pages a day, and so on and so forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Automation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There shouldn't be a need for human intervention in routine activities such as creating a newcomer account.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reflection</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Privileges of the wiki's users should be accessible and modifiable in the same way as any other content of the wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Security</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The ability to restrain bullies, to close off pages to everyone but selected participants, to have any grain, any permutation, and any kind of legitimate collaboration imaginable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Responsibility</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your signature gets attached to every edit you make, deleting signatures is a completely separate privilege. Privileges are managed by human beings and can be revoked. Management of a group of users' privileges is itself a privilege which can be revoked.
      </p>

        <em>Would </em><a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a> apply, or could one be an <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a> or use a pseudoynm?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Non-linearity</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Though this would be extremely difficult to implement within the limitations of the web.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please explain what </em>non-linearity<em> means in this context.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki links make the wiki as a whole highly non-linear; hypertext instead of text. However, the pages themselves are highly linear and people must spend an inordinate amount of effort on demarcating their non-linearity when they wish them to be so (ie, to distinguish threads and speakers). Basically, the grain of non-linearity (the page) is much, much too big.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Are you therefore using "non-linear" to mean "non-sequential"? In these contexts "linear" could be talking about "scaling" type issues -twice as big implies twice as long sort of thing. Perhaps sequential is a better term.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>Depends. If you make the distinction between </em><a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> and <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>; the latter is much more non-linear than the former--and for threaded conversations, things like Usenet and most blogging engines are probably better than wikis.<em></em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Carrying on with the distinction between "linear" and "Sequential", </em><a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> pages are sequential, <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> pages aren't, although they are laid out as such. That's what makes them undesirable.<em></em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        This proposal is inelegant. Might as well install a prefab message board program.
