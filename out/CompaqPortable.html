        Compaq Portable
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Compaq Portable was the first IBM PC clone, developed in the early 1980's. Aside from the <em>portability</em> (that word is being generous... the machine weighed 40 pounds), the only factor that distinguished it from the IBM PC was a video board that had CGA graphics, but the higher resolution text characters of the IBM Monochrome text adapter.

      <p>
        This machine spawned a whole series of portables from Compaq: Portable Plus (10MB hard disk), Portable/286 (80286 CPU), Portable II (80286 in a lighter case), Portable III (faster 80286 in an even lighter case with a plasma display), and the Portable 386 (an 80386 in a Portable III style case).

        The companion machine to the <a href="CompaqPortable.html">CompaqPortable</a>, the Deskpro, had an 8MHz 8086, making it notably faster than either the <a href="CompaqPortable.html">CompaqPortable</a> or the IBM PC, and likely one of the first <em>turbo</em> clones.
