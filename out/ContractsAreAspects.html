        Contracts Are Aspects
      </h1>
      <p>
        Contracts only are a sub-concept of Aspects (inspired by <a href="TypesAreContracts.html">TypesAreContracts</a>) or more specifically: Contract is an aspect pattern.

        I don't see how it can be true that "contracts are only a sub-concept of aspects", since contracts are primarily <em>documents for the human reader</em>, describing what each part of a system requires and guarantees. A good DbC system will provide ways to enforce (parts of) the contracts, but the tests are not the contract.
      </p>

        You can certainly use aspects to implement some of the checking found in systems that support DbC. But it's not clear to me that everything you <em>can</em> do using aspects <em>is</em> a "sub-concept of aspects" or an "aspect pattern". -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>
