        This was the second and last conference with the name Agile Development Conference. It and the <a href="XpUniverse.html">XpUniverse</a> conference will be merged in 2005 under a new name.

        This conference set a standard for openess and inclusiveness of discussion that future conferences should seek to maintain. It also had the highest bonding rate of any conference that I and many other people have ever seen. Hopefully the merged conference will manage to capture that also.
