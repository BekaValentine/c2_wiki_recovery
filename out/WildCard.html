        <a href="WildCard.html">WildCard</a> was what would become <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>.

        Interesting little historical bit here.

        Ward claims he saw <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a>/<a href="WildCard.html">WildCard</a> after <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> showed it to him; Beck was working at Apple with <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> on Playground, part of the <a href="VivariumProject.html">VivariumProject</a>. Playground was an ecological sims environment aimed at allowing kids to design the interactions between fish (er, "agents") and things like that. Atkinson's <a href="WildCard.html">WildCard</a> had been developed at around the same time, and was also being used in the Vivarium project. Apparently, there wasn't any direct Smalltalk influence in <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> (despite <a href="TedKaehler.html">TedKaehler</a>'s later involvement in the <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> project), but you have to admit that this was a pretty small world.
