        A homomorphism is a function from one <a href="AlgebraicGroup.html">AlgebraicGroup</a> into another which preserves the group structure.  Formally, if <em>G</em> and <em>H</em> are groups with operations * and #, respectively, and <em>f</em> is a function from <em>G</em> to <em>H</em>, then <em>f</em> is a homomorphism if

        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>a</em> * <em>b</em> = <em>c</em>  implies  <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) # <em>f</em>(<em>b</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>c</em>)</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        for all <em>a</em>, <em>b</em>, and <em>c</em> in <em>G</em>.
      </p>

        A homomorphism maps the identity element of <em>G</em> onto the identity element of <em>H</em>.  If <em>h</em> is the image of <em>g</em> under a homomorphism, then the inverse of <em>h</em> is the image of the inverse of <em>g</em>.
      </p>

        The definition above is not the usual one, but it is equivalent to it.  The usual definition is that <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>*<em>b</em>) = <em>f</em>(<em>a</em>) # <em>f</em>(<em>b</em>) for all <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> in <em>G</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a homomorphism is one-to-one and onto, then its inverse is also a homomorphism, and it is called an <em>isomorphism</em>.  Two groups are considered to be the same if there is an isomorphism between them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <em>H</em> is a group with identity element <em>e</em>, and <em>f</em> is a homomorphism from <em>G</em> to <em>H</em>, then the set of all elements  <em>g</em> in <em>G</em> such that <em>f</em>(<em>g</em>) = <em>e</em> is called the <em>kernel</em> of the homomorphism.  The kernel of a homomorphism is always a NormalSubgroup of <em>G</em>.
