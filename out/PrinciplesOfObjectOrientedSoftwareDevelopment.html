        There's no superlative enough for this book on OO. 
        The most thorough review of the current research, models, methods and practices in <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recommended reading for all those who believe there's one and only and true OO model - and that should fit either Smalltalk or Eiffel ;-)

        I wonder if anyone else has discovered that "good OO" makes your code worse? Recently I descended into object purism and landed in <a href="RefactoringHell.html">RefactoringHell</a>. I'm going back to my latest slogan, "Objects are for idiots." cf. <a href="CppHeresy.html">CppHeresy</a>. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        While I was working on an OO cache for a relational database, I've taken for granted the principle of "object identity", that you can find in almost all well known OO books (you name the author here ... ) as something sent from Heaven. Well, in reality for some applications the principle smells like hell. -<a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        I'm exaggerating, naturally. As for common sense, I believe that would get your objects twisted pretty tightly. You should <strong>never</strong> apply common sense when programming OO. Circle/Ellipse. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
