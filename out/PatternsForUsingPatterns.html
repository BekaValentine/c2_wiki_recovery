        Patterns For Using Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm currently working on developing a "Best Practices" textbase and the associated processes for populating and maintaining it.  I've taken a "Patterns Lite" approach to the templates used to document the best practices, and am trying to integrate workshopping and other pattern writing methods into the practice documentation process.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would seem that one fruitful area for discussion, albeit a bit "meta" in nature, would be patterns for applying patterns in new areas.  In the "Patterns Lite" style we've proposed, I'll contribute my first pattern for applying patterns:
        <em>Name:</em> Selling Hammers By Their Shape
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Context/Forces:</em> A business unit could benefit from a patterns-like approach, as opposed to their current procedure-based method for documenting their activities.  Balance the need to provide a general and flexible framework for the documentation against the unit's desire not to get involved with more fuzzy-headed theories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Approach:</em>  Cut down the patterns template to a minimum number of slots and sell the advantages of patterns, rather than the name and applications in other areas.  In specific, push:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            supports interaction of experts to determine best overall approach
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            encourages documentation of general practices rather than specific procedures for one piece of equipment or a given subsystem.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            documents complementary and associated forces governing a problem.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Can evolve into a more formal approach without loss of knowledge.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            minimum cost to implement if Web server software and hardware exists.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Exceptions:</em>  May not be a good idea in seriously dysfunctional groups or recently "burned (by previous change efforts)" staff.

        My intuition says that we should use more of a pull-rather-than-push-approach, and have people buy rather sell.
        Will try to give examples, but I am sure others - with more experience can.
