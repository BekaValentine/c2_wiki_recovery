        Observation Equivalence
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ObservationEquivalence.html">ObservationEquivalence</a> is an idea that arose in Concurrency theory.
        It was the response to the question
        `` when are two (concurrent) programs equivalent? <em>.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The answer is that this depends on the observer
        that interacts
        with the program. If an observer can interact with two observed
        entities in such a way that it can spot difference in their
        behavior, then they are not relatively equivalent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, if you are given a language in which observers can be
        described, and you can show that for all possible observers
        two entities exhibit the same behavior, then we have a stronger
        equivalence, often called congruence.
