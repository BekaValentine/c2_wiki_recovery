        One of Tom's quotes above sounded familiar, and triggered some digging.
        <a href="GeraldWeinberg.html">GeraldWeinberg</a> uses a similar line in <a href="ThePsychologyOfComputerProgramming.html">ThePsychologyOfComputerProgramming</a> (p. 18).
        The setup is that a sticky problem has just led to a project being canceled. Our hero has devised a solution that may save the day, and is presenting it to the members of the project team. We enter as they react:

      <p>
        The members of the audience - who had, after all, all contributed to the one-second version - seemed relieved. But our hero, who was rather young and naive, was not put down by this remark. Instead, he calmly observed, "But your program doesn't work. If the program doesn't have to work, I can write one that takes one millisecond per card - and that's faster than our card reader."

        "By relieving the brain of all unnecessary work, a good notation sets it free to concentrate on more advanced problems, and in effect increases the mental power of the race. Before the introduction of the Arabic notation, multiplication was difficult, and the division even of integers called into play the highest mathematical faculties. Probably nothing in the modern world would have more astonished a Greek mathematician than to learn that...a large proportion of the population of Western Europe could perform the operation of division for the largest numbers. This fact would have seemed to him a sheer impossibility... Our modern power of easy reckoning with decimal fractions is the almost miraculous result of the gradual discovery of a perfect notation."

        "Java's primary roots are out of the C++ world. From that standpoint, Java is a big step up. It's a cleaner, object-oriented language. And the benefits of a Virtual Machine on every platform are obvious.
      </p>
      <p>
        "But I came to Java from a different world of programming, the Smalltalk world. For people who program in Smalltalk, Java is a 30-year step back. Smalltalk is what made object-oriented programming real. It had a mature class library and culture from the day it was released, whereas the C++ world just kind of happened. Its class library still isn't stable. The result for me is that Java is an absolute requirement in today's software world, but sometimes it hurts me to use it."

           It would become very tedious very fast to manually name 10,000 things.

        <li>
           It might not matter a lot, but each head _is_ a little different. At least you would want to know how old each (or each lot) is. As for files, it's easy to see how their distinction is crucial.

           You probably don't really care about the specific name given to your file, or care to refer to a cow by a number or another id.

        For some file types (particularly pictures, video, drawings, and correspondence), thumbnail icons, summaries, keyword lists, and creation or last-modified-time are a lot more useful than names.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Summaries and keyword lists are names - or at least take as much time as names; timestamps are provided by the OS (hopefully); thumbnails are hard to search by (as of 2008).  Quite often, those who claims names are obsolete are coming from a Windows background, where each file type has a "default" or "preferred" application associated with it, and things like tax returns would be associated with that program (Quicken, </em>TurboTax, etc), and the program would only show related files.  In a more open system, with options for many programs to use data, you need a way to get the specific file to an arbitrary program, hence the names<em> --petehardie</em>
