        Ups Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have a UPS wired into the outlets in my office. It provides great peace of mind, even though it has never been used. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        A UPS provides better power conditioning against voltage spikes and the like than one of those little plug-in outlet strips.

        Also, if you live in California, our semi-third-world electrical network gives a UPS a good workout, with frequent failures.

        And when you're taking a printer into the shop, it's a lot more fun unplugging a UPS than unplugging a CPU :) -- <a href="JoeTennis.html">JoeTennis</a>

        A laptop with a surge protector (do they make little surge protectors?) might be a more portable option.

        If you plug a UPS into itself, will it power itself forever?

        <em>No.  Energy lost in the form of heat will quickly result in the unit discharging.</em>

        Well damn. Mine's been going for like two years like that.

           It has a very large, eventually to become a discharged battery. Why not connect something useful to it also, so it will discharge quicker, think of all the potential energy you'll be losing! :) or :( . <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>
