        Rejection Letter

        <em>The book is so endlessly complicated by details of reference and information, the interim legends become so much of a nuisance despite their relevance, that the very action of the story seems to be to become hopelessly bogged down and the book, eventually, unreadable. . . . The manuscript of The Left Hand of Darkness is returned herewith.</em>

        New writers often collect stacks of rejection letters from publishers before getting their break in publishing, even those who become successful authors.

      <p>
        The moral:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Not all critics are right.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Though some of them might be.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Those who wish to be successful in any endeavor must develop a strategy for dealing with criticism.
        </li>
      </ul>
