        The first computer spreadsheet program developed by <a href="DanBricklin.html">DanBricklin</a> and <a href="BobFrankston.html">BobFrankston</a>. The archetypal <a href="KillerApp.html">KillerApp</a>, it was responsible for a <em>lot</em> of <a href="AppleIi.html">AppleIi</a> sales. Apple arguably wouldn't be around today without this early boost because they couldn't fund the Mac and GUI projects without the revenue. The reasons it was developed for the Apple first tend to vary. One story is that the Commodore Pet and TRS-80 were taken by other projects. Another is that Steve Jobs gave them some Apple computers in exchange for porting another product of the company over to Apples.

        <strong>An emulation of the paper spreadsheet</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most software is more or less an adaptation of a non-software system (word processor; typewriter; database: column systems; accounting software: accounting books etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="VisiCalc.html">VisiCalc</a> was a software emulation of the physical, paper spreadsheet that had been used by accountants for ages. The idea was that the number in one cell may come from a formula. Of course, the cells contained values only - the innovation was in making cells able to contain automated computations

        <em>As a young, na√Øve engineer whose first OS was Windows 98, </em><a href="VisiCalc.html">VisiCalc</a> for me came across as a spreadsheet version of <a href="ViEditor.html">ViEditor</a>: commands are a slash and 1-3 keystrokes. -- DaNuke<em></em>
