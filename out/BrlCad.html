        Brl Cad
      </h1>
      <p>
        brl-cad is a solid modeling tool (like Catia, pro-engineer, etc.) but open source and has conversion engines to and from the application.
      </p>
      <p>
        The URL to the homepage is:
        <a href="http://www.brlcad.org/">http://www.brlcad.org/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        True, its origins are a bit doubtful but it seems to hold well in a Linux environment and it is full of potential.
      </p>
      <p>
        Questions, obviously, remain among which:
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: why is the IGES file conversion so patchy (not a single success yet) and is it user error?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: is there a tool to morph one 2D shape into an other?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: is there a convenient scripting tool that will allows the conversion of arbitrary solids into models that brl-cad can understand? tlc/tk is already heavily supported but is there example code available?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: IGES is a good but somewhat unstable format so what is the experience with sending these models converted to IGES to be produced?
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: I have tried the dxf conversion into qcad without success.  What am I doing wrong?
