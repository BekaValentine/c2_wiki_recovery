        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You are designing a system to be constructed from a mixture of third-party and home-grown components.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you make it easy (easier) to reuse components and maintain a system built from components?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A component that has implicit dependencies on the context in which it is used is harder to reuse in other contexts.
        </li>
        <li>
           A system in which implicit dependencies exist between components is brittle - making a change to one component can break others which have an implicit dependency on it, but the cause of the failure will not be immediately obvious.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Replace implicit dependencies with explicit dependencies. One or more of these strategies might help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Define <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a> between components.
        </li>
        <li>
           Connect components via <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a> or a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Components can exhibit <a href="ContainerIndependence.html">ContainerIndependence</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="InterfaceDiscovery.html">InterfaceDiscovery</a> allows a component to be used without compile-time knowledge of its type.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a> helps keep a component's implementation independent of the persistence mechanism used by the system.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Based on some of the discussion that occurred in <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a>, I've done more thinking about what we're talking about here. We're talking about the structure and behavior of interacting components and frameworks. But what about expected and unexpected life and death? I am, therefore I exist . . . but how did I come and how will I go? Perhaps another mini-pattern language called LifecycleMethods or the <a href="GameOfLife.html">GameOfLife</a> is in order?
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know if it's a part of <a href="ContextIndependence.html">ContextIndependence</a>, or if we should have the <a href="GameOfLife.html">GameOfLife</a> contain <a href="LifePatterns.html">LifePatterns</a>, <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a>, and DeathPatterns -- all taking both foreign and domestic structural and behavioral forces into consideration. Thoughts?
