        I've been following the patterns idea for quite some
        time now, basically since <a href="BruceAnderson.html">BruceAnderson</a> started his
        work on the "architecture handbook".
      </p>
      <p>
        I use patterns in a course on software architecture
        at the university of Utrecht [1], and try to apply them in
        practice via the Software Engineering Research Centre [2].
      </p>
      <p>
        I've run some (small) workshops to learn more about how to
        model/design with patterns. Together with a student I'm
        going to look at a pattern-centered design environment.
      </p>

        Any tips, suggestions and comments are welcome. Just drop
        me a line.
