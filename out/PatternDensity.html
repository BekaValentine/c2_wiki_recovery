        Pattern Density
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some have said that code with a lot of <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> crammed into a few classes has a high <a href="PatternDensity.html">PatternDensity</a>. It seems to say that this is a sign of high complexity and a bad thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand <a href="TheTimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TheTimelessWayOfBuilding</a> seems to promote high <a href="PatternDensity.html">PatternDensity</a> as a sign of good architecture, at least in building architecture.

        <em>"Designs with high pattern density are easier to use but harder to change. We have found that such a high pattern density around key abstractions is common for mature frameworks. The opposite should be true of immature frameworks - they should have low pattern density. Once you discover what problem you are really solving, then you can begin to "compress" the solution, leading to a denser and denser field of patterns where they provide leverage."</em>

        My guess is that the problem isn't really a question of how many patterns, but a question of <a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a> vs. <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a>. High <a href="PatternDensity.html">PatternDensity</a> is not a bad thing, but applying every pattern in the GoF book without thinking is. -- <a href="AndersBengtsson.html">AndersBengtsson</a>

        Design patterns add flexibility; thus, they generalize. Thus trying to incorporate them from the beginning of a project falls under the category of <a href="PrematureGeneralization.html">PrematureGeneralization</a>. -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>
