      <p>
        <a href="MockupScreens.html">MockupScreens</a> is a tool to <strong>extremely</strong> quickly create screen mockups that <strong>don't</strong> look like real screens. You organize mockups into scenarios.

        As it states on the website (<a href="http://www.mockupscreens.com/):">http://www.mockupscreens.com/):</a>

        Actually, I was doing screen mockups on many projects and I was quite unhappy with tools support. How to effectively maintain, comunicate or e-mail paper sketches? How to populate rows in datagrid in some GUI tool? How to organize mockups? Only tool that made me moderately satisfied was <a href="QtDesigner.html">QtDesigner</a>, but I knew there should be a better way. I just didn't want to waste hours just to sketch the screens of a scenario - I wanted to focus on the problem I was trying to solve, not on some tool or the process.

        Finaly, I got fed up with inaction, and wrote a small tool to help me. It was started as a PetProject, but it has grown since into quite a helpfull little tool. If you are curious, check the website: <a href="http://mockupscreens.com">http://mockupscreens.com</a> :-)
