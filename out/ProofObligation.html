        Proof Obligation
      </h1>
      <p>
        A famous term coined by <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a>. It means:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Every programmer has to be able to demonstrate that his program has the required properties.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is the central idea of all of Dijkstra's work on computer programming.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        To what extent is this principle compatible or incompatible with <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> (TDD)? Dijkstra encouraged a logical/mathematical kind of "proof", where the party arguing for correctness had to demonstrate step-by-step that the implementation was sound. In contrast, TDD reverses the burden of proof -- the assumption is that the implementation is correct unless someone can provide a test that proves otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's incompatible because tests always only cover a small sample of your program, they don't prove your entire program is correct. Extreme logical reasoning about a program can prove it is correct, whereas tests only cover small samples of the program functionality. However in practice, testing is useful because bugs in programs do exist, despite all our logical reasoning. When a bug is found in software, it is useful to keep the tests available for future use to ensure that bug doesn't crop up again (</em><a href="RegressionTesting.html">RegressionTesting</a>). I think unit testers see software as engineering (engineers like to test), whereas Dijkstra definitely wanted software programming to become a mathematical discipline (math equations can be proven wrong much more effectively using logical reasoning on paper, rather than testing millions of parameters as inputs)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think most people will agree that formal proofs of correctness are not feasible for the complex systems we build today. But has TDD gone too far in the other direction, saying basically "If it works, then that's <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>; we don't need any deeper understanding than that?"
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I want to mention that my reading of Dijkstra's ideas is that he didn't mandate formal proofs of correctness validated by proof checkers. He knew the limitations of the technology. So while I can't speak for Dijsktra, I would assume that for practical software building he would have agreed that proofs might be informal: imagine for example in a peer review of your work, you'd have to convince the (reasonable but inquisite) reviewer that your code is correct. More importantly he emphasized the requirement that your design of the program should be driven by the proof that you have in mind.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [This page was about Prof Dijkstra and requiring proofs (if not formal proofs) for correct program code. If you look at the Wikipedia article on him, you will see that he valued Math above CS and wanted CS to become more of a Math sub branch. My 35 plus years of experience tells me that everything I have read about Mr Dijkstra was naive and misguided. Some would say "Who cares?" but I would say that this Math emphasis is not benign. It is harmful to our field and holds back the progress of real CS. see <a href="FacultyOfSoftwareEngineering.html">FacultyOfSoftwareEngineering</a>. --- <a href="DavidClarkd.html">DavidClarkd</a>]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm sure that in the long run, he envisioned better language design and more importantly better development education (he characterized the software engineering discipline as "how to program when you can't"), that will make formal proofs a reality. There's no substantive evidence other than the typical naysayer's mumbling that his vision is not achievable sooner or later. And should I mention, Dijkstra contributed a lot more to our profession than all his naysayers combined. -- </em><a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [You make an all encompassing statement about the merits of Prof Dijksta as compared to all other "naysayers" (you must be a Mathematician)! Would you care to enlighten a mere professional programmer as to how his entire, long career could be incorrect while a professed Mathematician is correct about a field he never actually worked in? We all want better "language design" and better "development education" but do you really think that will come from the people who don't actually develop anything? When was the last time that CS professors actually asked professional programmers what they want for tools or what techniques actually worked or didn't? Why don't these professors ask what areas of language design research would benefit or enhance the work that these professionals actually do? --- <a href="DavidClarkd.html">DavidClarkd</a>]
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Another thing I want to mention, is that Dijkstra spelled out what we all have in mind more or less. I think that when we write down some code, we all are are at least partially "convinced" in a corner of our mind that "it should normally work", in other words we already have some partial proof or some sketch of a proof in mind, otherwise we wouldn't write that code. He only asked for a bit more rigor and intellectual discipline in the way we do it. I don't think that's such a tall order, that we can refuse a priori to follow his model.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The above sounds like a lot of pandering to a Mathematician pretending to be a Computer Scientist without any argument. How many and how big were the computer projects that were successfully designed, implemented and used by end users that were written by Prof Dijkstra?
      </p>
      <p>
        He taught computer programming without actually knowing "for sure" how to program himself because he wasn't a professional programmer. How does that make his "theories" about programming valid? You wrote "I don't think that's such a tall order, that we can refuse a priori to follow his model.". Show me some evidence that would make such a statement worth "believing or following until proven wrong"!
      </p>
      <p>
        What is wrong with designing code by playing around with different ideas until the spark of a solution emerges? What is wrong with imagining a solution and then verifying the unknown parts needed to fulfill that vision before solidifying your design? I could go on but there are many useful ways of designing programming systems that meet many of the goals of software development like maintenance, speed, flexibility, speed of creating etc that have nothing whatsoever to do with Math theorem proving.
      </p>
      <p>
        No human can possibly do a walk through of code and be any near as thorough or fast as the CPU of the computer can. In the end, if you disagree on the validity of the code with the CPU, you automatically lose! Stop the desk checks and use the power of the CPU! If you can't show an example of how a program will produce erroneous output, given data from the domain defined by the program specification, then that program is probably "good enough" until you can. If you end up with a "bug" the world won't end. Fix the bug and move on. Only ivory tower persons can spend unlimited time, producing Mathematical proofs while the real world just keeps moving on.] --- <a href="DavidClarkd.html">DavidClarkd</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Large (or relatively large) information systems, though often business-critical, are not life-critical. Cost/benefit analysis on them shows formal verification is not worth the expense. For relatively small, life-critical systems -- firmware of drug delivery systems or heart pacemakers, weapons systems, aircraft navigation and autopilot systems, nuclear reactor control systems, and so on -- formal verification is worth it and provides added assurance of validity.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The examples you give are obscure and very few in number compared to all programming projects. I don't think Dijkstra's ideas were intended for such a small group of programs. Like all Mathematicians, he wanted to make statements that would encompass <strong>all</strong> cases when the world of creating programming, is not homogeneous. There is nothing stopping any programming project from spending whatever time they think wise, in testing and showing that their project is without bugs. No special "formal verification" is required in the general case and many methods of ensuring "bug free" code are available, in the exceptional cases. Dijkstra specifically recommended "code walk through's" which my 35 plus years of experience as a professional programmer/developer, tell me is a waste of time. My disagreement with this idea from a professional Mathematician still stands.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is just another case of a Mathematician pretending to be a Computer Scientist and in Dijkstra's case, he was very convincing. Who could imagine that the extremely important task of teaching programming would be given to people who have never been professional programmers? Should the blind lead the blind? --- <a href="DavidClarkd.html">DavidClarkd</a>

        <em>Code walkthroughs and formal verification are not the same thing. Whilst I don't doubt that Dijkstra would have encouraged a more formal approach, or at least more rigour, in programming than the ad-hack approach that many programmers take, I'm sure he would have recognised the practical unreasonability of doing it on every program. That doesn't mean it's any less a good idea. If we could automate formal verification and do it with reasonable resource consumption, there would be no reason not to do it.</em>

        This is <strong>your</strong> opinion and definitely not a fact. My BSc degree has a mayor in Computer Science and a minor in Math. I have had a very long career in applications, tools and designing/creating computer languages. I have used very little Math in all the hundred's of thousands of lines of code I have designed and written. Most of my code has been written using the tools I created myself. I have studied, contributed and hopefully still expect to contribute to the "science" of making computers more useful, through better software tools. Although I know quite a lot about Mathematics, I certainly am not a Mathematician. Are you saying that my practical contributions are worth less than the Math algorithms that constitute the unused but published papers of our "so called" CS professors? I do agree that not all programmers are computer scientists. I also would add that some Mathematicians have become true computer scientists but then so have trained chemists etc. Mathematicians have no special place in CS and because they dominate the publicly funded CS positions at Universities and teach programming that they don't do professionally themselves, there should be a heaping dose of condemnation toward the CS pretenders in our field. --- <a href="DavidClarkd.html">DavidClarkd</a>

        <em>You are a software engineer, not a computer scientist. Computer scientists contribute greatly to the theoretical and mathematical underpinnings of computing. Software engineers contribute greatly to applying computing to real-world problems.

      </p>
      <p>
        Again, this might be your opinion but definitely not fact. Very few professionals call themselves "Computer Engineers" [I meant Software Engineer, my mistake] because designing and creating software isn't an engineering type discipline. If you had enough experience actually solving real world problems with computers, you wouldn't make such an unqualified statement.

I am the first one to say I learn new things every day, but I am not happy when people question my right to call myself a Computer Scientist.]

        [I took a 3rd year course, in 2000, in "Software Engineering" and (at least from this course) it looked to me like the SE crowd wanted CS to revert to some kind of Math. Good luck with that! CS has transformed our society over the last 40 years like nothing else has. Every advancement in almost every field can be tied to computers and the software that run them. Almost all popular and currently used languages and tools are made by companies or crowd sourced rather than by academics. All this good has been gifted to Mathematicians that have publicly stolen what rightfully belongs to others (public payed positions at Universities in the CS department). If CS professors are doing research in Mathematics, then the Math facility should be footing the bill, not the CS department.]

I know there is pure mathematics being done in computer science departments, and applied computer science being done in mathematics departments.

That happens -- take another course. </em><a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> encompasses a broad spectrum from purely theoretical computer science at one end to totally empirical pragmatism at the other.<em> [Actually, I think CS professors should take a course from me!

      <p>
        [I don't think that "computation is fundamentally mathematical"! I think computation is based on what set of instructions a computer can execute. Why would you call a branch or subroutine call Math? The exact configuration of constraints that software developers have to solve their problems with is defined by the arbitrary set of features embodied by the CPU. This isn't Math. If some people want to adapt some Math notions to these things, as Math is a kind of language, then good for you but that doesn't make programming, some kind of Math.]

        Just a few quotes from the Wikipedia article on Prof Dijkstra:

        <li>
           <em>One starts with a mathematical specification of what a program is supposed to do and applies mathematical transformations to the specification until it is turned into a program that can be executed.</em>

        <em>Computer science is the study of computation in all its myriad forms, which includes what was Dijkstra's area particular interest, the mathematics of computation. Dijkstra wasn't "anti-computer", he was a theoretician; he simply wasn't that interested in the application of theory. Likewise, most astronomers are interested in stars, galaxies and planets; they aren't that interested in telescopes. The desktop computer is only one possible implementation of the theoretical foundations of computing, and for those who are concerned mainly with the theoretical foundations, it is not of particular interest. Yet, without those theoretical foundations, we would not have computers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [I guess we can agree to disagree. I think someone who is only concerned about Math is a Mathematician. Someone like me is concerned with computers and the software that runs on them, therefore I call myself a "computer scientist". Your analogy about studying a telescope is the same as studying a computer, is nonsense. The telescope might be comparable to the designer of a CPU but not software designers. I also have created many "theories" and then tested them by actually creating the code and having the CPU verify my "theory". I have also had many theories about how "end users" actually use code and this has made me design many enhancements to the UI of my programs. Most of the "theories" I have conjured, have had everything to do with "Computer Science" and very little to do with Math. If I was a designer of a CPU, then I might need a theory of computing but my expertise is in creating useful software and the tools that make that process better. Although I am not an expert on what it takes to create a new CPU design, I have read the things that Prof Dijkstra "invented" and they have nothing to do with computer design or anything I have ever used. I think your opinion on the merit of his contributions aren't supported by the facts I have read about Prof Dijkstra. If you believe that the theory (Math?) comes first and then the design and implementation in software design, you don't know much about software. I programmed over 100,000 of assembler on a Z80 CPU running at 2 megahertz. It had a 16 bit address space and no segment register. The 8086 (which came after the Z80) still only contained a 16 bit address space but also included a segment register. This gave it the ability to access 20 bits of address space (on 16 byte boundaries) and that was enough memory space to start the explosion of PCs. What Math theory was it that invented segment registers? Could have just been a common sense solution to the problem of providing more address space while still only using 16 address lines?] --- <a href="DavidClarkd.html">DavidClarkd</a>

That isn't what I do and not what other software designers and developers do either.

        Second: It is very difficult to hire programmers who are worth hiring because they are being taught by people that aren't professional designers and programmers.

           My experience tells me that most CS professors have got a doctorate where their thesis looked more like a Math paper and then got a job as a professor without any real world experience.

        Re above: "Almost all popular and currently used languages and tools are made by companies or crowd sourced rather than by academics." 
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe this is because the primary purpose (need) of programming is to communicate with programmers (self and others). Communicating with machines is of secondary importance (although still a necessary feature). If communicating with machines was the primary purpose, we'd be using something closer to assembler or machine language. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Mathematicians mistakenly concentrated on communicating with other mathematicians because that's who they work with and know, and their development tools were thus rejected by "the masses", who are not mathematicians. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A result of the mostly non-mathematician-built tools that they are not the most intellectually noteworthy nor of the highest abstraction ability, but instead are geared toward a common set of mutual idioms, patterns, and conventions that more or less "felt the most comfortable" to average developers, for good or bad.

      <p>
        <em>There's a simple(r) explanation:  Universities, which is where academics typically work, are not in business to create commercial products.  They're in business to generate knowledge and disseminate knowledge to individuals or companies who may commercialise it.  Aside from notable examples that have an academic origin (e.g., Lisp, Haskell, and </em><a href="PostgreSql.html">PostgreSql</a>), popular and currently-used languages are made by companies because that's what companies do.  Academics produce theory and research -- that's what universities do -- that eventually become the foundations and features of popular and currently-used languages.  For example, the <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> facilities that are increasingly incorporated into languages like C# 3.0 and Java 8 are based on theoretical work at the universities of Glasgow, Edinburgh, Princeton, and MIT.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But "crowd sourced"...??? Which popular and currently-used languages are crowd sourced?</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect the author meant products like Apache and Php.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Neither are "crowd sourced". They're </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, but not open to the public editing implied by "crowd sourced".<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Technically they are open to public editing because they can be forked by anybody at any time. Only the original name is "locked".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Their distributions are not open to public editing, only being forked.  Thus, they are not "crowd sourced".  The individual who claimed such products were, is incorrect.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To enter deeper into quibble-land here, we don't have to consider "distributions". We can consider it from the perspective of "code base". The original poster called them "tools", not "distributions", and thus did not lock the scope into just "distributions". Forking X into X' does not de-tool-ify X'.

      <p>
        Again, limiting the scope to a single instance appears to be an arbitrary scope. And it's possible for corporate software to be a sub-set of "crowd sourced". The author was not focusing on corporate versus open-source, but rather academically built software versus non- academically built software. The rest may merely be examples rather than something intended to have a clear dichotomy. Personally I would have worded it differently, but as given it's not objectively wrong. Ambiguous, perhaps, but most English statements are. Ambiguity in English is just a matter of degree. As given, the author's statement does not clearly claim that company-built software is a different category than crowd-sourced software.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Crowd sourced" has a specific meaning.  See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crowdsourcing</a>  I'm not "limiting the scope to a single instance", but making the point that there aren't <strong>any</strong> "popular and currently used languages and tools" that are "crowd sourced".  Perhaps the original author intended "crowd sourced" to be a deprecatory euphemism for <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, but taken literally (and there's no reason not to take it literally) it winds up stating something nonsensical.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        From Wikipedia: "Crowdsourcing is the process of obtaining needed services, ideas, or content <strong>by soliciting contributions</strong> from a large group of people, and especially from an online community, rather than from traditional employees or suppliers." [emph. added]
      </p>
      <p>
        It thus "asks" lots of people for ideas and contributions, not necessarily <em>using</em> all or most of such. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>: move above debate about definition of "crowd-sourced software" to another topic.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed.  There are no "popular and currently used languages and tools" that "'asks' lots of people for ideas and contributions".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        An asking-based metric? How does that work exactly? And perhaps "allowing" is a more fitting terms than "asking". I am allowed to offer code changes to Php, for example. Now, whether it will be accepted depends on a vetting chain. And I am allowed to fork Php, no questions asked. If nobody uses my fork, so be it, but I can do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Being allowed to fork a popular and currently used language or tool is called </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, not "crowd sourced".  No popular and currently used language or tool uses the process of "<strong>obtaining</strong> needed services, ideas, or content by soliciting contributions from a large group of people".  Your interpretation that it "<strong>asks</strong> lots of people for ideas and contributions" is quite distinct from "<strong>obtaining</strong> needed services, ideas or content."  Crowd sourcing means obtaining crowd input, not merely asking for it, nor does any popular and currently used language or tool ask for input other than the usual bug reports, which are hardly "needed services, ideas or content."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The definition given is a form of "obtaining X by asking a large number of people". It is not "obtaining X by having a large number of people participate in actual construction".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The crucial issue is "obtaining X".  No popular and currently used language or tool obtains "X by asking a large number of people", where 'X' is any aspect of development.  Thus, no popular and currently used language or tool is crowd sourced.

It only makes it look like he doesn't understand <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, which is about the distribution model, not the development approach.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find an objective and term-usage-acceptable way to measure "soliciting", measure it, and show that it's too low for open-source to qualify by comparing it to some agreed-upon level of "solicit-ness", you may have point. Many so-called crowd-sourcing websites don't have an active sales-force, I would note.

Contrast this with </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects (or <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a> development) which do not depend on effectively anonymous, diffuse, largely un-vetted, mass input.  Both <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> and <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a> development depend on relatively small, highly-vetted, highly-communicating, focused teams -- the diametric opposite, if anything, to "crowd sourced".<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unvetted? Please elaborate.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Most crowd sourced sites are like this Wiki: anyone can and does contribute, and the aggregate interaction hopefully results in acceptable overall results.  Contributors and contributions are barely vetted, if at all.  I know of no </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> or <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a> project that works that way.  Popular and currently-used <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> and <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a> projects select contributions and contributors very carefully.  Contributors and contributions are thus vetted extensively.<em></em>
      </p>

        That may be true of <em>some</em> crowd-sourcing, but not all, and not a prerequisite. The vetting of services/sources/orgs called "crowd sourcing" varies widely. Anyhow, I'm tired of debating terminology. The term obviously means something different to you than me, and neither is going to change the others mind. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Quite simply, </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> does not imply crowd-sourced, and crowd-sourced does not imply <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>.  They are orthogonal.  The original use of "crowd-sourced" appeared to be intended to make some deprecatory connection between the two, or perhaps between "crowd-sourced" and popular languages and tools in general whether <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> or <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a>.  There is no such connection.<em></em>

      <p>
        Go right ahead and believe that, Mr. Repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you show otherwise?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I already did. You did not prove your case solidly, rather, mistake your <em>personal</em> interpretation of term as a universal truth. We've been in this vocab dance already. Now, fuck off!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You haven't shown any evidence to connect any popular and currently-used language or tool development with a process of crowd sourcing.   You've mainly waffled about irrelevancies, or evaded my questions and points with private vocabulary like "asking-based metrics" and irrelevancies like "universal truth".  Universal truths are almost solely mathematical.  This is not a mathematical discussion, but a simple one about how popular language and tool development actually works.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Projection, you are the one who "waffled about irrelevancies". Your own made up rules about vetting and participation rate didn't hold up under scrutiny. It's a typical evil pattern of yours:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Make up rules about a word or phrase out of your arse
        </li>
        <li>
           The rules end up failing to back your own claims when applied
        </li>
        <li>
           Blame the other guy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I believe crowd-sourcing and open-source have fuzzy boundaries that probably overlap based on actual usage. I don't have a formal study to "prove" that, but you don't have one either for your vocab view/claim. <a href="AnecdoteImpasse.html">AnecdoteImpasse</a>. Done. Nothing new to see.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In other words, you have no evidence at all.  Having started down an indefensible path, you're going to squirm and quibble about it rather than admit the obvious: popular and currently-used languages or tools are built by development teams; they are not crowd sourced.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I gave my evidence already. Spin spin spin, repeat repeat repeat. Fuck fuck off off. Nobody cares about this vocab squabble as nothing important or useful hinges on it. Let's get back to arguing about <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a>.

        <em>Your evidence is weak, and you must care about it because you're debating it.  If it didn't matter to you, why did you respond in the first place?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your evidence is likewise weak. Anyhow, I don't know why the fuck I am here debating it still. Maybe I need a shrink. Maybe I hope it will eventually click that you keep mistaking your personal interpretation of definitions for universal truths (and/or popular opinions).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you find any external evidence -- i.e., citations to articles, books, 'blog posts, whatever -- that popular and currently-used languages or tools are developed by crowd-sourcing them?

      <p>
        Those are opinion pieces. If somebody paid me to write an opinion piece, I too could give <em>my view</em> of what the terms mean. (I even considered going into that business once.) And the fact that the first one has to <strong>"correct the masses"</strong> suggests that the masses are intermixing the terms, and definitions are generally shaped by mass usage, not logic nor canon authorities. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've seen no evidence of mass confusion.  If there was, we'd expect to see (say) </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> and crowd-sourced used interchangeably, which seems not to be the case.  Instead, what appears to be the case is individual confusion like yours.  I suspect even the original poster was writing with a specific anti-<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> agenda and used "crowd sourced" in a deprecatory manner.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If I were to isolate the distinguishing characteristic(s) between them, I'd say the <strong>outputs are the key</strong>, not the inputs. Open-source requires that the outputs be open, while crowd-sourcing doesn't. However, this has very little to do with the nature of the contributors (inputs).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If "outputs are the key", then it seems like you're confirming my point by distinguishing crowd-sourcing from </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> (at least) in terms of output, but the inputs are different too.  Popular and currently-used languages or tools are developed by small, closely-communicating teams, not anonymous crowds.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's still possible to consider "open-source" a sub-category of "crowd-source". And I disagree with your "input" characteristic for reasons already given.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> is a distribution model.  It is orthogonal to the development model.  If there are <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects that use crowd-sourcing to obtain source code, then it's reasonable to identify them as using "crowd-source" development, but they could be <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a> just as easily as <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>.  Can you name any software development projects -- any at all, not necessarily just popular and currently-used languages or tools -- that "crowd-source" their development?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unless we agree to a canon definition of "crowd source", I cannot answer that beyond what I've already stated. I'll supply an answer based on my working definition and you'll question it based on YOUR working definition and we'd then be back to square one. We've been doing that dance for years.
