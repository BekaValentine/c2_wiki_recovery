        If this is a serious comment it imputes on the quality of the work, as the page on <a href="GreenSpunning.html">GreenSpunning</a> includes the word <em>bug-ridden</em>. I am unable to discuss this with the anonymous contributor. I suggest that person show how they can implement the <a href="FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign.html">FunctionalPatternSystemForObjectOrientedDesign</a> in a language of choice. That would be a positive contribution to the discussion.

        Whoever the anonymous commenter is, he <em>has</em> suggested that you use a language in the ML family. I assume he means <a href="OcamlLanguage.html">OcamlLanguage</a> or one of its siblings, which is a functional, object-oriented language. That is, there's nothing to show because the language just does the right thing.

           <em>Some people don't have the freedom to choose their language of implementation. The techniques given on this page provide a way of using functional methods - which might be the most appropriate - in C++ - which might be demanded.</em>

        <em>No doubt the anonymous hit-n-run "contributor" simply wanted to say "If you want functional features use a functional language".

        Thank you for the comments. I am not the original author of the FC++ code, but have now spent a lot of time working on it as well as using it. I had looked at <a href="OcamlLanguage.html">OcamlLanguage</a> at one stage. It seems to use <a href="StrictEvaluation.html">StrictEvaluation</a> rather than <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>, which is what I need. My main reason for working in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is to integrate with other code for <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a> which is in C++. I find that in practice I don't need a lot of code to make a big difference, e.g. to turn a member function of a class into an object which can be passed around. The <a href="ObserverPatternInCeePlusPlus.html">ObserverPatternInCeePlusPlus</a> is one example of this.

        <strong>'... providing real [functional features] to people who are required by customers to use C++ ....</strong>'
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely many of the customers who require C++ do so to ensure that the resulting code is "understandable" to their (in-house/contract) C++ developers. Isn't using FC++ going to hinder that? Does it follow the letter, but not the spirit, of the requirement to use C++?
