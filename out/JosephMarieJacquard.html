          -07-07 marked the birthday of Joseph-Marie Jacquard, in Lyon, France. It is the late 18th century that can be marked as a significant beginning point in the <a href="HistoryOfComputing.html">HistoryOfComputing</a>, for it was then that Jacquard developed a practical automatic loom which wove patterns utilizing a linked sequence of <a href="PunchedCards.html">PunchedCards</a>. It was from this beginning that Charles Babbage and Herman Hollerith developed their own use of cards. Jacquard looms are still found in use today throughout the world. Jacquard died 1834-08-07, in Ouillins, France.
