        Tests that forbid regression in software projects.

      <p>
        Regression is when an old bug shows up again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Regression is also when a functionality that was not yet implemented and was later implemented, is missing because a bug was introduced. It is implied that getting that functionality to work again will take a lot of time and effort.

        A simple way to achieve <a href="RegressionTest.html">RegressionTest</a>s for bugs is to <a href="CaptureBugsWithTests.html">CaptureBugsWithTests</a>. A simple way to achieve <a href="RegressionTest.html">RegressionTest</a>s for functionality is to write <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s for every functionality. <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s are now called <a href="CustomerTest.html">CustomerTest</a>s and were once called <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s by <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s can be captured by the customer using a simple tool like <a href="FitNesse.html">FitNesse</a>.
