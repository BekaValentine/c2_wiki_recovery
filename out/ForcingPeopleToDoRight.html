        <a href="CaseSensitivity.html">CaseSensitivity</a> forces people to be consistent with their capitalization.

        <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> forces people to have a minimal amount of semantic correctness, even when they forget to <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>.

        <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> forces people to spend more time on syntax, leaving less time for <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> .

        <em>A bit of a weak argument there... the </em>'time<strong> involved in writing statically typed code is far less than the time involved in writing good unit tests.  </strong><a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> does have benefits, but time isn't typically a big one.<em></em>

        On the one hand, we want code that is consistent (<a href="FixBrokenWindows.html">FixBrokenWindows</a>) and semantically correct.  On the other hand, the idea that it is Ok to force people to do something might be a slippery slope.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead of making it painful for people to go against your wishes, why don't you make it enjoyable for people to comply with your wishes?
      </p>
      <p>
        Make <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing fun, rewarding, and hassle-free.

      <p>
        Portray the benefits of consistent capitalization.

        Listen.
