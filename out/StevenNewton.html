        I've lost my interest in doing IT work, and am returning to my prior career as a photographer. If you'd like to purchase a print of my photographs leave a message here. I'm also available for writing and editing assignments, either technical or non-technical fields.

        Ward and I worked together and came up with a nice logo, I'd like to share it here:

        Also I wrote a little poem.

        Funny day -- that glary yellow thing in the sky again,<br/>
        Scary blue mist above.<br/>
        I'd float right up<br/>
        With no moist blanket over me.<br/>
        I don't care what people say,<br/>
        Fair days, bright highlights and deep shadows,<br/>
        Strange sights.<br/>
        I like the way the green world<br/>
        Looks in the grey rain.<br/>
