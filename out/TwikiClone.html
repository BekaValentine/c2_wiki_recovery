        Twiki Clone
      </h1>
      <p>
        TWiki is a mature, stable and full-featured Wiki system. It is targeting the corporate intranet world to create dynamic intranet sites and knowledge base systems. There are several hundred installations of TWiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Twiki said to stand for "Take Five Wiki", a product of <a href="PeterThoeny.html">PeterThoeny</a>. [sourced from KrisJohnson wiki]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pages are grouped into TWiki webs (or collections). This allows you to set up separate collaboration groups.
        </li>
        <li>
           Full text search with/without regular expressions.
        </li>

        The TWiki home is at <a href="http://TWiki.org/,">http://TWiki.org/,</a> the place to get more details and the GPLed source code.
        Registration for download of the code was required, but the registration is currently broken, so it can be downloaded without registration.

        I like the functionality of TWiki a lot for intranet use (revision tracking with RCS, user authentication, plugins, file attachments, etc.), particularly its plugin model - there is now a long list of plugins including calendars, voting, action tracking, spreadsheet, vector drawing, smilies, database access, LDAP queries, etc. It's quite easy to add features such as embedded searches (e.g. 'all open bug reports') without writing any code, you just embed a search command in the page.
      </p>
      <p>
        The user interface needs a bit of work, as out of the box it looks quite complicated, but it's possible to customize the UI greatly using templates (search for KoalaSkin on TWiki) - this is more of an adoption issue really. It also has a large and active community of developers (I'm one of them, so I'm probably biased...)
      </p>
      <p>
        TWiki also has a quick-comment plugin that is a first step in the direction of a <a href="WikiLog.html">WikiLog</a> with more support for discussions - see <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/CommentPlugin">http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Plugins/CommentPlugin</a> .... There's also some customization that was done at one site, but that isn't part of the core code - see <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/EvEm">http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/EvEm</a> for how that site did threaded discussions within TWiki (and an interesting template).

        <em>TWiki Dec-2000 takes 15 minutes or less - change a few config lines, upload it all if you have to, a bit of permission-setting and... presto! - an instant multi-web TWiki, prepopulated with helpful pages cloned from twiki.org. Simple, and all you need for a basic TWiki. It's in the options that TWiki set-up can get truly intense - there's so much customization potential built-in, and all so easy to do, it really is near unbelievable. -- TS</em>

        <em>If you know your way around a Web server and you have access to the shell, TWiki Dec-2000 can install quickly. However, if you do not have access to the shell and are only accessing via FTP (i.e. Web-hosting account), watch out. It is much more complicated, but can be debugged using the help forum documents at TWiki.org. I tried to upgrade to the latest release, Sept-2001 and could not get it to config correctly at all on a Web-hosted account, even after working at length with the developers. Admittedly, the Sept-2001 was much more "techie rich" than the Dec version. Definitely not for the faint of heart... even if you have shell access.

        The only hard part about setting up TWiki (for me) was getting the authentication working, and that was because (a) I know nothing about HTTP authentication before I started and (b) my Web hosting provider had a particular non-standard way of enforcing it. Other than that, TWiki was a breeze. I just upgraded our Dec 2000 installation to the newest Dec 2001 release, which again was pretty painless. But it's true that you need to have a shell account, and you need to know how to use it. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        <em>Agree, I've got some background in HTTP authentication (no rocket science) and it was a breeze setting it up. No problems at all, I just stupidly followed the installation instructions, and voila. I haven't got mail notification running though, but I suppose it's a problem with our qmail setup. Taken this aside, I can only recommend TWiki: stable and very functional.</em> -- JulianScheid

        For me it's been a pretty big ordeal getting it set up. The initial install took all of an hour, but since then I've had a problem with it truncating content every time a page is saved. It appears that this is a problem specific to Red Hat 9 and the version of mod_perl I'm using, but frustrating nonetheless. I really want to get it working! From all my research it's "the" wiki to have for an Intranet. -- <a href="MarcusVorwaller.html">MarcusVorwaller</a>

        I'm an engineer, not a programmer and I've installed software like <a href="MovableType.html">MovableType</a> no problem, on FreeBSD, but TWiki was a freakin nightmare to install and configure. Thank God for the port install method - that helped a lot, but there are so many gotchas with various perl modules not being included and what not. They need to come out with "Twiki For Dummies". I hear someone is working on a complete install script that takes the headaches out of installing. Without that I don't recommend this one for newbies. For example, I was able to set up new users, and include only myself in the admin group preventing anyone else from editing site wide preferences and setup stuff. Only problem was, I didn't realize I had to setup htaccess stuff first. There is NO user authentication out of the box, so I effectively locked myself out of making important configuration changes to the site. Whoops. Not quite ready for prime time department...

        TWiki supports any type of authentication. All it needs is the REMOTE_USER environment variable, which is typically provided by an Apache authentication module. last edit Mar05 by unknown-3-136.wrs.com

        Twiki is said to be "hard to use" compared to other (e.g. C2). Where do I go read up on "independent" commentary re its relative merits for use in an intranet environment.

        I settled on TWiki as my standard wiki, after trying the original <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a>, ZWiki (<a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a>), <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a>, and <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a>.
        My main motivations for TWiki for
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (a) use of UNIX files, rather than a database - allowing me to use other tools when necessary,
        </li>
        <li>
           (b) plugins, the ability to write my own (seldom used, but really nice when I do so),
        </li>
        <li>
           (c) version control,
        </li>
        <li>
           (d) access control - not perfect, but better than none,
        </li>
        <li>
           (e) hierarchy - the twiiki webs, corresponding to UNIX directories.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        At Intel, the wiki community has settled into two tracks - I would hardly call them "camps", since we share all the time:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> is used for the open to all Intel employees wikis, such as the corporate wide wikipedia.
      </p>
      <p>
        TWiki is the main wiki used for projects which have access control needs - the requirement to restrict some files or sub-hierarchies to particular users or groups.  But to specific users.  Also for projects that need to generate some stuff automatically, using plugins and/or filesystem access.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect that <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> would be our main preference, if <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> had access control.  We (Intel) have even made approaches about paying for the development of access control for <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a>.  But the <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> community has indicated a complete lack of interest, and, in fact, has indicated that they would refuse to accept such changes into the codebase, resulting in a fork.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> has better data organization tools.  But TWiki has better plugins.
        I wish that the version control for twiki was a distributed version control tool such as GIT, instead of RCS.
