        <a href="PythonScript.html">PythonScript</a> is just <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> with an <a href="ActiveXscripting.html">ActiveXscripting</a> wrapper so it can be used on a <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> box as a <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> in <a href="ActiveServerPages.html">ActiveServerPages</a>, <a href="WindowsScriptingHost.html">WindowsScriptingHost</a>, etc.

        It is also common to use "a python script" as a synonym for "a python program". In some strange way the term "script" has less status than "program". -- <a href="AndersBengtsson.html">AndersBengtsson</a>

        <em>Actually, I think "script" just implies that it's interpreted directly from code, or compiled to </em><a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> every time it's executed. <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> fits the bill there, so you call your "python program" a "python script" interchangeably. It <strong>does</strong> sound meaner, though, doesn't it? :)<em></em>

        The "script" suffix in this case is just a parallel with the names of <a href="VbScript.html">VbScript</a> and <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. The context is that it is used under ASP versus just being a CGI [<a href="CommonGatewayInterface.html">CommonGatewayInterface</a>] script or some other type of program. -- <a href="AdamVandenberg.html">AdamVandenberg</a>

        Unfortunately, <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> also offers a system known as Python Script (or Script(Python)). Having gone through several thoroughly ungooglable names (like Secure Python and Python Methods), they've settled on the ultimate confusing name. Zope's Python Script is a replacement for the long lost Rexec module. A restricted execution system for Python, so that embedded Python interpreters can run untrusted code. Unfortunately, nobody at Zope will give me more information on this project. Can anyone here? -- <a href="MartinZarate.html">MartinZarate</a>

           Sorry you did not get a response on Zope question regarding their <a href="PythonScript.html">PythonScript</a> and I don't know either. I am however interested in knowing where to get a Real<a href="PythonScript.html">PythonScript</a> (as defined above) so I can use it in <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a>. Can you or anyone help? -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

           ActiveState ActivePython (<a href="http://www.activestate.com)">http://www.activestate.com)</a> has an implementation of Python running under the MS Script Host.  Note that you don't need this to use *Python* under <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a>. --ChrisMellon

               Thanks Chris. Do you think it is much easier to have Python "packaged" this way (e.g. easier to remove)? Else why would someone do it? -- dl <a href="DeleteWhenRead.html">DeleteWhenRead</a>
