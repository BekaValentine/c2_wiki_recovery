        Scalable Syncracy

        <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> described the <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> as a "scalable syncracy" without defining "syncracy."

        As of January 1, 2000, Google (<a href="http://google.com/)">http://google.com/)</a> finds no web pages with the word (although <a href="AltaVista.html">AltaVista</a> does have a few hits).
      </p>
      <p>
        In April 2002, Google finds two pages worth of results, although none appear to define the word itself and most use it either incorrectly (instead of synchronicity) or as a hyphenated suffix (as in the pun "idiot-syncracy").

        Syncracy is a social psych term that describes families who make decisions by consensus. Wiki itself seems a very syncratic mechanism, don't you think? I meant government by mutually <a href="ConstructiveInterference.html">ConstructiveInterference</a>. Now don't go asking me to define constructive interference ... --PM
