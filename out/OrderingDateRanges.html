        Ordering Date Ranges

      <p>
        This page was really discussion the question of <a href="OrderingIntervals.html">OrderingIntervals</a> rather than specifically ordering date ranges.

           In general, are dates from different time zones comparable at all?
        </li>
      </ul>
