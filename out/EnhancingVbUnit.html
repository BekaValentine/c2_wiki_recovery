        Crashing the <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> IDE is handled much more gracefully now.  ;->
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em>'This is not vbUnit's fault, but it's useful to know this, to work around <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>'s problems:<em></em>'
      </p>
      <p>
        When the application under test crashes...
        <em>(yes, there </em>'are<strong> ways to do this in </strong><a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>  ;-)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Symptoms:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> crashes...
        </li>
        <li>
           vbUnit attempts to do its "Stop Debugger" command -- so you may see the "Run" menu pop up.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> IDE is shown on the screen, but does not refresh and the mouse pointer is stuck; it won't move.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Workaround:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do the <a href="ThreeFingerSalute.html">ThreeFingerSalute</a> (Ctrl+Alt+Delete).  You'll typically get the <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> error and be able to kill it without going through the Task Manager.
        </li>
        <li>
           Stop writing bad <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> code that makes the IDE crash.  <em>(One of the </em><a href="VbClassicBugs.html">VbClassicBugs</a> relating to conditional compilation was causing me problems, in this case.)<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A really minor "nit":
        If there's a syntax error that prevents the program under test from compiling, <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> highlights the offending code, but this highlighting is not displayed because the vbUnit add-in window is still the focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Workaround:
        To see VBs highlighting, scroll the code window up or down one line.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some of  the things we could do for <a href="VbUnitTestDataManagement.html">VbUnitTestDataManagement</a>, need to be do differently in <a href="VbUnitThree.html">VbUnitThree</a>.

        Some things don't work quite right when one has several projects open at once (with a group), and the projects share files:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Close all files" does *not* display VB's "do you want to save changes to this file?" nor the "do you want to share changes with other projects?" dialog boxes.  [Exit VB to get the save/discard dialog box.  'File -> Save All' may also do the trick (but I haven't tried it).]
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>I'm not sure about this, but this *may have* allowed me to make incompatible changes to the same file from two different projects -- a conflict VB detected and forced me to discard one of the two.  This was a minor annoyance.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm pretty sure that this 'shared files' situation contributes to vbUnit being unable to find the test suite class.  (...even though the test suite class is *not* shared.)  Saving and/or closing files sometimes fixes the problem.  Closing and restarting VB always fixes the problem.
        </li>
      </ul>
