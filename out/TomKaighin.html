        Tom Kaighin
      </h1>
      <p>
        Tom Kaighin is a somewhat strange (read 'normal') individual, with a penchant for speaking his mind, though it has been brought into question whether or not it is his 'right' mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        A pseudo-intellectual with a flair for the obtuse (read 'out of the loop and lovin' it!'). Remember; "Never argue with an insane individual in public; Passers-by may not be able to tell the difference!" - a paraphrased quote from I know not where!
