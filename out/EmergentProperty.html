        Emergent Property
      </h1>
      <p>
        How many properties does a geometric point have? One: its location. Not a lot.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say you have two geometric points. Now you have two properties, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        No: you have the points themselves <em>and the distance between them</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where does this "distance" come <em>from</em> if neither point has such a thing? It emerges from the <em>relationship</em> between the two points. It is an <strong>emergent property</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If, for each new point or unit, one must factor in the relation between that unit and each of the others, then the complexity of the system is O(n^2). If one must factor in the relation between the unit <em>and all the other emergent properties</em> (e.g.: packing a suitcase), then the potential complexity grows exponentially.
      </p>
      <p>
        The existence of emergent properties explains how such a complex world can be built from simple components, and related philosophical quandaries. It is the root cause of why the FallacyOfDivision is a <a href="LogicalFallacy.html">LogicalFallacy</a>. It is why water is wet, and why brains think without the requirement that there be a GhostInTheMachine.

        A point can be an <a href="EmergentProperty.html">EmergentProperty</a> of a Named Point, as can the connection between it and another point (not necessarily a straight line) and may also pass through other points connected together. The traversal may also have a name (trip), with each of the points and connections being properties. A property can itself have properties as is illustrated by all of the characteristics(properties) which exist in a font used by a computer, each of which may have properties. Objects may have properties, which can also have properties. -- <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a>.<a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20110922
