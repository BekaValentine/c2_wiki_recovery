      <p>
        In my travels I've noticed a troubling disease. At first I thought it was just the occasional isolated case, but now I'm worried that it's an epidemic. 
      </p>

           Yet another case of <a href="ObjectRelationalPsychologicalMismatch.html">ObjectRelationalPsychologicalMismatch</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've observed that a lot of people have the notion that a web application should be looked at as a contraption for generating SQL strings and then wrapping HTML around SQL result sets.

      </ul>
      <p>
        (This is in stark contrast to my perspective, that a database is a place where good objects go to rest when we don't need them, and that the fact that a database speaks SQL mainly influences how I optimize certain operations.)

        Symptoms include some or all of of the following:

        <li>
           lots of untyped strings and ints with semi-mystical values
        </li>
        <li>
           large amounts of hand-written SQL throughout the code base

        <li>
           a muddy object model
        </li>
        <li>
           an object model that doesn't map well to the business domain

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>. True story: in giving a series of tutorials on a <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a>-style web application framework, explaining the <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a>, how to configure the controller to invoke actions in response to specific request parameters, database interaction via a simplified <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> layer, and presentation generation, the most frequent questions is, "Where do I put my SQL?" -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What I do to avoid this is use a data-driven <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> framework. It's a lot easier than writing or maintaining SQL to do various queries, and it winds up making applications more flexible (for instance, by providing database independence). The one I use is the <a href="EnterpriseObjectsFramework.html">EnterpriseObjectsFramework</a> included with <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a>; it's 100% Java, and you don't have to use it with <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> if you'd rather use some other web application server. (<a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> is built on the <a href="EnterpriseObjectsFramework.html">EnterpriseObjectsFramework</a>, not the other way around.)
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the things that's great about the <a href="EnterpriseObjectsFramework.html">EnterpriseObjectsFramework</a> is that you can reverse-engineer an existing database into objects very easily. You point the graphical EOModeler tool at your database, select which tables and stored procedures you want to use in your object model, and it will build an object model for you automatically. Then you can customize it and start using it in your application quickly. -- <a href="ChrisHanson.html">ChrisHanson</a>

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>, too. We required from a subcontractor that an application had to have a distinct object-relational mapping layer. They said, sure, they did this every time anyway, and had a finished framework ready for that. Later, it turned out that their "framework" for "object-relational mapping" consisted of a class that took a sql query string, executed the query and converted the result set into a vector of String arrays - never mind whether a field was a number, a boolean or a date, everything ended up as Strings. These were then sent to the servlets / JSPs for processing and display (<%=d[i][5]%> etc.). After all, Strings are objects, right? So it must be an object-relational mapping, right? - It would be more funny for me if it wasn't true. -- <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        Amazing! I've seen the same thing as <a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a> talks about, except the <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a> was converted to a two dimensional String array.

        I guess this Pattern / <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> originated in the days of cgi-script web applications, where the database
        was the only place for data to persist between requests within an interactive session. If every piece of data with a lifetime of greater than one request had to get onto the database within the request that created it, it is easier to think of the data in SQL terms, rather than craft them into objects that would be mapped to SQL and destroyed within milliseconds anyway. -- <a href="AndrewMcGuinness.html">AndrewMcGuinness</a>

        I think there is an <a href="ObjectRelationalPsychologicalMismatch.html">ObjectRelationalPsychologicalMismatch</a> (philosophical divide) issue here. OO proponents tend to see SQL as a mere storage mechanism, but relational proponents see relational as a powerful tool that can simplify code and structure management, and thus not something to be merely "hidden away" but used to its fullest potential. If you <strong>only</strong> use <a href="RelationalDatabases.html">RelationalDatabases</a> as a storage mechanism, I can understand such a distaste for "naked" SQL. But I tend to side with the <a href="ChrisDate.html">ChrisDate</a> viewpoint on this one. OO proponents are making a mistake by pushing aside relational's potential and end up reinventing the database in their own application code without realizing that they are doing such. (I agree that SQL is not the ideal relational interface language though. But, still better than hand-coding DB features from scratch.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, in order to have "swappable vendor" database code, you would have to use a rather wimpy subset of RDBMS features, creating more code to do what the DB might otherwise do. Plus, the SQL standard is often not closely followed or leaves too many gray areas. The alternative is go with an open-source RDBMS or roll-your-own from scratch, which OO proponents seem fond of doing anyhow it appears to me and some other relational proponents.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        SQL text found in applications is mostly monotonous. See <a href="WhereAndAnd.html">WhereAndAnd</a>. So IMHO creating "vendor swappable" code is not a big issue.

      <hr/>
      <p>
        This problem is not limited to web applications. I have seen many VB applications that is also a contraption for generating SQL strings and then wrapping VB gui around SQL result sets. As the saying goes, you can write Fortran in any language, this kind of bad practice can be seen in any kind of system. Web apps are just the latest fad that attracted the newest batch of newbie programmers.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This problem may not be limited to web applications, but the issue mentioned above with objects being destroyed at the browser still exists and is a very strong factor in modern web app architecture decisions. Cookies and sessions are both unreliable on the browser. Is it any wonder we cling to the one data storage method over which we have the most control?
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, a well-designed relational database will take care of so much work for you. Maybe this is just laziness talking, but I trust an established database to police variable types more than my own code. Provided you don't <a href="ScatterSqlEverywhere.html">ScatterSqlEverywhere</a>, I see no problem in letting it do its job. See <a href="DatabaseIsSoftwareToo.html">DatabaseIsSoftwareToo</a>.

        I would like to see a semi-realistic example of why it is a bad practice. I have seen some cases where wrapping adds and updates may be prudent because most RDBMS don't allow updatable views. But beyond this, I don't see read-based queries a problem. The maintenance effort caused by wrapping is equal or greater than that of not wrapping it in my observation. SQL used to its full potential is too powerful to be wrapped by a "flat" API anyhow.
      </p>
      <p>
        One can make utilities to generate the repetitious parts of SQL (See <a href="HelpersInsteadOfWrappers.html">HelpersInsteadOfWrappers</a> for examples). This is automating the repetitous parts without trying completely push SQL into a closet. Another way of saying this is that <strong>automating repetition and hiding SQL are not necessarily the same thing</strong>.

        Ok, I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> as well. I would love to write code in a nice, totally non-coupled fashion. Unfortunately, I have to react to business need and I'm sure I would end up taking too long writing code in this fashion. Sometimes having totally decoupled code with processing engines, data engines and the like are function of institutions that have a tight relationship with an <a href="IvoryTower.html">IvoryTower</a> or a very large corporation. Let's face it the medium and small businesses of the world (most of them), don't have the resources for this kind of intellectual twiddling. With that said, I would like to say I would l love to be in a spot where I had the luxury how to do it TheRightWay. I don't believe this is a newbie or intellectual problem.

        I don't really agree with the overall premise of this page, but there are some legitimate concerns.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           lots of untyped strings and ints with semi-mystical values
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm not sure what an "untyped string" is, but I think the mention of integers probably refers to enumerated type codes in the database. One way of addressing this sort of thing is to accompany the schema with code that defines such things symbolically, and being consistent about using the symbolic names.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           large amounts of hand-written SQL throughout the code base
        </li>
        <li>
           lock-in to a particular database vendor and version
        </li>
        <li>
           an inability to change the schema because of the code

           an inability to change the code because of the schema
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are all legitimate concerns. Centralizing the definitions of non-trivial queries, sticking to standard SQL whenever possible, and having a flexible compatibility layer to hide details of the DBMS API all help here. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           extensive use of the database as a processing engine
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This, I don't see as a problem at all. For many processes, especially those involving large updates to the database, the DBMS can do things much more efficiently than application code can.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a muddy object model
        </li>
        <li>
           an object model that doesn't map well to the business domain
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These don't sound like problems with the use of SQL, unless it's perhaps an indirect consequence of trying to force the output of every query into an object.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           pain, misery, and woe

        That just sounds like a characteristic of programming large systems. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        Wrapping every database in business objects discourages the use of queries tailored to the immediate needs of the application, which in turn leads to gross inefficiencies. A pattern I've seen often, for instance, occurs if you have need to display a list of only a few columns of some business entity; loading each business object in order to display only a few attributes in each row can be terribly inefficient, especially if the business objects contain complex hierarchical structure that's not needed for this particular display. (Consider for instance bank account transactions with detail records, when you only want to display a summary list of check numbers, description, and total amount.)
      </p>
      <p>
        [That's an excellent point. Display shouldn't be considered business objects. Perhaps operations from the display are on business objects.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem isn't limited to display, that's just a common example. Any sort of batch process or "macro" process that might have to examine numerous records in the database will be up against the same problem. Yes, you could use business objects to encapsulate some of this, as they also often encapsulate basic loading and updating of their corresponding database entity. But eventually, you'll run into some process that relates to multiple business objects. Personally, I think that attempts to map the entire database schema to business objects causes more code organization headaches than it solves, and, as implied above, discourages use of the inherent flexibility of a relational database system.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, the inherent flexibility of SQL is what makes using it so difficult. When any statement can at any time, access and modify data, and you give up specific data structures for generic datastructures like resultsets, code becomes essentially weakly typed and data completely unprotected. Every time you write a new statement, you have to hope you aren't violating any business rules. With objects you know you aren't violating any business rules, they are all contained within the model. Trading Object.Name for Record["Name"], means giving up strong types, for those of us who like that. It means no longer having the compiler assist us when changing things around. It means resorting to hunting down field names with search instead of compile errors. IMHO, this leads to a lot of broken brittle code, it also leads to spending copious amounts of time chasing SQL statements just to find out what fields exist in the record you're working with. Using business objects, one can generate a base system to work with, and tune and optimize from there, you can always drop back to SQL when the need arises, and it always does. Starting with SQL on the other hand, forces one to start from scratch. I'd rather start with something and tune the slow parts, that start from nothing each time. It's not like using the object model forces one to give up SQL, it simply let's you only have to write the slow parts by hand, rather than all by hand.</em>

        I've been working as a DB designer for ~20 years now and on the way dabbled with OO (my favourite language being Smalltalk). This is mainly to try and overcome some of the difficulties people experience connecting OO with (relational) databases: nowadays mostly working with Java/JDBC. There are a lot of interesting issues involved but the above comments about SQL are both true and a little unfair. SQL is a flexible language precisely because, as Hugh Darwen states, a database is a set of axioms (the data asserted as tuples in a relation [translation: rows in a table]). The result of a query is a theorem (new data derived from the orignal facts/axioms/data). The process of deriving the theorem is a proof (we can prove a piece of SQL correct because it is based on relational calculus/algebra).
        Now, would you want your mathematical theorem generator to be inflexible? How would that limit you to what you could prove correct?
        In practise, not many people bother to prove things, but the point is that RDBMS's are based on a sound mathematical footing and hence one <strong>could</strong> prove things if you wanted to. -- PaulHorth
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"...code becomes essentially weakly typed and data completely unprotected. Every time you write a new statement, you have to hope you aren't violating any business rules."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you're using an industrial-strength DBMS, you put the database constraints <em>in the database</em>, where they will be checked regardless of who accesses the database from where. This ability is fundamental to relational databases, for exactly the reasons you cite. Many database constraints can be easily expressed declaratively. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree, but find that most business rules can't be enforced with simple constraints. Most rules aren't simple validation, they are far more complex and the business objects make them easy to express. So I stand by my original statement, you basically have to hope you aren't violating rules when you allow sql instead of business objects.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, as a database is a set of axioms (see above), I would like to ensure they are correct and not inconsistent before I use them. At least with SQL, being based on relational calculus/algebra, can be <strong>'proven</strong> to be correct. In the DB I use (Oracle) complex constraints can be enforced. I like to stick constraints that are company/system wide in the DB. Application-level constraints should go in the application layer. -- PaulHorth
      </p>
      <p>
        If you rely on business objects to enforce all the rules, then you will have a very hard time indeed when you have to "start tuning the hard parts" - you'll have to heavily refactor your validation code to decouple it from the business objects, or you'll have to replicate a lot of validation in different forms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I use the database for simple validation that constraints can handle, but a system which works and is slow is far better than a system that doesn't work at all, and I find most SQL approaches are so riddles with bugs and violations of the rules that I consider them not working sufficiently, it doesn't matter how fast they are.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My experiences have been colored by working on a proprietary system that uses such an object-based approach. I've been "tuning" this system for several years.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sympathetic to many of the concerns cited, though. I also preferred - vehemently - static type checking several years ago. I'm very concerned about maintainability and vendor lock-in. However, what we have done, and it seems to be serving us relatively well, is to add a heavy dose of unit tests to the system, along with centralizing the definition of non-trivial queries so that it's easy to automate many of the unit tests. In addition, we have our own <a href="DatabaseAbstractionLayer.html">DatabaseAbstractionLayer</a> that isolates us from SQL dialectic differences -- but this was admittedly an expensive architecture to create, and the write path through this layer is only rudimentary at the moment, although the read path is working very well. For writing data, we currently do still rely on the business objects, where all of our data validation is encapsulated. (We're <em>not</em> using a very capable DBMS at the moment, although we hope to address this problem soon. We're using MS Jet, via DAO. You may laugh at me now, I won't be offended. Jet's numerous SQL idiosyncrasies are a major source of headaches for our abstraction layer, which generates SQL from relational expressions. The good news is that once I determine a workaround for a problem, nobody else has to worry about it again.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I won't laugh, databases are a pain for most of us, and I know sql quite well. Knowing sql has little to do with the problems in using it. I've even considered not using objects and unit-testing every single procedure as an alternative method, I'm still on the fence. I like how fun and easy programming is with objects. I like pretending I simply have unlimited memory and no database. As a language, I think SQL sucks, it has little in abstraction capabilities and makes reuse a pain, maybe one day I'll find an approach I like on all fronts, until then, I'll take objects.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You may know SQL, but knowing it and knowing why RDBMSs are important and how to design a proper relational model and how to interface with objects and how to optimise it are two different things. Too many people spend a lot of effort trying to tie OO and DB together when nowadays it is probably cheaper for most medium to large scale projects to buy in (or get for free) a third-party tool like <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> or Hibernate to do the ORM mapping. -- PaulHorth
      </p>
      <p>
        Maintenance of references to database names (tables and fields) is definitely an issue, and it would be nice to have the compiler warn you about invalid references. However, searching for these names does not have to be so difficult, especially if you use a simple trick. Use your <a href="DatabaseAbstractionLayer.html">DatabaseAbstractionLayer</a> to enforce a uniform syntax for referring to them. For instance a small class named "fld" could be used to represent field names, so all field references appear as fld("FOO"). Now a simple regexp such as "\bfld\s*\(\s*"FOO"\s*\)" (Perl-style) can reliably find all references to field FOO, outside of SQL.

        If you leave performance tuning to the end, in many applications it will end up consuming a huge amount of effort. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree. I find it's quite easy to trace the database, find the most repetitive hits, and combine them, cache them, or write a proc to replace them. Few parts of an application really need that much effort, at least imho.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep telling our application-level programmers the same thing: retrieve only what you need from the database. This is the single most important guideline for performance when using a database, and following it 
        requires bypassing business objects. Our small group of DB experts spend a lot of time rewriting application code to fix performance problems, but with decent schema documentation and well-designed schema, it should rarely require an expert to do this right in the first place.

        To you fans of heavily wrapping the DB behind API's and methods, I am curious about something. Would you still recommend it <strong>if the </strong><a href="RelationalLanguage.html">RelationalLanguage</a> was consistent across vendors<strong>? If so, why? I am trying to figure out if it is the differences in vendor implementations that you are trying to protect from, or just the strings and their lack of compile-time checking, or being that it is a different paradigm than your favorite language? -- top</strong>

        <em>It's because it's strings. Even with a single perfect implementation, it'll get wrapped. Consider that the OO wrapper is likely to be an interpreter pattern that takes an abstract syntax tree of objects and creates sql out of it, the point of which is to make the sql operators into language elements rather than strings. I'd rather have to type ...</em>

      </p>
      <code>
        "'value'='"+aVar+"' or 'another value'='"+aVar+"'";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>the object version is structured, and can be manipulated, changed, and can be translated directly to equivalent sql. It's just our way of making SQL native to the language. Strings suck.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But less than the alternative. I have not seen any SQL wrapper language that is simple, uncluttered and flexible. Sometimes there are patterns such as <a href="WhereAndAnd.html">WhereAndAnd</a> that one can take advantage of, but if something more complex comes along you may end up with a <a href="DiscontinuitySpike.html">DiscontinuitySpike</a> (have to rework the whole thing). Thus, I keep such wrappers light-duty so that they are easy to abandon if more complex SQL expressions are needed. They might resemble something such as:
      </p>
      <code>
        appendAndClause(clauseName, varName, value, validationOptions)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This simply adds an expression to a criteria clause (string). If simple appending no longer works, then I don't use such anymore and work with more direct strings. This way one can take advantage of patterns in SQL expressions, but resort to raw strings if/when needed without having to use wrappers for every other expression. Your approach seems all-or-nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Boolean expressions in general don't convert to OOP API's very well.

        To answer top's questions from my own perspective, here were some of my motivations for creating a relational API wrapper for SQL:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Portability among vendor implementations. (So, yes, this was a motivation. But not the only one.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>You need more than just simple expression wrappers. Translating the differences between vendors is not always a one-to-one translation or swap.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Well, duh. Hence the next point.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Relational correctness. People get lost in the dark corners of SQL; I find it easier to use and to teach a more consistent relational algebra.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Huh? You created a new relational language that is translated back to SQL at run-time?</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Basically, yes. A C++ API modelled on the semantics of Date & Darwen's <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>, <strong>not</strong> on SQL. D&D did all the heavy theoretical lifting; I plucked out the ideas that seemed most feasible and usefule, then figured out how to map them automatically to SQL.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Ease of use.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Working in C++, I was able to create an API that was at least as easy to use as common SQL-based APIs. (Certainly less verbose to use than the examples above involving explicit "new" operations.) My original intention was also to have compile-time typing and name checking, but I lacked the time to create the tools to facilitate this, and people on the project had concerns regarding compile-time coupling overhead. We ended up with a dynamic API, which has advantages and disadvantages. Unit tests made up for some of the latter.
            </li>
            <li>
               Simplified concurrency models. We stuck to conservative, strong transaction modes, which are easily modelled in the API and easy to use, since there is less opportunity for concurrency programming errors. Our application serves small numbers of users at a time, however, so I'm not certain how well this would scale.
            </li>

               <em>Sounds like you are trying to create/emulate a whole damned database. I am surprised your boss lets you do such. Things must be slow there.</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   It was more work than expected, but it falls far, far short of writing an entire database system. No need to deal with implementing all the dirty details of storage and atomicity, for instance -- that's all still left to the underlying DBMS.

        What's wrong with pushing computation onto the db? Unless I can use domain specific knowledge to short circuit some of the computation, the optimized db routines are likely to be a lot more performant than what I would otherwise write. Yes. working with strings is a pain in the ass.. but given that the industry seems to have standardized on p_programs_ expressed as strings (at least at the programmer level) I'm hard pressed to see the disadvantage, in practice...

        I'd say that this entry also points to it's corollary, especially talk about getting developers to think about things in the 'right' - i.e. OO - way. 
        This doesn't encourage developers to consider alternative approaches, but in my experience swap from one default pattern to another. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I work with a team of programmers and designers with many years experience, but most of it OO (while my programming is mostly server-side). They have translated the rule 'database access is expensive' - to become variously 'databases aren't performant' and 'to avoid going to the database, get as much information as possible every time you do'. Our default pattern for web search screens is to go off, query every possible result (possible hundreds of rows) back from the database to the Java layer, then let the user navigate through the record set a page at a time. Given that in 95% of cases the result to user wants is on the first result page, this is a complete waste of time.
        Of course, the second we want to make the application allow, say, flexible reordering or filtering of the results on the page, then it's NOT a waste of time.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This isn't specifically an OO/relational thing - it would be perfectly possible to have defined things all the way through to get the Top 5, but in my experience it does stem from a combination of always wanting to use the same approach, rather than thinking what is the most appropriate approach, and secondly an ignorance about databases - i.e. how to write an efficient query to get the nth page of data from a set in a stateless system - or even knowing that you can. Lack of knowledge of what your tools offer is the biggest cause of re-inventing the wheel and inappropriate decision making. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, doing an efficient nth page query might be something your framework or O-R mapping tool provides, but as with any framework, how it operates should be something you understand. A framework should be a tool  to save writing repetitive code, rather than a tool you use to avoid understanding 'what lies beneath'. It's good to know that doing operation X might be badly performing, but it's better to know that it's actually causing the server to page 6 Gb of virtual memory, not just waiting to lock a row - it gives a sense of perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        For hand-tuned SQL (i.e. queries, multi-row updates) I recommend storing it on the database - where views won't do, most implementations of SQL support functions / procedures that can accept bind parameters and either return result sets or pointers to result sets. This allows responsibility for SQL performance to be passed off to a smaller expert team / individual, who may not even know the target language. It also allows the same query to be shared across multiple languages (useful if you need to provide .NET and Java interfaces into the same system), or the same query to be tuned for different RDBMS versions (more useful), or even RDBMS (currently difficult due to variation in implementation).
      </p>
      <p>
        I still think most of the problem is with Java's static typing (it's a Static/Dynamic conceptual split as much as Object/Relational). Ideally you want something that can automatically extend classes when the database structure is changed (or deprecate on column or table removal) - the sort of syntax that makes Oracle's PL/SQL a very concise language - you can define a collection of %ROWTYPE, fetch into it, and iterate through it, without having to know anything about the underlying table structure.

        My solution would be to make app languages more like SQL (or a better query language), not SQL more like OOP.

        Most OOP shops make the so-called <a href="FirstGreatBlunder.html">FirstGreatBlunder</a>, and this creates many of the mismatch problems. I am approaching this from the perspective that I am one of many developers, probably with zilch rank, and that I likely could not change the practice of <a href="FirstGreatBlunder.html">FirstGreatBlunder</a>. Thus, my statement is essentially correct in such an environment.

           Technically you may be correct because with enough indirection everything is everything. One can write a Fortran compiler in Cobol, and a Cobol compiler in Fortran, etc. However, that says little about the practical benefits of doing things a certain way. We appear to be running into the same kind of "idealism wall" we had in the bags-versus-sets battles where I approach it from what an "average" developer faces in terms of the work environment and jurisdiction/control versus what "could be" if the whole world was overhauled and rebooted. Being technically correct does not make you "practically" correct. If you want to claim a technical victory, be my guest. However, that won't change the reality of available choices of developers in the trenches who may not be able to change certain practices in an org. This wiki should welcome both perspectives. Ward never claimed it was a theory-only wiki.  -t

           Where does the "huh" start? One can "bend" OOP to have features of relational and vice verse with enough programming such that technically they can each gain features of the others.

        I'm also skeptical that <a href="DateAndDarwensTypeSystem.html">DateAndDarwensTypeSystem</a> would be practical, but that's secondary.

      <p>
        <em>Depending on your definition of "successful" and "production", yes:  The </em><a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> is the first successful implementation of the majority of the version 3 specification, though Alphora's Dataphor was apparently strongly influenced by an earlier version.  The professional DBAs to whom it has been demonstrated have applauded it for eliminating accidental erroneous joins between unrelated types (e.g., invoice number joined to customer number) and for trivially handling multiple units in a single type. E.g., a LENGTH type can handle both metres and feet, or a TEMPERATURE type that can represent Fahrenheit, Kelvin, and Celsius.  Programmers to whom it has been demonstrated have applauded it for supporting <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> and workable specialisation by constraint.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't mean implementation of a language that supplies the concepts, but rather a production domain application built with such a language. That's where most of the complaints about <a href="PerniciousIngrownSql.html">PerniciousIngrownSql</a> come from.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am aware of two such applications.  One is used for birdwatching.  The other was part of an evaluation comparing </em><a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> to SQL done by one of my students, based on a real-world scenario I supplied.  In the latter, <a href="DateAndDarwensTypeSystem.html">DateAndDarwensTypeSystem</a> worked effectively and resulted in an implementation that was subjectively considerably more readable (hence, more easily maintained and perhaps less likely to result in user/developer error) than the SQL equivalent.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as joining invoice number to customer number, those kinds of bugs are usually caught early in testing of an app. It's "almost right" implementations that tend to cause the biggest bugs. I suppose it could be useful for ad-hoc querying for one-off requests, although it would have to be weighed against the "bloat" of most type systems. Further, a built-in natural join mechanism or "common join catalog" (<a href="AlternativesToNaturalJoins.html">AlternativesToNaturalJoins</a>) could also prevent problem joins.

        But how is customized column types related to breaking encapsulation? It's not really a problem at the column-level.

           Nothing is 100% encapsulated because one can break into the disk or RAM cabinet and sample raw bits directly in the chips/wires. Encapsulation is a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>, but never absolute (barring some new encryption technology). It's <strong>relative</strong> to a given perspective. Similarly, we may use a certain abstraction layer in say 95% of our application, but go around it 5% of the time for say performance reasons. In <a href="HelpersInsteadOfWrappers.html">HelpersInsteadOfWrappers</a>, it's also suggested that the repetitious grunty parts of interacting with SQL, HTML, and other sub-languages can be wrapped via API's, but without the expectation that we are always hiding it away. -t
