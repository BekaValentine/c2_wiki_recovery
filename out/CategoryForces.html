        Sometimes when we look for patterns, we actually find <a href="PatternComponent.html">PatternComponent</a>s.These traditionally include the context, the forces that recur within that context, and conflicts between the forces, as well as the pattern that keeps the forces in balance.

        This is a category which illustrates the abstraction we call forces. These are usually described as inevitable influences upon an object or process which shape the SolutionSpace. It is the understanding of the forces acting upon the object or process that will clarify the bounds in which we work.
