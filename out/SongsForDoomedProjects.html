      </h1>

Be heard singing (or humming) the following tunes at appropriate times at work, and your teammates will enjoy a knowing chuckle.

        Doomed projects frequently become a <a href="DeathMarch.html">DeathMarch</a>, where lots of overtime becomes a fact of life.  Great tunes for this situation include:

        Doomed projects (usually) will eventually come to an end (though some are known to run forever in shops with bad management that isn't willing to cut their losses).  Invariably, there will be a post-mortem, where management attempts to assign blame.  A heady dose of optimism can help; to cheer the team up and point out that not <em>all</em> was lost (we <em>did</em> learn something--hopefully), the following refrain can be used:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Grow the Roses" from ChittyChittyBangBang.  The last line of the refrain sums it up nicely:  "From the ashes of disaster grow the roses of success"
        </li>
      </ul>
