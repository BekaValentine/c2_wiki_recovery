        Tim Sort Simplified
      </h1>
      <p>
        I don't understand <a href="TimSort.html">TimSort</a> fully.  It has a lot of optimisations that make it fast, but hard to understand from source code alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page, however, contains my interpretation of the basic operating principal in <a href="TimSort.html">TimSort</a>, which is <em>find ordered runs, and merge them</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        EDIT:  This algorithm actually came before <a href="TimSort.html">TimSort</a>, which is an improvement on it.

        Notes:
        - Run-finding can be done in-place, but that requires mucking about with mutability, and I wanted to show the strategy, rather than implementation details. In essence, you would record the start and end of all runs, as in timsort.  This has O(N) space complexity, O(1) extra space if you can record said times in a bitset, like <a href="SmoothSort.html">SmoothSort</a>.  Also like timsort, performs faster the more ordered the input is.  However, it's easier to understand than <a href="TimSort.html">TimSort</a>, as it never uses insertion sort, and thus probably won't work well for small runs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Worst-case time complexity:  O(n log n), same as mergesort.  However, the merge phase will start with sub-lists of length two, so it could be slightly faster, as it won't recur quite as deeply.  On the other hand, if comparison is expensive, this will do O(n) comparisons, and <em>then</em> merge the sublists.
      </p>
      <p>
        Best-case time complexity:  O(n), when there's only one run. Average-case time complexity:  I have no idea.  Somewhere between O(n) and O(n log n), I'd assume.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Depends strongly on the average type of input you're giving it, I expect.</strong>
