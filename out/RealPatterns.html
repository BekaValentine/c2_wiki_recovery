        Real Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RealPatterns.html">RealPatterns</a> is the title of a paper by the philosopher <a href="DanielDennett.html">DanielDennett</a>. It was originally published in 1991 in the JournalOfPhilosophy (vol. 88, pages 27-51). The paper was reprinted in Dennett's <em>Brainchildren. Essays on Designing Minds</em> (MIT Press 1998).

        What's it all about?
      </p>

        As I haven't found the time for months now to write a decent summary, here's just a tiny bit: The paper is not about software patterns or patterns in the Alexandrian sense, rather it is concerned with the ontological status ("is something real") of mental states: Are beliefs and desires <em>real</em>? And what does that mean?

      <p>
        To make his point that beliefs are just as real as centers of gravity or calculators and other stuff, Dennett draws heavily on patterns in Conway's <a href="GameOfLife.html">GameOfLife</a>.
