        Autumn 2012: Have been working with Disney in Seattle for a year, going to Software Craftsmanship meet-ups, studying Scala at Coursera and trying out remote discussion groups via Google Hangout.
      </p>

        Previous point of interest: had a sticker from <a href="http://arxta.net">http://arxta.net</a> on my laptop.  Artisanal Retro-Futurism X Team-Scale Anarcho-Syndicalism.  (No, it's not about mining the Moon for cheese...it's "back to the future" with Agile development).

        From August 2005 through July 2011... trying to bring agility to Google with limited success.  Following other agilistas on Twitter.
      </p>

        Worked at Plumtree Software in SF from February 2003-Aug 2005 on cross-platform single-source development.

        I enjoyed the <a href="AgileDevelopmentConference.html">AgileDevelopmentConference</a> July 2003 in Salt Lake City.  Maybe I'll be back for 2010?
      </p>
      <p>
        I had a good trip to XP2001 (<a href="http://www.xp2001.org)">http://www.xp2001.org)</a> in Sardinia.  Anyone else? 
        Regrettably my pictures didn't come out.
      </p>
      <p>
        Found c2.com's <a href="WikiSpace.html">WikiSpace</a> via a set of contacts at 1998's LinuxWorld conference,
        and thence to the <a href="SiliconValleyPatternsGroup.html">SiliconValleyPatternsGroup</a>.  Known there as a note taker and 
        sometime artist. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I first ran across <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>'s A <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> on the bookcase 
        of a summer sublet, and had no idea that it had been adopted by software designers.

        Summer 2001 - 2002. Contracting part-time.
        April 2001 - At Sendmail Inc. until a layoff.

        From 7/2000 to 2/2001, working in an <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> team as a Java servlet developer at <a href="EvantSolutions.html">EvantSolutions</a> in SF.  Loved it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previous to that, as a Java servlet developer at TimeDance [<a href="http://www.timedance.com]">http://www.timedance.com]</a> (RIP) in <a href="SiliconValley.html">SiliconValley</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Before that, for 2 years as as an Internet firewall specialist in San Francisco.

        Since my dad programs the accelerator at Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
        (his 2nd career after high energy physics), that makes me a <a href="SecondGenerationProgrammer.html">SecondGenerationProgrammer</a>.  I might be among the last of the 
        <a href="PunchCardGeneration.html">PunchCardGeneration</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I might be a <a href="GentlePersonAfflictedWithPeculiarNotions.html">GentlePersonAfflictedWithPeculiarNotions</a> like <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> if I 
        had someone to conspire with.

        Wiki looks cute, but strange, in the Scamper browser in <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>.  Now if I could only figure out where the Back button was...

        Thanks for your contributions to the hangout - I would like to be there every week, but a busy schedule prevents it.
