        Computer Definition
      </h1>
      <p>
        On <a href="DifferenceEngine.html">DifferenceEngine</a>, someone defined a computer as something that can "run stored programs that had conditional logic and iteration."
      </p>
      <p>
        A different way to word that might be that a computer can:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Run code
        </li>
        <li>
           Run code repeatedly (iteration)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Not</em> run code (conditionality)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Does anyone know of the source for this?  Does anyone know why this is considered the definition?  One can imagine being able to build higher-level things like functions from these three primitives.  It might be interesting to see a more formal treatment of this definition.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you're the kind of person who is attracted by the abstract and theotretical, a computer is often defined as an machine which can solve any problem solvable by a <a href="UniversalTuringMachine.html">UniversalTuringMachine</a>.  This definition arose out of <a href="AlanTuring.html">AlanTuring</a> and <a href="AlonzoChurch.html">AlonzoChurch</a> 's formal definition of an Algorithm, and what kind of problems are Computable as opposed to notComputable.
