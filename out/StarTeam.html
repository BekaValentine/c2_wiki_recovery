        Cruise control .NET was deployed against a .NET enterprise application with MS SQL back end. Cruise control completed 4000 builds over a 9 month period, with a 9 person development a 3 person QA team. Once the vagaries of the command line compiler switches were worked out and the directory setup done, the installation was straight forward.

        A direct savings of 10-20 hours per week in "Integration" work was achieved with this excellent utility.

        Starteam is an excellent integrated defect, workflow, and CM system, I'd highly recommend it for medium to large projects where CVS is too slow, bugzilla too painful, or VSS is crashing.

        I've used <a href="StarTeam.html">StarTeam</a> as streight-up source control. It worked OK until I had to move files.
