        Punch Card Generation
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="PunchCardGeneration.html">PunchCardGeneration</a> are people who remember submitting a program on a deck of punched cards. I did that when I went to work in 1969. I still have a small number of blank cards in my desk drawer and show them to the current generation of students, who don't know what they are. They have not seen a <a href="SlideRule.html">SlideRule</a> either. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
