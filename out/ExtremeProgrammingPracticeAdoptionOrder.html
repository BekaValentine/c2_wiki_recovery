        Extreme Programming Practice Adoption Order
      </h1>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Is there an optimal order in which to adopt Extreme Programming practices?
        </li>
        <li>
           Are there practices that work out better if other practices are previously adopted?
        </li>

        Could you expand on this relationship?  I just don't see it.

        There are really two different questions here.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What is the best order to propose practices to an organization isn't aware of, or receptive to XP as a whole?
        </li>
        <li>
           What is the best order to implement the practices for an organization that is eager to try out XP?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the first case, <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> would be the last (or among the last) practices that I would suggest.  In the second case, these would be among the first.
      </p>
      <p>
        In either case, <a href="CollectiveCodeOwnership.html">CollectiveCodeOwnership</a> and <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s would top my list for practices to start early.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It would seem to me that <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s are the core to anything and should be the first practice adopted, especially with existing code.
      </p>

        It really depends on your situation, amount of legacy code, schedule, etc.  For projects already underway, the business/development interaction practices make an ideal starting point.  The programmers need to get practice pairing and estimating, and they have to make sure that their build situation is under control.  After that, you need to know what you are delivering and that you aren't breaking things (testing), then you can concentrate on being terrifyingly effective in code.  People doing greenfield have more possibilities.  -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>
