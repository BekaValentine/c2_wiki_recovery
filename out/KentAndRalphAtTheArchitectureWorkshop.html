        Kent And Ralph At The Architecture Workshop
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> arrived late at <a href="BruceAnderson.html">BruceAnderson</a>'s first
        <a href="ArchitectureHandbookWorkshop.html">ArchitectureHandbookWorkshop</a> at OOPSLA'91.
        He had spent the morning giving a
        tutorial on frameworks, so he wasn't sure what was
        happening.  The group had spent the morning writing
        a table of contents for the Architecture Handbook,
        and conflicting visions of the future were in the air.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s vision of the future was patterns.  When
        Bruce told the group to work in pairs to write a entry
        for the Architecture Handbook, Kent grabbed Ralph and
        said "I've always wanted to write a set of patterns for
        using <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a>.  Let's do it!"  Ralph agreed.  Kent was
        happy to have such a compliant team.  They spent
        an hour or so writing down 8 or 9 patterns for using
        <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a>, and then coerced <a href="NormKerth.html">NormKerth</a> into acting as their
        test subject.  They taught him the patterns, and then 
        when it came time to present their entry to the group,
        they had Norm show it off by designing a dataflow diagram 
        editor, in real-time and unrehearsed.  Both Ralph and
        Kent thought it was a fabulous success.

        A month later, Ralph looked at the patterns and thought
        they looked bare and feeble.  Nobody would understand them
        unless they were better explained.  He couldn't understand
        why he had been so excited a month before, but trusting the
        memory of his enthusiasm, he fleshed out the few lines into
        a few pages, and started circulating them, first to his
        students and then to the <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a> mailing list.  He tried to
        get Kent's attention (though probably not hard enough), but
        Kent seemed to be busy with other things.  As he got feedback
        and added examples, the paper grew longer.  Eventually
        he submitted it to OOPSLA, and the result was
        <a href="DocumentingFrameworksWithPatterns.html">DocumentingFrameworksWithPatterns</a>.
        A year or so after that he learned that Kent would have
        liked to have been a coauthor, and he felt bad that he
        had been so rude.  This didn't permanently damage their
        friendship, as can be seen by <a href="PatternsGenerateArchitectures.html">PatternsGenerateArchitectures</a>.
