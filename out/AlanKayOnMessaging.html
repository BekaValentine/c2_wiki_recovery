        Just a gentle reminder that I took some pains at the last OOPSLA to try to<br/>
        remind everyone that Smalltalk is not only NOT its syntax or the class<br/>
        library, it is not even about classes. I'm sorry that I long ago coined the<br/>
        term "objects" for this topic because it gets many people to focus on the<br/>
        lesser idea.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The big idea is "messaging" - that is what the kernal of Smalltalk/Squeak<br/>
        is all about (and it's something that was never quite completed in our<br/>
        Xerox PARC phase). The Japanese have a small word - ma - for "that which<br/>
        is in between" - perhaps the nearest English equivalent is "interstitial".<br/>
        The key in making great and growable systems is much more to design how its<br/>
        modules communicate rather than what their internal properties and<br/>
        behaviors should be. Think of the internet - to live, it (a) has to allow<br/>
        many different kinds of ideas and realizations that are beyond any single<br/>
        standard and (b) to allow varying degrees of safe interoperability between<br/>
        these ideas.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        If you focus on just messaging - and realize that a good metasystem can<br/>
        late bind the various 2nd level architectures used in objects - then much<br/>
        of the language-, UI-, and OS based discussions on this thread are really<br/>
        quite moot. This was why I complained at the last OOPSLA that - whereas at<br/>
        PARC we changed Smalltalk constantly, treating it always as a work in<br/>
        progress - when ST hit the larger world, it was pretty much taken as<br/>
        "something just to be learned", as though it were Pascal or Algol.<br/>
        Smalltalk-80 never really was mutated into the next better versions of OOP.<br/>
        Given the current low state of programming in general, I think this is a<br/>
        real mistake.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I think I recall also pointing out that it is vitally important not just to<br/>
        have a complete metasystem, but to have fences that help guard the crossing<br/>
        of metaboundaries. One of the simplest of these was one of the motivations<br/>
        for my original excursions in the late sixties: the realization that<br/>
        assignments are a metalevel change from functions, and therefore should not<br/>
        be dealt with at the same level - this was one of the motivations to<br/>
        encapsulate these kinds of state changes, and not let them be done willy<br/>
        nilly. I would say that a system that allowed other metathings to be done<br/>
        in the ordinary course of programming (like changing what inheritance<br/>
        means, or what is an instance) is a bad design. (I believe that systems<br/>
        should allow these things, but the design should be such that there are<br/>
        clear fences that have to be crossed when serious extensions are made.)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I would suggest that more progress could be made if the smart and talented<br/>
        Squeak list would think more about what the next step in metaprogramming<br/>
        should be - how can we get great power, parsimony, AND security of meaning?<br/>
