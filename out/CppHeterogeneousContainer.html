        Cpp Heterogeneous Container

      <p>
        See <a href="GenericsVsSubtyping.html">GenericsVsSubtyping</a> for the origins of this, where there is a discussion of <a href="HeterogeneousContainer.html">HeterogeneousContainer</a>s and <a href="HomogeneousContainer.html">HomogeneousContainer</a>s, which invited the discussion of <a href="HeterogeneousContainer.html">HeterogeneousContainer</a>s in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.

      <p>
        Here are two possible ways of organising this.  There may be more.
      </p>
      <p>
        One is to build a container which can contain different types of object but with designated types of object in each position. This can be implemented using the <a href="BoostTupleLibrary.html">BoostTupleLibrary</a>, or <a href="BoostFusion.html">BoostFusion</a> which also has tuples optionally with the <a href="BoostFusionUserExtension.html">BoostFusionUserExtension</a>. It also has a powerful set of macros which make it very easy to set up a container with access using user defined keys.
      </p>
      <p>
        The second is to have a container which contains objects of all the same type, but which are capable of holding data of different types. Strictly speaking this is a <a href="HomogeneousContainer.html">HomogeneousContainer</a> of MutableTypeObjects, such as those provided by <a href="BoostAny.html">BoostAny</a>, but the effect is more flexible than the first type.
