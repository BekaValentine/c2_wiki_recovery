        Wards Wiki Tenth Anniversary
      </h1>
      <p>
        March 25th, 2005 will be the 10th anniversary of Ward Cunningham's wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hopefully he can get his new wiki administration system in place by then.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tomorrow is the day!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Tomorrow is here. And tomorrow never dies.</em>

        Strange, looks like someone vandalized <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> undetected.  All of the 1995 dates were changed to 1994.  Anyone have an offline copy to restore from? It has already dropped out of <a href="PageHistory.html">PageHistory</a>.  -- <a href="MichaelSparks.html">MichaelSparks</a>

        <em>I have a backup from a year ago, but it's appearance suggests </em><a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> has not been changed in the way you describe. Where would you like it to be put, Michael?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, this is confusing.  
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Pattern_Repository">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portland_Pattern_Repository</a> indicates <strong>3/25/1995</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wiki</a> also indicates <strong>3/25/1995</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> in its current form indicates <strong>3/25/1994</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20031213120340/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory">http://web.archive.org/web/20031213120340/http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?WikiHistory</a> shows that previously, <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> said <strong>3/25/1995</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/mail-history.txt">http://c2.com/wiki/mail-history.txt</a> (probably the most authoritative source) shows that it started around <strong>3/16/2005</strong>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Looks like the consensus is on 1995, but the day of the month is unclear. The email dump in <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/mail-history.txt">http://c2.com/wiki/mail-history.txt</a> shows that Ward was just getting c2.com itself up and running in 11/94, so any document that claims wiki started before that is clearly wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if wiki started on 3/25/1994, then we wouldn't be celebrating its 10th anniversary this year - it would be the 11th anniversary.

        <em>I have an early backup (from October 2001) which starts "This is the first ever wiki site, founded in 1994", but "1994" was changed to "1995" by May 2002.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you are right, someone must have celebrated 10th year last year, press or here

      </ul>

        From mail-history.txt, there is an email dated "March 16, 1995 11:06AM".  In it, Ward writes:

        <dd>"Steve -- I've put up a new database on my web server and I'd like you to take a look.  It's a web of people, projects and patterns accessed through a cgi-bin script.  It has a forms based authoring capability that doesn't require familiarity with html.  I'd be very pleased if you would get on and at least enter your name in <a href="RecentVisitors.html">RecentVisitors</a>. I'm asking you because I think you might also add some interesting content.  I'm going to advertise this a little more widely in a week or so.  The URL is <a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki.">http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki.</a>  Thanks and best regards. -- Ward"</dd>

        This is just a text file on the web server, not a wiki page, so it should be immune to vandalism. The date here is trustworthy. This email was sent 03/16/1995, and Ward says that he will be advertising it further in "a week or so". I'm guessing that week or so was about 9 days, which leads to the 03/25/1995 date. Sounds pretty conclusive to me... anyone disagree?

        <em>The 03/25/1995 date seems to come from </em><a href="VisitorsInNinetyFive.html">VisitorsInNinetyFive</a>.<em></em>

        For what it's worth, archive.org first spidered <a href="http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki">http://c2.com/cgi-bin/wiki</a> in Nov 1996; if you want to check old (but not oldest) copies of certain pages, you might find something interesting. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's true, but the Nov 1996 archives seem to be inaccessible.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I know, I tried first; but archive.org servers go up and down all the time, that's not necessarily a permanent error. There are thousands of servers, and it's unpredictable whether a given page will be on a given server. They are frequently upgraded, they frequently crash...it's an interesting setup.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, although the oldest pages that archive.org might be most helpful, it's still possible that some certain e.g. 1998 version of some page might also be useful as a comparison. And given the above, there's no particular reason to think that it, too, would simultaneously be off line. Might or might not be. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Certainly, the January 5, 1998 version of </em><a href="PastVisitors.html">PastVisitors</a> also contains the March 25, 1995 date.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've fixed the page - if everyone would review the change, that would be good.  -- <a href="MichaelSparks.html">MichaelSparks</a>

        Happy tenth anniversary, everyone.

        Which of the <a href="VisitorsInNinetyFive.html">VisitorsInNinetyFive</a> are still active?

        Let's celebrate by starting a giant threadmode Mother of all Flame/troll-wars. Seriously, congratulations and well done!

        And now we're coming up on the twentieth anniversary in a few months. I just happened to notice, as I was directing a programmer to it for their first time. Seems like some celebration is warranted :)
