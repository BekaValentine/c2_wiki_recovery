        I am perpetual (more iterative than incremental) student at the GeorgiaInstituteOfTechnology.  Whenever I get motivated, I sign up for every class offered during a given session.  I have earned, over the course of my life time, every degree offered (I think - it's tough to keep up) by GIT. It's been a blast, but my memory isn't what it used to be.  Can anyone else contribute factual information about my life?
