        Distributed Denial Of Service
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="DistributedDenialOfService.html">DistributedDenialOfService</a> (DDoS) attack is a <a href="DenialOfService.html">DenialOfService</a> attack originating from multiple computers acting in concert. The computers can be acting either wittingly, or unwittingly.  There have been many instances of crackers compromising a system and using it in a DDoS attack against another system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically done to increase the "bandwidth" available for a <a href="DenialOfService.html">DenialOfService</a> attack.  A cracker who's got a 768K DSL line isn't going to be able to take down Google.  Several thousand computers, each with 768K DSL lines can likely deny service.  Given a large enough number of nodes in a DDoS attack, any site can be brought to its knees.

        Also done to disguise the origins of an attack.
