        How Could We Drastically Improve The Patterns Literature
      </h1>
      <p>
        We have a <a href="PatternOfBabel.html">PatternOfBabel</a>.  How do we fix it?  
      </p>
      <p>
        On <a href="PatternOfBabel.html">PatternOfBabel</a>, I agree with what <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> said about the problem of the "consensus" approach.  Years ago I started the <a href="GreatBooksList.html">GreatBooksList</a>.  When someone added CorbaDesignPatterns <em>I couldn't believe it!</em> 
      </p>

        So I think we need a body of active, intelligent Patterns-savvy folks who will guide the new effort to improve the literature.  But it will only work if these folks can spend quality time on the task - and that probably means it will have to be funded. --<a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>

        To me the way to really improve the patterns literature is to create compendiums that focus on the problems -- while an oversimplification, patterns are solutions to problems in a context.  The user of patterns doesn't want to read pattern literature, he wants to solve problems.  So the obvious way to structure the literature is to structure the problem spaces and tabulate patterns by problems and structure the contexts within the problems, segment the anti-patterns from the patterns, and orgainize the solutions along lines of similarity.  If we were interesting in the truth and not another patterns book I think that would be what we would do. --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        Shorten the average pattern length by 90%.

      <p>
        Have many fewer things puporting to be patterns. Distinguish carefully between patterns, maybe-patterns and cute ideas written down in pattern form.

        Has any serious attempt been made to produce a cataloguing 
        scheme for patterns? (For example, a scheme which is to patterns
        what the Dewey decimal system is to general publications.)

      <code>
        <em></em><a href="ConstructionPrincipleForDesignPatterns.html">ConstructionPrincipleForDesignPatterns</a><em></em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I've read so much about the need for such a scheme. Why hasn't a workable
        scheme emerged by now? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it due to the TotalInterconnectednessOfEverything? (i.e. Difficulty in determining a workable, useful set of relationships between patterns
        independently of the readers context.)
      </p>

      <p>
        Survival of the Fittest. Not all patterns have the <em>timeless</em> quality. Perhaps, periodically, we should collectively look at the patterns we have and determine which ones have survived (seen some recent use).  Will all of the GOF <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> survive the cut?  Will all of Cope's <a href="OrganizationalPatterns.html">OrganizationalPatterns</a> remain relevant? When should we review the patterns we currently have documented? Every 5 years?
