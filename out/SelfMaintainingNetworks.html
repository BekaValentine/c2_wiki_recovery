        Self Maintaining Networks
      </h1>
      <p>
        With <a href="MobileAgent.html">MobileAgent</a>s and a little <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> we can introduce <a href="SelfMaintainingNetworks.html">SelfMaintainingNetworks</a>.  In some projects (see <a href="http://gurjari.sce.carleton.ca/netmanage/perpetum.shtml)">http://gurjari.sce.carleton.ca/netmanage/perpetum.shtml)</a> in research right now <a href="MobileAgent.html">MobileAgent</a>s are allowed to interact with the services on the network.  So in an example, a problem is detected.  A <a href="MobileAgent.html">MobileAgent</a> is dispatched, with code inside and ready to run, to fix the problem.  It interacts with the service and saves the day.  The AI on the system meanwhile watches what code is inserted and where the <a href="MobileAgent.html">MobileAgent</a> is dispatched.  This sort of technology is used in satellites so the satellite operator doesn't have to fix as many problems from Earth.  The operator fixes a problem and next time it surfaces the system sends a <a href="MobileAgent.html">MobileAgent</a> to fix the problem.  Moreover, if the AI isn't advanced enough, a <a href="MobileAgent.html">MobileAgent</a> can be sent to the satellite and it will upgrade the AI to meet the new needs.  - <a href="OpenAuthor.html">OpenAuthor</a>, <a href="JohnDuffy.html">JohnDuffy</a>
