      <p>
        in applying patterns to learning, particularly learning
        about objects.

        To my mind these are the opposite. I am of the PiecemealLearning/DistributedControl school of education. I want to give my learners tools for learning. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="PatternsForTeaching.html">PatternsForTeaching</a> camp is more concerned with "optimizing" what the teacher does. Does the lecture come before the lab? Do you have a second lecture after the lab? 
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think this focus on the teacher really matters. Different people learn differently. They should have different tools and strategies. The teacher should be there as a learning consultant to notice when a learner doesn't have a tool they need or isn't using a tool they already have.

        Actually putting the emphasis on the student is the whole point of most of the <a href="PedagogicalPattern.html">PedagogicalPattern</a>s developed by this group of people. The intent here is to help the novice instructor (and others) develop ways to reach diverse sets of students effectively. --<a href="JoeBergin.html">JoeBergin</a>

        You are right, there is teaching and teaching: one is 
        <em>teaching to the student</em> 
        (as described in <a href="PatternsForTeaching.html">PatternsForTeaching</a>), and one is 
        <em>learning with the student</em> 
        (as, according to what I have heard, practiced by you). The latter of course is preferable, but sometimes not possible, for example when you have to lecture to a large audience or when teaching through a book. --<a href="FalkBruegmann.html">FalkBruegmann</a>

        I'm a pattern newbie, but it strikes me that the first thing to do is to try to define a <a href="WhyWritePatternsPattern.html">WhyWritePatternsPattern</a> --<a href="MartinCosgrave.html">MartinCosgrave</a>
