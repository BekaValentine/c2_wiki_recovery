        These are great and inspiring words. Having been in the military, I can relate to, and have been trained to live by, many of these priciples. But I'd offer a few words of advice to those who would attempt to lead an XP team with these principles (I'm assuming that is what's suggested with the Extreme prefix). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Software types chose their profession as an alternative to military, hierarchical structures. Attempts to introduce a healthier lifestyle are often met with resentment. An effective leader in XP must subordinate themselves to the group and encourage acceptance of responsibility rather than delegate it. Patton's subordinates couldn't leave if they grew tired of his philosophy. He had authoritative power. Effective XP requires referential or expert power. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But there is a lot to be said for software developed using a military-like philosophy. Siebel is a good example of a successful company that very closely adheres to the above mentioned principles.
