        A <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a> using the <a href="GeckoEngine.html">GeckoEngine</a>. Contrary to the <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a>, it is better integrated into the <a href="GnomeDesktopEnvironment.html">GnomeDesktopEnvironment</a> and tries to be just a browser (but doing that well).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of its features, not found in the <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           session management and crash recovery
        </li>
        <li>
           besides using multiple windows for multiple pages, a single window with tabs can be used. Or a combination. 
        </li>
        <li>
           open all bookmarks in a folder with a single click
        </li>
        <li>
           bookmarks with parameters and images
        </li>
        <li>
           more than one bookmark toolbar
        </li>
        <li>
           fullscreen browsing
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is also faster (does less) than mozilla.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also no longer being developed. Embedding <a href="GeckoEngine.html">GeckoEngine</a> in non-Mozilla browsers is no longer supported. A current alternative is <a href="MidoriBrowser.html">MidoriBrowser</a>

        I love this browser. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The tab mode makes it easy to have 50 pages open by using only a couple of windows without a problem like getting lost or so.
      </p>
      <p>
        The crash recovery combined with the speed also takes the horror out of the (with mozilla 0.9.1 getting quite few) crashes: If it does crash during an extensive web session, having five windows and twenty pages open, I just start it again. It is there within a second, asks whether it should restore the state before the crash and does just that. At least on my admittedly not too old machine this gives working even with very unstable versions a nice flow.

        Since the source code does not contain the rendering engine (it embeds a gtkMozilla widget), and especially not a mail/news-client, messenger or scripting engine, it is much smaller than mozilla and much easier to hack. For myself, I added a reload which bypasses the proxy without a problem. -- <a href="MarkoSchulz.html">MarkoSchulz</a>

        My favorite Galeon feature: how it remembers my desired font size for each domain visited. Consequently, I never have to fret over font sizes too large or too small. -- <a href="NaumTrifanoff.html">NaumTrifanoff</a>
