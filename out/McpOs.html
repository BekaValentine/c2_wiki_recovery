        Master Control Program was the name given to the operating system of three different architectures of machines
        manufactured by Burroughs (now Unisys).   I have a very limited recollection (so perhaps others who remain better informed
        can fill in the details).   The <a href="McpOs.html">McpOs</a> which ran on mainframes is, as far as I can tell, the oldest operating system
        still in use and actively supported.   It was written in Algol 60 and had an Algol-like job control language called WorkFlowLanguage
        (WFL).   It had a screen editor called CANDE (Command and Edit) which required the user to input line numbers. -- <a href="DonaldFisk.html">DonaldFisk</a>
