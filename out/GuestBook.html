        It was called <a href="RecentVisitors.html">RecentVisitors</a> and that is closed since April 3, 2014.
        This <a href="GuestBook.html">GuestBook</a> got abandoned around 2010 after heavy spamming. 
        Time to start new!
        If it get's spammed again, I got an idea what to do about that. -- <a href="ManorainjanHolzapfel.html">ManorainjanHolzapfel</a>

        Here I found a lot of ground breaking thoughts & ideas about <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> and information about <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a> which inspires me a lot, connects me to the beginning of it all and thus serves my need for continuity since I consider myself to be ultra-conservative. I like to build on solid ground. And wikiwise this liquid site is most solid ground ;-) -- <a href="ManorainjanHolzapfel.html">ManorainjanHolzapfel</a>
