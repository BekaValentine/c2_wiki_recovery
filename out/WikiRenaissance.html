        Evidently the WikiMeme is spreading explosively now. What's interesting is that that meme invariably comes with links back to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>. Messy and primitive as it is, this place has enormous power. Old growth in the silicon forest indeed.

        Now we're seeing quite a few readers and writers deriving not from contacts of Ward's or the <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> community, but from <a href="WikiDom.html">WikiDom</a> as its own universe. <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is picking up and most of the old problems in this place seem to be, if not under control, at least relatively quiescent.

        <a href="VideoWiki.html">VideoWiki</a> may extend wiki's reach still further. When Paris Hilton drops in to edit her homepage, we'll know we're in deep trouble.
