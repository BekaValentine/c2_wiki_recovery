        Why not let the most frequently used navigation paths define parent-child relationships? For example, if you always get to <a href="WorldWideWikiWeb.html">WorldWideWikiWeb</a> from <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a>, then <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> should be a parent to <a href="WorldWideWikiWeb.html">WorldWideWikiWeb</a>. The key is to capture the navigation events, and then to use the captured information to display the paths as a map. You can get a <a href="WorldWideWikiWeb.html">WorldWideWikiWeb</a> going this way. You can define a <a href="WikiWebTransferProtocol.html">WikiWebTransferProtocol</a> that includes the ability to optionally specify the source of the traversal
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (Do you agree you would need to leave the source blank when you traverse the parentage link?),
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        and then any <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> that obeys the protocol and displays the parentage information as traversible links would automatically join something that would end up growing bigger than even this <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>. You could even get cute and skip over popular parents that recently tested as failed; permanently bad links would eventually fall behind the new parents. It's pretty elegant, actually. All it takes is a good protocol.

           Note: this is a copy-and-paste from the ZWiki page at <a href="http://joyful.com/zwiki/WikiStructuringIdeas">http://joyful.com/zwiki/WikiStructuringIdeas</a> <em>(</em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 2004-12-21)<em> -- someone over there said they've had great success getting people to use their </em><a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> by visually displaying parentage information that they explicitly define, and then the idea to just let the clicking do the talking came up...

        This sounds sort of like <a href="FreeNet.html">FreeNet</a>. Would the parent-child relationships automatically move <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a>'s content onto the same server as <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a>'s for speed's sake?

        This also sounds like applying <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s to other sites. Some <a href="WebLog.html">WebLog</a>s have started doing this recently, by parsing the web-server log for Referer data. Any wiki, being a dynamic server, could do the same thing on the fly by grabbing the Referer from the request-header before delivering the page. Most sites show counts by referring-URL and sort in that order. Some have agents that go out and grab the Title of the referring page. Some even have authors that personally go back and annotate those <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s. (<a href="BillSeitz.html">BillSeitz</a>, Apr'02)

        What about making a WorldWideWikiWebConsortium (W4C)? -- <a href="AntoineZimmermann.html">AntoineZimmermann</a>
