        Words Vs Ideas

        "Snares are used to catch game; once you have 
        the rabbit, you can dispense with the snare.

        "Fish-traps are used to catch fish; once you have 
        the fish, you don't need the fish-trap anymore. 
      </p>

        "Words are used to catch ideas; once you have 
        the idea, you can throw the word away. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Oh, how I wish I knew someone who had thrown all 
        his words away, so I could talk to him about ideas!"

        How foolish to think that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Snares are used to catch game once and then are thrown away.
        </li>
        <li>
           Fish-traps are used to catch fish once and then are thrown away.
        </li>
        <li>
           Words are used to catch only one idea, and then are then thrown away.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Oh, how in the world can the Chuang Tzu's of the world talk with some one about ideas, if they have thrown all their words away?

        This is where wiki stands tall, it has not only words, but also Idea-words, Complex-words, Wiki-words, Category-words, Tag-words, Value-words, Concept-words, Back-links, Linking-words, open-universal-participation, and so on: each of which can be preserved for ears to hear and which one can use to speak, not just OnceOnly, but also in the Wiki-now! -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20080124
