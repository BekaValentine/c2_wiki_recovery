        Primary Key
      </h1>
      <p>
        See <a href="CandidateKey.html">CandidateKey</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A non-empty set of columns (an ordered set in some RDBMS products) that contain non-null values and whose values uniquely identify a row (record). A table cannot have more than one <a href="PrimaryKey.html">PrimaryKey</a>, and should not have zero primary keys (this is usually but not always enforced in RDBMS systems).
      </p>
      <p>
        Often the term <a href="PrimaryKey.html">PrimaryKey</a> is used to refer to a set of columns which is a strict subset of all of the columns in the table; and in many cases it is assumed that the <a href="PrimaryKey.html">PrimaryKey</a> consists of a single column.
      </p>
      <p>
        Primary keys are useful and necessary because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They uniquely identify the record
        </li>
        <li>
           They are needed to implement <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a>s (though any <a href="CandidateKey.html">CandidateKey</a> will suffice).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The ideal primary key would be
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a <a href="CandidateKey.html">CandidateKey</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           mandatory - it is never possible to not have one (do all employees have SSN's?)
        </li>
        <li>
           immutable - can never be updated
        </li>
        <li>
           and minimal - as small as possible
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Primary keys are distinguished from other CandidateKeys in that their values are used by other tables to refer to rows in the (primary key's) table. A primary key also may capture the notion of <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a> (<em>e.g.</em>, I'm still the same person even though my name, weight, age, first and last name have changed). In a normalized database, primary key values are the only values that should appear multiple times in the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        Whenever a row is inserted into a table, you need to provide (or generate) a primary key for it. <em>Uh, no you don't... the entire record could be a </em><a href="CandidateKey.html">CandidateKey</a>, in which case it comes for free.<em> </em>KeyGeneration is done when there is no column or set of columns which meets the uniqueness constraint, account numbers are typical examples of generated <a href="PrimaryKey.html">PrimaryKey</a>s. See <a href="PortablePrimaryKeyGeneration.html">PortablePrimaryKeyGeneration</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is it really necessary for the set of columns defining a primary key to be ordered? I can't think of any reasons why other than efficiency; I was under the impression that the relative ordering of columns _specifically_ didn't matter under relational algebra.? -- </em><a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, it doesn't. Many RDBMS products aren't that faithful.
        </li>
      </ul>
