        An unacknowledged savior of Apple. At a time when Apple was losing market share, and with their sales in a slump, Dan Bricklin and (mostly coded by) <a href="BobFrankston.html">BobFrankston</a> (together, SoftwareArts), brought forth a program that allowed a decidedly plastic modeling of numbers, interactively, on a computer monitor.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the direct effects of this was that people bought <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a>s just to run <a href="VisiCalc.html">VisiCalc</a>. This program drove a sales recovery for Apple, but I don't ever recall having seen an acknowledgement from Apple to that effect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="VisiCalc.html">VisiCalc</a> was the second of the "big three" must-have applications that justified personal computing: 1) the <a href="WordProcessor.html">WordProcessor</a> [<a href="WordStar.html">WordStar</a>, MagicWand, <a href="WordPerfect.html">WordPerfect</a>], 2) the <a href="SpreadSheet.html">SpreadSheet</a> [<a href="VisiCalc.html">VisiCalc</a>, SuperCalc, Lotus123] 3) the desktop <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a> [dBASE II, Paradox].
      </p>
      <p>
        With those three things available to Joe Everyman, personal computing was from then on lodged firmly in the world of business.
