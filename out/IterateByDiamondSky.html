        "Iterate" is a software tool for the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>.  It provides digital versions of <a href="StoryCard.html">StoryCard</a>s (<a href="DigitalStoryCards.html">DigitalStoryCards</a>), as well as charts and reports based on those cards.

        Update 2008-09-16:  The product is no longer available, as indicated at <a href="http://www.diamond-sky.com/download/">http://www.diamond-sky.com/download/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's one more advantage of physical cards or open source software tools:  availability.

        <em>I love how if you click on their Products link, Iterate Expert edition shows up, with the tagline, "For when index cards are exactly what you need."  I got a good chuckle out of that one.  Still, you cannot blame them (him?  her?) for attempting to build their/his/her (as appropriate) own company/career by riding a definite trend in the market (at that time, at least).  In a way, it's kind of sad.</em>
