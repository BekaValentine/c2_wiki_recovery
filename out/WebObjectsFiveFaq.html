      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Can there be native EOAdaptors for <a href="WebObjectsFive.html">WebObjectsFive</a> or can we only use the JDBC (<a href="JavaDatabaseConnectivity.html">JavaDatabaseConnectivity</a>) adaptor?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A1.</strong> JDBC only, but you also need a database-specific plugin for EOModeler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A2.</strong> You can get by without a plugin.  It can handle semi-automatic pk generation, but that can be done via a delegate too.
      </p>
      <p>
        You also need one <a href="PureJava.html">PureJava</a> plugin for the appserver, and one JavaBridge plugin for EOModeler.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Where can a person get the JDBC Oracle driver for <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> and <a href="WebObjectsFive.html">WebObjectsFive</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> Do the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/software_index.htm">http://technet.oracle.com/software/tech/java/sqlj_jdbc/software_index.htm</a> 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Download the Oracle8i 8.1.7 JDBC Drivers for use with JDK 1.2.x by following the things for Solaris. There is a 100% pure Java version which will run on OS X.
            </li>
            <li>
               get the classes12.zip file and put it in the Java VM's extensions directory as indicated in the section titled <em>Using JDBC With </em><a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> 5<em> at </em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/webobjects/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes.html">http://developer.apple.com/techpubs/webobjects/ReleaseNotes/ReleaseNotes.html</a> ( <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> )
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Can this adaptor update the database structure via the "synchronise schema" command in EOModeller?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> Works with <a href="OpenBase.html">OpenBase</a> that comes with <a href="WebObjectsFive.html">WebObjectsFive</a>, but a bug in the adapter requires at least one table exist in the database before it works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Haven't tried the FrontBase adapter yet...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> What changes have been made to the WOAdaptor? Is it also in <a href="PureJava.html">PureJava</a> now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> No, still in C. wotaskd and monitor are now in <a href="PureJava.html">PureJava</a> however (since they are WO apps)
      </p>
      <p>
        The WOAdaptor connects to a standard <a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a> rather than a servlet container, so it <em>has</em> to be in C (or a native-compiled language).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> 5 now finally supports running as a servlet as well as standalone (possibly via the adaptor).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Is Linux a supported configuration for running the WOAdaptor?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> Not officially, but people use it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> What is the best debugger option for <a href="WebObjectsFive.html">WebObjectsFive</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> JSwat? <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Does it use Java collections or NS* classes?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> NSArray, NSDictionary and friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Does it run on JDK 1.1.8, JDK 1.3.1?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> Any J2SE should do, but only certified against a few. (Mac OS X 10, Windows 2000 Pro, and Solaris 8) 	Officially need JDK 1.3.x!
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Can WOComponents be put into Java packages?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Does <a href="WebObjectsFive.html">WebObjectsFive</a> support <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> Yes, in 5.1.  It includes the ExoLab's EJB container for basic test deployments, and can be deployed in a commercial J2EE server if need be.  However, WO can be used directly with just a JSP server (like <a href="ApacheTomcat.html">ApacheTomcat</a>) and no need for the rest of J2EE.  A little like rolling your own, but it's already rolled, and rolled correctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Does <a href="WebObjectsFive.html">WebObjectsFive</a> integrate with Servlets/JSP?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> Yes, in 5.1.  WebObject actions and dynamic components can be used through JSP tag libraries, there's documentation available on Apple's techpubs Web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Is there a trial version?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> A <a href="WebObjectsFive.html">WebObjectsFive</a> trial version was handed out at the WWDC.  It expired September 30, 2001. It can also be downloaded from Apple, along with the developer tools.  
      </p>
      <p>
        WebObjectsFivePointTwo can be downloaded from ADC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cost = $699.  less for academic licenses.  (Was $25,000 before 1998 -- perhaps that's why it never got the market share...)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Are there any upgrade offers from <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> 4.0 and 4.5 to <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a> 5.x?
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> No.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q.</strong> Where is that great article from Malcolm Crawford titled "Differences between WO4.5 and 5"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A.</strong> <a href="http://homepage.mac.com/mmalc/delta5/">http://homepage.mac.com/mmalc/delta5/</a> ( <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> )
