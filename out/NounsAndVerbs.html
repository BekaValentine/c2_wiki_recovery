        Nouns And Verbs

      <p>
        Things exist while action happens.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore (for GUIs)</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Put lists of things (nouns) in a list pane (one of FewPanes) which persists through interactions.
        </li>
        <li>
           Put actions (verbs) in <a href="ShortMenus.html">ShortMenus</a> which pop-up and then disappear as the action commences.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>For example:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The one time our domain specialists had trouble satisfying this pattern was for a menu they thought should include...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Decimal
        </li>
        <li>
           Octal
        </li>
        <li>
           Hex
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We recognized that they were in fact thinking of the menu options as actions and suggested that they rename them...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be Decimal
        </li>
        <li>
           Be Octal
        </li>
        <li>
           Be Hex
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore (for </strong><a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>)<strong>:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Give classes "noun" names.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Base classes should have general, simple names. E.g.:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   "List"
                </li>
                <li>
                   "Stream"
                </li>
                <li>
                   "Web"
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Subclasses should have specific, adjective-noun names. E.g.:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   "SortedList"
                </li>
                <li>
                   "FileStream", "NetworkStream", etc.
                </li>
                <li>
                   "IntranetWeb"
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Give methods "verb" names. ("isHappy", "becomeHappy", ...)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (See <a href="SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns.html">SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns</a> for more details.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Exceptions to this rule:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(I can't think of any that justify the inconsistency. Can you?)</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In the menu example at top, wouldn't the options Dec, Oct, Hex actually be a radio-button group that "just happens" to be nested in a menu?
      </p>
      <p>
        If this were the case (as in several calculator apps I've seen), Decimal, Octal, Hex would be nouns that the user chooses from a list.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Trying to combine the thoughts above... if the choices displayed as radio buttons were prefaced by a verb, I think that would satisfy all requirements. For example, "Display as:" followed by radio buttons labeled as Decimal, Octal, and Hex.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I think the first paragraph so badly misstates the noun-verb/object-message relationship to menus that I'd like to try a different wording here, and then encourage others to replace the original if they agree.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore (for GUIs)</strong>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Put things (nouns) on the desktop and allow them to be "selected".
        </li>
        <li>
           Put actions (verbs) that apply to the selected item(s) in <a href="ShortMenus.html">ShortMenus</a> that pop-up and then disappear as the action commences.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sort the <a href="ShortMenus.html">ShortMenus</a> from left to right in a MenuBar from most-stable to most-dynamic. This usually corresponds to most-general to most-specific.
        </li>
        <li>
           If a button, mnemonic, keyboard shortcut, and so on, is available, be sure it corresponds to exactly one currently-visible menu selection. If the menu selection is disabled, so should its alternative be.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please note that this approach (shamelessly stolen from the Macintosh user interface guidelines of 1984) moots the Decimal/Octal/Hex example; every menu item should be a verb, applied to whatever the selection (noun) is.
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Decimal/Octal/Hex" menu is generally presented as a "Format" menu, with the three choices listed and a checkmark placed next to the most-recently selected choice. The radio-button logic can be used to turn the checkmark on and off. A "Format menu" is a good example of a menu that changes dynamically; it should always appear as "Format" in its menu bar, but the "Decimal/Octal/Hex" choices only appear when the <strong>selection</strong> is a number for which they make sense. A non-numeric selection would end up with totally different choices.
