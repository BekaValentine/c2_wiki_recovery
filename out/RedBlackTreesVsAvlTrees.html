        Red Black Trees Vs Avl Trees
      </h1>
      <p>
        Okay. What's the deal with <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s? They're, like, <em>everywhere</em>! Universities are teaching them instead of AvlTrees. They're showing up in the kernel. They seem to have become the <a href="BalancedTree.html">BalancedTree</a> of choice. Why?
      </p>
      <p>
        Back "in my day" we all used AvlTrees when we needed a <a href="BalancedTree.html">BalancedTree</a>. They made sense, they used fairly obvious rotations, and well, I understood them. Now I fancy myself competent in computer land. I grok <a href="BeeTree.html">BeeTree</a>s, TwoThreeTrees, TwoThreeFourTrees, and AvlTrees. But I don't get these new <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a> things. I see how to statically map a <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a> into a TwoThreeFourTree, but I don't see how any of the insertion or deletion algorithms I can find for <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s, with all their color flips, map into those for TwoThreeFourTrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I've got two questions for you wiki masters:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Where can I find a <em>good</em> description of <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s? Not just some froofy, here's how they map into TwoThreeFourTrees, not one that just gives some algorithms without any explanation, but one that walks through the algorithms and explains what they're doing?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Wikipedia has a nice article on </em><a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-Black_tree).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red-Black_tree).</a>  It explains how each of the rotation algorithms serves to restore the tree's invariants.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What do <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s have over AvlTrees? What is so cool about them that they have all but replaced AvlTrees in programming land?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Not having learned </em>AvlTrees in school, I can't say for sure :), but a Google search ("avl-tree vs red-black") turns up some interesting discussions.  In summary: AvlTrees are slightly better balanced than <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s.  Both trees take O(log n) time overall for lookups, insertions, and deletions, but for insertion and deletion the former requires O(log n) rotations, while the latter takes only O(1) rotations.  Since rotations mean writing to memory, and writing to memory is expensive, <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s are in practice faster to update than AvlTrees.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="TheArtOfComputerProgramming.html">TheArtOfComputerProgramming</a> explains them all I think (thus they are all not that new anyway). If I remember correctly <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s are isomorphic to TwoThreeTrees expanded into one or two nodes. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The second edition of volume 3 mentions <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s but does not explain them. I believe that is the most current edition at this time (May 23, 2005).
      </p>

        <em>You are right. Wrong reference (and wrong statement too, oops). I shouldn't trust my memory on such things. Correct: </em><a href="AlgorithmsFromPtoNp.html">AlgorithmsFromPtoNp</a> explains on page 165, that <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a>s (are not isomorphic but) correspond very closely to 2,4-trees.<em> -- .gz</em>
