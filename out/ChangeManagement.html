        According to a Summer06 article at <a href="http://www.strategy-business.com/media/file/sb43_06207.pdf">http://www.strategy-business.com/media/file/sb43_06207.pdf</a> titled "The Neuroscience of <a href="LeaderShip.html">LeaderShip</a>", it was said brain research provided a biological reason why people can be against change even if it is in their best interests. It was said behaviorism tactics (the carrot and stick approach) do not work in the long term. Other not so effective methods include the humanistic approach of appealing to SelfEsteem and <a href="HigherPrinciples.html">HigherPrinciples</a>, and the Socrates method of questioning.

        <em>The Brain needs to be aligned with the mind</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The paper suggests the way <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a> can be effected is through a cognitive approach, of effecting change in mental maps of people in a large way. To do that the people involved need to "own" the change initiative. Quoting the article, it was said:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Leaders wanting to change the way people think or behave should learn to recognize, encourage, and deepen their team's insights.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The article also quoted the success of <a href="ToyotaProductionSystem.html">ToyotaProductionSystem</a> hinges on the ability to employ tactics that promote fine-grained awareness of processes and how to improve them. Earlier on there were also suggestions that <a href="TheToyotaWay.html">TheToyotaWay</a> worked because of workplace practices that are supportive of the way the brain works.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Looking at <a href="TheToyotaWay.html">TheToyotaWay</a>, a lot of the fourteen principles interact to form a cohesive, immersive, experiential approach of the interlocking Toyota techniques such as visual controls, "go and see", etc
        </li>
        <li>
           When a process defect is detected, the highly valued Continuous Flow process is stopped. This creates an emergency and results in lasting improvement quickly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not sure to what extent this school of thought agrees or complements the work of Kurt Lewin, who originated Force Field Analysis and founded the Research Center for Group Dynamics at MIT before he died in 1947. Kurt pioneered work relating change and psychology (organization development is the modern term). I am interested to know about recent and relevant work done by key thinkers in related areas (e.g Cognitive Dissonance - any applications to <a href="ChangeYourOrganization.html">ChangeYourOrganization</a>?).

        <strong></strong>CommunicatingChange<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is never been enough communications in any significant <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a> exercise. I found this to be true as an apprenctice in an inhouse project where my IT background had little relevance.
      </p>
      <p>
        CommunicatingChange is the title of a well-known book, published during the heydays of <a href="BusinessProcessReengineering.html">BusinessProcessReengineering</a> (ISBN : 0070364524) by the Larkin team.

        In mid 2005, TJ Larkin was invited to address International Association of Business Communications (IABC), where he got standing ovation (second time in its history alongside Salman Rushdie), but that also sparked a fierce debate with his contemporary on how to do communications.
      </p>
      <p>
        This was taken from an observation by another person at <a href="http://blogs.iabc.com/chair/archives/2005/08/26/holtz-vs-larkinround-3/">http://blogs.iabc.com/chair/archives/2005/08/26/holtz-vs-larkinround-3/</a> in regards to the debate between those two skilled communicators:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I’ve also sensed that they have occasionally missed the meaning of a point made by the other. It’s like I learned in marital counseling once (don’t ask for details), sometimes two people can become polarized to the point where they don’t really hear what the other person is saying</em>

        Also, it may be beneficial in some situations for the <a href="ChangeAgent.html">ChangeAgent</a> to do a bit of reflection. It is possible that if his attitude changes, there will be less disconnect with the targeted group and therefore more chance for success.
