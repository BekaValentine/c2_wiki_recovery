        Merge Tool
      </h1>
      <p>
        These are some standalone tools used to both show the differences between two text files and allow the user to apply the differences to either of the files or perhaps a third file.  These are often included with or used in conjunction with a <a href="VersionControlSystem.html">VersionControlSystem</a>.

        I guess merge UIs integrated into IDEs etc don't count, otherwise I'd immediately add <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> and LinCvs. And I <strong>bet</strong> there is something for Emacs.

        <em>I just checked out </em>WinMerge. Very trad design. Not something an author would ever be able to use. AraxisMerge is even worse, it's very top-heavy with useless features that serve only to add conceptual complexity. For example, "linking lines" instead of just displaying missing text, "three-way merge" and "directory merge". Kdiff3 is even worse still. It's obvious these were made with a specific language in mind, a language which keeps source in files and directories. This makes them exceedingly ill-suited for anything but that retarded language.<em> -- RK</em>

        In Emacs, ediff mode is usually used. It's very nice, as merge tools go.

        Three-way merge is not language-specific, and conceptually is not specific to files. Three-way merge is helpful when reconciling changes in two divergent text versions that have a common ancestor. Most people don't need it very often, but it is very helpful on occasion.
