        Fine Grained Distributed Objects
      </h1>

        Sadly this is a common <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. The recipe is to create a nice domain model, then make every object distributed. This is very easy to do with RMI, CORBA etc. Indeed I've seen some CORBA vendors quote it as a feature.

        The problem is that remote procedure calls behave differently to local ones. Remote calls are orders of magnitude slower, and can fail.

        As a result using <a href="FineGrainedDistributedObjects.html">FineGrainedDistributedObjects</a> leads to terrible performance problems, together with reliability issues.

        Instead you should use <a href="FacadesAsDistributedComponents.html">FacadesAsDistributedComponents</a> or a <a href="BagOfJumpingBeans.html">BagOfJumpingBeans</a>.

        However this has changed with <a href="EjbTwo.html">EjbTwo</a>. Since LocalInterfaces are now available then it's actually a good idea to have fine-grained entity beans with a stateless session bean in front of them. Of course one could argue that the entity beans that are only being exposed via a LocalInterface aren't distributed objects.

        Well they're not.  The reason that you can make fine grained entity beans in <a href="EjbTwo.html">EjbTwo</a> is that they have <em>local</em> interfaces that are exposed to session beans in the same address space.
