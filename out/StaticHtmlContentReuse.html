        Static Html Content Reuse
      </h1>
      <p>
        For logistical and legacy reasons, there are certain web pages in our org we cannot use SHTML or server-side content sharing (per reuse & content <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>), such as "include" statements. The HTML standard has no client-side "include" equivalency, unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p>
        Doing it via <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> (JS) is one possibility, but it's often awkward to code that way, search engines often skip JS-generated content, and it can create ADA-compliance problems per ADA reader software. iFrames have given us sizing problems and other side-effects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Has anybody found a decent solution, or wish to offer recommendations? It's one of those things that feels like it could or should be simple, but is not.

        [How about static-site compilers, like <a href="http://jekyllrb.com/">http://jekyllrb.com/</a> ? Common content can be included at compile-time, rather than on the fly when pages are accessed. -DavidMcLean]

        That wouldn't work in our circumstance.
