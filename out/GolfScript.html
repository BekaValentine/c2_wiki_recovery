        Golf Script
      </h1>
      <p>
        An esoteric language designed to win at language-agnostic <a href="CodeGolf.html">CodeGolf</a>. It's a stack language with 44 built-in operators, some overloaded. "Blocks" provide both control structures and re-use as in <a href="FalseLanguage.html">FalseLanguage</a> and <a href="DeeCee.html">DeeCee</a>. Some parts of the language are very golf specific ("when your script is executed, all input from stdin is read first and placed as a string onto the stack").
