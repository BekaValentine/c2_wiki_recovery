        Orphan Page
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> is a Wiki page with no inbound links. Creating them is discouraged. <em>On the other hand, see </em><a href="WikiContentGenerationProcess.html">WikiContentGenerationProcess</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s can come about in two ways:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           a page can be born an orphan by pointing the wiki?edit URL to a nonexistent page that's not one of the <a href="WantedPages.html">WantedPages</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           a page can become an orphan when all pages that link to it are deleted
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There are several ways to find <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           use the <a href="OrphanWikiPages.html">OrphanWikiPages</a> script
        </li>
        <li>
           trying <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           investigating <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           perusing <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           walking the <a href="WikiList.html">WikiList</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="ShortWikiPages.html">ShortWikiPages</a> are often <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you find an <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>, consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           adding a link to it from a related page
        </li>
        <li>
           checking whether it's a <a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           refactoring it into a related page
        </li>
        <li>
           becoming a FosterParent
        </li>
        <li>
           renaming the page so it is easier to link to
        </li>
        <li>
           adding "<a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a>" if it's an old <a href="AbandonedHomePage.html">AbandonedHomePage</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Exceptions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When deciding whether to add the <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a> to a page at the same time that you're adding an <a href="AreYouThere.html">AreYouThere</a> badge, it's customary to ignore <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s to automatically generated pages (e.g, the ChangesIn______ pages).
        </li>
        <li>
           Pages that have a reasonable category (home pages, books, stories) <strong>can</strong> consider the category <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a> as a link, but this alone does not justify the page.  Consider the context and usage.  Few people will come to C2 for a list of books (more likely they'll use Amazon), so a book that is not recommended from another page is likely a useless page.  A home page, on the other hand, is very likely to be an orphan unless the person signs their contributions.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Since it's not really possible to find an </em><a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> unless you specifically set out to look for one, you could also consider..<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           not worrying about <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s and trying some page creation instead
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you do decide to muck about in the OrphanPages, consider trying to <a href="RefactorLowHangingFruit.html">RefactorLowHangingFruit</a>.  <a href="LowHangingFruit.html">LowHangingFruit</a> may include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Clear nonsense.  E.g. SonOfBirdBrain.  Solution: delete.  Note that nonsense does not equal <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>.  Many <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> take offense at the deletion of movie and joke pages, and will restore.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Clear GoodPages.  <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>, many participants, decent length, etc.  Hummed along merrily for a few days while it was in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and then died for lack of linking.  Solution: place link(s) in related page(s).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Note:</em> when sowing links, avoid if at all possible building nests of "See: <a href="FooBar.html">FooBar</a>, BarBaz, BazQuux, QuuxJulie, etc." at the bottom of pages.  If the link cannot be added in a natural way, you have either chosen the wrong foster-parent or the <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> is in need of refactoring.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lost buds.  Short pages that were extracted from longer ones, but no forward link added to parent.  Symptoms: very short, us. only one contributor, and a note like "Moved from <a href="FooBar.html">FooBar</a>" or "See BarBaz".  Solution: if parent is not a <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>, move content back to parent and delete.  If parent is a <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>, add a link.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        OrphanPages that are difficult to deal with are those that are <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>, long, have one or very few contributors, and come at a problem from an idiosyncratic or biased angle.  Deletions will be restored, but merging or even linking are difficult to do in a coherent way.

      <dl>
        <dt><a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> knots (a.k.a. <em>dead cycles</em>)</dt>
        <dd>Pages with mutual links among themselves (keeping them from being orphans) but no other links into the set.  (<a href="WalledGardens.html">WalledGardens</a>)</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Identifying knots requires defining a root set; any page reachable from the root set is by definition not part of a knot.
      </p>
      <p>
        One probably should exclude things like <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and various searches from the root set.  OTOH, categories might be part of the root set; any page with CategoryWhatever is non-orphan because it shows up in the category.  (I wouldn't give this special treatment to other <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a> searches.)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The CultureOfRecentChanges makes popular pages sprout many links out of them, but few links into them. For the not-so-popular pages, they might have <strong>only</strong> outward bound links. Once they move off <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, it is very unlikely that anyone will ever see them again, except by searching specifically for them with <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a>, or by following <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s. But since they are unpopular, these methods are unlikely to cause anyone to browse them. If people did not sign their contributions, then many of the <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> pages would be <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s. In fact, many people do <strong>not</strong> sign their contributions, or have never made a contribution except for their <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>. This is just to show that <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s are at least fairly common on Wiki.

        <strong>Predictions</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There are many pages out there that have zero or one links into them, aside from the dynamically made pages.
        </li>
        <li>
           There are many pages out there that, for whatever reasons, have not been browsed in years.
        </li>
        <li>
           There are many pages out there that, for whatever reasons, will not be browsed for years to come.
        </li>
        <li>
           Since there is no automatic <a href="GarbageCollector.html">GarbageCollector</a> for Wiki, these pages are unlikely to ever get re-evaluated the way most Wiki pages are. They are providing no value to any <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> because they will never get visited, and when they are, they are out of date and unpopular.
        </li>
        <li>
           The CultureOfRecentChanges significantly adds to the number of <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s. Other ways of browsing Wiki do not have the same effect (to the same degree).
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Q:</strong> Are <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s killed after some time?
        An author might use a <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> for minimizing the chance of inadvertently overwriting recent changes on a page made by another Wiki author.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> No. There is only one way to delete pages. See <a href="HowToDeletePages.html">HowToDeletePages</a>.

        What do you do when you think of a topic that's great for the Wiki, but you don't know how to place it <a href="OnFocus.html">OnFocus</a>, because you can't think of a good launching point? Not an <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>, but an UnbornPage (I'm thinking of <a href="PettinessWillKillYou.html">PettinessWillKillYou</a>, which now has a parent).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All new pages are linked to </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, and my guess is that there are enough <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s that it will slap the page on the bottom and get it screaming and breathing. Unless its <a href="ApgarScore.html">ApgarScore</a> (which was also an orphan but now has a parent) is too low, I suppose. We'll just see about this...<em></em>
