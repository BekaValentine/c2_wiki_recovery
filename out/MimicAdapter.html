        Mimic Adapter
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="HexagonalArchitecture.html">HexagonalArchitecture</a> you write an <a href="AdapterPattern.html">AdapterPattern</a> against your external dependencies. 
      </p>
      <p>
        It's important that the adapter add actually do something. Don't write a 1-1 adapter to a new, identical interface. For example, in C#:
      </p>
      <code>
        interface IFileSystem<br/>
        {<br/>
        void DeleteFile(string path);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // etc. - every method on File, Directory, and Path are here.<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class <a href="FileSystem.html">FileSystem</a><br/>
        {<br/>
        void IFileSystem.DeleteFile(string path)<br/>
        {<br/>
        File.Delete(path);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This isn't really an adapter, since there's no real abstraction being created: it's not abstract.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Concerns</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This lets you ignore the need for a new, valuable abstraction. Your tests are giving you feedback and you're suppressing that feedback. That abstraction should be a little higher, so that it can hide the ugly details of the dependency that you don't care about. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Exceptions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The adapter is actually one level higher abstraction than the dependency (e.g. "File System" becomes "Blob Store")
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The adapter adds some functionality that was missing originally (e.g. transactions)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Replace primitive-type parameters with a <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> (e.g. `string` becomes `FileSystemPath`)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The new interface maps terminology from the dependency in to your domain.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is the first step in a series of refactorings, which will create a useful abstraction later.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You can't refactor, due to time, risk, or skill constraints.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The new interface is a narrower subset of the external interface.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The new interface hides something ugly about the external interface.
        </li>
      </ul>
