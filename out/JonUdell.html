        Jon develops <a href="http://www.byte.com/,">http://www.byte.com/,</a> and writes about it.  His May (1996!) article (<a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9605/sec9/art1.htm)">http://www.byte.com/art/9605/sec9/art1.htm)</a> describes adding conferencing to the site.

        Jon may write about being a "knuckle scraping Neanderthal," but today programs in Perl, a language with no data types, but sweet on data structures. (<a href="BenSmith.html">BenSmith</a>)

        Two years later: BYTE bit the bullet. Jon's on his own, writing a book on Internet groupware. Now reachable at <a href="mailto:udell@monad.net.">mailto:udell@monad.net.</a> The former BYTE newsgroups have moved as well. They were reachable from  <a href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/talk/newsgroups.html">http://udell.roninhouse.com/talk/newsgroups.html</a> but are now served up by news.devx.com. (You may be asked to log in once -- try a blank password.)

        October 1999: Now Jon's newsgroups are back at BYTE.com. And his new book, <a href="PracticalInternetGroupware.html">PracticalInternetGroupware</a> (<a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pracintgr/),">http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/pracintgr/),</a> has just been published by O'Reilly and Associates.

        Jon has an RSS channel where you can catch up with his weekly column and other doings; see <a href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/.">http://udell.roninhouse.com/.</a>

        <em>[Also at </em><a href="WikiWikiKudos.html">WikiWikiKudos</a>.]<em> Jon wrote a column for BYTE on May 1, 2000 (</em><a href="http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2000-04-26.html)">http://udell.roninhouse.com/bytecols/2000-04-26.html)</a> titled "Newsgroups And The Wiki Way Why Heads, Decks, And Leads Matter." In it, he calls this wiki "one of most remarkable -- and long-lived -- online collaborations in existence, radical in that every document is editable, always, by every user."

        More years later: In 2002 I find myself at the intersection of Wiki and weblogs; see <a href="http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/04/04.html#a171.">http://radio.weblogs.com/0100887/2002/04/04.html#a171.</a> What a fascinating mix of online communities, styles of information architecture, and modes of communication.

        I finally got to meet Ward in person, at a gathering convened by <a href="ClayShirky.html">ClayShirky</a>. A couple of months later, I interviewed Ward for a column I wrote in <a href="InfoWorld.html">InfoWorld</a> (<a href="http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/02/13.html).">http://weblog.infoworld.com/udell/2003/02/13.html).</a> It was a real treat.  -- <a href="JonUdell.html">JonUdell</a>
