      <p>
        Michael is an experienced system analyst and programmer coding in Oracle web development tools and PL/SQL database packages (unfortunately not truely object oriented, but many OO principles can still be applied).
        He found Wiki after linking here from <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.

        The team he leads is just starting to use XP. Experiences so far:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pair Programming - some success. Problems include hardware which makes it difficult to implement (desks not wide enough and monitors too deep), and some team members who claim they cannot possibly think with someone sitting next to them.
        </li>
        <li>
           Unit Testing - investigating. We have downloaded <a href="PlSqlUnit.html">PlSqlUnit</a>, the Unit Testing Framework for PL/SQL, developed by <a href="StevenFeuerstein.html">StevenFeuerstein</a>. We have written some tests, but project deadlines are slowing us down. Yes, I know project deadlines won't be as much of a problem once we are unit testing all the time, but that is in the future (hopefully).
        </li>
        <li>
           Acceptance Tests - we haven't got a good idea how to do this yet.  <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> - Does anyone know how to automatically test Oracle Forms 6i?  i.e. what tools are available to do acceptance testing of oracle forms?
        </li>
      </ul>
