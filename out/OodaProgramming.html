        Ooda Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        Boyd's <a href="OodaLoop.html">OodaLoop</a> is obvious and simple. But no OO program does it. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Observe
        </li>
        <li>
           Orient
        </li>
        <li>
           Decide
        </li>
        <li>
           Act
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Orientation is what's missing. My method <em>observes</em> its message, compares same with its state in order to <em>decide</em>, and then goes ahead and <em>acts</em> by messaging other objects. It may, after the fact, attempt to reframe its state by letting an observer know that it's done something. But this is the exception, not the paradigm.
      </p>
      <p>
        To lift programming to a higher plane it is this missing orientation step that must be addressed. At present its only embodiment is testing. But this is static and disposable; tests are not used at run-time.
      </p>

        What would the orientation stage actually be in a programming context?  I've had a quick google for Boyd and it seems to be something to do with military planning.
