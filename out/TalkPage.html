        <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a> is for <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> what <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a> is for any other <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This page gives a suggestion for a different way of working on this wiki, which is used elsewhere.</em>

        This page is in <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>. The <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a> is here: <a href="TalkPageDiscussion.html">TalkPageDiscussion</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Explanation:</strong> The <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a> concept is to complement the concept of <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a> which suggests to append 'Discussion' to any <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> in order to separate <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> of a general <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> from <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> of the <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a>. In this light <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a> is the <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a> of a <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>.
        Since <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>s are considered a more private space, a page mainly edited by the person under who's name it is, it is also to the discretion of the "owner" of any given <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, how they like to handle their <a href="MailBox.html">MailBox</a>, either as part of their <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> or as a separate <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a>. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Please do not confuse </strong><a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a> with other concepts like <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a> or <a href="NamePage.html">NamePage</a>!<strong> </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="NamePage.html">NamePage</a>s are not created by <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a>s of this wiki as their <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> but <strong>about</strong> people of specific interest like <a href="AlanTuring.html">AlanTuring</a>. 
        </li>
        <li>
           A <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a> created by appending 'Discussion' to the name of your <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> would indicate not a page to talk <strong>to you</strong>, but to discuss <strong>about you</strong> like you became the subject of a debate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Where does it come from?</strong>
        I introduced this concept on 10/2014 shortly after coming to this wiki, on account of my <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> based experience with those <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a>s. There nearly all <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s got a <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a> attached to it automatically except for so called SystemMessagePages. --<a href="ManorainjanHolzapfel.html">ManorainjanHolzapfel</a>

        <em>'How to implement':</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Create a link to your new <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a> to be on one of the ends of your <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, preferably on top, so that you and the visitors to your talk page don't need to scroll.
          <ul>
            <li>
               format: <strong><home_page_name>Talk</strong>
            </li>
            <li>
               Maybe You like to add some words or signs that clarifies for your reader what that means
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Click that link to create your personal <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a>. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Add a <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a> to your <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> on top of your <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Add <a href="CategoryTalkPage.html">CategoryTalkPage</a> at the bottom of your <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               Tell Your visitor how you like it, newest on top or bottom. Top is preferred, again because of no scroll.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Advantages and disadvantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is a concept to be used freely on ones own discretion. (which could be seen as disadvantage)
        </li>
        <li>
           One has to do it on ones own, gets the possibility but no structural support by any technical implementation. So, how do get people to know about it? When they click on the hopefully provided <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a> link.
        </li>
        <li>
           It helps to prevent that <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>s get messed up with possibly unsigned comments.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you like to search for public discussions <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=Discussion">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=Discussion</a> you will not find any personal talk nor documents.
        </li>
        <li>
           Nobody needs to make out any sense of the way somebody organised their <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>. You do not even need to look at it in order to talk to them. So the 'owner' of a <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> that is complemented by a <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a> is more free in its form. They do not need to have any consideration for <em>talkative</em> visitors.
        </li>
        <li>
           A <a href="TalkPage.html">TalkPage</a> is an obvious invitation to talk to that <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a>. No need to be shy.
        </li>
      </ul>
