        Fleas Ad Infinitum
      </h1>
      <p>
        By JonathanSwift, from "<em>On Poetry, A Rhapsody</em>".
      </p>
      <code>
        So, naturalists observe, a flea<br/>
        Hath smaller fleas that on him prey;<br/>
        And these have smaller still to bite 'em;<br/>
        And so proceed <em>ad infinitum</em>.<br/>
        Thus every poet, in his kind,<br/>
        Is bit by him that comes behind.<br/>

        The more familiar form comes from AugustusDeMorgan, in "<em>A Budget of Paradoxes</em>":
      </p>
      <code>
        Great fleas have little fleas upon their backs to bite 'em,<br/>
        And little fleas have lesser fleas, and so <em>ad infinitum</em>.<br/>
        And the great fleas themselves, in turn, have greater fleas to go on;<br/>
        While these again have greater still, and greater still, and so on.<br/>
      </code>

        It comes with this nice rejoinder, from around 1922, by LewisFryRichardson: 
      </p>
      <code>
        Big whorls have little whorls,<br/>
        Which feed on their velocity;<br/>
        And little whorls have lesser whorls,<br/>
        And so on to viscosity<br/>
        (in the molecular sense).<br/>

        <a href="http://math.ucdavis.edu/~robinson/funstuff/geekpoetry.html">http://math.ucdavis.edu/~robinson/funstuff/geekpoetry.html</a> has some neat poems by scientists. I like the <a href="StanislawLem.html">StanislawLem</a> one at the top, which starts...

        Come, let us hasten to a higher plane,<br/>

      <code>
        Come, every frustum longs to be a cone,<br/>
        And every vector dreams of matrices.<br/>
        Hark to the gentle gradient of the breeze:<br/>
        It whispers of a more ergodic zone.<br/>

        Rabby Burns did write about "Seeing a louse on a Ladies Head" or something
        like that:
      </p>
      <code>
        ... What a gift t'a gi' us,<br/>
        to see our'sel, as others see us.<br/>
