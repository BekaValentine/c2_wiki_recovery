        Free Rider Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        Free-rider or hitchhiking effect (Kerr, 1983; Kerr & Bruun, 1983). This occurs if individual effort is perceived to be unnecessary, as is the case when the whole group receives one grade that may be based on the performance of a sub-group, for example, the ones who do a substantive share of the work.
