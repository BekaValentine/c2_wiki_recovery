        Select Case Examples
      </h1>
      <p>
        These two examples are helpful for <a href="VbaExercises.html">VbaExercises</a>' Exercise 10.

        When using Visual Basic's <strong>Select Case</strong> feature,
        make sure to indent your code so that it is easy to understand.
        Here are two examples.  The difference is that one has very short code 
        for each case statement, and the other has ordinary length code for each case statement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notes:  This code could easily be replaced by a database lookup (such as in Access), or by a VLOOKUP in Excel.  Also, this code assumes that you have already declared the relevant variables, and have set (or passed in) the input values.  
      </p>

        <strong>Short example:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that in this example, each case and its code easily fit on one line.

      <code>
        'lngPresident is the sequence number for the U.S. Presidents,<br/>
        'as used by the U.S. Secret Service.<br/>
        '1 = George Washington, the first president under the current U.S. Constitution.<br/>
        'One president was counted twice, because his terms were not consecutive.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Select Case lngPresident<br/>
        Case Is < 1:  strPresident = "Invalid" 'Before George Washington<br/>
        'was President<br/>
        Case Is < 40: strPresident = "Not entered yet"<br/>
        Case 40:      strPresident = "Reagan"<br/>
        Case 41:      strPresident = "Bush, Sr."<br/>
        Case 42:      strPresident = "Clinton"<br/>
        Case Else:    strPresident = "Unknown" 'recent presidents who<br/>
        'have not been entered yet,<br/>
        'and future presidents<br/>

        <strong>Typical example:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that in this coding style, the <strong>Case</strong> statement is indented 2 spaces,
        instead of the usual 4 spaces.
