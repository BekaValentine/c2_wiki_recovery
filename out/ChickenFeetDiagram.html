        Chicken Feet Diagram
      </h1>
      <p>
        An Entity-Relationship modeling diagram with the older-style chicken feet line notation (before 1:m came into vogue), and with just about everything else removed - no dashed lines, no double-border boxes, also no inheritance.  We found them useful for finding our way through about 200 types.
      </p>
      <p>
        We used to make no pretense about using a "standard" notation, and called them <a href="ChickenFeetDiagram.html">ChickenFeetDiagram</a>s to reflect this.
      </p>

        I know this notation as a <a href="BachmannDiagram.html">BachmannDiagram</a>. I never did understand why it fell into disuse, as it's so much more visually intuitive than 1:m etc.
