        <em>Any famous </em><a href="LeftHanded.html">LeftHanded</a> programmers?  We aren't very good at math, but we are creative.  I'm worried left handers are behind the <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> craze.  I doubt they're behind the <a href="PurelyFunctional.html">PurelyFunctional</a> craze.<em></em>

        I always thought there was a positive correlation between being
        <a href="LeftHanded.html">LeftHanded</a> and being good at mathematics. -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>
        (good at mathematics but right-handed)

        Actually I thought the correlation was left-handed and dyslexic, and I believe being dyslexic makes maths difficult. --<a href="NoelWelsh.html">NoelWelsh</a> (leftie and very mildly dyslexic)

        I'm wrong then.  It's nice to know I'm good at math.  :)
