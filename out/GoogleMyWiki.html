        I never want Wiki to grow to a size where I have to search it using <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> <<a href="http://google.com/">http://google.com/</a>>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But wouldn't it be great to be <em>able</em> to search Wiki with Google?
      </p>

        You can!  Result June 22, 2002 :

        "Searched the web for [Wiki c2.com]   Results 1 - 10 of about 64,300. Search took 0.19 seconds<br/>

        Everybody forgets about the "site:" syntax with Google:

        [<a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> kacks on a single space; it's okay for finding something you know is there, but not for arbitrary result sets...]
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> doesn't do the kind of "authority" ranking that Google does. Given the highly linked nature of Wiki, that might be interesting to see.

      <p>
        <em>Perhaps </em><a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> could rank results by the number of <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s (a naive but practical heuristic to measure the significance of a wiki page).<em></em>

           Given that <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> is vastly smaller than the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>, it may well be possible to apply the <a href="PageRank.html">PageRank</a> metric Google uses without too much difficulty. -- <a href="DanielBiddle.html">DanielBiddle</a>

        See also <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> for the Web of all Wikis, that might be interesting for a search-engine like Google. This way you might get the weights of the traffic arcs.

        I wonder whether Wiki's heavily interlinked nature might not break Google's sorting algorithm? It works by ranking highly pages with a lot of high quality links in and out. Heavily interlinked Wiki pages may well get an artificially high ranking... -- <a href="KornySietsma.html">KornySietsma</a>

        Not sure where this belongs, and I don't want to yet create a new page, but here's an interesting little toy, Googlism My Wiki: <a href="http://googlism.com/index.htm?ism=wiki&type=2">http://googlism.com/index.htm?ism=wiki&type=2</a>

        The primary reason why most people use Google is to "find information". The fact that the PresentationOrder of the results may be arranged according to a ranking system is a side issue.
