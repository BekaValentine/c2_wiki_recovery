        One of the most useful things you can do for developing in Dynamo is to <strong>sprinkle your code liberally with debugging statements</strong> -- anywhere you would usually put a comment or an assertion in fact.  Because you can turn loggingDebug off and on dynamically, you can see exactly what your code is doing without impacting performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Set up eclipse templates to help you do this (<a href="StuartJones.html">StuartJones</a>)
      </p>
      <code>
        <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?> <br/>
        <templates><br/>
        <template context="java" description="log debug" enabled="true" name="ld">if(isLoggingDebug()) { logDebug("${enclosing_method}(${enclosing_method_arguments})"); } ${cursor}</template> <br/>
        </templates><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You can also use logDebug in JHTML pages by saying 
      </p>
      <p>
        <java>
        request.setLoggingDebug(true);
        request.logDebug("This is at the start of the JHTML page");
        </java>
      </p>
      <p>
        This works well when you're trying to debug a single page.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>To comment out code or text in Dynamo</strong>, use the embedded Java comment 
      </p>
      <p>
        <java>/* comment */</java>
      </p>
      <p>
        or the JSP comment
      </p>
      <p>
        <%-- this is a comment --%>
      </p>
      <p>
        Neither will show up in the page output.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that doing 
        <java>// This is a comment </java>
      </p>
      <p>
        will break the page!  This is because the interpolation is done without a newline, which means
        the comment will probably be prepended to some working piece of code and all your _DARGS will magically stop working.
      </p>

        <strong>To find the scope of a particular component</strong>, use 
      </p>
      <p>
        <valueof bean="Component.serviceConfiguration.scope"></valueof>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is because most components inherit from GenericService, which has a bean property of getServiceConfiguration, which has a Configuration interface which exposes many properties of the bean.  Very useful when you just want to check out how something is configured.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>To find the class of a component or param</strong>, use
      </p>
      <p>
        <valueof bean="Component.class.name"/>
