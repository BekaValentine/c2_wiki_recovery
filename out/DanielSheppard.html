      <p>
        Programmer from Melbourne, Australia.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a Bachelor of Economics and Commerce from Melbourne University, but I've never put any of that knowledge to use in my employment (I lean a little too far to the left politically to convince myself to work for most economic and financial employers).
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been programming extensively in Java for my current employer for the past 5 years, and fiddled in whatever programming languages I could get my hands on before that. I've never had any formal programming education (well... I did do half a year of an Information Systems degree, but I wasn't learning anything, so I stuck to my other degree).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd say my skills are good to excellent in Java, XHTML+CSS and javascript (though I try not to use my javascript powers for evil) and Ruby. I'm passable in Python, C# - I've never had the opportunity to use any of those skills on a complete project before, so I can't really comment.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done some <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> work with <a href="http://pmd.sf.net/">http://pmd.sf.net/</a> and <a href="http://httpunit.sf.net/">http://httpunit.sf.net/</a> but mainly I don't have the time to dedicate to OSS. I like to help out here and there on the mailing lists for most of the open source products that I've used.
      </p>
      <p>
        I try to be a good <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> - I try to pride myself on a calm and professional approach to conflict. If I drop into informality or I seem to be insulting, it's typically a lame attempt at humour.
