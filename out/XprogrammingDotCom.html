        I've just opened <a href="http://www.XProgramming.com">http://www.XProgramming.com</a> for preview.
      </p>

        It has most of the old Armaties content, and some new XP-related content as well. Armaties will be trimmed down and links placed to XProgramming as time passes.

        XProgramming.com aims to be a resource for the entire community of individuals interested in <a href="LightweightMethodologies.html">LightweightMethodologies</a>.  Accordingly, it will be my pleasure to include any of your writings relating to XP or <a href="LightweightMethodologies.html">LightweightMethodologies</a>, or to place links in XProgramming to material you may recommend.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please check out the site and let me know how it's shaping up. I've been working hard on it and hope I haven't messed it up too much.
