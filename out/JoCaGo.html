        I am a C/C++//VB.NET//PHP//ASP.NET//TCL/TK programmer.  I know, all those languages conflict with each other.  I can't help it.  My interests vary greatly.  For example, I also have held a job as a photographer (albeit for a small, university magazine), and consider myself a writer/philologist.  I also have a great interest in science (photonic communication facinates me)and cryptography.

        I know what you are thinking.

        Well, since you asked, I don't.  I've had to pretty much give up flying (I guess I forgot to mention that I took flying lessons), and photography.  I still write, and program for a career (though I am leaning towards management or Project Management, both of which I currently do as well as programming/designing).  This leaves me with *no* time, but I am happy.  I think...

        By the way, my name is Josh.

        And C/C++/VB.NET/PHP/ASP.NET/TCL/TK don't conflict with each other.  They're more or less all in the same family.  <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>/<a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a>/<a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>/<a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>/<a href="ErlangLanguage.html">ErlangLanguage</a>/<a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> all conflict with each other. ;)  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>
