        Product Owner
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a>, the <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> prioritizes the <a href="ProductBacklog.html">ProductBacklog</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> of Scrum is somewhat analogous to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>'s <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a>. One obvious difference: The <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> is usually part of the development organization and has a customer of his/her own. The product owner solely controls the <a href="ProductBacklog.html">ProductBacklog</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> also federates the interests of all business stakeholders, users, etc., so should be empowered to make final arbitrary decisions with respect to priority.  This is especially important if there are many customers.  If the "true Product Owner" of a project has delegated the <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> aspect of the role, that person must be able to make decisions with quick turnaround time.  
      </p>
      <p>
        A well-trained <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> is a key to success in a <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a> project.
