        I live on Martha's Vineyard with my wife Sheryl (an actor at the Vineyard Playhouse -- <a href="http://www.mvy.com/playhouse.html)">http://www.mvy.com/playhouse.html)</a> and my 4-year-old son Eli.  I telecommute four days a week to State Street Bank in Boston; the fifth day I go to Boston for meetings, hanging out, and generally keeping in touch with the office stuff.  It's a 3-hour commute, but it's worth it.  Programming experience includes C++, Objective-C, and Visual Basic.  Java is next, and I won't write a line of application code unless I've written the tests first.
