        The <a href="PatternPrimitives.html">PatternPrimitives</a> page was prompted by the question "What are patterns made of?", it's not a definitive answer. More like a sketch of a beginning of an answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The question will strike some as ridiculous, after all a
        pattern is an emergent property, irreducible, remove any
        part and the pattern vanishes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also the whole page brings into question many of the assumptions made by the alexandrine style of formal patterns that has such a history here.

        Are the concepts listed above patterns in their own right that we have used so much that we no longer consider them patterns? --<a href="LarryPrice.html">LarryPrice</a>

      <p>
        Perhaps all design patterns can be boiled down to selections between two choices:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Add indirection to manage flexibility
        </li>
        <li>
           Remove indirection to improve performance
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Kinds of indirection:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reification
        </li>
        <li>
           Polymorphism
        </li>
        <li>
           Delegate to method(s)
        </li>
        <li>
           Delegate to object(s)
        </li>
        <li>
           Record and defer
        </li>
        <li>
           Reference indirection
        </li>
        <li>
           Conditionals
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Things that can be redirected:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Data flow
          <ul>
            <li>
               Object references
            </li>
            <li>
               Object creation
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Control flow
          <ul>
            <li>
               Queries
            </li>
            <li>
               Commands
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>Very nice classification approach -- which patterns fail to fit anywhere?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Which patterns describe <em>removing</em> indirection?
      </p>
      <p>
        Several of the <a href="RefactoringPatterns.html">RefactoringPatterns</a>, such as <a href="InlineMethod.html">InlineMethod</a>, remove unnecessary indirection.  Also some <a href="OptimizationPattern.html">OptimizationPattern</a>s   remove indirection to improve performance.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are some thoughts about this in the pattern detection research field.  There's a paper [1] that uses "fragments" which include "classes, methods, parameters, using relations, inheritance relations, and containment relations."
