        <em>You can also get rid of those dependencies by using a "hidden" variable to pass the </em><a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> around, such that only users of the <a href="ContextObject.html">ContextObject</a> are even aware that it exists. Example hidden variables include <a href="SpecialVariable.html">SpecialVariable</a>s and <a href="ThreadLocalStorage.html">ThreadLocalStorage</a>; more generally, <a href="ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext.html">ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext</a> describes many such tactics.

      </p>
      <p>
        There are at least two general approaches to context information: Singletons and dependency injection.
        But if you write a library or framework and don't know your clients beforehand or really have different clients, then you run into trouble with both.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead I use the ThreadLocal pattern to define context values. My code looks like this
      </p>
      <code>
        class SomeObjectUsedInForeignCode  {<br/>
        Context<Log> LOG = Context.of(new DefaultLog(), Log.class);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void someMethodCalledDeeplyInForeignCode() {<br/>
        LOG.get().log("doing it");<br/>
        doWhatIsNecessary();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This library code can safely log output using the default Log and still be configured to use a different logging method should the client wish so:
      </p>
      <code>
        Context.runWith(new CustomLog(), Log.class, new Runnable() { void run() {<br/>
        doSomeVeryComplicatedTasksWhichUltimatelyCallMyAboveMethod();<br/>
        }});<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        During the whole execution of the Runnable will the LOG Context provide the CustomLog(). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Caveat: Every call LOG.get() variable will access a ThreadLocal and thus this approach has a certain performance penalty. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> and setting a Log variable is faster, but to be able to use it you must inject essentially <strong>all</strong> variables - otherwise you are unable to later inject a variable in a sub sub sub object. Thats why DependencyInjectionIsaVirus: You can use it all or nothing. In a library I cannot use it.

        The preferred solution to this problem is of course the following functional pearl: <a href="http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf">http://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~ccshan/prepose/prepose.pdf</a>
        Sadly this cannot be done in Java; the nearest one could get would be to let a <a href="ClassLoader.html">ClassLoader</a> distinguish context instances.
