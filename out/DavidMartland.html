        I am currently trying to explore new ways of communication, and trying not to become, or avoid being, a <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also investigating the use of message boards as a communication medium, and trying to use these as a way of stimulating interest in a course on UML and OO - see <a href="http://pub56.ezboard.com/fumlwizardsfrm2">http://pub56.ezboard.com/fumlwizardsfrm2</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am investigating Wikis, and using Wikipedia ( www.wikipedia.org ) as an interesting example.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also want to be able to test out Wikis with students from my classes (and others), and locally (at Kingston) we might set up a Wiki server - though as yet we have to decide on this, and how to go about it, and what might be the best software to use. There may be features which we'd like to implement in Wikis which are not in any of the Wikis so far available - we'll let you know when these are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following my earlier experiences with this Wiki, I'm somewhat wary of setting up too many pages, but it seems to me that this is not the best page for communication with me. I suggest that if you want to communicate with me, you look at TalkWithDavidMartland - I will move all the current comments to that page.
      </p>
      <p>
        While we get set up, I may try the experiment of implementing DavidMartlandsWikiWorkArea which can be used by any student, or indeed just anyone. I hope that this won't cause any problems. Obviously it did offend some people, so it's now gone. When I get our own Wiki set up this sort of experimentation may very well be encouraged - but that'll be another world, another time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still sticking with these things, so now there is a Wiki called <a href="UmlWiki.html">UmlWiki</a> installed on <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> at www.seedwiki.com.
        Naturally the focus is on UML and OO matters, and it also gives some guidance about how to develop basic Wiki skills.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to monitor changes on the Wiki, look at <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, though why it doesn't order the changes in reverse order like <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> I can't imagine!  <em>redundant.  see </em><a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A recent discovery has been weblogs, so see mine at <a href="http://dave2002.pitas.com">http://dave2002.pitas.com</a> and <a href="http://www.testmysite2002.blogspot.com/">http://www.testmysite2002.blogspot.com/</a> (currently the first of these is better developed... but ...)

        I have just been to Albuquerque in the USA and am currently in a meeting about BEEP!
