        Extreme Xmas
      </h1>
      <p>
        The holiday season (which currently runs from Labor Day through the
        first weekend of January) is intended to be a time of peace, joy, and good
        fellowship. In practice, though, it is too often a time of stress,
        excess, and manic activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ExtremeXmas.html">ExtremeXmas</a> (XX) is a pattern language to help manage the holiday parties,
        for both host and guest. Below are brief descriptions of the XX patterns:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Stand Up Feeding</strong>: Afraid your guests will never leave? Hide your chairs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Hair Programming</strong>: Getting a permanent or a short, simple cut before the holidays can save a lot of valuable preparation time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Unit Fests</strong>: Avoid mixing social friends with co-workers. Have separate, smaller parties for each.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Contractor Mercilessly</strong>: Consider hiring a caterer for your party, a decorator for your home, a shopper for your business gifts. It's money well spent if it's the only way to stay sane.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Do The Simplest Thing You Can't Possibly Shirk</strong>: Beware of agreeing to help with the office party. Never sign up to bring the turkey when they still need more paper plates.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>You Aren't Gonna Knead It</strong>: Home-made stoellen? Fruitcake from Grandma's old recipe? Get serious! Don't exhaust yourself baking seasonal treats at home; buy them at a good local bakery.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Ounce And Only Once</strong>: A hangover may be a badge of honor for a college student, but everyone who isn't immortal should drink only in moderation. And use a light hand when flavoring that eggnog.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Accuser Stories</strong>: Sure, gossip is fun, but is it really in keeping with the spirit of the season? Steer conversations to less prurient topics, and a better time will be had by all.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>The Tanning Game</strong>: Avoid the hassles altogether. Spend the holidays in the Caribbean.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Finally:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>They're Just Fools</strong>: Yes, everyone else is embarrassed by the behavior at their family get-togethers, too. Learn to let it go.
        </li>
      </ul>
