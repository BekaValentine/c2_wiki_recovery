        <a href="HallmarkPeople.html">HallmarkPeople</a> are those folks who write in flowery language suitable for a greeting card, but questionable in technical forums or other professional contexts.  They have a melodramatic writing style that when you first read it seems to elevate their normally plain observations into something poetic and profound.  Subsequent readings are progressively more annoying.
