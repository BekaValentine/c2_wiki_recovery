        <a href="BackPack.html">BackPack</a> seems to be a <a href="NextGenerationWiki.html">NextGenerationWiki</a>. It brings unique take on a wiki, using several datatypes and freeform entry.

Backpack supports todo lists, raw content (marked up with the wiki-like Textile markup), remote and local images, and reminders that are actually sent to your phone and email. It can also receive and store emails for pages, and allows blog-like "notes" to be added with a date and timestamp.
