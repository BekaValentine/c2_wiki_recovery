        Sign Of Insecurity In Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        When I see comments for accessors or case statements, I think of possible code smells. Looks like it's a sign of insecurity which comes together with poorly written code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some justification for that?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some places where it's appropriate are where you have to deal with code from different organizations, or they will have to deal with your code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Comments are an insecure <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>? I can't understand that position at all - can you explain? Surely you aren't advocating <a href="SecurityThroughObscurity.html">SecurityThroughObscurity</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The author means 'insecure' in an entirely different sense. To summarize the position, when a programmer feels the need to use a comment in their program, it indicates that the intent of the code isn't clear on its own, and therefore, something's wrong. Please read </em><a href="TreatCommentsWithSuspicion.html">TreatCommentsWithSuspicion</a> for more.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So comments are not insecure as in "hacker resistant", but insecure as in "the code is probably borked"? I suppose it depends on the type of comments. I can't see that commenting for auto-doc tools, or algorithm descriptions are a design smell, but I don't think that's what the author is referring to.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, the author is suggesting that presence of comments doesn't indicate the </em>'code<strong> is insecure.  they indicate the </strong>programmer<em>' is insecure.</em>
