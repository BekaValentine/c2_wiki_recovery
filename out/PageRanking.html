      <p>
        Got this from a wiki user:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>There's a ton of information here. Is there any way the pages can be ranked, say by number of views?  <em>see </em><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/topten?do=counts&do=wiki''">http://c2.com/cgi/topten?do=counts&do=wiki''</a>  Perhaps also a user rank. For example, <a href="http://vim.sf.net/">http://vim.sf.net/</a> has a bunch of scripts that can be downloaded. It tracks them by number of downloads and a "karma" factor - users are allowed to rate them on a scale of quality as being -1, 0 or 1. So this works like good user feedback on the quality of a given script.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Any thoughts?
