        Manage Micromanaging Sadists
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Note:</strong> <em>Before</em> you read the following, let me make this clear - this page <em>does not</em> mean to imply that all bosses are bad.  However, there <em>are</em> bosses who have toxic personalities.  You should not have to live with a boss like that - in my humble opinion. Life is just too damn short.
      </p>

        As mentioned in <a href="MicromanagingSadist.html">MicromanagingSadist</a>, it's best to get away from the company of these characters.  However, if you insist on sticking it out, here's some things to try:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WorkToRule.html">WorkToRule</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Document everything that happens to you
        </li>
        <li>
           Stay calm, always. If you let them get to you, you make them extremely happy
        </li>
        <li>
           Never be in a meeting alone with a sadist, <em>never</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           CC every piece of email to someone else that's involved in the project
        </li>
        <li>
           Be a class act. Always act super cheerful and positive with everyone you work with (when the sadist complains about you, others will think that he/she is nuts - which of course he/she is)
        </li>
        <li>
           Update your resume and start sending it out. <em>Do it now - don't put this off because "things might get better next week, next month, next millennium...".</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

        I didn't say that <em>good</em> managers are sadists.  I'm saying that managers that micromanage programmers are bad managers.  You <em>can't</em> be happy with that type of manager. Notice point 6 - be a class act. That's important. I'm not saying don't follow what the boss says (he/she <em>is</em> the boss after all).  But note that with <a href="MicromanagingSadist.html">MicromanagingSadist</a>s, nothing you do will ever, ever be right.
