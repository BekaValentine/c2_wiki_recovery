        Test Suite Consistency Check
      </h1>
      <p>
        Accidents happen. Tests get deleted by accident. The test runner may have bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is good to have <a href="TestPositiveConfirmation.html">TestPositiveConfirmation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is good to have simple, easily verified, consistency checks for a large test suite.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a> pattern is one example of such a consistency check.
      </p>
      <p>
        An even simpler <a href="TestSuiteConsistencyCheck.html">TestSuiteConsistencyCheck</a> is to report the number of tests run, passed, failed, etc., in the hope that the human or tool running the test would notice if the number of tests run has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, preferably, your test runner / ContinuousBuild environment can detect when the number of tests have diminished, and alarm the appropriate personnel.
