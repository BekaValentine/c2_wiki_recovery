      <p>
        British marxist satirist best known for his "Who's that fat bastard?" tagline.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Didn't you kill my brother?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Also portrayed the character "Brian Damage" in an episode of "The Young Ones."
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, he played half a dozen characters in "The Young Ones" -- Brian Damage, their landlord, the South African vampire, etc. He doesn't have nearly enough exposure in the US.

        His book "Train to Hell" is also hilarious in parts (especially the illustrations).
        Since my job involves me dealing with mortality statistics the A.S. sketch
        that sticks in my mind is the show which starts off with him discussing
        heredity and mortality;
        "So, you are most likely to die from what ever your grandparents died of.
        This makes me perfectly safe unless I get met by a horde of rampaging cossacks."
      </p>
      <p>
        (The end of the sketch is predictable)
