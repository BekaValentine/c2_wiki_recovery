        A pioneer in providing <a href="OnlineInformationServices.html">OnlineInformationServices</a>: started as a skunkworks project within HRBlock as a way to make better use of offpeak network bandwidth in 1979; acquired by <a href="AmericaOnline.html">AmericaOnline</a> in 1997. Provided an early feel for what was to come in the Internet with discussion groups, on-line software upgrades and trials, multimedia file posting areas, and email.  Many people who were active in <a href="CompuServe.html">CompuServe</a> forums feel that they, when used with offline readers such as TapCis (nee ZapCis) or OzWin, were superior in functionality and community building to Web or Usenet alternatives.
