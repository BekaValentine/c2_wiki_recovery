        Zcdsf File Format
      </h1>
      <p>
        See <a href="AlternativesToXml.html">AlternativesToXml</a>. ZCDSF is data serialization format, like XML, JSON, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages includes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No reserved words.
        </li>
        <li>
           External encoding, rather than Unicode.
        </li>
        <li>
           Comments starts with # meaning that a shebang line is possible if you want it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Has support for macros.
        </li>
        <li>
           Uses delimiters instead of indentation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Support namespaces.
        </li>
        <li>
           Support references to other parts of the data; these aren't the same as making copies of the data, they are more like pointers.
        </li>
        <li>
           External datatype support by use of "host macros".
        </li>
        <li>
           Implementation in 35K (this is the size of a Windows executable including the library and a small example program, so the actual implementation is smaller).
        </li>
        <li>
           It is cleaner than XML.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disadvantage:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Numbers are limited to 64-bits.
        </li>
        <li>
           Some error checking is missing from the implementation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Implementation isn't quite completely tested.
        </li>
        <li>
           The format does not check the schema.
        </li>
        <li>
           Some people hate it.
        </li>
        <li>
           The computer will not understand what you mean if you try to use VT100 line drawing to enclose an object.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is difficult to put pictures in it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Less common.
        </li>
      </ul>
