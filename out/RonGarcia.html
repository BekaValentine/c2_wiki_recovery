      <p>
        Howdy.  I'm a student at the University of Notre Dame.  I just completed a M.S. in  Electrical Engineering, and am now pursuing a Ph.D in Computer Science and Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm very interested in software engineering practices.  Specifically, I have been studying <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> and practicing Object Oriented Programming
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm also very interested in the process of training effective software developers and project leaders -- ie, what skills/attitudes should be instilled in both of the above to make them effective.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've recently been reading a lot about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, and have begun to implement some of the prescribed practices in my C++ development. I'm learning a great amount about the process of mapping XP-style development practices to C++. perhaps I'll write some of them up someday...
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary language at this time is C++, which I have spent the last 1.5 years studying rather intently.
