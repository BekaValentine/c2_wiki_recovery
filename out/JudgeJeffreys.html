        Judge Jeffreys
      </h1>
      <p>
        George, 1st Baron Jeffreys (1648-89), Privy Councillor and sometime Lord Chief Justice of England. Known as the <em>Hanging Judge</em> for his vigorous approach to criminal law. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the strength of this reputation Jeffreys was chosen by King James II/VII to teach the Duke of Monmouth's followers a lesson. He tried over three hundred Protestant rebels and hanged seventy-four of them at the "Bloody Assizes".
      </p>
      <p>
        Come the Glorious Revolution and the installation of the (Protestant) William and Mary as joint monarchs [sic] Jeffreys tried to flee the country in disguise. He was recognised while in the pub now called the Town Of Ramsgate, was seized by a lynch-mob, rescued by the militia and lived the remainder of his life within the Tower of London.

        There was a time in British history that <a href="JudgeJeffreys.html">JudgeJeffreys</a> (sometimes "Jeffries", spelling was a craft more than a science in the C17)  word was final and normally fatal.

        Any resemblance to any other historical figure who may, for instance, have contributed numerous interjections, judgments and sweeping generalisations on Wiki, which are widely credited for wiping out a whole generation of budding methodologists intent on providing for their families using <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> ...

      <p>
        any such resemblances are far too good to miss, now that I come to think of it.
