        Mutually Encapsulated Software System

      <p>
        A <a href="MutuallyEncapsulatedSoftwareSystem.html">MutuallyEncapsulatedSoftwareSystem</a> combines a grand vision with extraordinary arrogance, resulting in a closed environment that demands a virtually complete intellectual reboot as its entry price. A <a href="MutuallyEncapsulatedSoftwareSystem.html">MutuallyEncapsulatedSoftwareSystem</a> is, out of the box, compatible with NOTHING. It requires hard work and patience to make it cooperate in any way with its surrounding context. Here are some typical characteristics:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Does not conform to clipboard protocol
        </li>
        <li>
          Doesn't use standard fonts
        </li>
        <li>
          Doesn't use native UI resources
        </li>
        <li>
          Doesn't support common protocols
        </li>
        <li>
          Takes over the entire display
        </li>
        <li>
          Uses all of the available memory
        </li>
        <li>
          Doesn't use any existing system resources (printer drivers, network connections, sound cards, and so on).
        </li>
      </ul>

        The canonical example of the <a href="MutuallyEncapsulatedSoftwareSystem.html">MutuallyEncapsulatedSoftwareSystem</a> was Smalltalk-80, as published by Xerox in the early 1980's. Most <a href="MutuallyEncapsulatedSoftwareSystem.html">MutuallyEncapsulatedSoftwareSystem</a>s suffer an early and quiet death -- they are more abundant in academic and internal corporate R&D departments.
