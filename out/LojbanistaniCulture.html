        The culture of Lojbanistan.

        <em>xu ti poi ke'a papri ku'o cu sa'u</em>  -- Hope this means what I want it to mean. ;)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           stop using papri for web stuff. it's malglico.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>sa'u</em> is not a <em>selbri</em>, so we don't understand you. Maybe you meant <em>sampu</em>.

        To say something is Lojbanic, <em>lobykai</em>, is to assert that this is more
        natural to Lojban, or will become so, in comparison with some alternative.
        Some think using large (multi-part) <em>tanru</em> is more <em>lobykai</em> than trying
        to create a precise <em>lujvo</em> for every part of your (English) meaning. A
        minority opinion would go even farther, & assert that the <em>lobykai</em> utterance
        is that which most closely approximates the "four-word sentence"...
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been observed that the <em>gismu</em> are semantically broad, like Latin words, & that understood portions of an utterance can be elided (e.g. pronouns) like both Latin & Japanese; but attempts at a Lojbanic style based on this have not met with unilateral approval among the community. Still, no alternatives to
        date have been offered...
