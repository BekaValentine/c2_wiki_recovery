        Vbe Xtreme Team
      </h1>
      <p>
        The VB Extreme Team is a team of 6 developers (currently) founded by <a href="SteveJorgensen.html">SteveJorgensen</a> so that its members can practice and learn <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> on a real project.  The team meets one full day per week, and does as much of a complete <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> process as possible, given that they must do things like put on the CustomerHat, etc.  For running tests, the team is using <a href="VbLiteUnit.html">VbLiteUnit</a>, also written by <a href="SteveJorgensen.html">SteveJorgensen</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The product that the team is producing is a set of tools to make it easier to do better quality software development with <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, <a href="VisualBasicForApplications.html">VisualBasicForApplications</a>, and <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>.  At this time, the focus is on VBA and using a <a href="MixedCodeGeneration.html">MixedCodeGeneration</a> system to help manage duplicated code that cannot be easily factored out any other way, such as <a href="ErrorHandling.html">ErrorHandling</a> code.
      </p>

        There is a <a href="WebLog.html">WebLog</a> to chronicle the progress of the VB Extreme Team at <a href="http://timestream.net/learningxp.">http://timestream.net/learningxp.</a>
