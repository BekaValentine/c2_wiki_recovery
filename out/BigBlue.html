        Anyone seen reports of companies replacing (not supplementing) <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> setup with Java, Microsoft or another setup in order to reduce development and operation costs for computing?

        Back in the days when <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> was the number 1 company, it helped <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> get started with MSDOS on its IBMPC. Around 1990 the two companies started to go separate ways when MS launched its <a href="WindowsOperatingSystems.html">WindowsOperatingSystems</a> v3. The rest is history.

        I can't tell you how many times I've heard, "Noone ever got fired for buying Blue".  Never fails to evoke a sigh of despair from me.
