        Are there any <a href="JavaScriptIde.html">JavaScriptIde</a>s? Or even better, any <a href="WebsiteIde.html">WebsiteIde</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        I've tried
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="MicrosoftFrontPage.html">MicrosoftFrontPage</a>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None seem to provide what I would expect. Like any other IDE, here's what I look for in a "reasonable" <a href="JavaScriptIde.html">JavaScriptIde</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Class/Method based browsing (like Smalltalk or <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Integrated debugger
        </li>
        <li>
           Dynamic code evaluation (select and attempt to execute as <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> any text fragment)
        </li>
        <li>
           Variable monitoring
        </li>
        <li>
           Incremental Compilation (ability to change and recompile method without restarting)
        </li>
        <li>
           Dynamic cross-references:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Senders of the selected method
            </li>
            <li>
               Senders of methods invoked by the selected method
            </li>
            <li>
               Implementers of the selected method
            </li>
            <li>
               Implementers of methods invoked by the selected method
            </li>
            <li>
               References to the selected instance variable
            </li>
            <li>
               References to the selected class variable
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Automated File Management (I think about objects and methods, the <a href="JavaScriptIde.html">JavaScriptIde</a> takes care of exporting and importing whatever files are needed)
        </li>
        <li>
           Reliable Browser Targeting (Allow me to specify browsers and browser versions, flag code that isn't supported or doesn't work)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nice-to have's (cool but perhaps not absolutely necessary) include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Language-based version management (<a href="EnvyDeveloper.html">EnvyDeveloper</a>-style)
        </li>
        <li>
           Integrated dependency/prerequisite management
        </li>

           <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>-style team development features
        </li>
        <li>
           Automated configuration management
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, it seems that it would be not too difficult for such a <a href="JavaScriptIde.html">JavaScriptIde</a> to include a Smalltalk-style reflective metastructure, to ease the burden of typing all the extra stuff required to conform to the <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> 1.2 object stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        It occurs to me that <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> might provide a good starting point for such a tool, but I say that with very little exposure to either <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> or other <a href="JavaScriptIde.html">JavaScriptIde</a>s that might exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can anyone point towards some reasonable tools?
        The Mozilla people should be able to help, they seem to use <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> a lot.

        Writing <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>/XUL using Borland <a href="CodeWright.html">CodeWright</a> is actually not too bad (tried many, that's what I settled on). <a href="CodeWright.html">CodeWright</a> is a "programmer's editor" where you can specify project files and mix and match languages. It is not a full-featured IDE for any language, but it has decent support for most. It also has a "vi" mode which I like. Here are the levels of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> support from your list (anything not mentioned is not available AFAIK): 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Class/Method based browsing: 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There is a generic browser called "Outline" which can be "coerced" to display prototype information using Regular Expressions. For example, I have been able to get <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> function names on the browser (of the type  "Class.prototype.functionName = function()") by entering a regular expression that is matched to each line. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Integrated debugger
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None. But I use <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a> and <a href="VenkmanDebugger.html">VenkmanDebugger</a>. <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> debugging would be tricky because of the many differences in implementations. I can't live without Venkman.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Dynamic code evaluation (select and attempt to execute as <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> any text fragment)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        None. But there's a Perl and a Basic-like API language and evaluator. It is used to create macros for the language itself and works very well.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Dynamic cross-references
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I know it's not the same, but when you right-click on a symbol on Codewright you get a "Find in (Project Files, Project Space, Open files...). The find is very fast and I find it sufficient to do that type of work.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Language-based version management (<a href="EnvyDeveloper.html">EnvyDeveloper</a>-style)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It supports 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's some stuff I have also found useful and it's not on your list:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Syntax Highlighting: Full support on <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> files. XUL files can be mapped as "XML" with some modifications (see below).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Embedded languages: I use <a href="MozillaXul.html">MozillaXul</a> and XBL, which is like an XML with embedded <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. Using the very strong regex support I was able to tell <a href="CodeWright.html">CodeWright</a> that an XML file "in my world" can have <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> embedded in <script> tags. It will colorize the <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> inside my XUL files - it will even slightly change the background color on the <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> sections so I know what sections are which language.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Code Completion: 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I cheated and mapped the code completion to C language. The similarities make it good enough to get some measure of code completion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing I also like is that symbols on other open files (say, a XUL file with a bunch of elements) are also taken into account for your code completion. So if I have an open XUL file with an element with an id of id="myNeatoWidget", I can do on another <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> file (or in a <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> section on the same XUL file) document.getElementById("my<Ctrl-Space) and I will get it filled in. It has saved me a lot of time and possible element bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be honest on this, a gaping hole is that because the code completion is C and not "real" <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, it can't do code completion when I want to type myClass.myPrototypeFunction() even if there is a <a href="MyClass.html">MyClass</a>.prototype.myPrototypeFunction(). But the class browsing (and being able to right-click and search on my entire project) makes this not that big of a deal. Regular functions are of course completed just fine.

        As of 26Feb2004, there don't seem to be any great <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> IDEs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've looked at:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Cardinal <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> IDE beta 1.0 (the top link on Google for <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> IDE")

            </li>
            <li>
               A plugin for Eclipse. Has syntax highlighting, code formatting, method list. Limited autocomplete - it seems to complete standard <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> keywords, and variable and function names that you've already entered in the same file. Doesn't do intelligent autocompletion - ie I created a <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> object with some attributes, but the autocomplete didn't offer me those attributes when I accessed an instance of that object. Doesn't have any refactoring.

            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

            <li>
               Still downloading the 100MB of trial, so I don't know what it's like, yet. Last time I used Dreamweaver the only support for <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> editing was syntax highlighting, but it may do more now.
            </li>
            <li>
               Update: Dreamweaver MX 2004 still offers little more than syntax highlighting. Some basic autocompletion of standard <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> methods, but not as good as Harish Kataria's Eclipse plugin. Disappointing, especially given the price.

        I LOVE javascript. And I *love* the .NET framework for its powerful RAD features and useful class libraries. And I *love* Visual Studio, because it's the best all-around IDE on the planet; most people will agree with this (although I use Eclipse for everything that I can, which is basically just Java right now).
      </p>
      <p>
        And having said that, .NET has almost none of the features you're looking for. Personally, I write all JS code in anything with syntax highlighting, and only resort to <a href="VenkmanDebugger.html">VenkmanDebugger</a> if I get stuck. Otherwise, I have the same attitude towards Javascript that I do towards Lisp and Ruby -- if you stick to solid mostly-functional style, you don't need to do very much debugging other than very simple interactive debugging (which Venkman provides).
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that the idea of doing the kinds of things you're mentioning isn't likely to be that useful for a lot of js development, because a lot of js development takes advantage of the things that js offers that less dynamic languages (like C# and Java) do not -- and one of the biggest differences is that JS is NOT an object-oriented language. Correct me if I'm wrong, but aren't objects just closures (functions) in JS? Ie first-class functions that can close over other objects. So class/method browsing seems a little less useful there, or at any rate, it would look very different than what most compiled-language folks would expect (hey, I still do most of my work in compiled languages, more's the pity...).
      </p>
      <p>
        The most useful feature I want is something akin to Ruby's ability to reflect over EVERY object in memory, because for long-running javascript (ie really dynamic interfaces that use remoting calls and may not be actually refreshed in hours) you can generate a surprising amount of garbage if you're careless, even a noticeable amount. I would like to be able to reflect over the entire object space; I guess <a href="VenkmanDebugger.html">VenkmanDebugger</a> does this, but I'm confounded by the interface for it.
