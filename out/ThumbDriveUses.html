        Thumb Drive Uses
      </h1>
      <p>
        The use of USB hard drives, <a href="ThumbDrive.html">ThumbDrive</a>s, or <a href="UsbKeychainDrive.html">UsbKeychainDrive</a>s as they are often called, has grown tremendously. This page attempts to gather some uses for <a href="ThumbDrive.html">ThumbDrive</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the major benefits of a <a href="ThumbDrive.html">ThumbDrive</a> is portability - particularly between two different computers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some ways <a href="ThumbDrive.html">ThumbDrive</a>s are used by programmers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> - Swiki (<a href="http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki),">http://minnow.cc.gatech.edu/swiki),</a> or <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> - as a sourcecode repository, so <a href="LoneDeveloperProjectManagement.html">LoneDeveloperProjectManagement</a> can be synchronized between work and home
        </li>
        <li>
           Easy backup
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SneakerNet.html">SneakerNet</a> - holds much more than a floppy
        </li>
        <li>
           All Your Personal Settings On a Keychain (especially interesting together with a CD-only distribution like Knoppix - you can boot Linux with your own personal settings on a foreign computer without having to install anything on their disk)
        </li>
        <li>
           Pgp Keys On a Keychain
        </li>
        <li>
           Copy Cya Type Docs To Your Keychain to protect them from being deleted if you live in that kind of corporate environment
        </li>
        <li>
           Portable music archive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Portable digital photo album.  Include some kind of slideshow software (versions for OS X and Windows at least) and you'll have new dads and grandparents knocking your door down to buy one.
        </li>
        <li>
           Transport of antiviral software, patches, and worm cleanup tools around a department. <em>However, this can backfire badly unless you use a thumb drive with a "write protect switch".</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Stealing ICE from CIA (bad joke, from a movie that was a bad joke) see <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292506/">http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0292506/</a>  Hackerish tells me that <strong>is</strong> a use, maybe not legal, but definitely a use. <em>On the other hand, the NOC list fits onto a floppy.</em> But of no good if you have a JammingPhone!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>booting</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Now, if they were bootable, that would be a handy rescue gadget!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some very recent BIOSes allow booting from a USB drive.  <a href="KnoppixLinux.html">KnoppixLinux</a> or similar would make it a complete solution.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Any commonly available laptop have that? And is it possible / desirable to create data files on the same <a href="ThumbDrive.html">ThumbDrive</a>? -- dl Sep04
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, you can put the boot file and data files on the same thumb drive. I've seen one person partition his thumb drive into a "programs" partition and a "data" partition.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If anyone has booted off a thumb drive -- tell us: How long did it take? One would hope that it would be practically "instant-on" compared to booting off floppies.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
           The ONLY backup for anyone like me who bought their computer years ago.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I can play DVDs but can't burn CDs.  Remember when 1.44MB was a lot of space?  
        Nowadays, even small media files are too big for floppies and I'd be lost without a thumbdrive.
