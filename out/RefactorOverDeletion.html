        Refactor Over Deletion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Instead of deleting the opinions of <em>others</em> (apart from obvious <a href="WikiVandals.html">WikiVandals</a>), try to incorporate it. You are always free to delete your own content, though note that it may not be good for everyone else to do so.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every addition should be seen as a message from the "collective consciousness", however poorly worded or organized.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unless it's the addition of a message from an individual, like this one. :-) </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone is free to <em>add</em> content, but once others have viewed it, their personal <a href="WorldView.html">WorldView</a> is now affected (you've collapsed their wave function!). Now you have to keep it, until the <a href="CreatorAsOwner.html">CreatorAsOwner</a> deletes it, or refactor it into the discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other <em>caveat</em> to this is that if there is an <em>absentee</em> "landlord" of a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> (no views for 120 days?), then others should be able to delete content.
      </p>
      <p>
        The true sign of a <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a> is that s/he can reduce a messy page to a much shorter, well-organized one without losing a single point.
