        Soup Pattern Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have actually seen a collection of patterns (which
        look suspiciously like they were inspired by <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>)
        in a cookbook devoted to soups (can't remember the name...).  They did not take the
        form of a language.  I am interested in developing a
        language which can lead me to successfully develop a soup
        in constrained situations (such as not enough time or
        missing ingredients, utensils or spices).
      </p>
      <p>
        If I can follow a recipe exactly, then a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>
        is less useful.  However, any ambiguities in the recipe can be
        addressed by the application of patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        As always, talking about cooking leads me back to software
        development:  How about software development pattern
        languages that takes into account constraints such as time
        limitations or lack of resources?
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>'s Mercenary Analyst[1]  (Pattern 23 in
        Chapter 13 of
        <a href="PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign.html">PatternLanguagesOfProgramDesign</a>) instructs me to hire a
        technical writer.  A great idea, but what if I can't do
        that? Can I continue to cook without that ingredient?
