        Michael's Laws:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1) Patterns are no surrogate for human intuition and creativity.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2) Overload of patterns in your software architecture implies overload of problems in your system. However, not using patterns where applicable may make your life extremely unpleasant.
      </p>
      <p>
        (3) If you just found a pattern, think again before bothering the rest of us!
      </p>
      <p>
        (4) Patterns are your best friends if they are treated with friendliness in your architecture design.
      </p>
      <p>
        (5) It is easy to become a pattern author but it is surprisingly hard to write a good pattern description.
      </p>
      <p>
        (6) Beware of Murphy's Laws when applying patterns.
