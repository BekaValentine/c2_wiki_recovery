        Wiki Is An Associative Store
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <strong>associative store</strong> <em>associates</em> a key with its related data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some real world examples are dictionaries, encyclopedias, phone books, and library card catalogs to name just a few.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiIsNotaDictionary.html">WikiIsNotaDictionary</a>... agreed. Since a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> is a combination of two or more regular words, the diction for these can more than likely be looked up in the common dictionary. However, Wiki is a <em>definitionary</em>. If it were not, it would serve little purpose. Why click on a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> unless you were interested in what someone (or the community) thought the combination meant?

        The database behind Wiki is an associative store, but Wiki is not its backing store; it's more than that.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've intentionally not elaborated on "more", and thereby avoided approaching <em>definition</em> of Wiki. Still, this page has meaning and value (to some). Meanings are allowed to exist in the absence of definitions, and that's a feature, not a bug.

        Note that the classical ISA relationship implies a superset operation. For example, "a dog is a canine" or a "cat is a mammal". Yes, the Wiki <em>is</em> 'more' than an associative store as a dog is <em>more</em> than a canine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Does not a meaning of or value of a name define it?
      </p>
      <p>
        btw, WikiIsaGem has significantly more value than WikiIsNotaDump.

        There does not exist an x such that for all y ((x isa y) containsMoreMeaningThan (x isNotA y)). Though, for all y (if and only if((x isa y) containsMoreMeaningThan (not x isa y)) then ((the size of the intersection of (z where z isa x) and (Z where Z isa y)) isLessThan (the size of the intersection of (z where z isa x) and (Z where Z isNotA y)))).
      </p>
      <p>
        Less pseudo-formally, the statements "has significantly more meaning than", "containsMoreMeaningThan" implied that the first is more specific than the second. As a counter example to assertions being more meaningful than negations, which contains more meaning "Wiki is a man-made artifact" or "Wiki is not a Dictionary"? Nearly universally in human speech, negations also act as assertions: saying "Wiki is not a dictionary" implies that it IS a member of the superset of dictionary "information storage medium". If this is a peculiarity of human language I am not sure. It seems quite universal to me, but I am a human after all.

        Oops. I don't quite get the full picture of your formal construction. Could I translate the semantics (meaning) like so:? ISA relationships normally point to more general classes. ISnotA relationships regularly lead to contradictions. Positive assertions grant more information to the reader. -- gl

        Could not <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s themselves make relationships more explicit ie <a href="EverythingIsa.html">EverythingIsa</a> already exists though it is more for fun, Category pages etc. But you could have a PartOf page listing things that are components of each other e.g. that <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> is PartOf <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> (<em>except that it's not</em> [ok HasA then that's the point...detail nuances]), detailing the nuances of the connection. <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is similar it links pages to time and author but such WikiWordRelationships would be user defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The point is that the use of a </em><a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> on a page indicates<em> some sort of </em>relationship or association. Where appropriate, the nature of the association can be given using specific semantic pointers<em> (words). </em>Unless the <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s function is upgraded to give the option to refine by LinkType, there is marginal utility, generally, in formalising the concept. In the example given, the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> provides the home for information about <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>s in the context of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes but some words are more noun (objects, classes) than adjectives, verbs or prepositions (relations) I'm just thinking if there was a convention for distinguishing them at a glance it might be helpful. There's a reason <a href="CirclesBoxesAndArrows.html">CirclesBoxesAndArrows</a> aren't all just circles. Yes you can parse the word, open it up, look at the context but that is not "at a glance".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It might be helpful. Why don't you try it and see if anyone begs you to stop. I'll just put a little placeholder here for the </em>PleasePleaseDontAssociativelyOrganizeEveryPageOnWiki debate... [LinkType:PleasePlease]<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Far be it from me to try start a fad but isn't that part of (sorry PartOf <em></em>AlignedWith, InspiredBy? Can't be PartOf just yet<em>) the goal of the </em><a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a> - be more explicit about relations?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I meant it when I said: "try it and see". If people think it's useful, they'll try it too. If they don't, they'll suggest a preferable alternative (which may be leaving things as they are). My own view is that it has marginal utility, but I've been wrong many times before...</em>

        The 2nd ref works for sure. Quite a compilation. I am currently working on some AI support for that database. It sure would be cool to download the Wiki and see how many of the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s can be incorporated. <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> may approve the content copy to that school. A "Diction"ary (pronunciation key) would be a valuable addition also. -- gl
