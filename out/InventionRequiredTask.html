        Invention Required Task
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="InventionRequiredTask.html">InventionRequiredTask</a> is a task that contains at least one element that has never been done before and that nobody knows how to do. The effort to complete such a task is, by construction, unpredictable -- because "inventing" is a creative act that is, in a technical context, highly constrained.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes an <a href="InventionRequiredTask.html">InventionRequiredTask</a> can take hours -- and sometimes years. <a href="InventionRequiredTask.html">InventionRequiredTask</a> is not a synonym for "long" or "hard". The phrase characterizes the predictability of the task, not its duration or effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, it is used in contrast to "<a href="StraightForwardTask.html">StraightForwardTask</a>" or "<a href="TrivialTask.html">TrivialTask</a>".
