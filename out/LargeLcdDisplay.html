        My <a href="IdealUmlCaseTool.html">IdealUmlCaseTool</a> would be an electronic whiteboard, a combination of a <strong>large</strong> LCD display and a cordless digitizer pen. See <a href="http://www.wacom.com/productinfo/pl300.html">http://www.wacom.com/productinfo/pl300.html</a> for a small example, a 10-inch 1024x768 LCD display with integrated cordless digitizer pen. That's too small still, but make it say 20-inch and double the resolution and we'd already have something rather useful. Wall-sized would be even better. Imagine a whiteboard where you could save your diagrams, recall and edit them later, and paste them into design documents and <a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a> presentations. -- <a href="DavidPrice.html">DavidPrice</a>

        Put the digitizer on the table and the view on the LCD or projected on a screen or wall and you have a product already quite good in making useful diagrams. It is called <a href="AutoCad.html">AutoCad</a>. It has been available to do this for over 15 years. And it can be programmed as well. There's no reason someone skilled in programming could not make it behave as a Wiki does. Let's call it <a href="CadWiki.html">CadWiki</a>! -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
