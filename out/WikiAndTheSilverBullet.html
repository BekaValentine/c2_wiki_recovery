        Wiki And The Silver Bullet

        So it took a couple of days to implement <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a>.  It could have more features, but I'm trying to keep it simple.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider a project to build such a system fifteen years ago.  We want:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Collaboration between any number of people
        </li>
        <li>
           Support threadmode and collaborative authoring, and allow people to go back and refactor existing work
        </li>
        <li>
           Accessible from almost anywhere on the world
        </li>
        <li>
           Client and server that run on Microsoft and several Unix variants.
        </li>
        <li>
           Quick searching of the whole database
        </li>
        <li>
           Hypertext links and back-links
        </li>
        <li>
           Simple enough to use in a few minutes with little training
        </li>
        <li>
           Embed or link to graphics and other resources
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Almost certainly people would have imagined a much larger project running over a year; perhaps it might have become a <a href="HundredPersonProject.html">HundredPersonProject</a>.  (Consider Xanadu, for example: much more ambitious, but far slower.)  A decade or so later it's one person and a couple of days, because
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A very reusable infrastructure is in place in the Internet, web browsers, and web servers.
        </li>
        <li>
           Higher-level languages (Perl, Python) are more easily available.
        </li>
        <li>
           Faster machines allow simpler solutions, such as <a href="BruteForce.html">BruteForce</a> search of the database rather than maintaining indices and use of scripting languages.
        </li>
        <li>
           Common designs for web sites (and <a href="WikiClones.html">WikiClones</a> in particular) are reasonably well established.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, in a way we have achieved an improvement in productivity of several orders of magnitude, mostly through reuse.  I think also it's important to try to believe that there is a simple solution, and that you can get a surprising amount of functionality done in a week.  (c.f. the 'UnpluggableComputer' paper.)

        If I pick my problem to match a solution that already exists then I can solve the problem very quickly. If I want to build a blue two-story house then I can probably 'build' that house in a weekend, if I already have a white two-story house. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If I can convince myself and my family we'll be happy with a new kitchen and coat of paint rather than a whole new house we'll save a lot of money -- and in software the difference is even greater.

        I'm not sure whether "high level languages" make a difference. <a href="ThoughtsWeaver.html">ThoughtsWeaver</a> took "a single day using pretty standard Shell scripts and simple C++ programs." I doubt if it would have taken much longer in C, and Shell scripts have been around for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I'd put it all down to various kinds of reuse, and <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a>. And the reuse is mostly at the level of entire programs, not some wizzy fine-grained component architecture. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        It made a difference to me: if nothing else, it skips compiling, gives proper stack traces, and gives built-in power tools like regexps.  Many of these things have been around on unix for years, but it's only relatively recently that most PCs could get to the net. -- <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>
