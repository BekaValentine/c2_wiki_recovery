           Sep05 blog by an analyst who had Yankee Group / Aberdeen group experiences, after MS PDC 2005, at <a href="http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1879">http://blogs.zdnet.com/BTL/?p=1879</a> made comments to these effects:
          <ul>
            <li>

               SOA is the art of modeling .. business processes. Went on to say "Business ... processes are .. volatile, ... subject to the judgment and whims of the human actors ..."

                   My interpretation is that they are arguing for an adaptive (evolving architecture), whereas commonly people equate architecture with blueprint, and one does not generally change blueprint once construction starts. CommentsPlease
