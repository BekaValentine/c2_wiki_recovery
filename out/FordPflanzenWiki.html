        Ford Pflanzen Wiki

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.fordpflanzen.de">http://www.fordpflanzen.de</a> is a German wiki with a skin that tries to eliminate some of the chaos that comes along with the wiki concept.
        It uses a kind of "menu" that contains links to the recently changed pages and the most visited pages.

        The content is somewhat private though. It is the story of 20 people that got to know each other nearly 20 years ago when they were apprentices at Ford Motor Company in Saarlouis, Germany. They stayed in contact ever since and create the content of this wiki together.
