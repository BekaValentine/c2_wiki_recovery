        Zope Application Server

      <p>
        Zope is an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> web <a href="ApplicationServer.html">ApplicationServer</a> that is a little bit like Domino. It is written in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, with performance-critical parts in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2014 there has been no release in 4 years, and the web site says: <a href="http://zope2.zope.org/">http://zope2.zope.org/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Zope is a legacy framework, which is kept alive to support existing applications built on top of it. It is no longer recommended to start new projects based on it, unless you are intimately familiar with the technology stack.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The "Six reasons for using Zope" page actually recommends against using it.

        <dd>Zope: A framework for publishing Python object hierarchies on the Web. With Zope, it's easy to set up a powerful interface to a database of web-based applications, by providing support for templates, interfaces to database engines, etc. If you're thinking about developing sophisticated web applications (as opposed to simple forms processing [...]), you should seriously investigate these tools.</dd>

           Zope provides a nice way to handle code templating, distributed page authoring, dynamic content and access control.  
        </li>
        <li>
           It doesn't really help you design pages as such.
        </li>
        <li>
           Co-authoring is an integral part of Zope, making it a good choice for content management systems.

        <strong>Performance / Scalability:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The basic Zope uses one machine and one filestore, so it has scale limits.  
        </li>
        <li>
           You can move content into a separate RDBMS, to extend the scale somewhat.  
        </li>
        <li>
           There is an add-on called ZEO which is the fully scalable version. In a recent announcement (Spring 2000) the authors of ZEO have announced that it is being released as <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> after a short testing program.

           You can do some neat things with it very easily, but there is a lot of functionality, and so it takes a lot of time to become proficient.

           The documentation is spotty--there is a fair bit of it, but it is spread out and not always well-organized.  Digital Creations has published the Zope Book online to help remedy this;

        <li>

        I'm curious if anyone who uses Zope also uses <a href="UserLand.html">UserLand</a>'s Frontier, and would be interested in commenting on how well they compare.  Obviously if you're a Python fan (I am), you might lean towards Zope.  I'm less interested obvious differences like that and want more end-user experiences with both. -- <a href="JohnPassaniti.html">JohnPassaniti</a>

        <em>Yes, at least one person uses both: the author of </em>ZopeFish <<a href="http://zopefish.weblogs.com/">http://zopefish.weblogs.com/</a>>.<em></em>

        From what I read about it, in addition to inheritance, Zope provides an inheritance-like abstraction mechanism called <a href="AcquisitionInheritance.html">AcquisitionInheritance</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's correct. Simply put - an object (eg a web page) in a folder has access to all the objects in that folder plus those in the folders above it (subject to security restrictions). Typically web pages in zope will use this to pull in standard headers and footers, logos or database access methods. You can also access the attributes of other objects and apply logic depending on the result. -- </em><a href="RichardMoon.html">RichardMoon</a><em></em>

        For the all-new Zope 3, implicit acquisition is pretty much going away in favour of explicit, largely because of the difficult-to-manage complexity that arises from ubiquitous acquisition.  See <a href="http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/FAQ">http://dev.zope.org/Wikis/DevSite/Projects/ComponentArchitecture/FAQ</a> for the high-level view.

        After a while, I started to get some clarity about acquisition:

        I am confused. Do we need Zope if we have <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> based <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a>? Or is Zope used for tasks unsuited for a <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a> (such as ....) ?

        Saw a nice demonstration of Zope (at the Saint Louis Unix User's Group). Strikes me as <strong>"an industrial strength wiki."</strong> Its operation is remarkably wiki-like, in that you can browse/add/change/delete content through the browser interface, and that your tools to build the Web site are simple (like a wiki) but robust.

      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, though Zope tends to use slighly older Python versions due to the need for security audits. As of 2007: both Zope 2 and Zope 3 are actively developed, with Zope 3 gradually becoming "the zope libraries" and Zope 2 becoming "the Zope application server, based on the zope libraries".
