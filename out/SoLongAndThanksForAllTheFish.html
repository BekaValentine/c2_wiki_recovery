        So Long And Thanks For All The Fish

        The fourth book in <a href="DouglasAdams.html">DouglasAdams</a> <a href="HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy.html">HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy</a> trilogy.

      <p>
        If you like tidy endings and warm fuzzy feelings, this is the "last" book in the "trilogy" (so, really, what do you call a five-book series??).
      </p>
      <p>
        If you prefer the pain of seeing where Adams took it before repenting, then read also "<a href="MostlyHarmless.html">MostlyHarmless</a>."  I wish I'd stopped at <a href="SoLongAndThanksForAllTheFish.html">SoLongAndThanksForAllTheFish</a> -- Adams died before he could repair the damage from "<a href="MostlyHarmless.html">MostlyHarmless</a>."  See editorial remarks in his (sort of) final work, <a href="TheSalmonOfDoubt.html">TheSalmonOfDoubt</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then just don't read <a href="MostlyHarmless.html">MostlyHarmless</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        And while you're at it, don't think of an elephant.
