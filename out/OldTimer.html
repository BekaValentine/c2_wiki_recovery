        Or used machines with drum memory? <em>Or tape cores, or magnitostrictive delay lines, or who still call "main memory" "core memory".

        Someone who keeps bringing up how oldTimer they are, about how they got started when (a) people still punched cards (or wrote programs on box-lined sheets so the "girls" in keypunch could type them in), (b) people had to enter the bootstrap program off the switches, (c) vaccuum tubes ("valves" in England, cf Hoyle's sfi The Black Cloud) kept the rooms warm in winter.

        Ooh, Yeah, load the octal boot address in the switches, hit swithes->E switch, hit E -> M switch, Load the op into the switches, hit switches -> E switch, hit store switch which increments the M automagically, ... <sigh> Oops, gotta go empty my drool cup.

        Speaking of greenbar, how about the number of carriage control tapes that you have punched? <em>Don't forget keypunch drum cards - Youthful old-timer (or am I just still ignorant?)</em>

        I started programming on an IBM 1620 in the Chem Eng Department at Cambridge University in about 1966. That had switches, numbered 1 to 4 which could be programmed in FORTRAN to control program flow. It also had a STOP button. Input was paper tape and it had a huge disk drive, bigger than a tub washing machine. Output was onto a heavy typewriter with a moving carriage.

        I can't go back so far so I'm a NotSoOldTimer - circa 1972 -- Magnetic Core Memory you could warm your hands over on a cold day and an IBM 360/40 ---CardStacker/Reader & Teletype Terminals at 110 Baud and the New fangled 300 Baud Video Terminals. Saying to the <a href="RadioShack.html">RadioShack</a> Store Owner - When the TRS-80 comes in, give me a call, I'll get it going for you. 4K RAM and a cassette recorder for a data and program storage device. Bought the second one he had - serial no in the 2000s. On to the Tandy 1000 and two 5 1/4 floppies - all the storage one could possibly need? The answer to the people who asked "what do you use a computer for" became "EVERYTHING".  BBSing using a 300 Baud Modem with manual switches. All this makes me appreciate the new 1.6Ghz Pentium 4 with 80 Gig Hard Drive and CD RW and a Cable Modem connected to the Internet.  What more could you possibly need? Yogi Berra might say it this way: I don't think we have seen nothing yet!!!
