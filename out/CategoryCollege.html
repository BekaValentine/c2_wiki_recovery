      <p>
        This category represents pages for institutes, colleges, universities and other institutions of higher learning, including public and private, geographical and virtual. The pages included reflect varied scopes, matters of learning and means and methods of instruction. They may be common only in the fact that they present studying opportunities for those normally past the seventeenth year of age and for those who have qualified themselves for entrance via testing or other entrance requirement fulfillments.
