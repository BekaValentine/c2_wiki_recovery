        System Programming With Xp
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was recently talking with Rok Sosic, CTO of TurboLinux and <a href="EricRaymond.html">EricRaymond</a> about Xp in a small cafe. Rok Sosic, who has a strong background in <a href="SystemProgramming.html">SystemProgramming</a>, wasn't very positive about Xp, though he admitted that Xp would work well with business applications. <a href="EricRaymond.html">EricRaymond</a> somehow agreed with him. Rok said of BDUF.

        And After that, I encountered by chance this fascinating interview with DavidCutler in the internet (<a href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/fromms/kanoarchitect.asp">http://www.microsoft.com/windows2000/server/evaluation/news/fromms/kanoarchitect.asp</a> 
        ). Some of his experience seemed to correpond to Xp principles, and some not. What do you think about <a href="SystemProgrammingWithXp.html">SystemProgrammingWithXp</a>? Has anyone tried Xp to system programming? --<a href="JuneKim.html">JuneKim</a>
