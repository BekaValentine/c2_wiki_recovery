        Wiki No Location Url Scheme
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="WikiNoLocationUrlScheme.html">WikiNoLocationUrlScheme</a> is a prefix <strong>wiki-no-location:</strong> which is prepended to a URL that retrieves a wiki page from some wiki server, and tells the browser to transform all links to <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> on that server into <strong>wiki:</strong> style URL's -- <a href="PhilipDorrell.html">PhilipDorrell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like this idea. Servers should be linked by WikiAdministrators. Then any page that is not locally defined in Wiki, instead of showing a "?" at the end, wiki should first search for the same page on the configured servers. This means that if site A has site B as backup server, then site B should have site A as backup server too. The protocol could do this automatically.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore when a site was added to a server, it would be added to a community of servers. The protocol should handle that ripple effect efficiently. Probably like RIP. This would be probably like reimplementing RIP on top of HTTP.
