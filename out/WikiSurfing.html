        It was suggested on <a href="WikiWalking.html">WikiWalking</a> that "Surfing implies being carried by some sort of imperative, unknowable force. The waves are marvels of physics, and have a volition of their own, unfathomable by human minds (without much preparation)."
      </p>
      <p>
        Whereas it is here suggested that <a href="WikiSurfing.html">WikiSurfing</a> is more appropriate <em>because</em> of that 'unfathomable' nature of <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> that is over and above an individual's contribution (<a href="SystemicThinking.html">SystemicThinking</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Surfing is also an appropriate term, because surfing requires a mastery of the 'unfathomable' and it is observed that when one loses respect for the PowerOfWiki, you invariably get dumped (<a href="AustralianCulturalAssumption.html">AustralianCulturalAssumption</a>? What's the common term for falling off a wave... WipedOut?).  What do you do next? Jump back on your SurfBoard with a newly acquired respect for <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> or leave <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> and head back to the beach to sunbathe?

        I know which one I prefer.

        P J O'Rourke talked about surfing the internet vs. lying on a towel next to it.

        He's a political commentator from USA? heh. Would like to see that quote.

        There is a cultural connection. Surfing is (as I understand it) a Hawaiian invention, and term <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is also Hawaiian.
