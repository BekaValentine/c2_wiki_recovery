        Not Invented Here Syndrome

        The common and often mistaken belief that something you invent (design, program) yourself is better than what others have invented.

      <p>

      <p>
        <em>Maybe a better analogy: Sufferers would often prefer to get paid while learning to play music instead of getting paid while picking up a few CDs...</em>
