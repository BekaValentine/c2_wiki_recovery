        "Agile" development is quite a buzzword these days -- if your project manager has structured work to following a development process based on XP, Scrum, Crystal, UP or MSF then you may be following an Agile method, but Agile itself is not a development process -- it is a set of principles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you have Agile principles?
