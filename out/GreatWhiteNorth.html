        We can't call it <em>Canadian Corner</em> for legal reasons, unless we spell it with a <em>k</em>.

        He got into, like, the ales, eh, before the show.

      <p>
        Six times twenty-four that's ... 104 beers you get, just for that.
      </p>

        And of course the song:

      <code>
        On the first day of Christmas, my true love gave to me beer<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me<br/>
        Two turtle necks<br/>
        And a beer<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        On the second day of Christmas, my true love gave to me<br/>
        Three French toast<br/>
        Two turtle necks<br/>
        And a beer<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Five golden touques<br/>
        Four pounds of back bacon<br/>
        Three French toast<br/>
        Two turtle necks<br/>
        And a beer... in a tree<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I need another beer after that.
