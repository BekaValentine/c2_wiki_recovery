        Best Of Breed
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Best of Breed" is the strategy of selecting the best product of each type (and integrating them yourself), rather than selecting one large integrated solution from a single vendor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, large integrated suites of products (like <a href="MicrosoftOffice.html">MicrosoftOffice</a> and LotusSmartSuite) contain a number of products that have a consistent look and feel, and work well together -- but each tool, taken by itself, is not "top of the field" in the niche it's in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taking a "Best of Breed" approach assumes that...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You're good at integrating 3rd party products.
        </li>
        <li>
           You're willing to take the training costs to overcome the inconsistent GUIs and tricky interfaces needed to get the products to work together.
        </li>
        <li>
           You believe that there are no appropriate integrated sets of tools on the market that meet your needs.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Someone's at my org has read too many technology whitepapers and has confused architecture with connect-the-dots. They're creating pretty coloured pyramids of different tools, technologies, and standards and justifying it with that well worn <a href="AlarmBellPhrase.html">AlarmBellPhrase</a> "We're going for a <a href="BestOfBreed.html">BestOfBreed</a> approach."

        This can also be used to justify going ahead with developing a product despite the presence of lots of existing and relevant competitors. One can always claim it will be "Best of Breed". See also <a href="WashesWhiter.html">WashesWhiter</a>.

        What seems odd about this phrase is that at the shows with which I'm familiar, <a href="BestOfBreed.html">BestOfBreed</a> is a runner-up position to "Best of Show".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think that's right. </em><a href="BestOfBreed.html">BestOfBreed</a> as best of its variety, not best of all possible things?<em> -- </em><a href="PaulHudson.html">PaulHudson</a>

        "Best of breed" is the correct term:
        It implies that for each type of software you need, you use the most capable product in that marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thus, you end up with a mismatched collection of quirky products that don't work together very well.  ;-></em>  -- anon1

      <p>
        <em>Is there anything else? -- anon3</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, grashopper, you begin to understand.</em>  ;->  -- anon2
      </p>
      <p>
        "Best of show," however, would imply that if you find that spreadsheet "X" is a "better product" than word processing program "Y", then you would attempt to do all work with "X".
        That is, to write a paper, you'd use the spreadsheet ("X") instead of a word processor.
        Likewise, to edit a source program, manage a database, do a presentation, schedule a project, etc..., you'd try to do everything with that one tool.
        This doesn't work:  Use the right tool for the job. // If the job is your primary responsibility, you probably use the right tool.  Otherwise, you may just use a convenient SoftwareSuite "Z" for all purposes: writing papers, crunching spreadsheets, preparing presentations, etc...

        <em>(Perhaps "Best of Show," in this context, would apply to integrated packages:  They can compete in each component category.)</em>

        I'm scared. I thought this phrase was fictional until I read a Watchfire (the company that makes LinkBot amongst other products) booklet aimed to get new hires. First paragraph had the phrase, "best of breed." I shuddered and dropped the booklet. What motivates people to laud their practices but not their accomplishments? [money, obviously; perhaps they have no laudable accomplishments... *sigh*] -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
