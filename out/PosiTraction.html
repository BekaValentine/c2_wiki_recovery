        Posi Traction
      </h1>
      <p>
        Limited slip differentials use various mechanisms to allow normal differential action when going around turns. When a wheel slips, they allow more torque to be transferred to the non-slipping wheel.

        <a href="PosiTraction.html">PosiTraction</a> transfers torque from the wheel that slips to the wheel that grips. <em>Actually, both wheels turn together; it's just that one tire slips while the other one bites in.</em>

        <em>"Posi" has been an important part of American automobile folklore for decades (</em><a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>). Even today references to "posi" are used plentifully in hardware engineering circles. Positraction is used as a metaphor all over the place in process automation and other control applications.<em></em>
