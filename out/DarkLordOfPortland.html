           What did you think the KGON tower was? Radio broadcast? Yeah, right! -- <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a> (The picture below should convince you.)

               <em>Hey, you're right! Of course, Ward's postal address is in Garden Home, a bit of a distance from the KGON tower. But that could just be a ploy...</em>

        But he does have that tower behind his house that he calls a "Ham Radio Antenna".

        Obviously you're a DarkMinion. Or possibly an obsessed stalker. What, the place next door wasn't available? ;-)

        <em>It was, but my realtor warned me that the neighborhood was full of giant spiders; and I saw a handful of orcs on the corner, begging for change. And don't get me started on the sulphur...</em>

        The <a href="DarkLordOfPortland.html">DarkLordOfPortland</a> is rumored to work in the small fortress, cleverly disguised as an office building, located at the center of this picture; the hub of his all-knowing network of palantirs (one of which, dear reader, you are currently gazing into) is reportedly located there:

        Though now that the <a href="DarkLordOfPortland.html">DarkLordOfPortland</a> is in the service of the <a href="LordOfTheOses.html">LordOfTheOses</a>; that may no longer be true...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Ah! So the picture above is of Isengard and not Mordor. </em>'That<em>' makes much more sense; as Ward didn't seem to be the dark lord type to me.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, yes. Saruman was so much nicer than Sauron was..... <em>He was before he gazed into the palantir... at any rate, that would explain why all the trees here in Oregon are being cut down. :)</em>

        <strong>Hrrrmm, hrrrmmmm, look out, Ward, Treebeard has your GPS coordinates!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We regret to inform you that Treebeard was turned into </em><a href="TwoByFour.html">TwoByFour</a>s quite a few years ago. While he and the rest of the Ents were able to defeat Saruman, they were no match for Weyerhauser.<em></em>

        It appears that the <a href="DarkLordOfPortland.html">DarkLordOfPortland</a> has escaped the clutches of Microso, er, Mordor; and is now "Director of Community Development".  I thought that the manufacture of orcs and their armaments <em>was</em> community development.
