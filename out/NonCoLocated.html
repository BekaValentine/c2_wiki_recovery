        Well... it's <em>not </em><a href="CoLocated.html">CoLocated</a>.<em> Basically, any team of developers that work together but are separated either geographically, or by some other means. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> utilizes the <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> concept, it seems to be used mostly with teams that are physically together. <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> emphasizes working closely together, so pairs are generally <a href="CoLocated.html">CoLocated</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The question then is, can <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> be done with pairs that are not physically together but still <em>together</em> by utilizing technology?

        I did it over the phone, before the Internet. Got phone ear. Kind of fun. On the phone for half an hour not saying anything to the other person. Occasionally swearing. Then asking a question, ATD/ATA, ZModem the source, +++ATH. Repeat. I'd look at <a href="InternetRelayChat.html">InternetRelayChat</a> for modern versions, <em>sans</em> skin irritation. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        Modern approach should take advantage of <a href="NetMeeting.html">NetMeeting</a>, <a href="VirtualNetworkComputing.html">VirtualNetworkComputing</a>, or other "shared desktop" technologies.  Instant messenging technology is ubiquitous now as well, and may be easier to use than IRC (especially if you need to get non-techies involved). --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>
