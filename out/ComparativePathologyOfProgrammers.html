        Comparative Pathology Of Programmers
      </h1>
      <p>
        To paraphrase LeoTolstoy, "Good programmers are all alike; every bad programmer is bad in his own way".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To paraphrase the bard, "Some are born bad, some achieve badness, and some have badness thrust upon them".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers can be compared by a number of factors, including education, programming language and operating system preferences, now an new factor has been added and that is by their pathology!
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea stems from the discussion/argument/bitching on the subject of the <a href="MicrosoftProgrammerMentality.html">MicrosoftProgrammerMentality</a>, where it was observed that although one can become a bad programmer through being brought up on <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> programming tools, there are other ways to become a bad programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, varieties of bad programmer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The <a href="MicrosoftProgrammerMentality.html">MicrosoftProgrammerMentality</a> - If management likes it, it must be good
        </li>
        <li>
           The PerlProgrammerMentality - code as fast as possible. If it's imperfect in any way, scratch it and start over.
        </li>
        <li>
           The LispProgrammerMentality - cleverness for cleverness' sake!
        </li>
        <li>
           The CprogrammerMentality - I like a language that lets me write my own <strong>malloc</strong>. Mine will be faster anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="SqlRdmsProgrammerMentality.html">SqlRdmsProgrammerMentality</a> -- If we just join these 7 tables and use a computed having clause, the answer is correct by implication. (<a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a> perhaps?)
        </li>
        <li>
           The OoMentality - Make a big hand-programmed <a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a> in code, and tell anybody who thinks it is a mess, "you just don't get it".
        </li>
        <li>
           Etc
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that the names reflect stereotypes; not every Perl programmer suffers the Perl pathology, and there are people who use languages other than Perl who do. The names are simply convenient <em>(if perhaps unhelpful)</em> labels.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I would disconnect pathology from the concept of "good" or "bad" programmer and associate it with motivations for programming.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Programmers with <a href="AspergersSyndrome.html">AspergersSyndrome</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Programmers without <a href="AspergersSyndrome.html">AspergersSyndrome</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>The second quickly become managers :-)</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="FanaticOrientedProgramming.html">FanaticOrientedProgramming</a> asserts like-minded developers tend to be more productive together. Thus, if you put a bunch of Perl fanatics or Smalltalk fanatics in the same room, productivity goes up under this theory. The less mixing of diverse viewpoints, the less chance for <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>s. The flip theory is that diversity keeps a form of checks and balances.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just because Perl code looks goofy to me does not mean that it will to a Perl fan also. Perhaps the challenge of reading obtuse code keeps Perlers awake and less bored, preventing burnout. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Notwithstanding the <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>, can we divide these up a little?  It might help to avoid <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, or allow the conversation to fan out a bit.
