        Why Lisp
      </h1>
      <p>
        The most amazing thing is what Lisp ended up being out of pure serendipity. <a href="JohnMcCarthy.html">JohnMcCarthy</a> was going after a universal function that would compete or replace a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        But when S.R. Russell noticed that eval could serve as an interpreter for LISP, and promptly coded it -- against <a href="JohnMcCarthy.html">JohnMcCarthy</a>'s advice and wishes, we ended up with a very special programming language, where code is always data, and data can be code, where a simple interpreter and a handful of primitives define a powerful language:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (eval exp env)<br/>
        (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) exp)<br/>
        ((variable? exp) (lookup-variable-value exp env))<br/>
        ((quoted? exp) (text-of-quotation exp))<br/>
        ((assignment? exp) (eval-assignment exp env))<br/>
        ((definition? exp) (eval-definition exp env))<br/>
        ((if? exp) (eval-if exp env))<br/>
        ((lambda? exp)<br/>
        (make-procedure (lambda-parameters exp)<br/>
        (lambda-body exp)<br/>
        env))<br/>
        ((begin? exp)<br/>
        (eval-sequence (begin-actions exp) env))<br/>
        ((cond? exp) (eval (cond->if exp) env))<br/>
        ((application? exp)<br/>
        (apply (eval (operator exp) env)<br/>
        (list-of-values (operands exp) env)))<br/>
        (else<br/>
        (error "Unknown expression type - EVAL" exp))))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (define (apply procedure arguments)<br/>
        (cond ((primitive-procedure? procedure)<br/>
        (apply-primitive-procedure procedure arguments))<br/>
        ((compound-procedure? procedure)<br/>
        (eval-sequence<br/>
        (procedure-body procedure)<br/>
        (extend-environment<br/>
        (procedure-parameters procedure)<br/>
        arguments<br/>
        (procedure-environment procedure))))<br/>
        (else<br/>
        (error<br/>
        "Unknown procedure type - APPLY" procedure))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Understanding this "universal function" is equivalent to understanding a 400 page programming language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There seem to be about 400 helper functions missing from this program though - it appears someone has abstracted them!</em>  Actually, no. But think about it for a little longer...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To prove that McCarthy had little intention in doing this, take a look at what he wrote (<a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/lisp.html):">http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/lisp/lisp.html):</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Another way to show that LISP was neater than <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>s was to write a universal LISP function and show that it is briefer and more comprehensible than the description of a universal Turing machine. This was the LISP function eval[e,a], which computes the value of a LISP expression e - the second argument a being a list of assignments of values to variables. (a is needed to make the recursion work). Writing eval required inventing a notation representing LISP functions as LISP data, and such a notation was devised for the purposes of the paper with no thought that it would be used to express LISP programs in practice. Logical completeness required that the notation used to express functions used as functional arguments be extended to provide for recursive functions, and the LABEL notation was invented by Nathaniel Rochester for that purpose. D.M.R. Park pointed out that LABEL was logically unnecessary since the result could be achieved using only LAMBDA - by a construction analogous to <a href="AlonzoChurch.html">AlonzoChurch</a>'s Y-operator, albeit in a more complicated way."
      </p>
      <p>
        Which goes to show that he had <em>no</em> vision or plan to create the monster that he did: it just happened out of pure luck. (<a href="PaulFeyerabend.html">PaulFeyerabend</a> lives!) This statement is specially 
        enlightening:

      </dl>
      <p>
        Thank God someone took his original notation seriously and literally... otherwise, the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> as we know it, may have never existed. And humanity would be deprived of its power, flexibility and simplicity.
      </p>
      <p>
        In terms of impact, <a href="GeneticProgramming.html">GeneticProgramming</a>, most <a href="AutonomousAgent.html">AutonomousAgent</a> Technology, <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> and all of its branches (<a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a>, Rule-Oriented, <a href="NaturalLanguageProcessing.html">NaturalLanguageProcessing</a>, <a href="ArtificialNeuralNetwork.html">ArtificialNeuralNetwork</a>s, <a href="GameProgramming.html">GameProgramming</a>, etc. etc.), Hybrid or Multi-Paradigmic programming, <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>, <a href="MetaObjectProtocol.html">MetaObjectProtocol</a>s, and a great deal of programming language research could have never been possible if it wasn't for Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Literally, we would not be where we are in programming if 
        it wasn't for a crazy guy that took a programming language 
        research paper literally, and did a very dumb thing:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>wrote some code in a short amount of time.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The rest was generated by this little "historical accident".
      </p>
      <p>
        Once code is data, there is not need for
        ASTs (<a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a>s).  Lisp notation is basically a condensed
        form for writing ASTs.
      </p>
      <p>
        But what that means is that to modify the meaning of the
        language and/or to do even things like meta-programming, Lisp
        is the natural choice.  Think about this:  it is easy to generate
        data from a program, right?  Well, if code is data, then it
        is easy to generate <strong>code</strong>.  Things like <a href="GeneticProgramming.html">GeneticProgramming</a> are
        easy with Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, parsing "other languages" is easy with Lisp.  It is no
        coincidence that most ACLs (AgentCommunicationLanguages) are
        Lisp-based, because the "verb/data exchanges" can be simply 
        interpreted on either side.  No need for SAX-like parsers that
        waste cycles in serialization and deserialization -- simply
        take the stream and interpret it.  And if it is not exactly Lisp, 
        get inspired by Lisp and create an eval-like function and then 
        interpret the "new language".  In that sense, eval is like a 
        "universal SAX parser".  Wouldn't you like to have one of those?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You still have to serialize and deserialize the byte stream, unless you're sending raw object code over the network.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the meta-programming side, imagine this, you can set any 
        level of filtering, execution of extra actions, change interpretation, 
        or give new meanings to anything that is interpreted or 
        "evaluates" by just changing eval.  So if you want to keep 
        meta data or meta processing on your programs there is nothing
        as simple as Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Lisp, for example, is incredibly easy to do <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>
        because you can manage at every point what happens
        to the joint and cut points of functions and it is easy
        to do so.... everything goes through eval.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The JAspect tool does whole-code analysis and transformation during the Java compilation phase; the aspects are guaranteed to be applied throughout the program.  This would be harder to accomplish in typical interactive Lisp development.  (And anyway, the "define-method" facilities only work for CLOS calls.)  To achieve the policy features provided by </em><a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>, a Lisp programmer is more likely to add a new control structure, along the lines of "with-" or "call-with-".<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If that wasn't enough, Lisp comes with a myriad of nice features 
        such as lambdas (first order functions), closures (functions that 
        generate functions), powerful macros (that can generate anything 
        data, functions, classes, patterns, or even other macros), 
        <a href="GenericFunction.html">GenericFunction</a>s (methods that cut across multiple classes in CLOS), and 
        by extension, MOPs;  and with a wide variety of powerful 
        Open Source Lisp source code scattered throughout the planet.  
        (The Lisp community was perhaps the first community that
        embraced Open Source.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, Lisp is the most powerful and flexible language,
        and in fact, I would say that once you understand Lisp, other
        languages seem very constraining, underpowered and unnecessary 
        complicated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, Lisp programmers were probably the first "agile developers"
        on the planet, because as far back as the mid-60s, many of the
        practices that we know today as "agile practices" or even 
        "extreme programming" were already in practice.

        Sorry for my longish post -- I could rave and rant all day about 
        the powers of Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll leave you with a thought.  Here is simple example to 
        extend Lisp to do Object-Oriented programming.  Try to do something
        similar in C, C++, Java or even Smalltalk ;-)

        (defmacro define-class (class inst-vars class-vars &body methods)<br/>
        "Define a class for object-oriented programming."<br/>

        `(let ,class-vars<br/>

        (case message<br/>

      <code>

        I still fail to understand, though, how a LispCompiler can interpret data *cough* code which is created at runtime, at the same speed as original compile-time code.  I suppose I could look it up somewhere. -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>, <a href="DeleteWhenCooked.html">DeleteWhenCooked</a>

        <em>Well, if it is </em><a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> the compiler is part of the runtime.  So you can dynamically create functions, compile them (or not) and run them just like any other function...<em></em>

        Thanks. I thought it was more of a "translate to <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, pass through GCC" kind of thing (see <a href="CeeAsAnIntermediateLanguage.html">CeeAsAnIntermediateLanguage</a>).

        <em>While there are projects to implement CL on top of a C compiler (see ECL), that behaviour is the exception, not the rule.  There are, however, very good CL compilers (see CMUCL for a free one) which will compile CL to </em><a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>, generally within a factor of 2 of a good optimizing C compiler.  This is pretty amazing, considering how much more power you get in CL compared to C.  To put it another way:  a lot of people like languages such as tcl/perl/python, because it's abstractions let them code much faster than they would in C.  However, the "abstraction penalty", if you want to call it that, is sometimes quite high, often a couple or even three of orders of magnitude.  So often people optimize by going back and writing critical bits in C or C++, which is a bit of a mess.  With CL, you get <strong>more</strong> power and abstraction than these languages, and with appropriately written code you can have very little penalty.  Why this hasn't sunk it for more people I am not sure (actually, that's a fib --- I have some ideas).<em> [</em><a href="WhyNotLisp.html">WhyNotLisp</a>?]

        Anyway, back to compilation. I understand (ish) the "text to list of atoms" reading step. Does the compilation before execution resemble in any way the <a href="JustInTimeCompilation.html">JustInTimeCompilation</a> of <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a>? Maybe at this point I shold just start hacking.
