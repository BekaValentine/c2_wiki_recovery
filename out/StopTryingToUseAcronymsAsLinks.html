        Stop Trying To Use Acronyms As Links
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the spirit of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, two pages covering a subject which has wasted space and time have been created to cover what some consider to be <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a>. When a familiar Acronym is used as a Link, due to the nature of what <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> recognizes as links, the result looks somewhat unnatural and fabricated. Those who argue <a href="PlainEnglish.html">PlainEnglish</a>, would rather that the Acronym be spelled out entirely in a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> that looks more conventional. Others argue that the Acronym is more universally recognized and understood than such a word would be.

        So if you are concerned with LinkBeauty, or do not wish to offend those who are, <a href="StopTryingToUseAcronymsAsLinks.html">StopTryingToUseAcronymsAsLinks</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If on the other hand if you do not consider that a problem, be prepared for some <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> to post a message of disapproval on any such page.
