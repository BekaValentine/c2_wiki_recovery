           Could you help me?

           Let's do it together!

           Could you drive?

           Here are my intentions

        <li>
           What are your intentions?

        <li>
           What should we do now? What is the next step?
        </li>
        <li>
           Did we miss something?

        <li>
           Let's ask the code
        </li>
        <li>
           How does this code work? Let's step into that Unit Test.
        </li>
        <li>
           What's the Test?
        </li>
        <li>
           I'm bored. What's going on?
        </li>
        <li>
           I do not understand. Draw me a picture! Explain me!

      <ul>
        <li>
           Can we break?
        </li>
        <li>
           Can we stop?
        </li>
        <li>
           Can we switch peer?

        Maybe
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Can I take a look a this alone for a moment? (It is not pair programming but may give some relieve after intensive pairing.  As long as 'a look' is only 'a look'.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Do not
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This sucks

        Keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't force it.  Forcing <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> will make people more resistant to try.
        </li>
        <li>
           Do not drive too long. Let the other drive.
        </li>
        <li>
           Drive enough.  Take the keyboard.
        </li>
        <li>
           Communicate: Both ways! Listen, Talk.
        </li>
        <li>
           Break often. Don't skip breaks. (guidelines: 15 min for newbies with pp, 45 min for experimented)
        </li>
        <li>
           Split the pair. Switch peer between pair.
        </li>
        <li>
           Enjoy

        Keep in mind the importance of the <a href="NoddingDummy.html">NoddingDummy</a>. Sometimes it is important to just sit and listen to someone else explain their thoughts on something (even if you don't quite get what they're talking about). A lot of times the person explaining will have a eureka moment and thank you profusely even though all you've done is sit and nod.
