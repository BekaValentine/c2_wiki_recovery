        Always And Never

      <p>
        Contradictory advice:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Always remember, never use 'always' or 'never'." 
      </p>
      <p>
        Better advice would probably be:
      </p>
      <p>
        "When tempted, remember, rarely use 'always' or 'never'."
      </p>
      <p>
        Practical advice which, in its own invocation, seeks to remind us that <a href="RulesAreMadeToBeBroken.html">RulesAreMadeToBeBroken</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is also a reminder that a general statement meant to simplify for everyone often prove only to complicate things for one or many. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As shown in <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>, some statements do not include enough clear and complete information to make them applicable AlwayOrNever.
