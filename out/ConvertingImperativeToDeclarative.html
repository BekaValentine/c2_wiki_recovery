        Converting Imperative To Declarative
      </h1>
      <p>
        Based on discussion in <a href="CodeAvoidance.html">CodeAvoidance</a>, here are techniques for converting imperative algorithms into more declarative approaches, specifically the data-centric type. This is <strong>not the topic to discuss the merit</strong> of such conversions, just the techniques. <a href="IsDeclarativeLessExpressive.html">IsDeclarativeLessExpressive</a> would probably be better for value judgments. Nor should we battle over which kind of data structure to use here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nothing here appears declarative, merely data-driven.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you suggesting a title change? Before making the effort, let's explore the definition of "declarative" and compare it to "data driven".
      </p>
      <p>
        And here I thought this page would be about PythoLogic (<a href="http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/240),">http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/view/240),</a> a framework for embedding <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are at least two kinds of "declarative": </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Attribute-based (data-structures)
        </li>
        <li>
           Logical (such as Prolog)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Perhaps we should make the topic more specific? However, in a <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> spirit, let's wait until we need a split.
      </p>
      <p>
        [A useful operational definition of 'declarative' is that ordering and duplication of statements does not affect program behavior.]

        I actually made a utility function just like this once or twice. If nothing is found, it defaults to the second parameter. However, I could never decide how to handle multiple finds. One can have it use only the first record, raise an error, use the default, or have yet more parameters. What would you do?

        <em>Um, that's just silly, an object "is" a data structure, with its operations bound to it, what exactly would be the point?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all objects are "just" data structures. Objects connote rich operations, information hiding, abstract interfaces, getters and setters, et cetera. However, use of getters and setters (or attributes) for maintaining a lot of data tends toward <a href="ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication.html">ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The point here is to separate the semantic operations from the data management issues (such as concurrency, security, consistency, and persistence).

        I am not sure this fully qualifies as a conversion, but rather a technique that uses declarative. Read information into a data structure first, and then process it in the data structure instead of as it is being read in. This provides a kind of <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> and can simplify error handling. The drawback is that it may require more machine resources.

        I think the usual map/collect reduce/fold/inject and filter/select are examples of declarative approaches to explicit loop handling, are they ok here?

        It's basically useless when you have to type your data in, free-form, in a language like SQL.  Remember that object.function(arg1, arg2, arg3) is itself data, something that's more obvious in the Lisp-syntaxed (function object arg1 arg2 arg3).  There's no real difference between that and "INSERT INTO functions VALUES (function, object, arg1, arg2, arg3)".
      </p>
      <p>
        The big difference, as I see it, is the possibility of structured data editors to manipulate that data.  So instead of writing in textual code, you'd get a spreadsheet-like view that shows all fields in tabular format.  And instead of delimiting fields with various punctuation marks, you can just tab between columns.  <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> does something like this with objects, and I'd really love to see a MultiParadigm programming language with a bunch of editors to edit different code structures.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What benefit would a spreadsheet-like view provide? -- </em><a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Less typing, easier to see patterns.  Switching between fields is just a tab, instead of the usual ( , , );  Can't get more minimalist than that.  There's also the possibility of making some data implicit; for example, populating a hash table of objects in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> usually requires:
      </p>
      <code>
        table.put(key1, val1);<br/>
        table.put(key2, val2);<br/>
        table.put(key3, val3);<br/>
        table.put(key4, val4);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The same table in spreadsheet form would have the symbols 'table' and 'put' be implicit, specified by the fact that you're editing <em>this</em> table.  So you'd only have to type
      </p>
      <code>
        key1 val1<br/>
        key2 val2<br/>
        key3 val3<br/>
        key4 val4<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And you can clearly see patterns in the code (data).  If you've got repeating groups of arguments, they'll jump out at you, while they wouldn't necessarily do so in free-form text.  It's easy for the important features of the code to get buried under boilerplate required by the language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <This argument seems to have veered in yet a new direction.  The statement above seems to be describing some sort of macro editor to create code rather than showing an alternative to the code itself.>
      </p>
      <p>
        (You can get much the same effect by lining up columns in a text editor, but that's often hard to maintain unless you have tool support for it.  And even then, it'll still usually be more typing, because you don't have the implicit/explicit option.) -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        <em>Do you have a lot of source code that looks like that?  Because of </em><a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, I tend to put that sort of thing in a file or database and read it in a loop.  My code has very little data embedded inside it.  -- EH<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's exactly the point.  It effectively <em>is</em> putting that sort of thing in a database - just not necessarily a BigIronRdbms.  The advantage is the tight integration with the host language.  There's no way to store eg. <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s in an RDBMs, but they could easily be handled in an editor like this.  And you wouldn't need to write the loop to read in the data - you would simply edit the data.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

      <p>
        In my Xbase days, it was usually easy to have both <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a>s and text editors open at the same time and switch focus between them. Another alternative is to program in a spreadsheet or spreadsheet-like utility and let text code be text code and tables be tables. There is a breif example of this at the bottom of <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>.

        <em>Looping through a result set takes less code that 500 put statements. -- EH</em>

      <p>
        <Weren't those 500 put statements required to get the data into the database?  There is a difference between creating a data structure and copying it.  Adding a copy operation does not reduce the code; it may time shift the execution of the code, but it does not eliminate it.>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Are you arguing that I should have 500 put statements in my code because the time cost is the same as entering the data in a database?  Time cost isn't the issue.  Source code is not a good place for data for many other reasons.  Anyway, looping reduces the number of lines of code.  The data in the database doesn't contribute to the line count.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <How is the data getting into the database?  Wasn't a SQL script of 500 Insert statements written?>
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <The assertion at the top was that a reduction of code occurred, other issues are not under discussion.  Persistance of data is not the issue, population of data and the lines of code to support that population is the issue.  Data population code must be written, the time must be scheduled, and people to write the code must be identified.  True, there may be other reasons for using a database for persistent storage, but reducing lines of code is not one of them.>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Data population code?  I've never heard of it.  SQL insert statements seem like a lousy way to load a database.  I either enter it by hand or load it from a file.</em>

        Again, this topic was not meant to be the place to discuss the merits of declarative-tilted programming.

      <p>
        <em>I don't understand why anything on this page is considered declarative. -- EH</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In data-centric declarative, you generally separate filling up a data structure and doing processing on the data structure. Another way of saying something similar is that repeating patterns are moved to a data structure of some kind.
      </p>
      <p>

        We wrote an interpreter in C++.  The programs were stored in a folder with a bunch of flat files, one per class.  You still need some behavioral code to "play" or run an operation, even though the operational data was stored in a data structure.  We could convert our data structures stored in flat files to C++ global variables (perhaps not with today's compilers), and convert everything to C++.  We had several operations: create (show), hide, arithmetic, send, receive, lookup (predicates), procedure (composite), move cursor, search ,reset, justify, trim, truncate, copy, ack, extend.  The question is, what is the minimal number of operators one needs to implement a language?  What cannot be made declarative? --<a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I never claimed that everything could be made 100% declarative. But a <em>large portion</em> of an application can often be converted to declarative, if one wishes to go that route. -t
