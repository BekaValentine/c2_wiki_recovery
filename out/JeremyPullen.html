        <em>After doing Agile for a number of years, I'm not so sure that the </em><a href="LeanProgramming.html">LeanProgramming</a> analogy of software development to manufacturing is the best fit.  I'm interested in doing some hands-on experimentation with some of Toyota's techniques for developing products -- which don't follow the manufacturing approach at all.  This has largely been triggered by reading "Product Development for the Lean Enterprise" by NeilKennedy.  The biggest difference between Toyota and <a href="LeanProgramming.html">LeanProgramming</a> appears to be a lack of set-based concurrent design within <a href="LeanProgramming.html">LeanProgramming</a>.
