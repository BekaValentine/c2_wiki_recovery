        The Swarm Corporation was founded in 1997 by Chris Langton, Glen Ropella, and Douglas Orr, to provide expert consulting and modelling capability to businesses and government agencies facing complex dynamics in various aspects of their organization, physical plant, or resource base. We provide expert knowledge and specialized computational and mathematical tools to help understand complex problems and dynamics in real world settings.

        Dr. Christopher Langton is internationally recognized as the "founder" of the field of Artificial Life. He is an  expert in computational approaches to complex adaptive systems, and has been the primary motivator behind  the development of the Swarm simulation system. Dr. Langton was one of five resident-faculty members at  the Santa Fe Institute for the past four years, and was a critical contributor to the establishment of the SFI as  the primary research facility in the field of complex systems.
