        Who Is Using Cpp Unit
      </h1>
      <p>
        Please tell if you use <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> and how you refactored it (if you did).
      </p>

        We try to integrate some of the <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> stuff into the <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a>.org automated test environment. We've done a lot of changes there.
        E.g. We use another STL, we don't need the <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> GUI stuff, make cppunit compatible to our Linux and Solaris environment, integrate a signal handler, because lot of bugs within Unix occur not as exceptions but as signals.
        If any one is interested in more, do not hesitate to contact me via email, lla<at>openoffice.org.

        I am using <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> for my individual project. I am using a separate configuration in VC6 called Test that started as a copy of my Debug configuration. This is so I can give out Debug builds that don't actually run tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each of the DLLs in my project runs its own suite of tests when DllMain gets hit with a DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH (everything in one process, so multiple test runs aren't really an issue). If the tests fail DllMain returns FALSE preventing the DLL from loading and in turn shutting down the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        Error results from tests are spit out to the debug console in VC file(line) : message format so I can double click on them to jump straight to source. Makes it very easy to just compile and run. If somethings broken I know right away, otherwise there's no interference with the application and everything proceeds normally.

        We are using <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> with Visual <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> 6.0. We did some refactoring for outputting name of test suites and number of tests and suites done. We also changed a little bit some of the variable names to be easier to understand. -- JeanMarcHeneman

        I used it on a MFC project to turn the Question Mark Button on the tool bar, in Debug-mode, from an About button to a Test button. This raises the <a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I added a Debug-mode-only flag to the command lines, "-test", to automatically raise this test and automatically bang its Run button. This involved a slight refeaturization - <a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a> had to click its own Run button at display time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I wrote a batch file that called the project with its -test flag on the command line.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I called that batch file from a Makefile as the last action under a target called 'test'.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I called that Makefile from a clicker in the Quick Launch tray of my Task Bar.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost forgot one more feature. I made the name of each failed test appear in via DebugOutputString in my output tab in file(99) format. This lets me use "next compile error" navigation to locate the assert failures.
      </p>
      <p>
        Warning: The hoary hirsute set will tell you UTs run in both Debug and Release mode. Screw it - the 80/20 rule applies.

      <p>
        I'm using it with <a href="GnuCpp.html">GnuCpp</a> (on a Linux-Box) also with the text interface. I had several problems with it and had to change some things (also the \r's). But at last it works. -- <a href="JuergenLindemeyer.html">JuergenLindemeyer</a>

        I wrote a variation (or an enhanced version?) of <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> which we used with Kai, MSVC, and now GCC. I refactored it heavily, in fact it is written from scratch. You can see some of my thought process in <a href="CppUtxOverview.html">CppUtxOverview</a>. We needed more heavy duty testing so I added some more <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Optionally generate detailed test results to a CSV or XML file in order to track results in a database.
        </li>
        <li>
           Made the <a href="TestMethod.html">TestMethod</a>s Unary and made their single argument an immutable <em>context object</em> that provided to the test writer:
          <ul>
            <li>
               A proxy stream to a formatted trace server
            </li>
            <li>
               A Private <em>argv</em> for each <a href="TestMethod.html">TestMethod</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               Some queries about the current state of the <a href="TestDriver.html">TestDriver</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Made the <a href="TestRunner.html">TestRunner</a> a <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> Visitor
        </li>
        <li>
           Added a <em>Specify</em> method to the <a href="TestDriver.html">TestDriver</a> class that allowed tests to be specified using wild cards (i.e. * means run all tests)
        </li>
        <li>
           Enhancements that made compiling and linking tests and test suites from multiple packages more straightforward and less-messy. This was a big improvement as it made it much easier to add new test suites with a minimum impact on recompilation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've since moved to another project - this one in Java - but if I remember correctly, those were the biggest changes. Oh yeah, I also changed the way tests and test suites are named. In CppUtx, I used names that were qualified with a sort of <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> path similar to how a file name is qualified by its path. Here are some examples of how a CppUtx test driver could be invoked:
      </p>
      <code>
        test -quiet -csv test.csv      <em>// Run all tests quietly -- create a csv file of results</em><br/>
        test root.i18n.CharEncoderTest <em>// Run all </em>CharEncoderTest cases in the i18n package<em></em><br/>
        test root.i18n.CharEncoderTest.TestEncode <em>// Run only the </em>TestEncode case<em></em><br/>
        test TestExceptions            <em>// Run case in every suite it occurs</em><br/>
        test root.core.string <em>// Run all tests in the core.string package (i.e. suite)</em><br/>
        test core.*           <em>// Run all tests in all the core packages</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This made it relatively painless for a programmer to run only their tests or for QA to run some pattern of tests when tracking down a bug. I used this same naming convention to optionally allow command lines for individual test cases. This was done using a simple file with the following layout:
      </p>
      <code>
        ;<br/>
        ; <em>test.def -- command lines for suites or individual cases</em><br/>
        ;<br/>
        root.core.thr.ThreadTest -threads 256<br/>
        root.util.ParserTest -in shakespeare.dat<br/>
        root.logger.LogTest.TestClient -server ten.ada.net<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        These are made up names and command lines, but you get the idea. Because of the hierarchical property of test names, you could send a command line argument to <strong>all</strong> tests with an entry like so:
      </p>
      <code>
        ; test.def<br/>
        root -verbose  ; <em>send this flag to all test methods</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Not that you'd really need an option like this, but the feature came for free when I changed the naming model of Cpp<strong>'Utx. In a test method, you would access the command line just as you would in a main routine:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        class MyClassTest<br/>
        {<br/>
        public:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void TestSomeMethod( const TestContext& ctx )<br/>
        {<br/>
        TestContext::argv_iterator <br/>
        at = ctx.ArgvBegin(),<br/>
        end = ctx.ArgvEnd();<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        std::string sTestName = *at++; // "<path>.TestSomeMethod"<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        while ( at != end )<br/>
        {<br/>
        // process command line<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Since this is C++, I made argv[0] the qualified name of the test. I'd say all in all, that while command lines were very rarely used, it was very easy to add and became very important to those tests which used it.

        I got <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> a rather long time ago, and I haven't recently compared it with what is currently available... The first refactoring I did was to fix the header inclusions. I also created a SimpleTestCase class that was a subclass of <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>, overriding setup() and teardown() to do nothing, because most of my <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> subclasses don't need to override setup() and teardown(). In VC++, there were compile problems with referencing test functions in an STL vector, so my work-around is to have one "inner" subclass of SimpleTestCase per test. When I have time, I'll get the latest <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> and compare it with my version, and either upgrade mine, or submit my changes to the world at large. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh yes, my copies of Junit and <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> also write out more progress and timing information, so I know which tests are taking a long time.

        I don't suppose anyone has done a <a href="PowerPlant.html">PowerPlant</a> version of <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>?

        This distribution includes an example which is a set of WideString conversion functions to match the Win32 shell API and some tests for the standard string functions I wrote as part of a current project.

        I am using it for company project. Now the only part of the code that doesn't have <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> is where the program have to be called from other library (It's like event loop here that i don't know yet how to simulate such callback). Even though the overhead of making Unittest in static type language like C++ is much of a burden in itself, I'm happy to spend hours to have unit test fail now than spending days when my program crash later. <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> help me catch those little silly mistake as well as some big bug. -- <a href="PisinBootvong.html">PisinBootvong</a>

        I have been using <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> for a commercial project (1.2 million significant <a href="LinesOfCode.html">LinesOfCode</a> ) since April 2004. Breaking dependencies so that you can test infect a large body legacy code can be slow going, so I have been focusing on <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing new features and the framework and libraries. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides helping me catch problems earlier, I have found that the discipline of minimizing dependencies in order to make code more testable has helped make my modules easily reusable. -- <a href="GeoffBurns.html">GeoffBurns</a>
