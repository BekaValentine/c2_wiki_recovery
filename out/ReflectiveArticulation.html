        I constantly 'talk to myself' by typing into a text file, whether it's designing, debugging, or implementing.  My writing is fairly stream-of-consciousness, as if I'm talking to someone next to me.  It is useful for the reasons other people have described above, but often even more so when I'm coming back to code I wrote a long time ago.  It's like having the old me describe things about the system to the current me, including all of the reasons that I discarded other approaches before settling on the current one.  As other people have noted, coding speed isn't really bound by typing, so I don't think being verbose in my diary costs me any time overall.  And it makes working a lot more fun. --<a href="DanSchmidt.html">DanSchmidt</a>

        I do this too! ( And thought I was the only one :-)  In addition to plain stream-of-consciousness, I have found certain structured formats very helpful.

        "Question and Answer"
      </p>
      <p>
        In question and answer, I write all unknowns as questions, and then post answers as I get them:
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: How does the client know their own id?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: The local_client record contains a client's own id.
      </p>

        "Problem and Solutions"
      </p>
      <p>
        In problem and solutions, I write a problem statement followed by brainstorming of possible solutions.  These can nest indefinitely.  When I choose a solution, I flag it with an IMPLEMENTED comment:
      </p>
      <p>
        Problem: Actively colliding objects need to be able to find each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution: Each object stores a link to a possible collider.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution ( IMPLEMENTED ): Use a central Mediator object to manage collisions.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Key Idea"
      </p>
      <p>
        I use Key Idea to place special emphasis on the gestalt of a system.  For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        Key Idea: Record ids have static mappings to object types, therefore record ids provide MEANING, not just a pointer to data.
