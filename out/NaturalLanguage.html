        What a shame that we must pick a language (American English) in which to grow this community.  It may exclude others with valuable contributions or a legitimate need.  It also potentially excludes entire world-views and cultures represented by those other languages (the old <a href="LanguageLimitsThought.html">LanguageLimitsThought</a> argument).
      </p>
      <p>
        If we did support multiple languages, I suspect that they would lead to independent communities bridged only by those polyglots with the will to forge links between them.

        Can automatic translation help yet?

        <em>As one of those polyglots which could bridge the English, Spanish and Portuguese communities, I must confess I don't think it could work out well... The tendency of grouping "us" vs. "them" is too strong in our minds... Automatic translators do a very poor work as of today, there are a lot of contextual decisions and personal insight in Wiki to be properly translated... Fortunately enough, our (presumably) group common technical background (whether in Sciences or Engineerings) will have exposed all us to the English language, so the number of lost contributions is mitigated...</em> -- <a href="DavidDeLis.html">DavidDeLis</a>

        I had to work in a country with a language different from English - yet I found all the highly trained and technical types were proficient in the use of English as a second language. They considered this part of the training necessary for participation in the technological explosion which has occurred in the past 25 years (the number could be 50, 10 or 5 depending on the particular branch of technology).

        Participants in an ongoing dialog within a particular discipline, contribute meaningfully only if familiar with the language and practice used by the majority of the participants, whether it be English, Spanish, French, German, C++, C#, Smalltalk, or Tcl.

          <em> Originally, in the 1960's, research was done on isolated word recognition before the later development of speech understanding systems. A physical problem with such systems is noise. Microphone and background noise can cause interference with the recording of the spoken utterance. Another problem is that the speaker doesn't always pronounce the same word in the same way. Sometimes whole syllables are dropped or "swallowed" at word boundaries. In fact, finding the boundaries between words in a connected-speech signal is one of the difficult problems in speech understanding. With increased information available to the hearer beyond the acoustic signal (such as context), expectations about the content can be formed. </em>
