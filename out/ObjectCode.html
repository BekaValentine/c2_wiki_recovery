        Object Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Object code</em> refers to code or files which:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Are instructions for some machine, either real (a microprocessor's instruction set), virtual (ie <a href="JavaByteCode.html">JavaByteCode</a>), or abstract (ie <a href="MicrosoftIntermediateLanguage.html">MicrosoftIntermediateLanguage</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Are usually the output of a compiler or assembler, and either generated locally as part of a build or are a 3rd-party deliverable (<a href="ObjectCode.html">ObjectCode</a> is typically not hand-edited)
        </li>
        <li>
           Is intended to be the input of a <a href="LinkerProgram.html">LinkerProgram</a>, <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>, debugger, or an OS program loader.
        </li>
        <li>
           Is often in binary form (though not always); even if in text form is generally not fit for human consumption.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, files which are archives of other object code files (such as Unix .a and .sa files, Windows .lib files, COM assemblies, Java .jar files, <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> assemblies) can, for most intents and purposes, be considered object code (even if the archive file is or can be used for other things--.jar files are really .zip files, the Unix archive tool can be used to archive anything and not just object files).
      </p>
      <p>
        When object code is targeted for a CPU's instruction set ("machine code"), it frequently (but not always) can be subdivided further as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Simple object files (.obj in Windows, .o in Unix).  These are only suitable as the input to a <a href="LinkerProgram.html">LinkerProgram</a>; they cannot be directly executed nor dynamically loaded (lacking the necessary runtime support).  Usually contain undefined symbols which must be further resolved.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Dynamically linked libraries/shared libraries (.dll in Windows, .so in Unix).  These are generally intended to be input as for a dynamic linker.  They contain additional implementation-dependent stuff to make runtime linkers/loaders more efficient, and often must contain position independent code (most OS's arrange to have only one copy of a given DLL in memory at a time, even if being used by multiple applications).  See <a href="DllHell.html">DllHell</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Executables.  These are intended to be directly run by the program loader, and contain the necessary machinery for that (the main program, the language runtime initialization/cleanup code, etc).  Should not contain undefined symbols, other than those found in a DLL.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When object code is <a href="IntermediateLanguage.html">IntermediateLanguage</a>, many of the above distinctions vanish.  There is no such thing as static linking in Java; all linking in Java is done by the class loader.  The only difference between an executable and non-executable Java class is the presence of "public static void main(String[])" in the class definition.
