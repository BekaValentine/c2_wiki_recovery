        I enjoyed reading it, although it seemed a little abstract.  <a href="YourMoneyOrYourLife.html">YourMoneyOrYourLife</a> is probably a better book.

        But, as to why this came up - "Marketplace" was on the radio the other day, and they were doing a piece about the "VoluntarySimplicityMovement". It struck me that voluntary simplicity has values in common with extreme programming -- <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, most obviously, but perhaps also <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> and <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.
