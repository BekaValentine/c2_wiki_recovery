        So, are we here to advertise any online bookstore, or is it all about recommending places that we have done good business with to other <a href="WikiUser.html">WikiUser</a>s?  What about it says that it offers something better for <a href="WikiUser.html">WikiUser</a>s, and who recommended it?  Why do we try so hard to keep out spam?  It looks to me like they came along and added themselves.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>True, but they did add their name in the right place -- which is a heck of a lot better than most spammers.  So it looks like we have </em>'one<em>' legitimate wiki user who likes them.  I think I'll try them next time I'm looking for a book, to see how they compare to the other search engines.</em>

I found <a href="BookAse.html">BookAse</a> competitive:  It has a better user interface, and no other search service had a better book price.  I bought the book through <a href="BookAse.html">BookAse</a>.  -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a><em></em>
