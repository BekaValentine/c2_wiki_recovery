        Getting Over The Hump
      </h1>
      <p>
        I find I feel a greater reluctance to get started on a new project if I view it as a "programming project".  If I use a scripting language I am familiar with, I can get started faster and with less effort. However, later in the project, it may well have become larger and less well-structured.  Or is it just me? Feedback would be welcome.
