        Software Developer.

      <p>
        I have been developing  online databases, and building plug-ins for <a href="ArcMap.html">ArcMap</a> lately.  I graduated from Central Wa University in 2004.  I program mostly in VB.NET but like C++ and C# much better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quite a few beefs and swearing when programming for <a href="ArcMap.html">ArcMap</a>.  Support is slim, but user forums are the only way to progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's all for now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Peace out.
