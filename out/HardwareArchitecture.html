        Hardware Architecture
      </h1>
      <p>
        A given implementation of the <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> abstraction must define certain architectural elements for sake of practicality.  Some of those elements are things like word size (i.e. register size), stack-size, floating point, etc.  
      </p>
      <p>
        These choices will affect the <em>types</em> that the system makes available, and in practice how higher-level programming languages will define themselves and interface to the machine.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Architectural elements can be ignored by higher-level programming languages.  That's part of what makes them higher-level.  It is perfectly reasonable for a higher-level language to provide, say, a built-in integer type that is not a reflection of the underlying hardware, e.g., infinite precision.</em>
