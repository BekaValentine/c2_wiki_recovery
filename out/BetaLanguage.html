        <li>
           BETA is the <strong>work of </strong><a href="KristenNygaard.html">KristenNygaard</a><strong> (among others), one of the two original creators of the core concepts of object-orientation in the 1960s.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           BETA's main distinguishing feature is its <strong>radical attempt at fully abstracting abstraction</strong>. Procedures, classes, exceptions, types, processes and other constructs are all defined using a <strong>unifying abstraction/syntax, the "pattern"</strong>. One upshot is that BETA has a <strong>small grammar</strong>.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Things that apply to patterns, such as sub-classing and virtuals, apply regardless of what the pattern is used for. This means BETA programmers have the <strong>ability to express abstractions not available in other languages</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Patterns are first class objects</strong>. Pattern variables can lend objects the sort of mutability you might expect from <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> despite the fact that BETA is <strong>strongly typed</strong> with compile-time checking.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           BETA fully supports <strong>concurrent programming</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           BETA's syntax is so well abstracted that major extensions can be made as libaries rather than by changing the language syntax, and despite BETA's strong typing. For example, <strong>class/object/operation predicates</strong> (invariants and pre- and post- conditions) and <strong>futures</strong> (return the result from a concurrent computation before it has been calculated).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           BETA is <strong>ancient</strong>. It was started in the mid 1970s, and the language syntax has not changed since 1992. BETA is <strong>modern</strong>. Its syntax and features may be favorably compared with recent languages.

        <li>
           Mjolner's BETA system (compiler, libraries, IDE, etc.) is <strong>free</strong> (as in beer, not as in speech).
