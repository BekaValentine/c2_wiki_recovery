        Naming Conquered Lands
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="MiddleEarth.html">MiddleEarth</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        (Like most conquering empires, Gondor did not bother do ask the locals the name of their land, and just called it Harad, "South" in their own language.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[Actually conquering empires tend to preserve a good number of "indigeneous" toponyms. Witness the many Celtic names in parts of the former Roman empire, or Quechua toponyms in Peru.]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Or all the Native American names on </em>LongIsland, and the rest of the northeastern <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a> as well.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        These are two possible patterns. Maybe we can list some others.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting pattern occurs in the Mexican toponym <em>Guadalajara.</em> It is named after a place in Spain, which in turn was named by the conquering Moors.

        Although, there are several instances of the invaders/conquerers/visitors misunderstanding the locals and calling land features whatever "that's a nice coat you're wearing" is in the local lingo.

        Similarly, there are several River Avon's in the UK.  I believe that Avon is the word for river.  I have visions of the following conversation:
      </p>
      <code>
        Roman Surveyor: What's that?<br/>
        Local: It's a river, you fool.<br/>
        Roman Surveyor (writing it down carefully): How's that spelt?<br/>
      </code>

        <em>I had the above experience when bushwalking in remote parts of Papua New Guinea. My friends and I enjoyed sampling the local tropical fruits, which were often delicious things we'd never seen before. So we asked, in our best Nuigini Pidgin: </em> <strong><em>Wannem nem bilong dispela samting?</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Once we received an answer, we knew what to call the thing next time we saw it. Or so we thought, until we noticed that a few different things seemed to be called </em>'firoot<em>'. Eventually it dawned on us that this was an attempt by the locals to use the English name 'fruit', and that it had been said in a tone of voice that implied a trailing instance of the word 'stupid!'.</em>

        I read somewhere that Senegal means: That's my boat...
        and that Yucatan means: Go away.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In </em><a href="TerryPratchett.html">TerryPratchett</a>'s "TheLightFantastic", he describes geographical regions named, in the local tongue, "Your finger, you fool". This is based on the real way many things get named when you're communicating with the locals via a pidgin or second language.<em></em>

        Does this explain why, in the Hitchhiker series, <em>Belgium</em> is so un-hoopy?

        Related, in an offbeat way: when Napoleon took over the Netherlands the French authorities forced everyone to adopt surnames. Some people responded with names like <strong>Niemandszoon</strong> (nobody's son), and <strong>van 't Zelfde</strong> (of the same).
