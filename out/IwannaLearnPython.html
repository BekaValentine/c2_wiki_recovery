        Good for you. <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> is easy to learn, very expressive and powerful, and extremely popular and well-supported.

        <strong>Online tutorials:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The official Python tutorial: (<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html).">http://docs.python.org/tut/tut.html).</a> Takes you gently through the language, and is well-organised and -indexed so you can use it like a quick reference. Read this if you know another programming language already.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Dive Into Python</em> (<a href="http://diveintopython.org/):">http://diveintopython.org/):</a> Online version of a printed book. This is much more verbose than the official tutorial. Read this if you know another programming language already.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Learning To Program</em> by Alan Gauld (<a href="http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/)">http://www.freenetpages.co.uk/hp/alan.gauld/)</a> For the not-so competent programmers, this tutorial far surpasses the official one - and the author also assists on the Python Tutor mailing list (below).
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>How To Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning With Python</em> (<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/)">http://www.ibiblio.org/obp/thinkCSpy/)</a> is excellent for novice programmers.

      </p>
      <p>
        The reviews are worth reading. (I, personally, think <em>Quick Python Book</em> is the best for the beginners and <em>Python Essential Reference</em> for the veterans.) -- <a href="JuneKim.html">JuneKim</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DavidMertz.html">DavidMertz</a> is very into <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>. Several articles in his "Charming Python" column are about FP in Python, even articles that don't mention FP in their titles. In addition, a good part of an early chapter in his <em>Text Processing in Python</em> book addresses FP.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only Python book which I've bought was Andre Lessa's <em>Python Developer's Handbook</em>, which is mentioned in Mertz's review, but not reviewed itself. It's somewhat larger than most other Python books I've seen, with the possible exception of the Core book, and tackles things from a beginner's perspective. A large part of the book is dedicated to certain tasks you might use Python in, and a comprehensive annotated list of useful Python modules, as well as sample code on how to use certain modules in certain contexts. Lessa's native language is not English, but the book is written well, and suffers from very few odd turns of phrase, and is well worth looking at. -- <a href="DanMoniz.html">DanMoniz</a>

There's also pywin32, which you can use to access MFC and the Win32 API directly, but I wouldn't use this unless you've got a lot of C/C++ experience with MFC (common), and are really in love with it (far less common). --cm

        Since I am trying to learn python, and this page, while offering many links, does not give any direct help, I thought I would share the absolute basic, which to me is open a file and run. This was not as straightforward as it seems. I made a file called test.py with a function called go() then tried 
      </p>
      <code>
        import test.py<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which did not work, then
      </p>
      <code>
        import test<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which did, but then typed go(), which did not work. Finally after slogging through the tutorial I found further down (<a href="http://docs.python.org/tut/node8.html">http://docs.python.org/tut/node8.html</a> the fibo.py example) you have to reference the filename so
      </p>
      <code>
        test.go()<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Worked. From there it should be a matter of <a href="CopyAndPaste.html">CopyAndPaste</a> from examples. Hope this helps save someone else time. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some clarification for why this worked/didn't work:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "import" imports a module. Modules are referenced by abstract name, not filename (putting a path in there won't work either). Modules are also imported into their own namespace. You can alias the modules namespace by using import as - import test as mytest will create load the module test into the namespace mytest. You can also import directly into the global namespace (although this is not recommended) using the from import syntax - from test import go will load the symbol go from the module test into the global namespace. This also works with a wildcard - from test import * loads all symbols from the module test into the global namespace. This use is not considered best practice.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also trying to use <a href="PipPy.html">PipPy</a> on the palm, at first when I tried a for loop in the "command line"/eval it kept giving errors even though it seemed very simple:
      </p>
      <code>
        for x in [1,2,3]:<br/>
        print x<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then I pressed enter after the last x and it worked. I am now heading over to <a href="PythonWhiteSpaceDiscussion.html">PythonWhiteSpaceDiscussion</a>. In <a href="PipPy.html">PipPy</a> it is even worse trying to load files, you have to do 
      </p>
      <code>
        import memoimp;memoimp.install()<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But then it seems to work same as using <em>import file</em> in the windows Python command line interpreter above. <em>file</em> is a Python category memopad file with #filename.py at the top. I deliberately have not tried the windows GUI IDE yet as I want to use both palm and desktop so am using the environment that is similar on both.
