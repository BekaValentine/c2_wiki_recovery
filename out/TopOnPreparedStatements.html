      <p>
        Let's look at a simple example in PHP using PostgreSQL.  Assume we want to select all customers from a customers table with a specified name, which has been obtained from the user and stored in a variable $userInput.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we don't use prepared statements, the simplest case could be this:
      </p>
      <code>
        <?php<br/>
        // Connect to a database named "mydb"<br/>
        $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mydb");<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Create a query for execution<br/>
        $qry = "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = '" + $userInput + "'";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Execute the query.<br/>
        $result = pg_execute($dbconn, $qry);<br/>
        ?><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If $userInput is, say, "'; delete from customers; --", we're obviously going to be in trouble.  This simplistic example invites SQL injection.  Of course, if we're going to create dynamic queries from user input, we should <strong>sanitise the user input</strong> -- as you've done using wrapper routines in your question -- but this requires discipline and assurance that the sanitisation has been successful.  <strong>That adds complexity and risk: we have to trust your filters to be correct, and we have to ensure that they're used consistently and correctly.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Using prepared statements, the above would be:
      </p>
      <code>
        <?php<br/>
        // Connect to a database named "mydb"<br/>
        $dbconn = pg_connect("dbname=mydb");<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Prepare a query for execution<br/>
        $result = pg_prepare($dbconn, "myquery", 'SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = $1');<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        // Execute the prepared query.<br/>
        $result = pg_execute($dbconn, "myquery", array($userInput));<br/>
        ?><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The pg_prepare function sends the query string to the DBMS for compilation, and identifies the parametric query with the name "myquery".  It is now prepared, i.e., compiled, for execution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The pg_execute function invokes "myquery", passing only the data for the parameter identified by '$1'.  It does <strong>not</strong> construct a new query string from "myquery" + $1 for parsing, planning and execution.  It merely passes the argument to 'myquery' -- which has already been parsed and planned (compiled) via pg_prepare -- in the same manner as passing a argument to a pre-existing stored procedure.  If "userInput" consists of "'; delete from customers; --", all it will do is harmlessly try to select a customer whose name is "'; delete from customers; --".  
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> aren't subject to classic SQL injection, and don't require filters.

        <strong>Advantages and Disadvantages</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ad-Hoc inline SQL advantages:

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           Code is compiled/optimized every time it executes (bad if different values should use the same plan OR the first value executed will cause a misshapen plan)

      <p>
        Isn't the whole point of this page, starting from the first question, about Tool X (filtering wrappers) vs Tool Y (prepared statements)?  And aren't the trade-offs precisely what are delineated in the "Advantages and Disadvantages" section, above?

        You asked, how are <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> better than wrappers?  I answered it.  My answer isn't marketing, but simply answering the question.  If you feel more balance is warranted, then perhaps your original question should be changed to, "when constructing queries, what are the advantages and disadvantages of using filtering wrappers vs <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>?"

You are oversimplifying the tradeoffs involved. They are often harder to read because the values are separated from the field names, creating more errors and potentially increasing maintenance cost. And the above injection string does NOT address the original question, as described later. -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The pros and cons of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are listed above, thus allowing the reader to consider and prioritise the tradeoffs as he/she sees fit.  Note that the alleged "complexity" of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is a development and maintenance issue.  The risk of SQL injection, as a result of an inadequate filter on a dynamic query, is a run-time issue.  One can presume that in most production applications, run-time execution of a SQL query occurs far more often -- and its failure (especially due to SQL injection) is far more costly and likely to have negative impact --  than its development and maintenance.  The implications, in terms of where particular attention should be devoted, should be self-evident.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are several problems with it, but first let's resolve the "wrapping" issue below.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>It wouldn't fail the first example. This is false or misleading. The wrapping functions typically </em>'escape quotes<em>'. If you are comparing "naked" value insertion versus wrapped values versus Prepared Statements, you need to define your working terms or create numbered references. You appear to morph into each without a clear segue. The first question was never addressed because the rest of the material is for different code from the original question. Or at least the relationship is not clear. -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we know it "wouldn't fail the first example"?  Maybe your wrapping functions are flawed.  Should I rely upon you to write correct filters?  If I use <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, I don't have to.  Anyway, my PHP example is conceptually identical to the code snippet in your question, differing only in the specific SQL statement.  You asked, "[h]ow are <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>s better than 'checking' routines?"  The PHP example and its associated text, plus "Advantages and Disadvantages" below, answer it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So you assume they are flawed up front?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't know whether they are flawed or not.  We take a risk on the <em>possibility</em> that they <em>might</em> be flawed.  If we use <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, we don't have to take that risk.  It is certainly possible that Microsoft's implementation of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is flawed, but a significantly higher percentage of users are employing Microsoft's <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> than are using your filters, so in the absence of any evidence that Microsoft's <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are flawed, we've effectively had more testing of the former than the latter.  Furthermore, we know that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> work by replacing values in a query rather than re-writing the query -- trivially demonstrated by the PHP examples above -- so by using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> we needn't rely on filters to prevent SQL injection.  Therefore, there's more justification for relying on Microsoft's <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> than for relying on your filters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why should I agree with your assumption?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why shouldn't you?  It's a reasonable assumption for even you, as the author of the filters, to not be sure whether your filters are flawed or not.  Have you done some form of formal proof, followed by extensive empirical validation, to verify their correctness?  Even if you have, can you guarantee with absolute certainty that your filters can't be fooled when they're used to construct dynamic queries?  Wouldn't it be better to not have to use filters in the first place, as is the case when using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And why should I assume Microsoft, Oracle, etc. codes stuff correctly? (Hint: they don't.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course they don't, but what should I trust more:  Your filters, or Microsoft/Oracle/whoever's mechanism for avoiding the need for filters?  Of course, if there was a SQL injection vulnerability in some vendor's implementation of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, we'd soon hear about it in the usual IT news channels, because <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are used <strong>a lot</strong>.  If your filters are flawed, we'll probably first hear about it when the contents of our customer credit card table appears in the "for sale" section of some hacker's Web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And no, </em>'it's not "conceptually identical"<em>'. You are wrong on that account. I have no idea how you came to that conclusion.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They look conceptually identical to me.  Both queries select rows from a table based on the content of some variable(s).  What is conceptually different about them?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And your pro/con summaries are vague, lacking scientific results.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They're a summary, based on understanding that anyone even minimally familiar with <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and <a href="StoredProcedure.html">StoredProcedure</a>s will inevitably have.

I'm not trotting out Stephen Hawking to claim that three out of four physicists prefer <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> over dynamic queries.  <strong>That</strong> would be <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>.  In this page, I've given you a simple PHP example that <strong>you</strong> can use to demonstrate <strong>to yourself</strong> whether or not <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> -- in your preferred DBMS -- allow query-rewriting and hence SQL injection.  If they don't, then you don't have to rely on filters to avoid SQL injection.  The only "authority", in that case, is you.

        <em>Your example as given will NOT fail the wrapped version. Perhaps you don't understand what "string escaping" is?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I know exactly what "string escaping" is, but I also know that SQL injection is not limited to failures in string escaping.  I don't know that you have implemented your filters properly; you may have made mistakes.  I do know that in general, parameterised queries and prepared statements eliminate the possibility of query re-writing -- because of how they work -- such that when I use parameterised queries and prepared statements, I don't have to trust your filters to work properly, because I don't have to use your filters.

      <p>
        You originally asked, "[h]ow are <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>s better than 'checking' and pre-processing 'wrapper' routines?"  The answer is that <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>s are better than 'checking' and pre-processing 'wrapper' routines because with <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, 'checking' and pre-processing 'wrapper' routines aren't needed, so we don't have to trust them to be correct.

      <p>
        <em>And it's not my job to find and present your side of the story. Thus, it is </em><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> as given.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What of my side of the story have I not presented?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> </em>'Empirical testing<strong> that clearly demonstrates they are "better". You perhaps may be right, but the reader is being asked to accept </strong><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>, with the seeming implication that big vendors are more trustworthy than small vendors or that database vendors are more trustworthy than wrapper API vendors. Ideally injection tests/scenarios and performance benchmark tests would be presented here for the reader. You only gave one scenario, it only fails code of your own creation (which is the "raw" SQL string-building approach, which is not what I proposed at the top). I realize such tests may be hard to come by, but at least make it clear to the reader that you are using <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>. That's not too much to ask. <strong>I have nothing against </strong><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a><strong> (barring better sources), </strong>but ask that its usage be made clear here.<em>'  -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        See below, starting with "Yes, wrappers can do type checking."  The one scenario I gave is categorical; it doesn't require "empirical testing" because <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are <strong>intended</strong> to avoid the need for filters, in order to eliminate the possibility of classic SQL injection. Aside from their performance benefits within loops, <strong>that's what they're for.</strong>  Furthermore, I'm not aware of any reported cases of classical SQL injection via <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  There are numerous ones resulting from dynamic queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For one, that could be because PS's are relatively rare, and perhaps because vendors may not be so forthcoming, simply saying, "we found a bug and fixed it in version x+1" without saying what the bug was. It would be interesting to see statistics as far as the conditions during the successful attacks, such as non-wrapped SQL versus wrapped SQL versus stored procedures versus PS's, etc. But we don't have such hard data so that we are left with just anecdotes, which is right back to my original point. Just agree your evidence is anecdotal (</em><a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>) and move on. And "categorical" could mean you are painting with too wide a brush.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        By the standard of "anecdotal" you're suggesting here, everything on the Internet is "anecdotal".  You also appear to be equating your "anecdotal" with <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>, which again puts the entirety of the Internet -- books too, I suppose, and peer-reviewed journals (obviously, the reviewers believed the "authority" of the author) -- in the same category.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I'm not sure what you mean. The ideal is empirical tests or analysis of actual attacks and representative attack techniques/strings. In other words, somebody throws bunches of A's at B to see if B can withstand the hits. For example, "in our test, we tossed the following 50 form test strings at 10 apps, one version of each using Bob's Wrappers 2.5 and one using Oracle version 7.23 PS's. 13 of them of crashed or penetrated the wrappers and 5 of them crashed or penetrated the PS's." You are doing the equivalent of bragging (talking) about the engine instead of going out and </em><a href="RaceTheDamnedCar.html">RaceTheDamnedCar</a> (or find somebody else who already did and filmed it). If somebody lies about such tests, that's a different matter. Repeatability of testing is also part of science, but so far it's not an issue <em>here</em>. -t (I'm going to use "-t" to mark my paragraphs for now on. Quoting complicates off-line writing.)<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

           Such tests are obviously appropriate if we're verifying code or comparing filters.  However, <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are not a filtering mechanism.  They're a structural mechanism.  They remove parameters from the construction of the query text, and defer inclusion of parameter values until after the query has been parsed (and compiled, usually) so the possibility of classic SQL injection -- which involves a change to the query logic by changing its command text, not merely values in the query -- is eliminated.  Of course, <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> don't preclude second order SQL injection, nor do they preclude buffer overflows, but those are very different security issues from classic SQL injection.

           The wrapper input can "contain unescaped SQL quote and delimiter characters" only because we are forced to rely on the wrappers to filter out SQL injection by correctly escaping quotes, recognising type mismatches, and the like.

           The important factor is that wrappers/filters are inherently risky.

           No, it doesn't protect against buffer overflows, for example, but filters generally don't either.  Buffer overflows are a different category of security violation.

           Re-writing is the means by which executable dynamic SQL statements are constructed, and it's the means by which classic SQL injection occurs.  Given a dynamic query like "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = '$userInput'", constructing an executable query requires that it be re-written to replace "$userInput" with the value of $userInput.  If the value of $userInput is "'; delete from customers; --", the query logic will be changed.  This is the basis for classic SQL injection.  However, a prepared statement like "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = ?" will be compiled in one step, then passed a single argument and executed in a second step.  When it's executed, the parameter value is <strong>not</strong> used to rewrite "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE name = ?".  The value is merely passed into the '?' placeholder in the pre-compiled query, so a parameter value like "'; delete from customers; --" is harmlessly compared to the 'name' attribute for every row in the 'customers' table.

        <em>Some anecdotal evidence suggests that vendors convert SQL into semi-serialized </em>'p-code<em>' or a p-code-like language internally such that commands and data are </em>still<em> mixed. The vendor theory is allegedly that internal p-code is still harder to hack than direct SQL because the hacker doesn't have direct experimental access or knowledge of the p-code. But that's still not strict separation: The p-code parser/interpreter allegedly encounters a mix of commands and data, as determined by delimiters or syntax rules. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, some implementations probably convert SQL into parse trees, some convert to executable machine code, some convert to byte code ("p-code"), and so on.  The crucial factor is that none of them rewrite the original SQL statement.  Rewriting is what makes dynamic queries risky.  Whilst passing values into some form of a planned (compiled) query may be subject to, say, buffer overflows, they're no more subject to such security risks than anything else.

        Exaggerated claims about performance are a different category of claim than asserting that (from above) "parameter values can contain unescaped SQL quote and delimiter characters" when that isn't the case.

      <p>
        It's not necessary for there to be "pure separation of commands and data/values" in some isolated memory sense.  What <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> do is isolate construction, parsing and compilation of queries from their execution.  It is only at the point of execution -- after the query has already been constructed, parsed, and (usually) compiled -- that parameter values are inserted into the query plan.  They are not used to construct a new dynamic query, so it doesn't matter whether SQL injection attempts are due to un-escaped input, or type checking failures, or trying to "trick" what are presumed to be the existing filters.  At the point of executing a prepared statement, the parameter values can be anything.  They can't cause the query to fail due to errant quotes, nor can they cause classic SQL injection by re-writing the query, because the query will not be re-parsed or re-written.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The devil is in the implementation details (which you haven't provided). If the SQL is re-written into p-code, for example, then such p-code is still subject to value injection because p-code, or even machine code, does not inherently separate commands from values.

        <em>I will agree that if commands and values are kept separate throughout the entire process, then injection attacks are much harder to do, and PS's do provide that </em>'potential<em>'.

      </p>
      <p>
        You appear to be using the term "p-code" to refer to something that hasn't been done in programming languages (or SQL DBMSs) since the early home-PC implementations of BASIC:  Some of them tokenised the user input and converted keywords to single bytes, in order to save memory and accelerate interpretation.  If a SQL DBMS did that -- converted SQL into some tokenised form, and then upon execution parsed the tokenised text -- then SQL injection would still be possible.  However, no popular SQL DBMS does this.  When SQL code is compiled (or "planned", in the usual SQL parlance), it is converted to an executable format and no further parsing or SQL re-writing takes place.  Therefore, it is <strong>not</strong> "potentially subject to injection", because once the SQL text has been converted to an executable format, no re-writing of the original query takes place, nor does any subsequent compilation take place that could convert user-supplied values into executable SQL.

        I don't see how this is "clear" evidence as claimed. You over-use "clear" or "clearly". I already explained the problems with some of these quotes, but some asshole keeps deleting stuff in this topic. Parsing characteristics are only <strong>indirect</strong> evidence for what is actually happening through the ENTIRE life-cycle. I'd like to see <strong>actual tests</strong>, not just JUST Microsoft's claims. I don't trust Microsoft. For example, few take Intel's word directly on their chip benchmarks; they prefer a 3rd party lab result, hopefully from multiple test vendors. Similar expectations should apply to Microsoft. Further, I don't see where Microsoft <em>directly claimed</em> separation. Your "conclusions" are only based indirect evidence. -t

        Prepared statements tend to harm readability and maintainability of query code and thus do have an economic cost. Whether the (claimed) security benefits are "worth it" as weighed against this maintenance tax is a shop management/owner's call. Maybe there's a "right way" to use them to improve readability, but such is not documented that I know of. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you demonstrate how prepared statements harm readability and maintainability by comparing a 20 column INSERT using prepared statements vs dynamic strings?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Insert statements don't expose the difficulty. Something like <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> may be a more fitting scenario.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By </em><a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a>, do you mean general ad-hoc queries?  That might not be an appropriate <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> for <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>s.  The typical application of prepared statements are predefined SELECT or update statements requiring one or more dynamically-generated or externally-input values.  An entire dynamically-generated WHERE clause, or a dynamic list of tables, or a dynamic list of columns, etc., usually can't be parameterised (though the specific rules vary from SQL product to SQL product.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> can be generated dynamically -- even in a <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> system -- with the user-supplied values passed via parameters in order to increase security. A well-designed <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> system shouldn't be obtaining non-parametrisable elements from the client as literal strings -- e.g., table and attribute names, operators, etc. -- so the need for validation should be minimal.  Does the use of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> in such a <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> system harm readability and maintainability over using non-parametrised queries?  Maybe slightly, but the construction of the QBE system should be a one-off cost, aside from the usual maintenance, and a QBE system is already a complex beast.  I'm not sure the difference between dynamic queries and <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> make much of a dint in the overall complexity of a <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> system, especially as the filtering needed for dynamic queries is potentially complex.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Roughly 2/3 of all application queries I write have some dynamic component. If they are static like that, then typically <strong>Stored Procedures</strong> are used in Internet shops I've worked at, not prepared statements. (Although I should point out that "dynamic reporting" tends to be my specialty such that my observations may be frequency-biased that way.) -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In some DBMSs, a prepared statement internally becomes a stored procedure.  Think of a prepared statement as being a convenient shorthand way of specifying a (possibly temporary) stored procedure.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's typically a shop decision, a typical developer can only give recommendations. Also, the issue of how to clean dynamic queries is still outstanding. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Clean dynamic queries -- whether from coding necessity, or due to a (peculiar, and unlikely) shop policy against prepared statements -- are a different topic deserving its own page. Clean dynamic queries aren't prepared statements.  And, of course, prepared statements can be generated dynamically.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The shop decision process intersects <em>all</em> the solution topics. Look at it from the perspective if a typical shop with a lot of dynamic queries. There are basically 3 options: stored procedures (SP), prepared statements (PS), and "custom" value wrappers (VW), as shown in the intro. If most of the queries are dynamic, then VW are pretty much the only choice for those. A shop would rather not support and train for 3 different SQL protection techniques. Thus, they'd be looking to find a way to cut down. Limiting the choices to SP and VW covers most of them reasonably well. The boss may figure that if VW is good enough for dynamic queries, then it's good enough for static ones also. A hacker is not just going to try to exploit static queries. It's like a warehouse with 10 doors. If you put up 3 metal doors and leave 7 of them wooden, that's barely better than 10 wooden because a crook will likely check and try multiple doors. It's even worse than the warehouse scenario, because different door types means learning to maintain/train-for different door types, if we apply software issues to doors. Organizations badly want <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a>. Too many different shop ways to do mostly the same thing harms this goal. -t

        Is this debate about using prepared statements when building truly dynamic SQL (that is a simple variable replacement won't cut it, which is equivalent on MS to the SQL cannot be embedded into a stored procedure without using string literals)?

        Understand that at my workplace, we *have* run the tests and found that the compile once/optimize once benefit for nontrivial SQL were so great that we could measure the difference using a stopwatch without even invoking a loop. I cannot release the test setup only because it is too tied to our proprietary database setup. I find it hard to believe that someone who favors table based programming as much as you do has never attempted the same. The <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> argument involved here leads me to believe more than anything else, you're doing prepared statements wrong. Oh, and we did get to run the experiment about escaping SQL strings thanks to some guys who decided to maliciously comply with incorrectly written policies rather than violate them when necessary (assembling SQL strings in a stored procedure is still assembling SQL strings). I was the only engineer here who could remember to correctly escape strings every single time.

I've work at approximately 10 different organizations as either a consultant or employee, that had external-facing websites, and PS's were not used in a single one. I do not believe they are "stupid", but rather weighed the costs and benefits. Like I said in a sister topic, most of the stuff I worked on were dynamic queries, which can't use PS's. Some shops already used Stored Procedures (SP's) for most static queries, and so put the high-volume queries in as SP's. If such shops supported PS's and SP's and wrapper functions for dynamic queries, then the shop is supporting <strong>three kinds of SQL control conventions</strong>. Shops don't like to support semi-redundant interfaces because they like <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a>, and thus look to cut down if practical. So, they put most of the static ones in SP's and used wrappers for the rest, making only two interfaces they had to support and hire around. That sounds reasonable to me as a business decision. Further, a hacker won't just stop with static queries, they'd test multiple queries typically such that the <strong>dynamic queries are still the safety bottleneck</strong>. Like I said elsewhere, it's like putting 3 metal doors on a warehouse but leaving the other 7 as wooden doors. A crook will likely try more than one door such that supporting metal doors is a waste (if they have a <strong>carrying</strong> cost, which SQL protection tools do in terms of training & support). Adding a third protocol, PS's, <strong>won't solve the ACTUAL problem</strong>. And decent hackers probably know that dynamic queries (output) is more likely to not have PS's (because most PS's don't support dynamic queries.) <strong>Crooks know to look for the wooden doors</strong>. Such decisions seem perfectly rational to me, but my detractor hand-waved this all away with vague dismissals. All mouth no and ears, which is frustrating.<em> -t</em>

        I'm not sure what you mean.  Your original question was, "[h]ow are <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> better than 'checking' and pre-processing 'wrapper' routines?"  In order to answer it, the first PHP example demonstrates the problem (SQL injection) that your filters are intended to fix.  The second PHP example demonstrates that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> fix the problem (SQL injection) without needing filters.  Thus <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are better because they don't need "'checking' and pre-processing 'wrapper' routines".  Is that not how you interpreted it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The injection example you gave does not "fail" the first example. It almost has nothing to do with the first example. You just think........weird! You seem to assume certain notions in your head are universally understood/implied such that you skip key details.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The injection example only doesn't fail the first example if the filters are correct.  How do we know they're correct?  As I pointed out in my descriptions with the examples, "we should sanitise user inputs, but this requires discipline and assurance that the sanitisation has been successful.  That adds complexity and risk."  In fact, it's generally considered risky.  See, for example, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Escaping">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection#Escaping</a>  
      </p>
      <p>
        With <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, we don't take a risk of filters failing, because we don't rely on filters.

      <p>
        I thought I did illustrate that issue.  <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> "guts" would have to be written in a bizarrely flawed way to fail.  They don't rely on filters because SQL vendors typically internally implement <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> parameters as true parameters to what is effectively (and, in some cases, really) a pre-compiled stored procedure.  They can be trivially tested as I've shown in my second PHP example.  If query re-writing took place, it would demonstrate that failure.  Filtering <strong>could</strong> conceivably be used to achieve the same end (say, as a quick-hack implementation of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> in some low end DBMS), but if it were exploitable we'd hear about it very, very quickly -- especially if the DBMS is open source.  If it's a commercial, closed-source DBMS, we can safely assume that the vendor is not going to take the cheap way out, given the significant business risks involved in producing a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementation that's subject to classic SQL injection.  Not that there's any reason to do so -- implementing <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> properly in a DBMS is technically straightforward, as it can leverage all the facilities already used to provide stored procedures.

           <em>Re "They can be trivially tested as I've shown in my second PHP example" -- I am NOT talking about the second example. If you are switching contexts, your text should make that CLEAR.</em>

        <li>
           If we're talking about <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> e.g., "if PS guts are written bad", then surely we're talking about the second example?

        <li>
           You claimed I am "switching contexts" by referring to the second PHP example, when it appears you'd already "switched contexts" to the second PHP example by referring to "PS guts".

        <li>
           <em>No, that's the 3rd example.</em>
        </li>

      <ul>
        <li>
           So?  It's still you who "switched contexts", not me.

           How so?

      <p>
        <em>Your sample, "'; delete from customers; --" has NO clear relationship with the sample at the top of the page, as written.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The relationship is that it's a string you need to filter out of dynamic queries, in order to prevent SQL injection.  It's also used to demonstrate that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> do not perform query rewriting.  If they don't perform query rewriting, classic SQL injection is impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No. For the ACTUAL example you gave, all you have to do is quote escaping to have it "pass", which should be done anyhow because if you don't, then entering "regular" quotes and hyphens in forms will crash the form.  And it demonstrates almost nothing about the implementation of SP's. I could mirror the same results using quote escaping inside clones of your SP api's.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, entering regular quotes and hyphens won't crash anything.  (You mean the query associated with the form, don't you?)  Yes, you could always use "quote escaping" (which isn't sufficient, by the way -- it won't handle typechecking failures, like passing a SQL injection string where the query expects a number.  E.g., "3; delete from customers;" passed to "SELECT * FROM customers WHERE custno = $userinput") in some API clone, but the whole point is that "quote escaping" and other filtering is risky.  <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, however, are no more risky than any other DBMS-side code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wrappers can do type checking also. And SP's may also rely on filtering. Their literature doesn't deny it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, wrappers can do type checking.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I wrote above, there might be <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> (is that what you mean by "SP's"?) that rely on filtering -- perhaps in low-end DBMSs as a quick hack by the developers to add <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> to a feature list.  However, it's unlikely.  Looking at typical <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementations in (say) Microsoft's SQL Server, DB2, PostgreSQL and so on, it appears there are obvious hints that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are done "properly", i.e., they insert values into a planned (compiled) query: 
      </p>
      <p>
        First, parameters are restricted to positions within queries where only values can appear.  If <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> were implemented via filters and query rewriting, there would be no need for such restrictions.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Second, there is a clear performance difference between executing a prepared statement vs executing a dynamic query.  The former is almost invariably faster than the latter; roughly equivalent to the performance of executing an equivalent stored procedure.  Thus, it appears executing a prepared statement means executing a planned (compiled) query -- into which values are inserted into value locations in the query plan -- rather than producing a filtered, re-written, parsed, and planned (compiled) query.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Third, if stored procedures are supported, all the mechanisms are already in place to properly implement <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  The same mechanism that allows arguments to be passed via parameters in a compiled stored procedure can be used to allow arguments to be passed via parameters in a prepared statement.  Why would DBMS vendors deliberately risk SQL injection by avoiding that pre-existing mechanism?
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, this is inference based on observations.  Whilst typical vendor documentation doesn't go into details about how <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are implemented, you can talk to people who have worked on DBMS implementation and easily discover that what I've described here is typical.

      <p>
        I'm not saying I've talked to people who have worked on DBMS implementation (though I have, but that's not the point) because <strong>I am</strong> someone who has worked on DBMS implementation and I know your nonsense about p-code and the like is nonsense.

      </p>
      <p>
        The "p-code thing" is nonsense.  It's not how any popular DBMSs are implemented, and I don't know any unpopular ones that do it either.  It appears to be something you made up.

      </p>
      <p>
        "Tokenized code" is something very different from p-code, Java bytecode, .NET CLR assemblies, and so on.  The latter are all object code.  The former is tokenized source code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Doesn't change the general point either way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps not, except that tokenized source code hasn't been used in a popular programming language since 1970-1980 era microcomputer BASIC interpreters, and your argument about "p-code" being subject to classic SQL injection only applies to tokenized source code.

        <strong>Have Both?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That dynamic query-creating approach you show is a bit awkward. But with wrappers very similar to my original version, perhaps the ugliness can be wrapped away so that we can have our PS cake and eat it too.
      </p>
      <code>
        // pseudo-code example 4761, based on original example. "&" is concat.<br/>
        q = querylibrary.new();  // create a query object with default connection info<br/>
        ...<br/>
        sql01 = "select * from foo where xcode=" & q.sqlString(myXCode) & " and id=" & q.sqlNum(myId);<br/>
        sql02 = " and zerk = " & q.sqlString(myZerk);<br/>
        // result: <br/>
        //   - sql01 = "select * from foo where xcode= $1 and id= $2"<br/>
        //   - sql02 = " and zerk = $3"<br/>
        q.run(sql01 & sql02);  // see below<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The implementation of these query library functions would resemble the following, roughly based on the prior Php examples:
      </p>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
        method sqlString(fldValue) {<br/>
        this.fieldArray.addElement(fldValue);  // store field value in array<br/>
        this.typeArray.addElement("String");  // may NOT be needed for some PS kits<br/>
        }  // method sqlNum is similar<br/>
        method run(theSql) {<br/>
        this.pg_prepare(this.connection, this.queryID, theSql);<br/>
        this.pg_execute(this.connection, this.queryID, this.fieldArray, this.typeArray);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, for more complex queries, I tend to break them into parts (sub-strings for sql portions) and then append them together in the end, often <strong>conditionally</strong> based on various computations along the way. But this may not be a problem if it's okay to skip numbers in the sequence. I haven't tested PS's in that regard. For example, the final string before value insertion may be "SELECT FROM foo WHERE X = $1 And Y = $3". The element "$2" may have been purposely skipped; its sql string segment ignored due to a conditional test.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it flies, then it's not an either/or choice as originally assumed near the top. An application programmer would barely have to even care whether SP's were used under the hood (by the library) or not. SP's could even be switched on/off for testing etc. Wouldn't that be lovely? -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The "either/or choice" was between relying on filter functions to avoid SQL injection vs using prepared statements to avoid SQL injection.  Your example is not relying on filter functions to avoid SQL injection, and it is using </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  That's good.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nothing here, or on </em><a href="TopOnPreparedStatements.html">TopOnPreparedStatements</a>, was intended to suggest that it's wrong to use wrapper functions to help construct SQL <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.

I'm not sure what the benefit would be of switching <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> (or stored procedures) on or off, though.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Often intermediate API's have glitches. If you have a way to run SQL "directly" or through a different mechanism, then you may be able to detect or isolate such glitches. It may also speed up certain kinds of testing that require masses of trial-and-error since there may be overhead for some SP's.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you give an example of the glitches that </em><a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> APIs often have?  Can you give an example of the "overhead for some SPs" (do you mean <strong>s</strong>tored <strong>p</strong>rocedures, or <strong>p</strong>repared <strong>s</strong>tatements?) that may affect testing?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Specifics? No. I'd suggest searching bug blogs if you want specifics. Further, one sometimes wants to <em>rule such out</em> by using both execution techniques. Thus, even if the API's are perfect, we may still need to verify that fact (for specific cases). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You appear to be saying testing is important, which is always true.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it's not always easy to break SQL execution down into sub-components for analysis, being able to rule out a middle-ware API bug is always helpful. Part of the problem is that SQL is a complex language, meaning that translation can often go wrong or act different than intended at the API level.
