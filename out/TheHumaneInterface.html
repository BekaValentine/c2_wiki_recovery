        There are some theoretical foundations in the book: GOMS analysis and some cognitive psychology stuff on attention loci, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the points of the book:
      </p>
      <p>
        People develop habits. <strong>Habits are good</strong> because then you can
        focus on other tasks. Thus, <strong>asking for confirmation is bad</strong>
        because users will develop a habit of confirming the command, or the
        interface will be obnoxious to use. Thus, commands must be undoable.
        Furthermore, adaptive user interfaces are bad, if the adaptation
        interferes with habits formed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Modes are bad</strong> because they cause errors, even when there is an
        indicator for the mode. That's because people will focus on the task,
        not on indicators. This applies also for hardware (powerswitches are
        bad) and applications (restarting an application should put you back
        where you left it, not in another mode). <strong></strong><a href="QuasiMode.html">QuasiMode</a>s are good<strong> --</strong>
        pressing a key to activate a mode (such as Shift, Control, Alt, or
        Meta) is good, because the touch required provides feedback on the
        mode. Therefore <a href="LeapMode.html">LeapMode</a> is good.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Monotony is good.</strong> If there is only one way of doing things,
        then people develop habits and feel secure and in control. If there
        are too many choices, it is difficult to teach, and difficult to use
        because you have to decide <em>how</em> you will do something.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Customization is bad</strong> because people tinker too much with the
        system. There is no proof that after customization, people are more
        productive. Furthermore, the software is harder to test, and harder
        to debug. And there is no reason to believe that users will be better
        usability engineers than the authors of the software. Plus a lot of
        choice makes the system non-monotonous (see above).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Icons are bad</strong> because as soon as you have more than a very small
        number of them, they need explaining again. Therefore, stick to texts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Zooming Interface</strong> is something to replace applications,
        desktop, browsers, etc. All of the content is displayed on an
        infinite virtual plane. As you zoom closer, documents can be edited.
        See <a href="ZoomableUserInterface.html">ZoomableUserInterface</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Filesystems are bad.</strong> Instead, just provide an interface where
        the user can type text. If not the zooming interface, then perhaps
        the old <a href="CanonCat.html">CanonCat</a> interface -- one huge text with document separation
        characters. If it is easy to select text and print it -- ie. it is
        easy to mark the text between two document markers -- then files are
        not useful. Consider the hassle of learning the importance of files,
        directories, filenames, etc. when all the user wants to do is type
        text and print it.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And which if you want to store it for later recovery, you can merely scan it and write down the place and name of where you put it in your day-timer (or even put it there).</em>
