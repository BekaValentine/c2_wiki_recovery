        Xproduct Marketing
      </h1>
      <p>
        The tendency for marketing departments and technologists to prefix product names with the letter 'X' in order to indicate that they are futuristic, <em>cool</em> and generally better than everything else. There is also a tendency for people to believe them. If the full name of the product begins with 'Ex' this gives a second weak justification for the moniker (e.g., 'Extensible', 'Experience', 'Extreme').
