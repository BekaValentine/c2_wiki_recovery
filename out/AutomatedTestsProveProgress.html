        Automated Tests Prove Progress
      </h1>
      <p>
        Should the tests that prove progress be <a href="AutomatedTest.html">AutomatedTest</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think there is any choice. If the tests aren't automated, eventually no one will execute them (even if they are automated it can be a chore). When testing stops, the project goes to hell. It hurts when we do this.

        <em>So all tests for user stories can be automated?</em> If they can't, it ain't a story.

        So, do you apply the <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> to represent the <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s, or in what kind of framework do you run the tests?
      </p>
      <p>
        A server can use something much like the <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> xUnit. For GUI-oriented code I don't know of an outstanding solution. I'm trying to experiment with writing <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>'s for a trading system (using <a href="TimeTravel.html">TimeTravel</a>), but I find myself writing gui code without tests all the time (one of the drawbacks of <a href="ExtremeProgrammingForOne.html">ExtremeProgrammingForOne</a> is that there is no one there to stop me). The <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>'s for the domain model help a lot, but I'm still falling back on <a href="PokeAndPeek.html">PokeAndPeek</a> far too much. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        I've used 3rd party tools for GUI testing, like SQA Test (now owned by Rational) and Microsoft MS Test.
        It's generally best to use a tool that can check and interact with the widgits you're using rather than just screen bitmaps -- so your tests will be more robust. It's tedious, but can be a real lifesaver. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        How do you automatically test the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> "The shuttle engines shall turn off 3 minutes after ignition"?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Behind me asking this is a confusion in my mind abouthow much Xp is "just" about software. There's hardware, working procedures policies, and much more involved in the solution of many business problems. Sometimes part of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> is not doing anything in the software at all, but changing the other bits so that the functionality is no longer required in the software. I'm sure this is the wrong place to discuss this point - if someone wants to point me in the right direction I'd be greatful). -- <a href="PaulHudson.html">PaulHudson</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a fine place to start discussion of this point.  This page first arose (as I remember) because I questioned the use of 'automated tests' (now 'repeatable tests') in Article 2 of the <a href="SoftwareManagementManifesto.html">SoftwareManagementManifesto</a> - with exactly this kind of issue in mind.  Although the context there is a software project, the truly professional team always needs to be mindful of ways to meet certain customer objectives (which should still be testable) without writing software.

        "Sometimes part of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> is <strong>not doing anything in the software at all</strong>, but changing the other bits so that the functionality is no longer required in the software" deserves a page of its own if this point is not already made forcably enough on Wiki.  <a href="TomGilb.html">TomGilb</a> and I would certainly co-author it with you!  --> see <a href="SimplifyTheRequirements.html">SimplifyTheRequirements</a> <em>great </em><a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, great points, what's the impact on testing?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It all depends on what a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> is allowed to be. <a href="OfficialXpPersonnel.html">OfficialXpPersonnel</a>? -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        A <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> can be a story describing any function the <em>system</em> must perform. I look forward to hearing how to remove "the shuttle engines shall turn off 3 minutes after ignition" from the software requirements. Supplying only 3 minutes of fuel won't work: I happen to know there's another story about getting out of orbit.

        You forget:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The booster rockets run out of fuel and are dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
           The main fuel tank empties and is dropped.
        </li>
        <li>
           Another fuel tank, in the shuttle, is used for manuvering and to slow to reentry speed.
        </li>
      </ol>

        What do you mean by <em>"tests that prove progress"</em> ?
      </p>
      <p>
        At first I jumped to the conclusion that we were talking about tests that somehow checked to make sure the system was actually getting *better* (smaller, faster, handles more data more efficiently, ... something like that).
        Some sort of time-dependent test that, instead of checking that the program could handle the full 500 GB in the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, today only checked 0.5 GB, but next week it checked 5.0 GB, etc. ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Are we really talking about the "normal" XP process of:
        <a href="AutomatedTest.html">AutomatedTest</a>
        <a href="ContinuousTesting.html">ContinuousTesting</a>
        <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>
        ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Those tests don't really prove "progress". But they are incredibly helpful in proving that the latest modifications to the program don't cause "NegativeProgress".
