        Load On Demand
      </h1>
      <p>
        Unlike <a href="ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization.html">ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization</a>, <a href="LoadOnDemand.html">LoadOnDemand</a> defers the creation of a costly resource to a point in time when that resource is actually needed. Often, that point in time is <em>never</em>, which is a quite substantial improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        Common implementations use a flag (bool loaded, bool opened, etc.), or create an empty envelope that fills itself when it's opened (yeah, the metaphor is lacking there).

        Is this analogous to DeferredInstantiation? -- <a href="DrewMarsh.html">DrewMarsh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, it's more special in that it implies a </em>costly resource<em>. </em>DeferredConstruction is a way to implement <a href="LoadOnDemand.html">LoadOnDemand</a>, but DeferredInstantiation covers more cases, like when you need to supply some data to open a resource (like some resource identifier, which is needed to access the resource).<em></em>

        Is this like <a href="LazyObject.html">LazyObject</a>? -- <a href="ErikMeade.html">ErikMeade</a>
