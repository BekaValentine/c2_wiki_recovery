      <p>
        The successor to the CDC (<a href="ControlData.html">ControlData</a>) 6000 and 7000 architectures designed exclusively for high-performance <em>scientific</em> processing, and relied on discrete semiconductors. Both were designed by chief engineer <a href="SeymourCray.html">SeymourCray</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CDC Star, the first vector-processor, was relabeled the Cyber 200.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cyber 170 line incorporated integrated circuits while remaining instruction-set compatible with the 6600 and 7600.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Cyber 180 series featured a 64-bit word, virtual memory, a predictably full set of <em>scientific</em> instructions for its traditional market running FORTRAN (<a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>). Contrary to CDC's history, the 180 series included <em>commercial</em> instructions used especially in Europe, where CDC mainframes sold well to run COBOL (<a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>). The 180 series top-of-the-line was its model 990: a <a href="VectorProcessing.html">VectorProcessing</a> <a href="MainframeComputer.html">MainframeComputer</a>, but despite an automatically vectorizing and optimizing FORTRAN compiler, plus a separate object-code optimizer, its performance was reportedly disappointing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There was also a Cyber 205, produced in a joint venture with EtaSystems.
