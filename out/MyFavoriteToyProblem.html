        My Favorite Toy Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think you know what I mean; I think you have at least one
        problem that you solve with each language or methodology as
        you learn it. It's a LearningPattern, related to <a href="BodyFollowsEyes.html">BodyFollowsEyes</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's the problem you solve each time you start learning
        a new programming language, software platform, hardware
        platform, or <shudder> methodology. It's a way of familiarizing
        yourself with the environment, a way of ensuring that your
        assumptions about how things work are correct. It's not
        too trivial a problem, otherwise you're really not learning
        anything; it's not too difficult, otherwise you'll be quickly
        defeated by the complexities and will abandon the language.
        (Possible relation to or subdivision of <a href="GoldilocksSolution.html">GoldilocksSolution</a>?)
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a means of gaining confidence by solving the familiar
        within an unfamiliar context, a specific focus while learning
        an abstract grammar, a gauge or barometer of how well you've
        learned things. Once done, you can even dismantle and generalize
        the solution, cannibalize it for parts, or <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> it into a
        framework, a prototypical example, or a template boilerplate.
      </p>
      <p>
        You might even <em>not</em> code it up, simply use it to provide 
        a context or framework for learning: "Ah, so I can use an 
        <a href="OrderedCollection.html">OrderedCollection</a> to set up a priority queue for my 
        ElevatorSimulation." Or, "Hm, so I can use the <a href="StatePattern.html">StatePattern</a>
        to model the internal states of my <a href="TurMite.html">TurMite</a>." Or, "How would I
        make a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> of my <a href="GameOfLife.html">GameOfLife</a>?" It's an intensely personal
        thing, and you often feel proprietary towards your toy problem.
      </p>

      <p>
        You're excited by a new environment, such as a programming language
        or a methodology. You have fiddled with it for a little bit,
        trying out trivial examples, to get a feel for the grammar, or the
        water, or the social situation.
        You're not confident that you can use the environment
        to solve major problems yet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore,</em> solve a non-trivial problem with which you are intimately
        familiar. Exercise your skill in the new environment by implementing a solution to that problem, to ensure that
        your assumptions are correct, to gauge how well you've learned the
        rules of that environment, and to build confidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>However,</em> you don't have time for it. You must jump in at
        the deep end, before you're fully cognizant of even some of the
        rules of the game. <needs more>

        ElevatorSimulation is a perennial (and personal) favorite: <a href="LittleSimulator.html">LittleSimulator</a>.
        It's complex enough to use when learning a software methodology
        or a programming language.

        More examples would be appreciated, of course. As this is my first

        One of my favorites is to write a pocket calculator.  
        Sounds trivial.  There are I/O issues (you can't just 
        type a line and press <Enter> and you can't just mouse), 
        there are user interface issues, there is the obvious 
        math stuff, and a bunch of little silly things that 
        become problematic depending on the language you've chosen.  
        Some languages *really* aren't good for this.  Some of the 
        "toys" I've written have tried to TakeOverTheWorld as they've 
        acquired features.
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally I've gone as far as to write a language interpreter.  
        I wrote a <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> interpreter in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>.  I wrote an 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> simulator in <a href="FoxPro.html">FoxPro</a>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I used to use this technique when teaching languages:  we set out 
        to write LPRINT.EXE in <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>, the object being to allow 
        the user to type lines analogous to those used in BASIC to control 
        the printer from the DOS command line.  LPRINT, in its simplest 
        form, allows commands like "LPRINT 27 65" which does precisely 
        what the BASIC line "LPRINT CHR$(27)+CHR$(65);" does.  But then we 
        allowed different number bases for input, string inputs, allowed 
        redirection of output, take input from a file source, escapes in 
        strings ("hello world\r\n"), and so on.  Eventually the toy would 
        TakeOverTheWorld.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have long since lost the source code for my original "toy" in 
        <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, a general purpose text filter called XTYPE.EXE, but 
        I use the binary all the time.

           That's a toy problem? How many Forth words? Is the GUI interface so straightforward that it didn't take more than a toy amount of effort? If so I should check it out, which Palm Forth? GUIs are usually a pain in toy problems.

        I also like to implement the UNIX <em>cat</em> and <em>tee</em> utilities.  They're great for exercising the basics of opening files and reading/writing lines.

           With all of the <em>cat</em> options, one hopes. ;-)

        In learning a new programming language, toolkit, or library, some people write "Hello, World". One I knew would write a hex dump utility. I calculate Mayan dates. Probably my very first real programming effort involved taking a Mayan date calculator written in FORTRAN and re-creating it in C. Since then I've rewritten it many times, and used the basic code as the core for implementing a prototype to learn new things, including web CGIs, servlets, Mozilla XPCOM, Web Services, and more. It was the natural choice for my foray into FIT: <a href="http://cmdev.com/antfit/examples/.">http://cmdev.com/antfit/examples/.</a> --<a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>
