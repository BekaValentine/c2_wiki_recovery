        What There Is To Like About Wards Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        In case anyone finds themselves wondering <a href="WhatThereIsToLikeAboutWardsWiki.html">WhatThereIsToLikeAboutWardsWiki</a>, perhaps ponder the following:

        First of all, of course the technical expertise here is wonderful. Reading the bios of some of our <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> (yes I've googled a few too) one soon realizes that a veritable book of tech who's whos has hung here over the years. Being rather a novice programmer, the exposure to new (to me) ideas has broadened my knowledge quite a bit and sent me off on tangents of searches for more information on a variety of topics. The reason being that in this place people speak passionately about the stuff they care about. I never thought that I would aspire to be anything like a <a href="SmugSmalltalkWeenie.html">SmugSmalltalkWeenie</a> until I started hanging out here.. The high degree of anarchy of this place (in my opinion) contributes to the passionate expression of ideas.

        Secondly, we all know (or should) that a little R&R goes a long way.. so I like the fact that we have <a href="CategoryHumor.html">CategoryHumor</a>, <a href="CategoryMovie.html">CategoryMovie</a>, etc., not to mention all the philosophical pages such as <a href="DefinitionOfLifeDeclined.html">DefinitionOfLifeDeclined</a>. Variety is a good thing. This site is a good thing. I really don't want to think that I boarded a sinking ship in Feb04 when my obsessive compulsive editing self got the better of me and got me hooked.. only to discover a treasure trove of information, conversations, and interesting people. I've been told that I'm a bit opinionated, somewhat fanatical, and full of (an absurd assortment of knowledge).. I've felt right at home here.

        I'm certainly not the only one who tries to throw a bucket of calm on all-too-common feuds. I actually don't think C2 is a sinking ship.. just going through changes once again. I just get worried when I don't see as many familiar names in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Of course, this is an old lament that has been voiced well before I ever got here. Or any names at all! <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a> is an idea important to the vitality of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, and I for one absolutely believe that AnonymitySucks.

        One of the problems is one shared by everyone on the Internet, that being explosive growth. Statistics say that spam (UCE) has been growing exponentially and now that spammers have found wikis, maintenance is more time consuming. This wears all us <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> a little thin. Kind of takes the fun away. <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s do the same thing.

        Really, I just started this page because there seem to be so many negative pages lately I thought a <strong>positive</strong> one would be nice. -- <a href="RonJandrasi.html">RonJandrasi</a> (still inspired, just less obsessed)
