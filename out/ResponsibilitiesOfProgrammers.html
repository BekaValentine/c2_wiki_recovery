        Responsibilities Of Programmers
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many debates here on Wiki (and elsewhere) center on the <em>responsibilities</em> of programmers--to a wide variety of parties.  Many design methodologies (including <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>) focus on a programmer's responsibilities to the "customers" of a project (stakeholders, end-users).  Other discussions have focused on a programmer's responsibility to society at large; to a programmer's responsibility to the programming and technical community; and to him/herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Following is a list of responsibilities programmers <em>may</em> (some are debatable) have to the above groups.  The list may include conflicting responsibilities--that's OK.  Feel free to add your own--or if you are ambitious, add your own category (but define it).  OK to put the same responsibility in more than one category, if it applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        As programming attempts to become more "respectable", and become recognized as an engineering discipline (alongside mechanical, civil, and chemical); or a profession (alongside accounting, law, and medicine), or a craft/trade/art/whatever--these responsibilites will come more and more into play.

        The groups to whom programmers have reponsibilities:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Our Stakeholders</strong>:  Whoever is paying for the programmer's work.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Our Customers</strong>:  The end-users of the programmer's work.  In many situations, the stakeholders and customers are one and the same (or at least in the same organization).  In others (shrinkwrap software, embedded systems); they are separate entities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Our society</strong>: If programmers are to be recognized and treated as professionals; we must have obligations to society at large--not just the folks paying the bills.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
