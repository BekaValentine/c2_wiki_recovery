        Bean Counters
      </h1>
      <p>
        The people who write your paychecks and give your department money to buy new stuff.   Their needs are often closely allied with those of the GoldUsers -- I am almost certain that GoldUser was a part of XP in the past.  It's been refactored out.

        Also, a (somewhat derogatory) term for MonitorEvaluator accountancy types of person more generally. Is is an unfortunate accident of history that bean counters in this sense have become the defining example of "professionalism" as used by too many middle-managers.

        I know <em>bean counter</em> is is meant to apply
        to accounting types who, stereotypically, are
        more concerned about the numbers adding up
        than what they represent. But the term can
        apply to anyone who can't see the forest
        for the trees.

        I worked (thankfully briefly) for a company
        that had project managers whose sole
        contribution to design meetings was, "And
        how long will it take to do it that way?",
        every time someone brought up a possible
        implementation. Not just once, but like
        a broken record. Dilbert wan't funny
        during that stretch. PERT-chart city.
