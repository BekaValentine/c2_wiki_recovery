        <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> is a 100%(tm) Java-based <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> layer (originally written in Smalltalk) developed by <a href="TheObjectPeople.html">TheObjectPeople</a>. TOP was sold to BEA in April 2000 with the <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> product being split off and sold to <a href="WebGain.html">WebGain</a>. <a href="WebGain.html">WebGain</a> was an independent company funded by Warburg Pincus Ventures (majority share) with BEA holding a non-voting minority share. <a href="WebGain.html">WebGain</a> sold the <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> product in May of 2002 to Oracle (<a href="WebGain.html">WebGain</a> has since ceased operations and other intellectual property it owned has also been sold).

        I just followed the links - they are no longer offering a free evaluation copy for their <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> version.

        <em>I understand that, sadly, they are abandoning the (Smalltalk version of the) product. What a pity. Just another takeover casualty.</em>

        I wonder if there would be any way for them to <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> the <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> version of <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a>?

        This is Oracle's newer version of the <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> OR Tool.  Oracle purchased <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> in May of 2002, and now continues to develop and support it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Applications using Oracle9iAS <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> can store/retrieve Java objects into relational  
        databases, XML files, or other data sources.  There is no need to subclass data objects from 
        pre-made class types, any existing data object can be mapped and stored.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oracle9iAS <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a> has support for JDO APIs.  Also, it is built on top of JDBC.  This makes it 
        portable across any JDBC compliant database: including Oracle, DB2, SQL Server, Sybase, 
        Informix, and Access.

        I have created a Wiki about <a href="TopLink.html">TopLink</a>: <a href="http://toplink.waldura.com.">http://toplink.waldura.com.</a> At this point in time it's mostly my own notes + some stuff I lifted off the Toplink forum at Oracle. Maybe it'll grow into something interesting? --RenaudWaldura
