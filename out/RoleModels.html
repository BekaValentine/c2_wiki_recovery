        I haven't done any work trying to come up with patterns about defining and
        using roles (although it is a good idea to do something along those lines).
        Peter Coad [1] has a very brief outline in his Actor-Transaction pattern, but
        like most of his patterns its a very generic outline, useful but not that
        detailed. There are also some ideas discussed by David Hay [2] in his chapter
        on Contracts. (Hay's book is not an object-oriented book, but is conceptual
        and thus still very valuable.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There is divided opinion about how much you should use roles. Coad's style is
        really to use roles all the time, while Hay's style is to avoid using roles
        except for very rare cases. This difference in style between Coad and Hay is
        echoed right across the modeling community.
      </p>
      <p>
        My own preference is to start without using roles, just putting features on
        Person, Organization or their supertype: Party. If you find that in different
        contexts Parties get at significantly different behaviour, then that is the
        force that leads you to roles. I wouldn't use them without that force (don't
        build a complication you don't need.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There is always an alternative to using roles, that is to look at the
        relationship itself. For example, you can model a person being employed by a
        company in four ways.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           you can have an association between Person and Company.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           you can have Employee as a subclass of Person. Employee has an association to Company.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           you can have Person with many PersonRoles. A subtype of PersonRole is Employee, which has an association to Company.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           you can have a class Employment which is associated with Person and Company (you can think of it as turning the association between Person and Company into a class).
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I would start with (1) as it is the simplest. If there was significantly
        different behavior for employees I would move to one of the others. (2) is
        conceptually simple and works well if there are few such roles. However it
        would probably require you to change the class of a Person, which although
        conceptually simple, is rather more awkward to implement. (3) and (4) are very
        similar: they both make it easy to switch the Person from being an Employee to
        non-employee; you can have many roles at once, including many employee roles;
        by adding a date range to the class you can easily keep a history of the times
        the person was an employee. The choice between the two is mainly on whether
        you wish to emphasize the relationship that defines the role (4) or the role
        itself (3). My experiences have usually led to to (4), but that does not make
        (3) wrong. (For an example of how I have done this take a look at my paper on
        organization structures [3]).
      </p>
      <p>
        All this is off the top of my head, and is probably a little too general for
        your particular problem, but I hope it is helpful. If you have any more
        questions feel free to email me and I will do what I can to help
        further.Someday I may even write a pattern on this.

        I have worked on money transfer systems at banks where the concept of "role" is currently in use (but is now being questioned).  
      </p>
      <p>
        A money transfer involves moving cash from one bank to another - often through a third bank (or other financial institution).  Each bank may be a "sending institution" on one money transfer, a "receiving institution" on a second money transfer and a "correspondent bank" (an intermediary) on a third money transfer.  Since the information about a bank does not change from one money transfer to the next it is useful to keep the bank information (which remains constant on all of the transactions) separated from the transaction information.  The role information currently describes the sequence in which parties in the transaction will send money to one another.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Since the responsibilities of a bank remain constant (pass the money along to the next party in the payment chain) no matter what the role, there have been some discussions about changing the system (an international interbank network) to just have a list of parties.
