      <p>
        Dan took the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> course from <a href="ChrisCleeland.html">ChrisCleeland</a> at WashingtonUniversity.
        Has had training OOT
        Has extensive experience in C++, now working with TAO CORBA and begin some interaction with JAVA.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Note, use the following when getting TAO to work with JAVA
      </p>
      <p>
        As of the present, Dec 14, 2000, TAO version 1.0 implementing CORBA 2.2 uses an IIOP version 1.2 endpoint by default
      </p>
      <p>
        JAVA versions use either 1.1 or 1.0
      </p>
      <p>
        In order for me to get my JAVA JDK 1.3 client to recognize a C++ TAO server i had to start the Server in version 1.0
      </p>
      <p>
        server -ORBEndpoint iiop://1.0@
      </p>
      <p>
        For any JAVA project however, I would first try 1.1 before trying 1.0
      </p>
      <p>
        JACORB I hear uses 1.1.  TO start your TAO server for this use
        server -ORBEndpoint iiop://1.1@
