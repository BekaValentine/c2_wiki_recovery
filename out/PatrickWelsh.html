      <p>
        I'm a founding partner with <a href="DaveAstels.html">DaveAstels</a> at <a href="AdaptionSoftware.html">AdaptionSoftware</a>, a fledgling agile software studio based in Nova Scotia, Canada. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My main focus at Adaption is on "everything else": administration, marketing, sales, yadda, yadda. I'm responsible for the company name, the logo, the website, and much of our current marketing strategy and tactics. As a programmer I am apprenticed to Dave. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Before Adaption I kicked around the software development world for 20+ years in various capacities, working as a programmer, technical writer, marketing person, user interface designer, multimedia producer, and manager. OK.
