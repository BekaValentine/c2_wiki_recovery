        Formulas Plus Attributes
      </h1>
      <p>
        I like to describe the ideal programming environment as <a href="FormulasPlusAttributes.html">FormulasPlusAttributes</a>, where attributes may also be considered meta-data. (I prefer to keep the attributes in RDBMS-like things, but if say XML floats your boat, then consider that also.) The formulas would be short and sweet but powerful. <strong>Programming should be more like math</strong> instead of lots of repetitous patterns, and where E=mc^2 creates your model then and there.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I would rather think about the formula for a day or so and then have most of the solution when I finally do write the little formula rather than start coding a bunch of statements and incrementally get to the final result. Nitty-gritty rules would still exist, but perhaps could be filled in by an intern or the customer themselves by applying the necessary attributes. I am thinking some kind of graphical interface that would allow them to see and draw relationships between sets, such as product categories. (The relationships would be kept in many-to-many tables internally.) The programmer would no longer have to type in a bunch of IF statements to achieve the same thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Query languages and logical programming sort of promised to be like this, but they seem to lack enough meta power or abstraction to overcome a lot of the repetition that should probably be factored into meta-data or attributes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I know, dreaming, but perhaps we can move a bit closer to such ideal.

        <em>Is this distinct from </em><a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>?  Your ideas somewhat parallel some of mine, which I've been implementing in a pet project to develop a LISP-like language with built-in persistence, <a href="MultiversionConcurrencyControl.html">MultiversionConcurrencyControl</a>, and set operations based on <a href="ExtendedSetTheory.html">ExtendedSetTheory</a>.  However, it's not really meant to be an end-user or even end-developer language; I intend it more as a substrate for developing <a href="QueryLanguage.html">QueryLanguage</a>s.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      <p>
        Functional generally does not deal with attribute organization and common attribute-related process factoring. Similar to OOP, it makes no attempt to standardize <a href="CollectionOrientedVerbs.html">CollectionOrientedVerbs</a>, letting each programmer re-invent their own. --top

        Functional dictates no standard "base" operators. Relational does.

        It seems what Top describes himself as wanting above is a powerful <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> language - ideally one with a powerful DBMS built right into it (or the ability to attach to one).  OTOH, his recent posts seem to indicate he's long changed his mind about this position.
