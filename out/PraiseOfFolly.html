        The library of Rotterdam recently scanned in the original latin text, as it was published in 1540 in the 'Opera Omnia' (collected works) by one of his pupils. It is available at <a href="http://www.bibliotheek.rotterdam.nl/erasmus/erasmus.html">http://www.bibliotheek.rotterdam.nl/erasmus/erasmus.html</a> Use 'Overzicht' to go to the scanned pages. The little arrows at the bottom can be used to navigate and you can click on any page to get a detailed look.

        The Latin title, "Moriae Encomium," can be translated as "A Praise of Folly" or in a more punnish vein "A Praise of More." Erasmus wrote the first version of the book while staying at More's house, and More's Utopia can be seen a kind of rebuttal to Erasmus's work.
