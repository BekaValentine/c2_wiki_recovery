        What Isa Pointer
      </h1>
      <p>
        Cutting to the chase: a "pointer" is a machine address, unless the context makes it clear that the term is being used more metaphorically. The term "reference" is often, but not always, synonymous in both senses. <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is somewhat unusual in having both "references" and "pointers" in the language with somewhat different semantics. <a href="PassByReference.html">PassByReference</a>, however, means something very specific that is not language-dependent or context-dependent.

        What is a pointer?  Everyone thinks they know; but it's a term with a lot of different meanings in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, some of them rather loaded.  Frequently, "pointer" is used as a dirty word--a low-level abstraction that no respectable code/programmer/system/language would touch with a ten-foot pole.  Many creative alternate names for pointers have been coined over the years.  For instance, early marketing literature and hype for <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> was full of silly claims like "Java has no pointers".  Hogwash.  While the object references of <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> may lack some of the nastier properties of <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>/<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> pointers (<a href="PointerArithmetic.html">PointerArithmetic</a> for instance), they're still pointers--a fact betrayed by the presence of <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> in the Java library.  :)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           SmugJavaWeenies are fond of saying that that just proves that <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> should be renamed, but in fact, Java <strong>does</strong> use pointers, whether you call them "pointers", "references", or whatever, and although it incorporates them into the language in a far safer way than C/C++.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, what <em>is</em> a pointer, exactly?  At its basest level, it's a mechanism for doing indirection; for saying "that guy over there" without having to have that guy present.  And, the pointer should provide efficient access/navigation <em>to</em> the object being referenced.  (For example; both an IP address and a MAC address can uniquely identify a network node anywhere in the world.  An IP address is a pointer of sorts; I can use it to try and connect with any computer anywhere.  On the other hand, a MAC address is not; the only way I could use a MAC address to find another computer would be to query each computer in the world (or a database containing this information) to find which computer, if any, had the matching MAC address). 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there are many varieties of pointers; each with their own features, foibles, and faults. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A pointer, depending on the context, may be:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A raw machine address into the memory space of some computer (or a logical address into some process space).  It might point to a valid object; it might be null, it might point to garbage.  See <a href="WildPointer.html">WildPointer</a>. As such such a pointer is inherently temporary, as earlier or later the machine (or process) will die and with it the meaning of the address. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An object reference or <a href="ObjectIdentifier.html">ObjectIdentifier</a>; an opaque thing that corresponds to exactly one (or possibly none, in the case of nulls) object; via which the methods and attributes of the object may be accessed.  An <a href="ObjectIdentifier.html">ObjectIdentifier</a> might be implemented as a raw address, or as some higher-level abstraction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a>.  <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s hate to hear this (the word "pointer" has an especially pejorative connotation in the relational world, it seems), but this is how the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> handles indirection.  <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a>s are certainly more well-behaved than encoding physical addresses in relational tables (and the RDBMS will, or should, reject any transaction that results in a <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a> which doesn't correspond to a matching <a href="CandidateKey.html">CandidateKey</a>--the relational equivalent to a <a href="WildPointer.html">WildPointer</a>), and <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a>s can be used for joins and the like (whereas ordinary pointers probably cannot); but the primary purpose of the <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a> is indirection.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           IpAddresses, <a href="SymbolicLink.html">SymbolicLink</a>s, <a href="UniformResourceIdentifier.html">UniformResourceIdentifier</a>s, and such are pointers of a sort.
        </li>
      </ul>
