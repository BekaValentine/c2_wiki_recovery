        Burn The Diskpacks
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> said that it is hard to change a system if
        you have to worry about backwards compatibility and
        keeping your legacy running.  Progress means leaving
        the old world behind.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, burn the diskpacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The advice was given to the smalltalk team on their completion of smalltalk-78, the first really well engineered implementation of the language. (They didn't burn em, and smalltalk evolution has stalled since then.)
