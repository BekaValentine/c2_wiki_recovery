        Listen to <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/windows_media/whos_on_first.wma">http://www.baseball-almanac.com/windows_media/whos_on_first.wma</a> ...

        When <a href="TheWho.html">TheWho</a> changed their name from the Detours back to <a href="TheWho.html">TheWho</a>, an announcer gets up on stage and tries to tell the audience like, "And the Who will be playing here again next week.."
      </p>
      <p>
        All the loyal fans yelled, "The Detours!" The announcer tried again, "No, the WHO is playing next week." Thinking it was a challenge to yell louder the audience repeats, "THE DETOURS!!"
      </p>
      <p>
        And so on...
      </p>
      <p>
        what?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No - he's on second ...</em>

        You will notice that in the audio link above the premise is to come into agreement - <a href="GettingToYes.html">GettingToYes</a> - and the obvious realization that the audience is in agreement, although the dialogue never comes to this.

        <em>I think that's analyzing it just a little too much.</em>

           Analyzing it just a little too much? He's their psychiatrist!
