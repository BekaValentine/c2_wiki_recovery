        How To React To Good Style Transgressions
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Occasionally, someone new to </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> comes along and starts editing in ways that go against the grain of Wiki conventions<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Usually, a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> will just fix the edits, and life goes on.  That's <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But sometimes, a new user objects to anonymous stylistic changes, even when those changes reflect the standards of the community.  
        </li>
        <li>
           New users aren't vandals--they just have different perspectives.  
        </li>
        <li>
           If we want to keep a consistent style within <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, we need to find a way to gently guide new users into good practices.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ---<strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s need to be extra-cautious when making stylistic changes to the edits of new users.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It might be best to put a signed note on the new user's <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> explaining the changes, and politely letting the user know that the changes aren't a personal affront.  
        </li>
        <li>
           If the user still takes umbrage, <em>drop the issue altogether</em>: it's likely that another <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> will do the same thing later, and might be able to phrase the explanation differently, in a way that the new user will understand  * Under no circumstances should stylistic differences escalate to the point where you <a href="SetTheBozoBit.html">SetTheBozoBit</a> or launch personal attacks.  It's just not worth it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ---<strong>But,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki is not static.  Over time, what is <a href="GoodStyle.html">GoodStyle</a> will change, so <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s need to be reasonable. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Consider whether the stylistic differences are disruptive enough to worry about 
        </li>
        <li>
           Even if you think that <a href="SturgeonsLaw.html">SturgeonsLaw</a> applies to new users' <a href="WikiInnovations.html">WikiInnovations</a>, that means that at least 10% of what they come up with are good ideas and are worth leaving alone
        </li>
      </ul>
