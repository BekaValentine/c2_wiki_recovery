        Sandbox Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems to me that we are getting a larger number of people visiting <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> who have a genuine interest in wiki technology, but who did not come to talk about our <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>. I've suggested to a couple of these people/groups to try to set up their own wiki software, but I realize that this can be a bit of a burden for someone who only wants to experiment with wikis or maybe just use one temporarily for a short-term purpose (e.g. ClassWork).
        I was thinking it might be beneficial for us to start a <a href="SandboxWiki.html">SandboxWiki</a> which takes the concept of the <a href="WikiWikiSandbox.html">WikiWikiSandbox</a> page one step further: The whole wiki is a sandbox (with maybe a few permanent seed pages explaining the basics).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A technical thought occurs to me; you can effect this by redefining those critical pages in the server as read only - in un*x, chmod 444. This prevents the software from changing them. ALL other pages are writable, therefore changeable. Sorry, please continue. -- </em><a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a><em></em>

      <p>
        Possible uses:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Short term projects (a few weeks at most), such as brainstorming ideas, or discussing class topics.
        </li>
        <li>
           Learning more about wiki without having to search for an 'appropriate' wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           Demonstrating wiki technology to others, such as a course on Web technologies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Possible benefits:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reducing sandbox-type traffic on C2's <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Provides a convenient and polite way to encourage experimentation while keeping our own <a href="WikiMission.html">WikiMission</a>, much like DeleteTestAndWelcome.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Possible problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Not enough experienced traffic to answer questions or make suggestions.
        </li>
        <li>
           Newcomers can get 'lost' in the disconnected wiki. This may be avoidable with <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> pointing back to C2.
        </li>
        <li>
           The place goes straight to hell because no one really maintains it. Could be somewhat averted by read-only seed pages and regular deletion (say all pages over 6 months old get deleted).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I would be willing to host a <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> for this purpose if people could help by making suggestions and discussing the issues. I don't really have an appropriate domain name for it though, so if someone else thinks it's a good idea, they might want to host it instead. <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a>.

        Oh, the other point I should mention is that I don't know a lot about <a href="WikiFarms.html">WikiFarms</a>. Would this be a better alternative than a <a href="SandboxWiki.html">SandboxWiki</a>? What would be a good farm to refer people to? -- <a href="RobHarwood.html">RobHarwood</a>

        If you create such a thing, I'd surely like to know. Until Yahoo Wiki comes along, it would be helpful for those who need a small wiki work area. -- <a href="LouisThomas.html">LouisThomas</a>
