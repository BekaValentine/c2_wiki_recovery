        <em>JBI defines a standard container in which components from multiple vendors and various integration technologies can interact.</em>

        But it is not (yet?) supported by major <a href="JavaPlatform.html">JavaPlatform</a> technologies like <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> (from <a href="IbmCorporation.html">IbmCorporation</a>) nor <a href="WebLogic.html">WebLogic</a> (from BEA).

           It is said IBM not interested in multivendor environments, and BEA wants prominence for its solution built on the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> Beehive that it promotes.

           JBI proposes to eliminate vendor specific integration solutions by defining a standards based Integration framework. The JBI API proposes to have a Standard environment where integration components from multiple vendors will reside and be offered as services to clients. These components provide specific services, which can be combined to form specific integration solutions. The services provided by the JBI are based on WSDL and web services.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The key components of the Java Business Integration framework are Service Engines (SE), Binding component (BC) and the Normalized message service (NMS).
