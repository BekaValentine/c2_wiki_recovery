        In <a href="WarStories.html">WarStories</a> it was mentioned that those who did not know or care about factoring seemed <strong>happy and care-free</strong> to just keep on with <a href="CopyAndPaste.html">CopyAndPaste</a>. I tend to be somebody who has an urge to "fix things", especially bad processes or techniques that lead to duplication and bloat. It gets kind of boring to reinvent the wheel over and over without being allowed to do something about it.
