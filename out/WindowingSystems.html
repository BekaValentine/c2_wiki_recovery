        <a href="WindowingSystems.html">WindowingSystems</a> provide abstractions for the visible parts: Screens, keyboards, pointing devices, etc.

        Only a small number of <a href="WindowingSystems.html">WindowingSystems</a> are in common usage.

        The Amiga had one of the best early ones, had a great and loyal following, but never gained enough market share.

        ApolloComputers had a nice <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a> on Unix before the <a href="XwindowProtocol.html">XwindowProtocol</a> took the stranglehold of the unix environment.

        <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a> had its own NeWS (see <a href="NetworkExtensibleWindowSystem.html">NetworkExtensibleWindowSystem</a>) before X took over.

        The <a href="XwindowSystem.html">XwindowSystem</a> includes an <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a> to control the display which uses the <a href="XwindowProtocol.html">XwindowProtocol</a> to talk to a variety of clients and <a href="WindowManager.html">WindowManager</a>s -- i.e. twm, mwm, fvwm, ...  This stack runs on top of  a variety of internet enabled <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a>, especially <a href="UnixOperatingSystem.html">UnixOperatingSystem</a> and <a href="VmsOperatingSystem.html">VmsOperatingSystem</a>.   Servers and clients exist for the Apple and Microsoft environments also.  Xorg is probably the most commonly used Xserver in use today.  X has a well defined layered architecture that sits neatly above many <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a>.

        Apple's <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> has been essentially inseparable from its type of  <a href="WindowingSystems.html">WindowingSystems</a> since the introduction of the Macintosh computer in the 1980's.  Apple's <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> windowing system (Quartz for the accelerated graphics, Aqua for the look-and-feel) descends from the <a href="WindowingSystems.html">WindowingSystems</a> of the NeXT computers (<a href="DisplayPostscript.html">DisplayPostscript</a>); now the underlying model is based on PDF.

        Microsoft has been working on Windows, its example of <a href="WindowingSystems.html">WindowingSystems</a> for several years now.  Until NT, it always seemed to be grafted on top of it's <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>, now they seem better integrated.  This is the windowing system used on most personal computers these days.

        <a href="PlanNineFromBellLabs.html">PlanNineFromBellLabs</a> had <strong></strong>EightAndaHalf 8&1/2;<strong> and now </strong>rio<strong> which use the intrinsic protocols for file access: Styx.  </strong><a href="InfernoOs.html">InfernoOs</a> uses the same protocol, but has a different windowing system -- the fact that both were created by the same hands is quite evident in their interoperability.
