        This core reference provides a one-stop, definitive resource for building robust, Web-enabled software applications for the revolutionary Microsoft .NET development platform. Windows programming authority Jeff Prosise masterfully explains this new programming paradigm as he introduces readers to the .NET Framework and to the new programming models that it embodies: Windows Forms, Web Forms, and Web services. The book includes more than 75 complete sample programs written in C#. The samples are designed to help readers resolve .NET development questions and to complement the book's carefully explained introduction to .NET programming. All the sample programs, as well as an electronic version of the book, are included on the companion CD-ROM.
