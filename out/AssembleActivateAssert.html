        Assemble Activate Assert
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Assemble-Activate-Assert":	is the pattern that all <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> cases follow, so arranging, naming, and formatting code to reflect the pattern is a good idea:
      </p>
      <p>
        All <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>s...
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <strong>Assemble</strong> the data resources they intend to use.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Activate</strong> a target method. <em>-- sometimes referred to as "</em><a href="TheMoneyLine.html">TheMoneyLine</a>"<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Assert</strong> that some side-effect, from that method, is within tolerance.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a>:  See <a href="ArrangeActAssert.html">ArrangeActAssert</a> (and consider condensing!)<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        All <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>s follow some variation of this pattern:
      </p>
      <code>
        def test_case<br/>
        a = assemble()<br/>
        q = a.activate(41)<br/>
        assert{ q == 42 }<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        All <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>s first <em>Assemble</em> the data resources they intend to use.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they <em>Activate</em> a target method. (Preferrably the one you name your real test case after!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then they <em>Assert</em> that some side-effect, from that method, is within tolerance.
      </p>

        <a href="AssembleActivateAssert.html">AssembleActivateAssert</a> seems to be used primarily in the <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> community.
        The <a href="ArrangeActAssert.html">ArrangeActAssert</a> term seems to be more popular in the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> community.

        I might say that <a href="AssembleActivateAssert.html">AssembleActivateAssert</a>/<a href="ArrangeActAssert.html">ArrangeActAssert</a> is a pattern that test cases <strong><em>should</em></strong> follow.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've certainly seen and even tests that don't follow these patterns.
        The tests might be improved by following the AAA pattern, but they did work and were automated tests, even without following the AAA pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        Specific deviations I've seen are...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Doing assertions in the "<strong>Arrange/Assemble</strong>" section of the test -- typically to assert that things have just been successfully initialized to a certain expected state needed by the code calling the <a href="ClassUnderTest.html">ClassUnderTest</a> (the "<strong>Act(ivate)</strong>" step) to be testing the intended scenario.
        </li>
        <li>
           Assertions mixed with <a href="ClassUnderTest.html">ClassUnderTest</a> calls -- mixing "<strong>Act(ivate)</strong>" and "<strong>Assert</strong>" steps.  This may be done to "tell a story" or test a full scenario:  Do step 1, with (assert) this result, followed by step 2, with this result, then step 3, with this result.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Making this three separate tests is possible, but may duplicate all the code of steps 1 and 2 in test 3, causing maintenance problems if the code in steps 1 or 2 change.  Of course test 3 could call test 2, which calls test 1.  But if test 1 fails, all three fail at that point -- which still masks potential failures in steps 2 and 3.  And heavy code reuse in tests can obscure their intent -- which is one of the most important aspects of tests.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Tests may loop over a number of scenarios, invoking the <a href="ClassUnderTest.html">ClassUnderTest</a> and doing assertions in each loop.  This may be "due to" JUnit's (<a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>'s) lack of data driven test support.  But it's a limitation we generally have to live with.
        </li>
      </ul>

        For any test case you can show me, worth the name, no matter how defactored or scripted or behaviorized it may be, I can point to its Assemble, its Activation, and its Assertion.

        It's not "should follow", it's "defines". --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
