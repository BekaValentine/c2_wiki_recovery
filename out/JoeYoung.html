        Well, here it is, the ubiquitous <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>.

        Guess if I'm going to play well with others, I want to make myself available for comment. I'm unsure if I trust the whole <em>'delete it if the spirit moves you</em> approach to wiki, but I'm intrigued. Leave questions and comments here.

           Not my real name, it refers to a "mighty" large monkey. Ok, maybe there is some resemblance. What's in a name, anyway?

        Curiously, there does not seem to be a consensus on this. I understand the nature of the <em>suggestion</em>, but prefer to retain a level a anonymity. I could post in a totally anonymous fashion (for example, the comment I am responding to), but I want to held responsible for what I say. Having a "username" seems to me to be a logical middle ground.

           Programmer extraordinaire, you name the language and I've used it or can learn it in a week. Current favorites include Java, Javascript, and VBScript.

           XML and XSLT. This is a truly fun technology. All the little bits on information I constantly refer to have managed to find their way to XML at some point.

           OOP. This goes along with Java, one of the best toys for OOP.  Currently we store data in databases and talk to them with SQL. More and more, we'll be talking to data objects. Though I believe there will still be an RDBMS on the back end, there won't need to be.

        More to come and edits planed as I worry out this curiously archaic markup.

        Wow, the <a href="AddYourName.html">AddYourName</a> mechanism is pretty cludgy for a technically oriented site. (Sorry, couldn't help myself. :) )
