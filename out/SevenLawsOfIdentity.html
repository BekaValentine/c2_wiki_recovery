        Seven Laws Of Identity
      </h1>
      <p>
        From 2005-July-23 Slashdot story: "Something strange is a brewin' at Microsoft these days. Check out this video interview with Kim Cameron, Microsoft's Architect of Identity, about Kim's Laws of Identity." From the post: "We have undertaken a project to develop a formal understanding of the dynamics causing digital identity systems to succeed or fail in various contexts, expressed as the Laws of Identity. Taken together, these laws define a unifying identity metasystem that can offer the Internet the identity layer it so obviously requires. They also provide a way for people new to the identity discussion to understand its central issues. This lets them actively join in, rather than everyone having to restart the whole discussion from scratch." <a href="http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/23/2118251">http://yro.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/07/23/2118251</a>

      <ol>
        <li>
            User Control and Consent: Digital identity systems must only reveal information identifying a user with the user's consent.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Limited Disclosure for Limited Use: The solution which discloses the least identifying information and best limits its use is the most stable, long-term solution.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            The Law of Fewest Parties: Digital identity systems must limit disclosure of identifying information to parties having a necessary and justifiable place in a given identity relationship.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Directed Identity: A universal identity metasystem must support both "omnidirectional" identifiers for use by public entities and "unidirectional" identifiers for private entities, thus facilitating discovery while preventing unnecessary release of correlation handles.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Pluralism of Operators and Technologies: A universal identity metasystem must channel and enable the interworking of multiple identity technologies run by multiple identity providers.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Human Integration: A unifying identity metasystem must define the human user as a component integrated through protected and unambiguous human-machine communications.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Consistent Experience Across Contexts: A unifying identity metasystem  must provide a simple consistent experience while enabling separation of contexts through multiple operators and technologies.
        </li>
