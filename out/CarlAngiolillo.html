        I don't know how you got here.  There aren't many links, I hope that doesn't make me a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>.  I'm just looking around a little, writing this more to myself than anyone else.

        <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a> first pointed this house out to me when we were working on building an operating system (for a class).

        I'm a big fan of the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, because it's how I learned to program, and I'm a fan of the <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> because it's how I wish I learned to program.  So as such I try to convince the folks who hire me to let me teach Scheme, or at least lisp or somesuch.

        I prefer <a href="OpenBsd.html">OpenBsd</a> to any particular <a href="LinuxDistribution.html">LinuxDistribution</a>.  Since a lot of my background is more mathy I just love wandering through all the crypto they've got.  Clever folks.  OpenBSD understands though that my flirting with <a href="BeOs.html">BeOs</a> is just a fling and I will always return.

        I haven't made substantial contributions to any pages here because I usually end up reading far more than I write.  Another few weeks and I might start fixing spelling errors.

        This house you folks have built is mighty impressive.  I've been wandering around for a little while.  I'll see something, push it onto my open tabs, browse that, finish reading, pop the tab.  So far I've been pushing a lot more than I've been popping.

        Oh, and I haven't quite gotten the hang of all of the unwritten rules around here yet.  If I have violated some taboo by creating this page, just let me know before deleting this page ? -<a href="CarlAngiolillo.html">CarlAngiolillo</a>

        How about saying "<a href="WikiMailBox.html">WikiMailBox</a>" <em>here</em>? sounds good.

          I got here via <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.  Welcome to Wiki. Feel free to ask if there is something I might be able to help you with. -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>

          <em>Thank you very much, and I will most likely have questions though not now.  You'll have to forgive if my visits are few and far between.  I'm working on a theater set design that sucks up most of my free time.</em>

          Take your time.  This can be a very hectic place in cyberspace.  Besides, I know just enough to appreciate that set design can be time consuming. I've added your name to my list of AutoPcn results so I will be notified the next time you post here. (Its easy to miss something in all of the cyber noise.) -- hwo.

        I think I'm supposed to say "<a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a>" here. <em>Yes, that's right.</em> great.  picking it up slowly.
