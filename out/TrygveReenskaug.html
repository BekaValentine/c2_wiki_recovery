        Trygve introduced <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> into
        Smalltalk while visiting
        <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a>.  He also wrote one of the articles
        in the famous <a href="SmalltalkIssueOfByte.html">SmalltalkIssueOfByte</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trygve has a book entitled
        <em>Working With Objects: The OOram Software Engineering Method</em>
        with co-authors P. Wold and O.A.Lehne.  
        He dedicates the book to <a href="DougEngelbart.html">DougEngelbart</a> ...

        ... because he made us understand that computers <br/>
        should be used to augment the human intellect rather <br/>
        than to replace it, and because his deep understanding <br/>
        of the symbiosis between humans and information is <br/>
        still far ahead of the rest of us.<br/>

        (p.s. from <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> - - - I just learned that Trygve's last name is pronounced as "rain skau" (silent 'g', rhymes with 'how').  Try pronouncing it the Norwegian way if you meet him!)  (and if he doesn't approve of it, let me know and take this message off!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Trygve has been defining and working with <a href="RoleModeling.html">RoleModeling</a> for some years now.

      <p>
        To Supplement on that as the authentic Norwegian(tm) I am it's pronounced "Treegve Renskau". Pretty close the anyway as "rain" is in Norwegian "regn" and a reindeer is a "rein" in Norwegian

        As people have said elsewhere it is not a simple read but is rife with interesting ideas.
