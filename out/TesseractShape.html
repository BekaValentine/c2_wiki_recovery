        Tesseract Shape
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Tesseract is the four-dimensional equivalent of a cube.  In other words, according to <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypercube.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Hypercube.html</a> and <a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tesseract.html,">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Tesseract.html,</a> a Tesseract is a four-dimensional hypercube (a regular cube being a three-dimensional hypercube).

        The next candidate for a <a href="TetrisGame.html">TetrisGame</a> (since BlockOut already covered the 3D cube). <em>I want to be the first on my block to own the display device for </em>that<em> game.</em>

        Good point. Tetris up to the umpteenth dimension should be quite doable, except for the display. I can think of some workarounds, though - everything beyond 2D is a workaround anyway. Meanwhile, anyone for a game of 1D tetris?

        Actually, a tesseract can be visualized on-screen. It's fairly obvious when you consider the construction technique: <em>Attach another cube to each face of a base cube, fold the attached cubes into the fourth dimension and put a cube in the space formed by the outer faces.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The tesseract can be visualized as the eight cubes and the very neat movements between them. The most interesting part is how gravity behaves.

        I've constructed a VR projection of a tesseract in <a href="AlphaWorld.html">AlphaWorld</a>. Visitors Welcome at 1176N 37E. -- <a href="MarcThibault.html">MarcThibault</a>
