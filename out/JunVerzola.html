      <p>
        <a href="JunVerzola.html">JunVerzola</a> is the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> of Pio Verzola Jr., a Filipino activist and journalist-researcher with experience in database programming and website management. He was mostly based in the Cordillera region of Northern Luzon, Philippines in the past 25 years (1984-2009), with stints in a few other places within the same period. He has worked with Northern Dispatch Weekly and Radio Sagada (in its preparatory phase). Since then, he has worked with GMA Network, a leading broadcast network in the Philippines, and IBON, an international NGO focused on capacity development for social movements.

        In 2005, Verzola started a wiki on this site for building a <a href="LanguageThesaurusScheme.html">LanguageThesaurusScheme</a> for Philippine languages. This Thesaurus was for a time hosted by <a href="http://www.philthesaurus.schtuff.com,">http://www.philthesaurus.schtuff.com,</a> now defunct. Verzola maintains a test-bed wiki site for topics on Philippine history and geography, <a href="http://wiki.iraia.net/mw.">http://wiki.iraia.net/mw.</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2012, Verzola returned to this site to re-explore its possible uses as a sandbox for his iraia.net test-bed site. (So you could say my homepage here is a test-bed for a test-bed site. I'm looking at possibilities of using this site for my explorations into philosophy, language, information, and maybe social sciences or history. Still not sure. I'll start with <a href="GeneralAndParticular.html">GeneralAndParticular</a>, and follow up with <a href="ObjectsAndProcesses.html">ObjectsAndProcesses</a>. How tenuous could I be.)

        I've added <a href="QuantityAndQuality.html">QuantityAndQuality</a> (as of March 19, 2013).

        [Note by Jun: I'll add more to this <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> as I familiarize myself with this wiki community. And, by the way, one of the things that interested me to learn wiki is its origins in <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>. I have read Christopher Alexander's <em>A Pattern Language</em> and <em>The Timeless Way of Building</em>. I think they apply to other fields of creative endeavor, not to mention life processes.]
