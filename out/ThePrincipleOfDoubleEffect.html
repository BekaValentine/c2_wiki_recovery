        The Principle Of Double Effect
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="RulesAreMadeToBeBroken.html">RulesAreMadeToBeBroken</a>, <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a> says: "It all reminds me of the moral decision making principles taught by the good Jesuits ... <a href="ThePrincipleOfDoubleEffect.html">ThePrincipleOfDoubleEffect</a> is one of the most interesting and most misunderstood."
      </p>
      <p>
        Can someone explain the rule?
      </p>

        I'm a Dominican, not a Jesuit, but as I understand it the principle states that, If an act has both good and bad (foreseeable) consequences, it is permissible when the following hold: 1) the act is not itself bad; 2) the bad consequence is not intended; 3) the bad consequence is not the means of achieving the good consequence; and 4) the good consequence sufficiently outweighs the bad consequence.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider, for example, the question of whether I should hard-code an array size.
        This might have the good consequence of simplifying my code, or maybe making it a little faster; a bad consequence is the maintenance cost. 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Hard-coding array sizes is not, in itself, bad, or else defining 3 dimensional points would be bad. 
        </li>
        <li>
           I wouldn't do it intending to increase maintenance cost.
        </li>
        <li>
           My code doesn't become simpler because of the increased maintenance cost.
        </li>
        <li>
           Is simple code worth the increased maintenance cost? Well, in the abstract, who can say? Here is where straight reason yields to prudence, and why <a href="RulesAreMadeToBeBroken.html">RulesAreMadeToBeBroken</a>.
