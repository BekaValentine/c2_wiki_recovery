        Sprint Backlog
      </h1>
      <p>
        When the <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> is ready for a feature to be developed, it is moved from the <a href="ProductBacklog.html">ProductBacklog</a> to a <a href="SprintBacklog.html">SprintBacklog</a>. So at first its estimate may be large and unwieldy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So, at the beginning of the <a href="ScrumSprint.html">ScrumSprint</a>, during <a href="SprintPlanning.html">SprintPlanning</a>, such a feature might be split into multiple, smaller items for implementation. In this way, the feature description and estimate are better defined, and sometimes new tasks/features are discovered.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, during a Sprint, if entirely new tasks are discovered, they can be added to the <a href="SprintBacklog.html">SprintBacklog</a>. It is also possible, however, that a new task <em>not</em> related to the <a href="SprintGoal.html">SprintGoal</a> is tossed back into the <a href="ProductBacklog.html">ProductBacklog</a>, to be prioritised by the <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> according to business priorities.
