        Borland Buttons
      </h1>
      <p>
        For many years, Borland's software development products didn't use "regular" Windows command buttons, they had their own version, which immediately gave away whether a Microsoft or Borland environment had been used.
      </p>
      <p>
        The buttons featured icons along with the text which animated when the button was pushed in, before being released to complete the "click".
      </p>
      <p>
        The icons were confusing at best, and an <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a> at worst:

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Cancel was fairly understandable, being a red X.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Retry featured a slot machine.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Ignore was a white sign saying 55 that flipped over (?) to show an infinity symbol... that took some working out for Brits.</dd>

        Actually, this points out a problem with icons - images carry much more cultural information than text. Frex, the configuration management tool we currently use has a row of icons across the top to allegedly facilitate use, instead of having to go to the menus. One button has a flying white bird on it - what does that mean?
