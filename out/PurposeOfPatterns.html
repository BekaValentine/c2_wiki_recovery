        Purpose Of Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's a bit arrogant to define patterns in this community, so I'd like to take a stab at defining the <em>purpose</em> of patterns instead, if we can take to mean use context.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm currently involved in a knowledge management study at my employer, Johnson Controls (<a href="http://www.jci.com).">http://www.jci.com).</a>  We've identified three major forms of knowledge delivery, and I'm inclined to name them after the three levels of competence in medieval guilds:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           knowledge is delivered by experts in the field.  Effective development includes specialized "SWAT teams" and other ways to make sure the experts see a wide range of problems.  New experts are trained by mentoring or other personal methods.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           knowledge is delivered through the application of well-defined methods by skilled workers.  In the best method definitions, there are spots that say "Call an expert" to cope with tougher problems.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           knowledge is delivered by "expert systems" used by relatively unskilled workers (or at least unskilled in the appropriate knowledge domain).  Sounds a lot like Visual Basic and Access to me.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        While patterns have been used for CASE tools as a semi-automated programming aid (a journeyman or apprentice-level aid), they have not been entirely successful.  There have been any number of complaints that using patterns as templates misses their point.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd suggest that the real purpose of patterns is that they give their users a common structure and vocabulary to discuss their work.  As used in <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book, they're not really appropriate for apprentice or (some) journeyman level programmers.  They appear to be more appropriate as a training aid to get journeymen to the master level, for example, than as a way to teach apprentices to be full journeymen.  Apprentice programmers may not have experience to appreciate the importance of patterns as recurring "motifs" in their programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dialogues on what patterns are present in a project, or how to generalize and organize them into a pattern language are most appropriate at a master level.  That may be the driving force towards increasingly selective groups for discussing and editing patterns into pattern languages -- there's no patterns newsgroup, a (relatively obscure) patterns mailing list, and much of the interesting thought occurs in small workshop settings or on limited visibility services like this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an somewhat opposing viewpoint, <a href="TomErickson.html">TomErickson</a> contends that patterns are not used at all by experienced architects, but have found common use by <em>non</em>-architects as a means of conveying their ideas to experts.  I'm not sure of any similar phenomenon in the software community.  [In my experience as a project manager for efforts involving experts for several disjoint areas, an important skill is the ability to understand the "patterns" of applying these disciplines to problems at a conceptual level, since I cannot understand all the details of my team members' work.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, this is a gross simplification, but I wonder whether this view might explain some of the confusion about pattern development and application that I've seen.  A followup question might be "What is needed to make patterns more useful for journeyman and apprentice applications?" Or "What software patterns are needed to help non-computer people define their requirements for new software?"

        Are you saying that patterns are useful only to train proficient coding? Or that they are useful only to express a model of the particular project a person is working on to another coder that understands such models and appreciates them? If the second is true, then pattern language would be a way to model the project by dividing it into a set of patterns. If in object oriented programming, this would be similar to a sentence, "Boy sits on chair". Boy being a pattern of an object, a way to describe an object that would have the same capabilities of a boy. Sit being a pattern that describes approach for adding methods to Boy. Chair being an object that receives an action, thus being also a pattern. <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In that way, a pattern language may result in a "sentence" such as, "([Network routing service] within Instance A of [Network device]) [speaks to] [communication handler] [directs] [network traffic] [received by] ([Network routing service] within Instance X of [Network device]); Where X = A|B|C|etc.". This would be similar to the way mathematical formulas are used to describe actual events.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that my example is way off, needs a lot of correcting, but my intent is to express an understanding of this topic, not an understanding of how to model network communication.
