        In Praise Of Thread Mode
      </h1>
      <p>
        Thread mode has virtues as well as vices. (see also <a href="ThreadModeConsideredHarmful.html">ThreadModeConsideredHarmful</a>)

            Signing statements allows people to take responsibility for their beliefs and statements.  Somebody who signs a posting is putting reputation at stake.  By contrast, anonymous posting is a favored tool of the flamer, not only of the <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a>.

            Signing statements helps to create a context.  When you know that the same person said, on different pages, "Software is evil" and "All technology is dehumanizing", you have a better understanding of the motives behind the first statement.

            Signing statements can lend them authority.  There are a couple of Wikists whom I have come to consider wise.  When I see an anonymous "Software is evil", it has no impact.  If I saw "<a href="SoftwareIsEvil.html">SoftwareIsEvil</a>" signed <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> (substitute your favorite Wikist), I'd have to stop and think hard about my prejudices.

            Signing statements preserves the individual character of the statement.  "I dislike working in troff" signed <a href="BetsyHanesPerry.html">BetsyHanesPerry</a> is clearly an individual foible.  An anonymous "troff is a nuisance" is a general statement, and doesn't invite dialogue, because there's no personality on the other side of the conversation.

           Signatures preserve <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>, which makes ideas that run through more than a single page comprehensible.

        In my opinion thread mode is good for brainstorming ideas between people. When the brainstorming slows after a while, then is perhaps a good time to clean it up. I was taught that when collecting ideas, don't worry about organization at that time. Organization comes <strong>after</strong> the collection phase is mostly complete and sifting and grouping starts. Don't sort your fish while you are still fishing.
