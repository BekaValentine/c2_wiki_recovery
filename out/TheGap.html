        <a href="TheGap.html">TheGap</a>. C2 has been down for several days in November 2009 and is now back. This will show up as a gap in <a href="ChangesInNovemberZeroNine.html">ChangesInNovemberZeroNine</a>. This page is there so that there is something to remember it by, and not just leave an unexplained gap in the record.
      </p>
      <p>
        And this was noticed. <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> has a page <a href="http://grault.net/adjunct/index.cgi?CeeTwoDown">http://grault.net/adjunct/index.cgi?CeeTwoDown</a> .  <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> has recently been a place of almost no activity at all, yet it was good to have somewhere to document the lack of C2.

        "Grapevine has it that it happened while Ward was doing Hardware and Software upgrades/updates.  Something went wrong, such as a sever crash.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To be frank, the Adjunct is sloooow, even without traffic. Is it running on a Timex Sinclair 1000?

          <em>Also, an ongoing annoying problem of quotation-marks showing up as %22, which seems to not concern the owner.</em>

           I'll take speed over a 22 fix anyday.

           <em>Oooh, oooh!  Is this a contest?  Right now </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is running very slooooow and it is like 1:30 AM without traffic.  I agree, slow sucks, but both need to be addressed, not simply one over the other.  My opinion, is that <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> was never intended to be a real usable Wiki, and was only intended as an excuse to delete pages from this Wiki.<em></em>

           I notice C2 wiki being sluggish also.

           12-01-2009 I am very pleased with the speed of Wiki today, the fastest that I have experienced since <a href="TheGap.html">TheGap</a>.

           [Why do you claim <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> was never intended to be a real usable Wiki?  Technical quirks aside, <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> <em>is</em> a real usable Wiki, whose intent was to provide a host for anything and everything, in particular <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> pages from <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.  The motivation was to maintain the <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> focus on <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>, with a side benefit of reducing the load on Ward's hardware and Internet connection.  Given that <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> is a <a href="SisterWiki.html">SisterWiki</a> and therefore cross-linkable to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, the user experience is roughly equivalent to a single Wiki.]

           The adjunct was never properly set up for heavy traffic flow.  It is not often maintained (fix software errors, stop spam, deleted pages actually deleted, etc.).  Certain "controversial" users were immediately chased/forced off by the owner, when the "alleged" idea was to move them away from C2.  Most pages deleted from C2 were not moved to <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a>.  A community was not actively encouraged/groomed/cultured/coaxed to grow.  Comments such as "You guys still here?" stated with genuine disbelief, etc.

           Guys guys, both wiki's are fine. No need to pit one against the other. I'm just curious why they are both currently slow. Slinging text should be easy for current computers, so the existence of a bottleneck under low traffic is a technical curiosity to me. The answer may teach us all something.
