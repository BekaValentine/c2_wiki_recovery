        Impression Of Control
      </h1>
      <p>
        Contrast with <a href="IllusionOfControl.html">IllusionOfControl</a>, which is clearly a Bad Thing -- the name specifically denotes the <em>lack</em> of control.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ImpressionOfControl.html">ImpressionOfControl</a> may or may not denote actual control, but is not a Bad Thing, nor intrinsically evil to want it; it's necessary in business and in life. And it may well be a <strong>correct</strong> impression. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that the concept of "control" has to be brought up to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ImpressionOfControl.html">ImpressionOfControl</a> is related to <a href="IllusionOfControl.html">IllusionOfControl</a> and <a href="ControlFreak.html">ControlFreak</a>, but with a slightly different connotation from either. <a href="ImpressionOfControl.html">ImpressionOfControl</a> is a combination of a mental-theoretical model and an emotional state. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="IllusionOfControl.html">IllusionOfControl</a> is based on being able to create a <a href="MasterPlan.html">MasterPlan</a> and then dropping it on the masses.  There is no (need for) information about how the plan is working or how reality is different from the plan.  The mechanical/hierarchical mindset assumes that the plan/heavy metholodolgy/etc will make the process work. <em> </em>

        I think one reason <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> might be unpopular with management is that it does not produce the kind of <a href="ImpressionOfControl.html">ImpressionOfControl</a> that heavyweight methodologies offer. This is related to the military-industrial-HenryFord-Taylorite model of corporations as hierarchical structures with cogs/drones/automatons at the leaf nodes carrying out the "actual work". For instance, waterfall methodologies give those satisfying sequential <em>chunks</em> of things getting <em>locked down</em> that we get in that moment of montage in action movies when the heroes are suiting up and raiding the arsenal preparatory to kicking badguy ass.
      </p>
      <p>
        From <a href="RollingYourOwnMethodology.html">RollingYourOwnMethodology</a>: "The <a href="WaterfallModel.html">WaterfallModel</a> is something that HenryFord invented, and was never really going to work for software anyway."

        Because XP is human-centered and demands initiative and responsibility from its practitioners, it stands in opposition to the mechanical/hierarchical mindset. However, the tight feedback loops of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing and <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> are clear examples of the best modern thinking on AI and robotics.
