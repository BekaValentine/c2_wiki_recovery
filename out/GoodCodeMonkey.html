        Good Code Monkey
      </h1>
      <p>
        A good code monkey is like a <a href="CodeMonkey.html">CodeMonkey</a>, except that the good code monkey's code tends to follow consistent standards and is of higher quality.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good code monkey cares about the program, and the fun of building it, rather than "enhancing shareholder value". Thus, a good code monkey can produce good to excellent results, but might need help seeing how program quality aligns with business goals.
