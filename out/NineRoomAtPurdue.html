        Nine Room At Purdue
      </h1>
      <p>
        The PDP-9 was an 18-bit computer with core memory,
        ttl logic, a disk drive and a single address instruction
        set.  The machine spun DecTape,
        compiled FORTRAN, and drove a calligraphic display on a
        big radar tube.

        Some EEs did projects on the machine.  A few of us managed
        keys to the room and hung out there late at night...

        The 9 room also had a cute little desk machine by Imlac.
        MazeWar and <a href="SpaceWar.html">SpaceWar</a> programs for the Imlac came from MIT.
        The idea was to use an Imlac as a front end for Purdue's
        big CDC equipment.  Bill wrote a terminal program with a
        display list handler driven by escape sequences from the 
        host.  I wrote several plot libraries and a few graphical
        applications that couldn't hold a candle to either MIT war
        game.

        I learned of the <a href="CircleOfReincarnation.html">CircleOfReincarnation</a> of display
        processors around this time.  
        We always wanted the hardware to do more.  I remember
        sneaking in one night to add vectored interrupts to the
        Imlac by populating empty sockets.
        ME had an Imlac too.  
        They told us how to do it.  In EE fooling
        with the hardware was forbidden.

        CS also had an Imlac. 
        We went over there an saw a beautiful client system they
        had put together.
        The trouble was, it tried to SimulateHumanBehavior to the mainframe.
        They said don't do it.  We didn't.
