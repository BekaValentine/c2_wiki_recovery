        To understand some of my unusual points of view, it may (or may not) help to
        know:
      </p>
      <p>
        My favourite programming language is <a href="AmigaEe.html">AmigaEe</a> (which is OOP of course), and I
        generally feel no other language (except maybe Java) comes close.  Unfortunately <a href="AmigaEe.html">AmigaEe</a> only runs
        on a nearly-dead platform (the <a href="AmigaOperatingSystem.html">AmigaOperatingSystem</a>), and hasn't been updated in
        years, so I'm now writing my own (far superior:) semi-compatible portable
        replacement - don't hold your breath though!
      </p>
      <p>
        I think <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> smells really badly and gives OOP a bad name; Java is better
        but it still has the awful syntax of C.  Things that smell about <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>:
        nearly every possible design feature was done the 'wrong' way, it has lots of
        unnecessary features that don't really improve efficiency, it's cryptic syntax
        is one step short of being obscure, everybody thinks it is great because they
        usually don't know any better, and nearly everything else! :)  Also see
        <a href="TemplatesSmell.html">TemplatesSmell</a> & <a href="LatentTypesSmell.html">LatentTypesSmell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is certainly powerful, and it was the first to implement many modern
        features in a main-stream language, but so many mistakes have been made in it's
        design (often due to trying to keep backwards-compatibility with C) that it is
        high time it was dumped in favour of something better; Java provides this,
        although I personally think that it's <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> smells (and proper
        <a href="DynamicCompilation.html">DynamicCompilation</a> should be used instead), and that it's GUI toolkit is
        ridiculously slow.
