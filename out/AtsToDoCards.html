        On ATS, I used index cards for <em>everything.</em>  (See <a href="AtsCards.html">AtsCards</a>.)  Putting "TO DO" tasks on cards is particularly handy -- I used to write things to do in my project notebook, or on post-it notes that I stuck to my monitor.  The problem with the former approach is that I would end up with a bunch of little lists scattered throughout my notebook, causing tasks to get 'lost.'  And the problem with post-its is that they would clutter up my monitor, fall off, and really get lost.  They were also hard to carry around, really hard to reorganize, and at 1x1.5, they were a little too small.

        With cards, I feel much more free.  Whenever I get an idea of something that needs to be done, I always, always write it on a card.  In the past, I didn't, because I would feel overwhelmed by the number of things I already had to do.  (This typically would occur when my monitor was chock full of little post-it notes, with several more littering the table around it.)  Now I <a href="WriteItOnaCard.html">WriteItOnaCard</a>, put it on the pile in the corner of my desk, and forget about it until my eyes chance on the pile and I remember I haven't looked at them for a while.  (Typically once a day.)  When the task is done, I rip the card in half and throw it away.  Very liberating.  :)

        My 'to do' cards all so "TO DO" in block letters above the ruled lines.  Then the body of the card says whatever it is that I need to do.

        </li>
        <li>
           Consider risks and re-estimate load factor.
