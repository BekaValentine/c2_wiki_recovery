        This article talks about potential reasons to go with a <a href="NoSql.html">NoSql</a> database. It gives more specific scenarios than usual such that there is more to analyze.
      </p>
      <p>
        There seem to be two primary arguments for sometimes going with a <a href="NoSql.html">NoSql</a> database:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The need to avoid "Join" look-ups for commonly-associated information
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The need to have "non-tabular" or semi-tabular ("low structure") data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A scenario the author gives is contact info associated with a given user. For example, a given user may have multiple cell-phone contacts, a fax number, a personal site URL, a Twitter contact, etc. This issue is discussed in <a href="ContactAndAddressModels.html">ContactAndAddressModels</a>.
      </p>

        <strong>Avoiding Joins</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that if two kinds of info is commonly associated in used in conjunction, then avoiding the JOIN process can indeed speed things up. However, that <strong>in theory</strong> should be a machine-level optimization choice, not a schema-design issue nor a query writing issue. One could tweak the RDBMS to actually store closely-related items together on disk. Thus, the "user info" table and the "contact detail" table(s) could have related records close to one another.
      </p>
      <p>
        One typically envisions one table being physically separate from another on disk, but there is nothing preventing them being "integrated". Of course, there will be trade-offs in terms of other query patterns being slower, and a more complex RDBMS to allow such such physical interweaving. (I couldn't name an RDBMS product with that ability off the top of my head, right now.) -t

        <strong>Low-Structured Data</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not convinced that contact details, such as multiple phones, fax, Twitter, <a href="FaceBook.html">FaceBook</a> accounts, etc. need a dedicated table for each "type". Something akin to <a href="DynamicRelational.html">DynamicRelational</a> would improve the flexibility of RDBMS-style tools, but still I have not seen that it would significantly help in this case. We could have a "static" table similar to:
      </p>
      <code>
        contact_details (table)<br/>
        -------------<br/>
        customer_ref    // user "ID" foreign key<br/>
        rank            // priority of contact<br/>
        contact_type    // Ex: phone, Twitter, email, URL, etc.<br/>
        contact_value   // the phone number, email address, URL, etc.<br/>
        notes<br/>
      </code>

        "SQL vs. NoSQL: Which Is Better?"
      </p>
      <p>
        As a user of both SQL and NoSQL (and a developer/user of true relational DBMSs) I find that question to be sillier than "Hammer vs. Screwdriver: Which Is Better?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <strong>both</strong> the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> <em>and</em> NoSQL, as and when appropriate, makes sense.  Use the right tool for the job.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using contact lists to illustrate "low structure" demonstrates the author's lack of understanding.  Contact lists are not "low structure" -- or at least not any lower than innumerable other scenarios for which SQL is appropriate -- and are hardly a justification for NoSQL.  However, running -- for example -- hundreds of concurrent ad-hoc text searches on multi-petabyte document collections is where NoSQL shines, and where there is (rightfully) no reasonable SQL (or <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>) equivalent.  Can you do what Apache Lucene does, as easily, in SQL?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some RDBMS have reg-ex searching. Whether they can compete with document-specific search engines on the high-end, probably not. A specific tool for a specific kind of "thing" is probably better than a general-purpose tool for the same thing.</em>
