Haven't done any mods yet, but we have written two sister unit test frameworks, VBSUnit (for testing class-based ASP code) and vfp7unit (for testing Visual Foxpro 7.0 code).  Looking forward to VBUnit3!

We'll integrate it into our automated build tools for regression testing.  Then we'll start to think about <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>ing.

Integrating it into my development process was a little tricky and required some patience, but I think I'm now hooked! I must say, it's incredible to see how many mistakes you can make. It's great when a test case you wrote 2 days ago fails through some minor tweaks in code. I imagine I'm saving quite a lot of time by having having my tests there. I've also done 2 refactoring sessions and I can now see why using this sort of testing process is fundamental to refactoring. Just a comment about how I'm not ashamed to admit I use VB: Yes, I'd wish VB was more like Java, but since I discovered that favouring aggregation over inheritance is a winner, VB seems much more freindly!

Instead, I developed my own unit testing system and I am quite happy with it. As my system only consists of some classes, it works perfectly with <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>. If I check in or share a class, I do this with the unit test also. I use a separate project file (without the unit tests) for the release of the application.

        I am not ashamed to admit it, but I am ashamed that I used it.  If not for its prominence in the market and the dictates of my clients, I would never have touched <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> beyond my initial evaluation of its unsuitability as a development language.
