        Multiton Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        A multiton is a class that limits instances to those in a single collection. Each multiton instance is associated uniquely with a key; no multiton instance can exist without a key. Furthermore, multiton instances can only be created within the method that retrieves instances. The <a href="MultitonPattern.html">MultitonPattern</a> is similar to the <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>, replacing the nullary method that gets an instance with a unary one.

        Multiton is a pattern derived from the more general Factory pattern.
