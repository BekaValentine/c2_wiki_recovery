        I have found this wiki a great resource over the last few years and would like to thank all who have taken the time to share their experience here.

        I am more interested in what makes successful teams tick than writing software these days. I am passionate about agile software development because it increases the chance of success in the face of complex problems and recognizes that teams are made-up of individuals rather than resources.

        I have worked in software development since 1987, mostly working on real-time systems in communications and robotics, using Ada, C, C++ and UML. In 2000, I was privileged to join the XP team at <a href="ConneXtra.html">ConneXtra</a> and spent a couple of years there programming doing Java based web development using <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> and <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. Also working there are the time were <a href="JohnNolan.html">JohnNolan</a>, <a href="PeterMarks.html">PeterMarks</a>, <a href="TimMackinnon.html">TimMackinnon</a>, Julian Higman, <a href="IvanMoore.html">IvanMoore</a>, Tung Mac, MatthewCooke, Paolo Polce 
      </p>
      <p>
        After that I worked for 8 years as an independent agile coach. In 2005, I spent 5 months working on a short project <a href="VirtualPairProgramming.html">VirtualPairProgramming</a> from home (using Netmeeting) which worked quite well for our team of 4 developers (<a href="JohnDaniels.html">JohnDaniels</a>, <a href="DaveCleal.html">DaveCleal</a> and <a href="DuncanPierce.html">DuncanPierce</a>) working on the SunSPOTs SDK. In 2011 I helped get <a href="IndustrialLogic.html">IndustrialLogic</a> Europe started. More recently I joined UnrulyMedia as coach of their Development and Product teams - this company is the brainchild of some ex <a href="ConneXtra.html">ConneXtra</a> people so we use XP and use many practices established there such as GoldCards.
      </p>

        I feel it is important to share success stories, lessons learned and connect with others using agile techniques. For this reason I put much of my spare time into the organization of agile community events and conferences. I have served on the board of directors for <a href="AgileAlliance.html">AgileAlliance</a> from 2003 and as conference chair for Agile2008. Agile2008 and Agile2009 have given me the opportunity to play the role of XP Customer in developing the submission system with <a href="PeterMarks.html">PeterMarks</a>.

        I've written a book about AgileCoaching (<a href="http://pragprog.com/titles/sdcoach/agile-coaching)">http://pragprog.com/titles/sdcoach/agile-coaching)</a> with co-author Liz Sedley.

        For those who want to meet others doing XP in the UK I recommend a visit to the <a href="ExtremeTuesdayClub.html">ExtremeTuesdayClub</a> and Extreme Programmers London meetup group. I went to my first <a href="ExtremeTuesdayClub.html">ExtremeTuesdayClub</a> meeting in Oct 2000 and try to get there every few months (even tho I live in Warwickshire not London).
