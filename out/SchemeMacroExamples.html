        <strong>A Scheme programmer demonstrates what can be done without  macros</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Can't you do quite a bit in Scheme without macros? I find lambda expressions to be quite enough. Consider this non-macro:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define for (lambda (start end func)<br/>
        (let loop ((index start))<br/>
        (if (> index end) #t<br/>
        (begin (func index) (loop (+ index 1))) ))))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (for 1 10 (lambda (x) (display x) (newline)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>This one is even more fun:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        (define cafor (lambda (start end func) ; conditional accumulating FOR<br/>
        (let* (<br/>
        (a-list (cons 'dummy '()))<br/>
        (a-end a-list)<br/>
        (add (lambda (x)<br/>
        (set-cdr! a-end (cons x '()))<br/>
        (set! a-end (cdr a-end))<br/>
        #t)))<br/>
        (for start end (lambda (x) (func x add)))<br/>
        (cdr a-list))))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (cafor 1 10 (lambda (x add) (if (odd? x) (add x))))<br/>
        => (1 3 5 7 9)<br/>
      </code>

        It makes me wonder what macros are good for in Scheme. Someone offers this example, a  for loop written as a macro.  What's interesting about this is that is accumulates state in a functional manner (no set!) and it binds the counter and state in the environment of the body.
      </p>
      <code>
        ;; (for-times (counter iterations) (state initial-value) . body)<br/>
        ;;<br/>
        ;; Execute body a number of times equal to iterations. counter and<br/>
        ;; state are bound locally to the current iteration and the value<br/>
        ;; returned by the previous iteration respectively.  Counter starts<br/>
        ;; at zero and increments to 1 less than iterations.  State starts<br/>
        ;; at initial-value and afterwards is the value returned by body<br/>
        (define-macro for-times<br/>
        (lambda (iterate state . body)<br/>
        (let ((iterator (first iterate))<br/>
        (iterations (second iterate))<br/>
        (name (first state))<br/>
        (value (second state)))<br/>
        `(let loop ((,iterator 0)<br/>
        (,name ,value))<br/>
        (if (< ,iterator ,iterations)<br/>
        (loop (+ ,iterator 1) (begin ,@body))<br/>
        ,name)))))<br/>
      </code>

        <strong>Some other Scheme programmers respond:</strong>
        Mostly for avoiding having to write lambda explicitly.  (Which is a good reason - ease of programming is important)
      </p>
      <p>
        Or for implementing let and let*, which can easily be macros over lambda...
      </p>
      <p>
        Or for writing your own non-strict forms, Scheme being a strict language. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Or for just tinkering with the language to please yourself.

        <strong>An example of language tinkering</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a big fan of block structure, but I detest the way  the default let family of forms results in programs that seem, to me, upside down and inside out. So I have macros that let me say things like
      </p>
      <code>
        (value-of expression with (name-1 binding-1) (name-2 binding-2))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        rather than
      </p>
      <code>
        (let ((name-1 binding-1)(name-2 binding-2)) expression)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        with-each and with-all serve me for let* and letrec.
      </p>
      <p>
        The beauty of doing this with macros is that it can be done transparently to codewalkers (that is, to program-handling programs), which simply expand the forms before traversing them.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        For the first time, I found a good reason for a macro. It's like this. Suppose the following functions exist:
      </p>
      <code>
        (make-rule <pattern> <proc>) => <rule><br/>
        (make-parser <rule> ...) => <parser><br/>
        (parse <parser> <input>) => <output><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now, <strong><proc></strong> is a procedure you create with <strong>lambda</strong>, like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        (lambda (stuff-from-parser) ...)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But <strong>make-parser</strong> is really catastrophically slow.
      </p>
      <p>
        The big question is how you make a parameterized parsing function. Like this. You can write:
      </p>
      <code>
        (make-my-proc <my-params>) => <proc><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is probably something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define make-my-proc (lambda (my-params) (lambda (stuff-from-parser) ...)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So you can also do something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define make-my-parser (lambda (my-params)<br/>
        (make-parser<br/>
        (make-rule <pattern> (make-my-proc my-params))<br/>
        <more-rules-that-never-change>)))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The problem is, the rules do not vary with the params, so <strong>make-parser</strong> is generating exactly the same parser tables every time you call it, and wasting a lot of time doing it. The only difference between the parsers is that the action procedures are bound to different variables.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now suppose <strong>make-parser</strong> were a macro which generated the parsing tables on expansion. Then it would generate the tables only <em>once,</em> no matter how many <strong>lambda</strong>s surrounded it. That would speed up <strong>make-my-parser</strong> enormously. That is a useful feature of macros.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bad thing about the macro would be that you could not write functions that made parsers whose rules varied according to the functions' parameters. Those are cases where you <em>want</em> to make the parser every time you call the function, because the generated parsers would be different. However, you can still leave the function available for those cases.
