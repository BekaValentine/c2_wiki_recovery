        Round Trip
      </h1>
      <p>
        A "round trip" is the amount of time it takes to send a message to an object and receive a response.  This time is dependent upon the speed of the channel used to send the message.  For example, sending messages over <a href="SharedMemory.html">SharedMemory</a> is very fast.  Sending messages over the Internet is relatively slow.

        By all means think of the <strong>Round Trip</strong> time, but it comes in two parts. Most people only think about the speed of the link, but most of the time it's the latency that kills you. <a href="http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/Latency.html">http://www.stuartcheshire.org/rants/Latency.html</a>
