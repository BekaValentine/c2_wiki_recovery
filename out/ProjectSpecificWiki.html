        Okay. I started a new job, and am now in the process of adapting to a totally new environment (cool place; change is still kinda stressful). 
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the things we're trying to set up is a local wiki, centered around the codebase here. This is something people have talked about before, and something that I've seen in a few places.
      </p>
      <p>
        The interesting question: what pages always pop up on project centered wikis, that don't pop up (or have completely different semantics) on a large-scale wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example: InnerLoops. It's not even a page on wiki (until someone clicks on that little question mark). But, if it were, it'd be about the general patterns, or about optimization or about ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Locally, what I'm aiming for is an actual enumeration of the inner loops and a discussion of their history.

        I'm not sure I follow, but wouldn't you then, instead of having just InnerLoops use WhatAreInnerLoops or AboutInnerLoops?
