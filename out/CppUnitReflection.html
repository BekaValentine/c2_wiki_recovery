        Cpp Unit Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>
        At my day-gig, a colleague wrote an in-house <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> that performs a little extra-linguistic magic to reflect.
      </p>
      <p>
        At test compile time, we parse the source of any file called test*.cpp, looking for lines that say "^test[_a-zA-Z]*\b". Because one would have to be sloppy to write that into a well-formatted source file without it's the start of a test function, I have never seen this system miss one or hit a false positive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence, we don't need to declare the Suite, inherit anything, add any method pointers to the Suite, or collate all Suites. The tool does this when we hit the Test Button.
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading the docs to <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>, I don't see this feature. And I do see lots of elaborate kvetching about elaborate CPP macros or editor macros. This is an OrganizationalSmell - <a href="ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate.html">ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate</a>. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        <em>The "extra-linguistic magic", which I assume is a Perl script or something similar, is an example of a </em><a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a>. /C++, unfortunately, requires a <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> be implemented outside the language. Actually, so far as I know, Java <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a>-es also need external scripts. <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>'s fairly recently added test registry is a <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> that works inside the space of objects that have been linked, but which does not span different "compilation units", aka source or object files.<em></em>

        I added this to TestCaller.h just to simplify the addition of testmethods to a suite (of course your compiler needs to have reasonable template support):
      </p>
      <code>
        template <class Fixture> <br/>
        TestCaller<Fixture> *test_newCaller(<br/>
        std::string name,<br/>
        void (Fixture::*f)()<br/>
        ) {<br/>
        return new TestCaller<Fixture>(name,f);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        #define TEST_NEWCALLER(f) test_newCaller((#f),(f))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then I can use the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        Test *fm_WhateverTest::suite() {<br/>
        <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a> *ts = new <a href="TestSuite.html">TestSuite</a>;<br/>
        ts->addTest (TEST_NEWCALLER(testIterator));<br/>
        return ts;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        I played around with <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> back six months or so ago, and wasn't wild about it.  The stuff's all there, but I felt there was too much syntax, especially for my C++ newbie team (see <a href="XpAtArinc.html">XpAtArinc</a>). Unit testing is so integral to the process, I wanted it to be absolutely painless to do, right from day one. So, I just liberated the basic concepts and implemented them my own weird way. My resulting framework makes tests via declarations like so:
      </p>
      <code>
        #include "Test.h"<br/>
        #include "BinaryFile.h"<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class cTestBinaryFile : public cTest<br/>
        {<br/>
        protected:<br/>
        void Run();<br/>
        {<br/>
        // ...Body...<br/>
        }<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        static cTestBinaryFile s_TestBinaryFile;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The static declaration adds the test to the master list. The list is used to display the entire set, so I can select one and run it, or all of them.  Downside to my current arrangement is that I'd like to have full-scale tree structure to my tests, as they are harder to select once the list gets large.
      </p>
      <p>
        I always take as full advantage as I can of the development environment. In this case (VC6), I use <a href="RunTimeTypeInformation.html">RunTimeTypeInformation</a>, the full exception mechanism, and VC6's ability to readily leave a file out of a particular build configuration. All tests are in separate .cpp files from their test-ee, and they are simply left out of the compile in the release. -- <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, no sooner did I write this down than I became convinced that I couldn't <em>live</em> without tree structure. The new format is simpler than the old:
      </p>
      <code>
        DEFINE_SUITE(Files);  // define a new test suite named Files<br/>
        DEFINE_TEST(BinaryIO,Files)  // add BinaryIO to Files<br/>
        {<br/>
        ...body of test...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is of course a use of the forbidden pre-processor. In spite of the language-lawyers best efforts to reduce pre-processing in the C++ environment, there are still things you can't do without macros. I am very happy with the result, and my testing display now shows a nice tree structure with open nodes leading to failures and successes all compressed. Of course, it still doesn't have proper fixtures. But, to be honest with you, I have never felt the need for them. I prefer to set up the test in code. -- <a href="MichaelHill.html">MichaelHill</a>

        Michael, I just started looking at <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> recently, and had the same reaction to the fixtures. I've been thinking of doing something very much like what you describe here, for all the same reasons. In fact, I don't really see why most test cases couldn't be coded as a simple function, with local variables providing anything that the fixture would. I also like some of what <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a> describes in <a href="CppUtxOverview.html">CppUtxOverview</a>, however, because I anticipate having (eventually) a very large set of unit tests in our program. I'm going to go play around with these ideas a bit now. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>
