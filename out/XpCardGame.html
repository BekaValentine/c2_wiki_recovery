        Playing Industrial Logic's XP card game at a SF <a href="BayAreaXpUsersGroup.html">BayAreaXpUsersGroup</a> meeting was a very good
        experience. It helped break the ice and it was the source of a lot of really
        good XP discussion. It's more of a conversation facilitator than a game. The
        rules are a bit tricky/different, so I'd suggest that someone tries it out at
        home first alone.

        Anyone else have any experience with this game?  How does it compare
        to the <a href="BalloonGame.html">BalloonGame</a>?
