      <p>
        <a href="EricSmith.html">EricSmith</a> now works for OTI in Raleigh. He was one of the first technical staff members at <a href="KnowledgeSystemsCorporation.html">KnowledgeSystemsCorporation</a>. He was primarily responsible for building the Harmony product for mainframe connectivity in Smalltalk/V.

        He is not any of the <a href="http://www.catsdogs.com/wwwesmith.html">http://www.catsdogs.com/wwwesmith.html</a> other Eric Smiths.

        Well he used to work for OTI in Raleigh but he now works for DukeCorporateEducation in Durham. He has left Smalltalk to the distant past and has been working with Java for 10 years or so now. He's written shamefully few articles and posted little of note for an awfully long time. So far as he is aware, he is still not one of the Eric Smiths cataloged in the enormous list, <a href="http://www.catsdogs.com/wwwesmith.html">http://www.catsdogs.com/wwwesmith.html</a> compiled by Eric Smith.
