      <p>
        I'm a one-man software engineer, working on long term contract-based software development projects with small entrepreneurs or researchers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a deep interest in finding better ways of doing my job, mostly by finding better ways of writing C++ code and managing ad-hoc/agile projects that can keep up with a continuous innovation process.  I'm currently using generic techniques and finding them vastly cleaner and more efficient than the older OO techniques.
      </p>
      <p>
        This wiki has vastly expanded my knowledge on all things, and I don't feel like I deserve my own page, but here it is anyway.
