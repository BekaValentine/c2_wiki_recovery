        Balanced Score Card
      </h1>
      <p>
        A ManagementIdea which I think is a <a href="ManagementPattern.html">ManagementPattern</a>. Developed by DavidNorton and RobertKaplan.

      <p>
        You can't manage what you can't measure, so a manager should have all the necessary information in just one card (screen or page).
      </p>
      <p>
        Information is entered into the system by workers as they work. No extra work is necessary to enter information, that would delay the information entry.
      </p>
      <p>
        Managers can see the information in <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a> by looking at the card, the BSC (<a href="BalancedScoreCard.html">BalancedScoreCard</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Key business drivers are transformed into KPI (<a href="KeyProcessIndexes.html">KeyProcessIndexes</a>) that appear as scores in the BSC.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, KPI is KeyPerformanceIndicator.
