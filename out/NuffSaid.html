        Nuff Said
      </h1>
      <p>
        A shortened and signified version of "Enough said."  A response signifying that all can appreciate a statement without need for further elaboration.

        The phrase was popularized by comic books. <a href="StanLee.html">StanLee</a> uses it frequently at the end of editorial introductions to Marvel comic book stories. Any red-blooded American boy will recognize this phrase. <em>[</em>'NOTE:<strong> </strong><a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>, Very Big Time.]<em></em>

           According to <a href="http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html,">http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_250.html,</a> "nuff said" was part of an abbreviation fad that began in Boston in 1838. See also <a href="EtymologyOfOkay.html">EtymologyOfOkay</a>.

        As a kid I used to read a load of Marvel stuff, and more recently, for nostalgia's sake I watched a thing on Sky Movies called "Stan Lee's Mutants, Monsters, and Marvels" <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0314724.">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0314724.</a> It was a feature length interview between Stan and <a href="KevinSmith.html">KevinSmith</a>, who is a film-maker and comic enthusiast.

        <em>It</em> could <em>be viewed as an </em><a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a> - except that I (who wrote the stuff above apart from the correct reference and the bit about red-blooeded Americans) come from <a href="NewcastleUponTyne.html">NewcastleUponTyne</a>, England :-) --MattStephenson<em></em>

        I think it can only be an <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a> if 'American' is assumed. In the above text 'American' is explicitly stated, so there isn't an assumption. Like "The dollar is the basic unit of currency" is an ACA but "In America, the dollar is the basic unit of currency" isn't. :P

        Can someone tell me which of the following meanings most accurately reflects usage of this phrase?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "What I've written is so obviously true that there is no need for more support."
        </li>
        <li>
           "I can't think of anything more to add."
        </li>
        <li>
           "I fear that I'm boring you now, so I'll stop."
        </li>
        <li>
           "There has been too much discussion of this subject already, without any agreement. Let's agree to disagree and move on."
        </li>
        <li>
           "I like <a href="StanLee.html">StanLee</a>." <Hoping to find someone with similar tastes>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Potentially all of them, but if you want a nearest paraphrase, I'd go with "I think I've made my point abundantly clear by now."</em>
