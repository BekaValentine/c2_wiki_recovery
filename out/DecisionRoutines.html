        Decision Routines
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes we can't decide what to do next: there are just too many choices. We get confused and paralysed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        According to JamesaDavis successful sportsmen restrict their choices. They get the smoothest responses and best decisions when they have three choices or fewer to pick from at any given moment. A decision must always be limited to three choices. This doesn't mean the problem has to be simple. Choices can be subdivided: once one of the choices happens, the next response breaks into three choices.
