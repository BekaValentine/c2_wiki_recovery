        Odd Teams
      </h1>
      <p>
        Any team I am a member of is bound to be a little odd....
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OddTeams.html">OddTeams</a> is a practice used to deal with the situation where you have an odd number of developers who are trying to pair program. The basic practice is as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Give each pair station an identifier, preferrably a number
        </li>
        <li>
           Pair up on the stations to the extent possible. I recommend letting a stronger developer take the helm as the loner to start.
        </li>
        <li>
           Set a timer for a reasonably short duration. We have found 20 minutes to be a comfortable clip.
        </li>
        <li>
           Hack away
        </li>
        <li>
           When the timer goes off, switch. Follow rules of:
          <ul>
            <li>
               drivers stay at their stations and become navigators
            </li>
            <li>
               navigators move to the next station and become drivers
            </li>
            <li>
               alternate between moving to the left and moving to the right (see below)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        For three people, two stations it looks like (parens represent a pair at a station):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (1 2) 3    
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1 (2 3)  > (2 moves right)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (3 1) 2  < (3 moves left )
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           3 (1 2)  > (1 moves right)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (2 3) 1  < ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           2 (3 1)  >
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For five people, three stations, it looks like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (1 2) (3 4) 5
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1 (2 3) (4 5)  > (2,4 move right)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (3 1) (5 2) 4  < (3,5 move left )
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           3 (1 5) (2 4)  > (1,2 move right)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           (5 3) (4 1) 2  < (5,4 move left )
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           5 (3 4) (1 2)  > ... 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It continues to scale in this manner. Notice that the outer pairs get increased focus from individuals -- i.e. one full hour of attention at a station, while the inner pairs get more pair focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           High frequency context switching, not necessarily at points-of-closure. If you are typing mid-stream when the buzzer goes off, it doesn't matter, you go ahead and switch.
        </li>
        <li>
           Violates the principle of <a href="AcceptedResponsibility.html">AcceptedResponsibility</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Other?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pros:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Time passes even more quickly [for us] than our normal "EvenTeams" pairing, possibly due to the increased time-limit focus
        </li>
        <li>
           Provides an explicit framework for dealing with O(n^2) communication issues via a hive-like collective conscious
        </li>
        <li>
           Every programmer works with every other programmer
        </li>
        <li>
           Every programmer develops on every part of the system
        </li>
        <li>
           prevents keyboard hogs and lazy navigators through team process rather than personal discipline
        </li>
      </ul>

        What we do here is, just avoid odd number of devs. <em>(Disclaimer: we're not extreme yet, still ad[ao]pting.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So if the team ends up having odd devs, we split the pairs at the stand-up meeting as usual. The person who gets to be pairless at any given time:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           does some sysadmin or dba work. We seem to be always needing some.
        </li>
        <li>
           refactors the html/zpt/css stuff.
        </li>
        <li>
           chats with customer.
        </li>
        <li>
           pairs with the coach when he/she is available.
        </li>
        <li>
           spikes stories for the next day.***
        </li>
      </ul>
