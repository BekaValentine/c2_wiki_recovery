        Unstable Backups
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> Backing up a system that keeps its state in multiple files can be a problem, and can result in a backup that restores the system to an inconsistent state.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example:</strong> Database systems that use separate files for tables and indices. If the files change between the time that the backup process archives them, the archive will be inconsistent. Source-code control systems that use multiple physical files might also be vulnerable.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong> Before you depend on their being reliable backups for a system you depend on, verify whether the system needs to be quiesced before being backed up, or has its own backup procedure. Have someone RTFM, and/or contact the vendor.
