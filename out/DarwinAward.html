        Darwin Award
      </h1>
      <p>
        Singular of <a href="DarwinAwards.html">DarwinAwards</a>, and refers to the award itself, rather than the principle or the book.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This is an interesting case for the "refactor to the singular" crowd. "<strong>Darwin Award</strong>" and "<strong>Darwin Awards</strong>" both occur naturally in writing, so one would expect to refactor to the singular, using <a href="SixSingleQuotes.html">SixSingleQuotes</a> in the plural.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah - no - because <a href="DarwinAwards.html">DarwinAwards</a> (with the "s") is the title of a book.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do we put information about the book on this page?
          <ul>
            <li>
               That means the book name and page name are out of step.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Do we refactor the singular to the plural?
          <ul>
            <li>
               That gives no natural way of using the singular in writing.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Do we keep both?
          <ul>
            <li>
               That may lead to duplication.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        The debate rumbles on ...
