        Pair Designing
      </h1>
      <p>
        Designs should be fleshed out by two or more people. Up to 5 people can be good if they all have a useful perspective on the problem space. Once the direction of the design is understood, coding can proceed without the requirement of <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, especially if <a href="TestDrivenDesign.html">TestDrivenDesign</a> is used to make sure the code works.
      </p>
      <p>
        Two people is often not enough people, as in <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, for design work. A design can hit many parts of the project and have many concerns, so a design session with all the relevant people can be much more powerful. Code isn't the only medium for design work. A group of good people working together can do amazing things. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Design in this sense isn't used to mean low level issues like method names or a detailed list of classes and relationships. These are tactical decision best left to the developer during the coding process. There's no reason a single programmer can't make good decision in these areas.

        <em>Be careful of </em>DesignByCommitte - it tends to lead to <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>, although (if properly done) - it can lead to <a href="BigReductionUpFront.html">BigReductionUpFront</a><em></em>

        It's not obvious because people continue to believe <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> is somehow caused by methodologies instead of people.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Who argues that </em><a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> comes from a methodology? <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> can easily happen to anyone planning any kind of design - it has no bearing on methodology at all. (I don't believe that the <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> problem is limited to software development)<em></em>
