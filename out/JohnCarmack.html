        John Carmack
      </h1>
      <p>
        Programmer at <a href="IdSoftware.html">IdSoftware</a>, responsible for Wolfenstein, Doom and Quakes 1, 2 and <a href="QuakeThreeArena.html">QuakeThreeArena</a>. Considered one of the best Graphics programmers alive (vying with <a href="MichaelAbrash.html">MichaelAbrash</a> for the title). Also one of the brains behind ArmadilloAerospace (<a href="http://www.armadilloaerospace.com).">http://www.armadilloaerospace.com).</a>
      </p>

        Interesting footnotes in the <a href="JohnCarmack.html">JohnCarmack</a> history is that he started Quake (and reportedly finished Doom) on <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a> operating systems.  I'd imagine that he was working on <a href="PaRisc.html">PaRisc</a> rather than the original <a href="NeXt.html">NeXt</a> hardware, since a few years ago they advertised they were giving away <a href="PaRisc.html">PaRisc</a> machines running <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a>.

        A quote from his .plan (6/27/99):
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>I got tired of thinking about it, and just started coding in some infrastructure to do extra lighting passes. I just made a gradient circle texture for the lighting, and generated the texture coordinates by just translating and scaling X and Y from the world coordinates.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>I got it running, grabbed a rocket launcher, and fired down a hallway. It looked just fine. I was stunned. I had been thinking about complex ramifications of weird edge cases for the past year when all it took was a couple hours of programming and the simplest possible approach to make it work decent. Sigh. :-)</dd>

        Sounds like a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> and <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>.  If you look at Carmack's writings, a lot of his philosophy seems very XPish.

        <em>More like </em><a href="ExtremeProgrammingForOne.html">ExtremeProgrammingForOne</a>, I'd say.  He always works alone, as I understand it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        extremely genius!
