        <em>eXtreme Programming seems to be a formalization of programming practices I started to learn while programming in Algol in 1970. </em> - We didn't do all of the things currently talked about but I'm happy to see that is has been written about so I can give others the material.  It's not unusual to be scoffed at by others who follow the more traditional software life-cycle techniques.

        I bought Beck's book over the weekend and I'll probably buy 10 more and sprinkle them around this organization.  It would have been nice to have it 30 years ago to give a little more structure and discipline to projects.
