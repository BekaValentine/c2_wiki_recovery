        Duplicates Are Bad
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's common knowledge now that <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>. Even if you don't consider this approach when designing your database schema ( be it relational , OO or whatever) it is always good to make a consistency check in the end. Look at your database through the eyes of <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>, and this will validate if you have a good schema or a bad schema. A good schema is one that enforces that the facts stored in the database are always consistent, have a clear meaning to the end user and are identifiable for the end-user.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this perspective you will always know that duplicates are bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        A duplicate row will say that you have said the same proposition twice, the same basic fact twice. You have not gained anything, the truth value hasn't changed. You have only gained the chance to introduce inconsistencies between the two statements (for example update one but forget to update the other).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a duplicate row means that you said different propositions but you said them incompletely which really makes them only one proposition. therefore you have a logical error.
      </p>
      <p>
        This happens usually when you fail to enforce primary keys, let's say the row (Ordered_Product='X', Quantity=4) and the duplicate of it. This might look OK in an OLAP scenario where you want to research the frequency with which a product is ordered, and the distribution of ordered quantities. Even for an OLAp scenario it is bad, but for transaction processing it's almost a disaster. What happened here is that you want to say that there have been two distinct orders where product 'X' was ordered in quantity of 4. You should have said two <strong>distinct</strong> propositions by including the ORDER_ID, but by eliminating the ORDER_ID you made them <em>logically</em> one proposition and you are in contradiction with <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a> principle.

        There are several aspects to <a href="DuplicatesAreBad.html">DuplicatesAreBad</a> and for some people duplicates are not that bad:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Duplicates are bad in the base table (also called stored facts)
        </li>
        <li>
          Duplicates are bad in intermediary results (results that are not displayed to the final user)
        </li>
        <li>
          Duplicates are bad when displayed to the final user -- this the least grievous of the three aspects and many developers are OK with it.
        </li>
      </ul>

        If I select the first names of employees in my department, the result set may contain duplicates.
        This would be a correct result if <a href="JeffDillon.html">JeffDillon</a>, <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a> and JeffHunt all work in my department.
        It may not be a terribly useful result for processing, because it does not include the primary keys, but it is a correct result. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Jeff, you can use GROUP BY and COUNT(*) so that the result will include the tuple (Jeff,3) which means that the first name Jeff belongs to 3 different persons in the department. A "bag" containing {Jeff,Jeff,Jeff} can mean a dozen very different things. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Consider for example that you might be the only one with first name Jeff and you have a working relation with 3 clients from partner company X. Now a program queries what are the first names of employees that deal with people from company X, but the sloppy programmer forgets to use SELECT DISTINCT. Then you get as the final result the same "bag" as before {Jeff,Jeff,Jeff}, what does it mean now ?</em> -Costin

        <dd>It means there are three relationships involving one or more people whose name is Jeff. Consider another example where there is more than one Jeff, and your SELECT DISTINCT as above comes back with {Jeff} ... now what does that mean?</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>Remember the question being asked was what are the names of the employees. It could have been as easily what are the emails of people who match something, and for each email send them a notification letter. And this would be a disaster. In case you generate a list for the end user, the user might realize that this was a bad program that didn't remove duplicates, and he might realize what duplicates mean from the context of the report. That means you shifted complexity to the shoulders of end user. See </em><a href="AlwaysUseSelectDistinct.html">AlwaysUseSelectDistinct</a> for this discussion.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now when SELECT DISTINCT removes duplicates it means projection, it responds to the question what are the </em>'distinct<em>' values of particular attributes in that relation. If you want to have quantitative information related to each value you use SELECT <attribute_list>, COUNT(*) FROM relation GROUP BY <attribute_list>. Even better, if you want to remove the influence of other joins in the quantification of an attribute value, you can use COUNT ( DISTINCT primary_key ) instead of COUNT(*), so it will disregard duplicates generated by join and it will count the occurrences of a value in the original table. </em> --<a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        Bags unlike relation as sets cannot be the basis for <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>, and there is absolutely no notion of correctness that can be tested against bags. The problem is not to justify on a case by case basis that duplicates are OK, but to have a consistent unique model that applies everywhere, having the same semantics, and consequently allowing you to enjoy all the goodies of a declarative programming style. Using duplicates you cannot build a consistent model that applies everywhere, because duplicates mean different things in different contexts like in the example above. And that is only one little part of the problem.
