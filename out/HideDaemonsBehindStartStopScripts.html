        Hide Daemons Behind Start Stop Scripts
      </h1>
      <p>
        As noted in <a href="UnixShellPatterns.html">UnixShellPatterns</a> daemons need to be isolated from their terminals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        One problem with daemons is stopping them.  Another is avoiding running two
        of them at one time.   You also need to be able to stop and restart a daemon
        without thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
        A simple solution is
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Make the daemon <strong>generate its own stop script</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Write a <strong>start</strong> script
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        You can use the data in the stop script to test whether the daemon is still running. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
        I run a simple Mailing list for  students in some of my classes.  For
        historical reasons it is called 'bbs'.  Once upon a time
        The crontab was a bit disfunctional on the system so I used a daemon was called
      </p>
      <code>
        bbs.daemon<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I would leave it running, sorting my Email, and redistributing it to
        other people in the class:
      </p>
      <code>
        : script of daemon that sorts bbs messages<br/>
        echo kill -9 $$ > /u/faculty/dick/bin/stop.bbs<br/>
        while sleep 30<br/>
        do<br/>
        /u/faculty/dick/bin/post.bbs<br/>
        done<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When I run start.bbs the script checks to see if the
        daemon is already running, and if not spawns the
        deamon:
      </p>
      <code>
        : script to start an agent that proceses personal and BBS mail<br/>
        cd $HOME<br/>
        default=180<br/>
        if /u/faculty/dick/bin/psg bbs|egrep bbs.daemon<br/>
        then<br/>
        echo is already running<br/>
        /u/faculty/dick/bin/psg bbs|egrep bbs.daemon|awk '{print $2}'|<br/>
        sed 's/^/kill -9 /' > /u/faculty/dick/bin/stop.bbs<br/>
        exit 1<br/>
        fi<br/>
        pwd<br/>
        echo Starting Bulletin Board with delay ${1:-$default} seconds....<br/>
        cat /dev/null >nohup.out<br/>
        nohup nice bbs.daemon ${1:-$default} &<br/>
        sleep 1; echo                                                                        <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (psg is another script that does a PS and a Grep).

        any comments?

        I've seen a somewhat different approach (Linux's gpm mouse daemon), where the program is written so that it check for an instance of itself running, and if found, exits, unless invoked with a specific argument (-k), where if there is another running copy, kills that copy before exiting. --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>
