        The <a href="HomeFactory.html">HomeFactory</a> is a factory where products would be manufactured, i.e. assembled, boxed and shipped from a small dedicated space in the home of a worker.  It could include small assemblies, craftworks, programs produced and prepared on CdRoms and FlashDrives, and many other possible products. It would be one of the answers to <a href="CarAddiction.html">CarAddiction</a> and a complement to the <a href="HomeOffice.html">HomeOffice</a>, and the <a href="HomeStore.html">HomeStore</a>.
