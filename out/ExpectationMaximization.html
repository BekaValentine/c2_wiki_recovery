        Expectation Maximization
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm is a fast
        maximum likelihood parameter estimation algorithm for partially observed data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that
        D is some observed data, U is some unobserved data,
        and T is a parameterisation for a joint probabilistic model for (D,U).
        The goal is to choose T so as to maximize P(D|T)=sum(U) P(D,U|T).
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting from an initial guess at T, 
        EM obtains the next estimate, T', via a two-step procedure:
      </p>
      <p>
        (1: "The E-step") Estimate the posterior probability distribution, P(U|D,T),
        for the missing data given the current parameterisation.
      </p>
      <p>
        (2: "The M-step") Maximize the following functional with respect to T'
      </p>
      <p>
        Q(T'|D,T) = sum(U) P(U|D,T) log P(D,U|T')
      </p>
      <p>
        (That is, maximize the expected log-likelihood of the observed and unobserved data,
        using the posterior distribution over U computed during the E-step.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Often the E-step reduces to the computation of certain expectation statistics
        that characterise the unobserved data sufficiently to proceed with the M-step.
      </p>
      <p>
        The K-means clustering algorithm can be viewed as an EM algorithm applied
        to a mixture-of-Gaussians model.
      </p>
      <p>
        The EM algorithm can also be viewed as a two-step optimization of
        a single variational functional (see e.g. work of Radford Neal).
