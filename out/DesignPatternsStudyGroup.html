        Design Patterns Study Group
      </h1>
      <p>
        A group of people who get together and discuss patterns on a regular basis. Usually the group starts out reading <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> and then goes on to papers by people like <a href="WardAndKent.html">WardAndKent</a>.  See also, <a href="CategoryPatternsGroup.html">CategoryPatternsGroup</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've finished the GoF book try the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a> for other patterns to study.
        See also <a href="CategoryPattern.html">CategoryPattern</a>.

        See the <a href="DesignPatternsStudyGuide.html">DesignPatternsStudyGuide</a> for a really useful suggested sequence of study for the patterns in the <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> book.

        Last update to this page (before this one) was in May, 1999. It is probable that this group is no longer active. What became of it?
