        <strong>History</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Borland was founded by <a href="PhilippeKahn.html">PhilippeKahn</a> on a shoestring and got its initial growth selling <a href="TurboPascal.html">TurboPascal</a> for CP/M and MS-DOS computers (late 1983).  This product was innovative in price (low) and the inclusion of an <a href="IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment.html">IntegratedDevelopmentEnvironment</a> (IDE).
      </p>
      <p>
        During the nineties, <a href="BorlandCorp.html">BorlandCorp</a> has been viewed as a fierce competitor (technically) of <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>. But <a href="MicrosoftWay.html">MicrosoftWay</a> prevails, as evidenced by the conversion of the architect of <a href="BorlandDelphi.html">BorlandDelphi</a> (<a href="AndersHejlsberg.html">AndersHejlsberg</a>) to MS, and subsequently producing the <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> for <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The firms refocus of its technology on the <a href="JavaPlatform.html">JavaPlatform</a> has not been successful, as it had to compete with early starters, and bigger players like <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a>.
