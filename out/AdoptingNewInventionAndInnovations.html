        New inventions and innovations are being daily exposed in the great thing we call the internet. Some are nifty, others are adopted and quickly discarded. What must one consider in adopting a new innovation in their own personal or professional life? Changing for the sake of change is not always a good idea. <a href="AskingQuestions.html">AskingQuestions</a> like <em></em><a href="ShouldIbeginToUseThis.html">ShouldIbeginToUseThis</a>?<em> will lead to answers which raise a number of issues and concerns.</em>

           <em>"Continuous invention and innovation are at the core of systematized research. They involve coming up with streams of new inventions and innovations over a limited period of time. Turning out those new discoveries has to occur in a fairly continuous or systematic way, to meet the many challenges faced by organizations. Successive experimentation is therefore part of continuous invention. For the kinds of organizations typical of technocapitalism, continuous invention and innovation are vital necessities."</em>
