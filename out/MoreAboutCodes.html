        We created the code words to discourage robotic attacks. Both the code words and the code word mechanism are subject to sudden change. Our code word policy is to not have a policy. Should the site become subject to systematic abuse, the code word mechanisms will become more stringent. Announcements appear on <a href="WikiWikiSystemNotice.html">WikiWikiSystemNotice</a>.

        When a code word is presented, you may use it to save edits. This serves the role of a very simple <a href="CaptchaTest.html">CaptchaTest</a> which probably only works because the rewards for breaking it are so small. There is a <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> plug-in that will type the code word for you.
        When no code word is given, you may use an alternative code word that floats along among trusted users. There is no way to apply for this code. Try your friends-of-friends network. Remember that this code and the mechanism itself will change if abused.

        If the reader is confused about the code words, here is a little story.  One day the mechanism presented me with its random number which by chance coincided with a numeric user ID I sometimes use on websites.  It must have been soon after I first encountered the code words.  I read the request as <em>Type the code word, </em>'<my user ID number><em>' here</em>.  I then got the totally wrong end of the stick about what the code word might be;  I had no idea I simply had to repeat the number.

      <p>
        I found that confusing at the time, but perhaps not very harmful;  i figured out what was happening after 5-10 minutes.  --<a href="DavidVincent.html">DavidVincent</a>

        Here is a <a href="GreaseMonkey.html">GreaseMonkey</a> user script (browser plug-in) that automatically types the code word for you: <a href="http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/485696.">http://userscripts.org/scripts/show/485696.</a> I couldn’t find the Firefox plug-in that types the code word for you that Ward mentioned above, so I created one. Since it’s a <a href="GreaseMonkey.html">GreaseMonkey</a> plugin, it is supported by Firefox, Chrome, and Safari, but you need to install another plugin first (e.g. <a href="GreaseMonkey.html">GreaseMonkey</a> for Firefox). It is the user script titled “C2 Wiki – Fill In Code Word When Editing” on userscripts.org. – RoryOkane
