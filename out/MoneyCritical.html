        Money Critical

        Something that only costs money if it fails (rather than actually killing people) is <a href="MoneyCritical.html">MoneyCritical</a>.  Most software is <a href="MoneyCritical.html">MoneyCritical</a>.  <a href="MoneyCritical.html">MoneyCritical</a> physical objects include battery-operated devices, inert objects, etc.  But even a bicycle is <a href="LifeCritical.html">LifeCritical</a>: bad brakes can ruin your whole day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Something that is <a href="MoneyCritical.html">MoneyCritical</a> is often subject to much lower defect rate standards than something that is <a href="LifeCritical.html">LifeCritical</a>.  Thus it can be made cheaper, or time and money can be spent making the <a href="MoneyCritical.html">MoneyCritical</a> thing more functional.
