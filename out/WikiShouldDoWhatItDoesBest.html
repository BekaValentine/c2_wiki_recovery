        Wiki Should Do What It Does Best
      </h1>
      <p>
        Two Wiki maxims for consideration:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Let every Wiki page shine.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        If we cannot make a page that is truly exceptional, we should ask ourselves: what is it doing here? There is already too much mediocre chit-chat, do we need to contribute to it?
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Respect the knowledge of other places.</dd>
      </dl>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Delete pages that are not exceptional</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If we cannot create a page that is exceptional, perhaps we should simply delete it. If there is a topic that is not covered here, that should not be taken as an admission of ignorance, but an implicit respect for the expertise of others.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Discovery should be possible with aimless stumbling</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki should do what it does best. You should be able to stumble around aimlessly, using (say) <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a>, and have an extremely high signal-to-noise ratio.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki should only be a dictionary for items where this community has exceptional interest & expertise. We can be proud of our pages on <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s; the old page on GangstaRap, on the other hand, was an embarrassment.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Discussion Structured by Wiki Gnomes</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki depends on the work of <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s to keep discussions structured, which is part of the reason the <a href="SociologyWiki.html">SociologyWiki</a> pages are a failure: no gnome will touch those pages.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Debating and Deleting</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        What it boils down to is this: Every time there's a debate about whether a topic is <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> or <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, we should ask ourselves "Can we do the topic justice?" If so, perhaps it should stay. If not, perhaps it should go.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Wiki At Its Best</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        All of the above arguments reinforce Ward's preference <a href="InFavorOfDissertation.html">InFavorOfDissertation</a>. So those who also feel that way, start contributing instead of spending your valuable keystrokes in discovering, discussion, disagreement, debate and deleting.  In other words: Make Some New Pages and be sure they are Pages That Shine: <a href="ReallyValuablePages.html">ReallyValuablePages</a>.
