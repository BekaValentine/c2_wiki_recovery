        Experience in: 
        Java
        Javascript/CSS/HTML 
        C89 (vendor lock-in fun!) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages I'm considering: 
        Haskell
        Common Lisp (Any version that's really consistent and easy to set up across OSes would be nice)
        Python
      </p>
      <p>
        Number of Linux Laptops that have died on me so far:

        Dylan
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been getting more into programming as a hobby, lately. There was a 2 year break from the time I learned Java in high school to when I taught myself C and Fortran where I did no coding at all. I have to make up for lost time.
