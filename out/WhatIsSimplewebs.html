        What Is Simplewebs
      </h1>
      <p>
        I did a <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=DateAndDarwen">http://www.google.com/search?q=DateAndDarwen</a> to find my refactorings of <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>. I was surprised to find two things in the first page of results:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           c2.com did not appear in the result
        </li>
        <li>
           a site called <a href="http://simplewebs.com/c2/?DateAndDarwen">http://simplewebs.com/c2/?DateAndDarwen</a> 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        There was also a hit on my wiki which was not unexpected: <a href="http://mahi.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/ChrisGarrod?DateAndDarwen">http://mahi.ucsd.edu/cgi-bin/ChrisGarrod?DateAndDarwen</a> I kept some notes on my refactoring there.
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked into the simplewebs site, and found the information I expected to find on c2.com. On c2.com, I was modifying my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>, and after saving it, I asked simplewebs for <a href="http://simplewebs.com/c2/?ChrisGarrod">http://simplewebs.com/c2/?ChrisGarrod</a> and it found my new page. I then asked for <a href="http://simplewebs.com/c2/?RecentChanges">http://simplewebs.com/c2/?RecentChanges</a> and found that it was dated 20070423 - about a week old.
      </p>
      <p>
        My question is: Why is simplewebs doing this, and do we on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> care? When I click on one of their <a href="EditPage.html">EditPage</a> buttons, I get an url like: <a href="http://simplewebs.com/c2/?edit=RecentChanges">http://simplewebs.com/c2/?edit=RecentChanges</a> that doesn't mention the <a href="CodeWord.html">CodeWord</a> at all, so I presume their changes stay there. Are they trying to hijack our content?
      </p>
      <p>
        And lastly, why didn't Google find the pages on c2.com with <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="ChrisGarrod.html">ChrisGarrod</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh and also, these came up as hits too, and I didn't trust the web to visit them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://youbypass.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2MyLmNvbS9jZ2kvd2lraU5hbWVz">http://youbypass.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2MyLmNvbS9jZ2kvd2lraU5hbWVz</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.proxzee.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2MyLmNvbS9jZ2kvd2FudGVkV2lraVBhZ2Vz">http://www.proxzee.com/index.php?q=aHR0cDovL2MyLmNvbS9jZ2kvd2FudGVkV2lraVBhZ2Vz</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The above URLs had our <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s in them but the content was more of a listing as in a harvest. Who knows anything about those? The cryptic portion of the URLs are so similar.

        I just came upon the simplewebs site. <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> is up-to-date, as is <a href="RubyOnRailsRulesTheUniverse.html">RubyOnRailsRulesTheUniverse</a>. I edited <a href="RubyOnRailsRulesTheUniverse.html">RubyOnRailsRulesTheUniverse</a> from simplewebs, and the edit took. No <a href="CodeWord.html">CodeWord</a> needed. The <a href="RubyOnRailsRulesTheUniverse.html">RubyOnRailsRulesTheUniverse</a> changes show up on the usual c2 site. Who the heck hosts simplewebs? -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>

        BTW, the trick to seeing the simplewebs pages is to turn off <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. With JS on, simplewebs just redirects to the usual c2 page (or sometimes twirls & blinks in confusion). For example, try visiting <a href="http://simplewebs.com/c2/?DateAndDarwen">http://simplewebs.com/c2/?DateAndDarwen</a> or <a href="http://simplewebs.com/?DateAndDarwen">http://simplewebs.com/?DateAndDarwen</a> with <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> turned on, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> turned off. Once there (with JS off), you can look at the page source. You'll see that the page contains loads of other <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> stuff amidst weird, invalid HTML.
      </p>

        Simplewebs could be a proxy hack: <a href="http://www.seofaststart.com/blog/google-proxy-hacking.">http://www.seofaststart.com/blog/google-proxy-hacking.</a> Even if it's not, failing to prevent proxy hacking could explain why <a href="GoogleHatesWiki.html">GoogleHatesWiki</a> sometimes.

        <em>I wonder if simplewebs wasn't a Ward-sanctioned effort to develop a </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> successor - with full integration to the "old" <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> to ease migration - that never made it to production.

        Firefox 2 on <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>. Yes, Simplewebs might be Ward-sanctioned. On the other hand, <a href="JeremyBackus.html">JeremyBackus</a>'s page lists a couple links (snap.com and nichebot.com) which give me the royal creeps, and I'm engaging in guilt by association. In either case, duplicate content can get <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> (or Simplewebs) dropped ever since Google started incorporating dupe detection in its indexing algo. -- Eliz

        I noticed something interesting looking at simplewebs.com/?<a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>. The first sentence reads as follows: "Note: As of 01Desimplewebs006, [...]". That looked odd to me, so I checked Dave's page on the real c2 wiki, and the first sentence is actually "Note: As of 01Dec2006, [...]". They ran a (much too simple) search-and-replace, changing "c2" to "simplewebs". My money is on this not being Ward-sanctioned in any way. -- <a href="MichaelSparks.html">MichaelSparks</a>

        <em>Though, on second thought (somewhat later), it might be an innocuous mechanism - the device to transform URLs like </em><a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AccountingModeling">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?AccountingModeling</a> to <a href="http://simplewebs.com/?AccountingModeling">http://simplewebs.com/?AccountingModeling</a> might be nothing but a crude global text replacement, built on the mistaken assumption that 'c2' would never appear in normal discussion except in URLs. Or, the mechanism might not have been completed. Maybe. I've emailed Jeremy Backus about this, so we'll see what he says, if anything.<em> -- DV</em>
