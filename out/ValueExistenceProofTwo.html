        Re: "contradicts typical understanding of dynamically-typed languages" -- So you claim. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's true. Why are <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages sometimes described as "value typed"?}
      </p>
      <p>
        I've rarely heard that term. There are a lot of pet terms related to types and values floating around out there. It's a poorly policed vocabulary district. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        {No one "polices" vocabulary; it is organic.  If usage appears, like "value typed", it's probably a reflection of typical understanding.}
      </p>
      <p>
        By that measure, if it's uncommon, then it reflects uncommon understanding. You fell on your own sword here.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Not at all.  I offer "value typed" only as an additional point of evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have not associated it with high frequency of usage. (See <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> Ratio_01.) If it's low frequency, then it's not of concern to typical developers. I've also given point evidence, such as it being used interchangeably with "literal".
      </p>
      <p>
        {I never claimed "high frequency", nor would I.  How high is "high"?  How low is "low"?  I'm fully aware that "value" is used as a synonym for "literal", but as I've explained elsewhere, that's entirely reasonable if not entirely precise.  Literals always denote values.}
      </p>
      <p>
        In the head.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Yes, and in programming language semantics and the interpreters and compilers that implement them.}
      </p>
      <p>
        But it's not necessarily one-to-one. Bob can turn his head model A into implementation X. Fred can study X, and create an ALTERNATIVE head model B that mirrors implementation X. Both A and B can model the behavior (I/O) of device X.
      </p>
      <p>
        {I've no doubt different semantics are possible for the same syntax, but how do you know models A and B are correct?  For example, "a = foo() + 4" can mean "invoke function foo and add its return value to four, and store the result in variable 'a'", but it can also mean "store the expression 'foo() + 4' in variable 'a'".  Will they both produce the same results if we assume writeln(p) always evaluates any expression it is passed, including an expression stored in variable p?}
      </p>
      <p>
        Experience and testing. And in many cases people's head models are probably less than 100% perfect.
      </p>
      <p>
        {"Experience and testing" are far less reliable than logical deduction.}
      </p>
      <p>
        We've had this argument already in <a href="ValueExistenceProof.html">ValueExistenceProof</a>; I'm not going to repeat it here.

        {Fair enough.  We'll deal with it there.}

        {Why do <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages lack type declarations on variables?}
      </p>
      <p>
        Because if a literal contains type info, then it's usually redundant. Dynamic languages tend to value brevity compared to static ones, which value explicitness.
      </p>
      <p>
        {I assume you mean "variable", instead of "literal"?  There was no mention of literals.  <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages lack type declarations on variables because <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages can be assigned any value of any type at any time.  Therefore, there is no explicit need to associate a manifest type with a variable.  As it turns out, there's no need to associate a type with a variable -- in a <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> language -- at all.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm mirroring existing languages as they are, and their behavior usually does reflect a "type indicator" of some kind. I agree the indicator is a dumb design (except possibly for efficiency), but it's the current style for good or bad. Example of effects in a <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>-like language:
      </p>
      <code>
        a = 3; write(typeName(a)); write(a + a); // result: Number 6<br/>
        b = "3"; write(typeName(b)); write(b + b); // result: String 33<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here above, "b" has something extra or different than "a".
      </p>
      <p>
        {Actually, no.  Scalar variables in popular <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages are undifferentiated.  Variable "a" differs from variable "b" only by the values they contain.  More accurately, it's the 3 has "something extra or different than" "3".  In <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> languages, values have type references.  In Category D1 languages (see <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>) the type references are explicit.}
      </p>
      <p>
        {When a variable is passed as an argument to an operator invocation, the operator only "sees" the value in the variable, not the variable itself.  Outside of assignment, whenever a variable name is used, the interpreter retrieves the value the variable contains.  The value is then passed to the appropriate operator as an argument.  It's the same process whether typeName()'s argument is a variable, a literal, or a function call.  In every case, the interpreter simply evaluates the expression to obtain a value; it doesn't matter whether the expression consists of a variable, a literal, a function call, or a combination of these.  Otherwise, there'd have to be one typeName() implementation for variables, one typeName() implementation for literals, one typeName() implementation for function calls, and one typeName() implementation for expressions consisting of a combination of operators, literals, and variable references.  Obviously, that would be unreasonable, and it's unnecessary.}

           Redundancy in models is a different issue. This is a definition question, not a quality question.

      <ul>
        <li>
           {I thought this was a modelling question -- about getting the parts of the model right -- rather than a definition question.  The definition of "variable" has nothing to do with how a variable is modelled.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How are you defining "right"? I define it as matching I/O, as already stated. Design issues such as simplicity, redundancy, grokkability, etc. are a different issue(s). Perhaps I misunderstood the original question above. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {By "right", I mean "accurately models the real world".  As I've mentioned elsewhere, I'm not sure what "matching I/O" means.  Output and user input can be anything, and an infinite number of programs can take the same user input and produce the same output, so I'm not sure that's meaningful.  If you treat program source code as input, then you must mean the program semantics are meaningful, because an infinite number of semantically-invalid programs won't even run, let alone generate output.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Data-Input + Source-Code -> Process -> Output. ANY "Process" that can transform the first two into Output that matches the target language (interpreter) for the same two inputs is considered "correct" in my book. And please, not the "real world" debate again.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {The problem is the above can admit an infinite number of programs that generate the same Output given different Source-Code.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, I consider source code as "input". See the "+"? Perhaps I am misinterpreting your scope. It's true that for any given INSTANCE of output there are infinite number of programs that could generate it, but not the same "Process" for ALL possible given input sets (data and source code).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Sorry, I'm not following you.  The same problem appears to hold true.  Your model, as described here, would appear to treat "write(3); write(4)" and "a='3'; b='4'; write(a + b)" as the same.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No no no. The data input AND the source code have to match the "actual" language interpreter's result. It's an "and", not an "or". Maybe this will clarify the expected relationship between the model and the actual language (interpreter).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        // Example loopy-72 -- Comparing I/O profiles<br/>
        for d = each possible data input file/stream<br/>
        for s = each possible source code input file<br/>
        x1 = outputFromRun(modelFoo(d, s))  // the target test model<br/>
        x2 = outputFromRun(actualLanguage(d, s))<br/>
        if (x1 != x2) then <br/>
        write("Model Foo failed to match I/O profile of actual language.")<br/>
        stop<br/>
        end if<br/>
        end for s<br/>
        end for d<br/>
        write("The I/O Profile of model Foo matches actual language.")<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In this comparison system, it doesn't matter whether the model uses pigtails and rubber bands, as long as it matches the actual language results given the same two kinds of inputs. I'll consider ANY model (such as modelFoo above) "correct" if it doesn't ever generate the "failed" message above for all loop iterations. (A passing model may not be well-suited for <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> studies, but that's the second stage. Also, it's not possible to actually test all combinations (a full looping), so spot sampling of some kind would be used in practice.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Given that the above is testing to see whether or not modelFoo() == actualLanguage(), aren't you really saying your "model" isn't a model at all -- it has to be a full compiler or interpreter of the language recognised by actualLanguage()?  Otherwise, modelFoo() cannot possibly be equal to actualLanguage().}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If it was fully implemented. As described, it makes the "user" do most of the parsing etc., and it can be tested with them doing their part. For our purposes, though, testing would be on type-related snippets, not full applications, because that's not what we are interested in here. I don't see that your model is complete either.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I see.  The problem with this is that the sets "each possible data input file/stream" and "each possible source code input file" are infinite.  How, in an automated fashion, can you assume that the next iteration of d and s won't result in "Model Foo failed to match"?  Essentially, you've described a brute-force, exhaustive-search proof of your model.  The only way to demonstrate your model is valid, then, is to demonstrate it works with "<strong>every</strong> possible data input file/stream" and "<strong>every</strong> possible source code input file".  That's not unreasonable for finite enumerable sets, and sometimes it is used as a successful approach -- a few years ago, a similar approach was used to prove a result in game theory using checkers, which required iterating over every possible checkers game -- but I think you'll need an infinite amount of time to demonstrate that your model works for infinite sets.}

        <li>
           Like I said, we don't need to test every possibility in practice, only representative samples of issues we are interested in. Plus, an alternative for empirical testing of models has not been found.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And the only way to know it's isomorphic with anything is empirical testing. (Dissecting the interpreter source code in theory may be sufficient, but not in practice.)

      </ul>
      <ul>

           That's just the nature of science: new observations may come along that invalidate existing models, requiring changing or tuning of models. Science is probably never "done" because we cannot make every possible observation, unless perhaps God comes out of the closet.

           Like I keep saying, colloquial usage is overloaded such that compromises likely will be needed when building something more rigorous. You also have awkward usage such as "representation". Glass houses. My trade-off choices were not made capriciously, but balanced against each other to minimize the evil. If you want to attack my decisions, you have to focus on the entire stack of features tied to such tradeoffs. It won't do any good to keep repeatedly pointing out that X is awkward without considering how it may make Y and Z awkward if they are tied to how X is done (<a href="WaterbedTheory.html">WaterbedTheory</a> in terms of both complexity and confusion). You dwell on one note on the piano, ignoring the rest of the keyboard. That's really an annoying aspect of your (plural) debate style. Engineering and design is all about balancing trade-offs; there is <strong>no known magic/free lunch that optimizes everything at the same time</strong>. You guys keep trying to find or enforce a One True Way master canonical model. It's probably a lost cause, but stubborn personalities don't give up easily. (And I know you disagree with my assessment of the <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> of the target audience such that there's no need to repeat that issue again either.)

           I've explained the logic many many times. In summary, it avoids the awkward and vague term "representation", and simplifies (shortens and de-nests) the data structure used <strong>most often</strong> by the model users. It's rational to uglify less-often used parts of the model <strong>in order to</strong> clean up or simplify the most commonly used parts. I know you disagree with those tradeoffs; there's no need to keep saying that over and over again repeatedly redundantly multiple times repeatedly. If you don't have any <strong>NEW arguments</strong> on that, then shut the goddam hell up! I don't know why you keep forgetting the replies and making the SAME COMPLAINTS over and over like an Alzheimer patient reading the same magazine for the 74th time.  That behavior if fucking stupid. You must be doing it just to agitate me, and it's fucking working: I'm fucking bloody agitated!!!!!!!!! I know I DON'T have an <a href="OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy.html">OfficialCertifiedDoubleBlindPeerReviewedPublishedStudy</a> to back my assumptions about programmer <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> (the only way you'd be "convinced"), but NEITHER DO YOU for assumptions about your model's users. <strong>You are throwing rocks from a glass house</strong>, the <a href="AnecdoteImpasse.html">AnecdoteImpasse</a> house. My model trade-off decisions are consistent with my stated assumptions about the model users' <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>, despite not having "convincing" proof of the way their heads work.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Again, your response is mainly a rant.  Lacking qualified evidence -- such as a clear and rational exposition of the supposed "tradeoffs" -- your justification for "the logic" of your model constitutes little more than a statement of personal preference.  I reject it categorically, unless you qualify documentation of your model with a statement to the effect that it is based on your personal assumptions, and does not reflect language semantics or real-world interpreter/compiler realities.}

      <ul>
        <li>
           Your model likewise appears to be only based on "personal preference", due to your probable overexposure of actual interpreter construction, making you biased to a certain model out of personal familiarity comfort. Matching machine implementation is not objectively a better goal than matching human thought patterns because assisting with human mental forecasting does not have to be tied to the implementation of existing interpreters. Nor have you found an objective way to measure "language semantics" so as to objectively fail my model based on such measurements. As it stands, I treat your "semantic" claims as  supernatural claims. <strong>Matching actual implementation is a fake requirement due to a logic mistake on your part</strong>. Again, it very much appears as if you are mistaking your personal mental models for universal truths.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I'm not claiming any "universal truths".  They belong strictly to mathematics and are only of philosophical concern.  What I claim to be true is that there are semantics common to all popular imperative programming languages.  My evidence is simple:  A statement like "a = foo() + 3 + b;", for example, has common semantics in every popular imperative programming language, despite (slight) variations in syntax.  I'm not matching my "model" to "actual interpreter construction", I'm matching my "model" to actual language semantics.  Do you deny that language semantics exist?  Their existence can be illustrated:  Given a C#/Java/C/C++/etc. statement like "a = foo() + 3 + b;", how would you describe it?  If you describe it as anything other than "a sequence of characters that follows certain rules for arranging the characters" (which is syntax), you're inevitably talking about programming language semantics.  Semantics can be consistently, objectively, and formally described via <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> and <a href="HoareLogic.html">HoareLogic</a>.}

           Again, I don't dispute that ideas exist (in human heads), I only dispute there is any known objective way to compare them or that they are objectively equivalent in all human heads. (See "hate" discussion.) If you use <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> and <a href="HoareLogic.html">HoareLogic</a>, can you prove that 1) They represent semantics and not something else, and 2) Your translation is the ONLY possible way the target languages can be represented in them? If there are other ways to represent the same syntax or interpreter behavior in DS and HL, then you've failed to establish uniqueness (canonical-ity). We've already established there are multiple ways to describe such expressions in both English and in code (interpreters), and thus find no uniqueness there. -t 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {This has nothing to do with ideas, and everything to do with the parts -- the statements and constructs -- of programming languages and the effects they have on the machine.  "Unique" is not equivalent to "canonical"; "canonical" is a synonym for "standard" or "typical", but not "unique" or "only".  It's occasionally used to mean "archetypal", which I suppose could imply uniqueness, but that would be incorrect here.  There may be multiple ways to interpret the semantics of popular imperative programming languages, but aside from your nuanced interpretation, I've not seen any outside of the canonical one.  I have certainly seen varying levels of detail in descriptions of semantics, but none that are incompatible with each other.  E.g., "a = foo() + b;" can be described as "the value resulting from the invocation of function 'foo' is added to the value in variable 'b' and the resulting value is stored in variable 'a'", or "a is 'foo' plus 'b'".  These describe the same semantics, differing only in detail.  Different semantics would be, for example, "rotate geometrical object 'a' about the axis labelled 'foo' by 'b' degrees."}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Based on your claims, you need to EITHER establish that there's only one possible "semantics" set to describe expression evaluation (and language processing) in the target "Algol" language style, OR show that most developers use a common set of "semantics". The first I'm calling "unique" and the second "canonical".  Trying to describe "semantics" with English does not convey enough precision to say anything definite or comparable. And your expression-to-English versions are biased to your favorite model; as suggested by your preference to use "value". (I've given a non-value version elsewhere). The <strong>English versions are arbitrary</strong> for the most part and varied. Expressions can be evaluated in parallel or semi-parallel, for example, and we generally cannot describe that very well in English because English is sequential. The "semantics" does not have to be sequential. There is no Law of the Universe that says that. Most human semantics is probably influenced by how we did it in school, and I'm not sure "semantics" is different from "algorithm". Students learn an algorithm for evaluating expressions, and this algorithm varies per personality and/or school system. (I gave examples already.) Some students can almost do it in their sleep because the steps become well-entrenched in their minds, and more resemble and algorithm than "semantics" from an outside observer.

           And I have already agreed my model makes NO significant attempt to match actual interpreter implementations and it says so on the page. Nor does it need to for the stated goal of assisting programmers to forecast type-related results. Bringing actual implementation into this discussion is a red herring. De-merits for you.

           {If you're claiming your model is an arbitrary approach to mapping <strong>user</strong> input to <strong>user</strong> output, that's fine.  You can use any approach you like.  As soon as you treat programming language source code as input -- and attempt to draw connections between source code and your model -- you inevitably draw comparisons between your approach to semantics (which is precisely what it is) and existing approaches to semantics.  Unfortunately, two fundamental elements of your model's semantics differ from established, documented semantics:  1. Your model of variables in D1 languages possesses an explicit "type" attribute; 2. your model of values in D1 languages does not possess an explicit "type" attribute.  Because this causes inevitable problems representing common constructs like returning results from functions, your resolution (it seems) is to conflate variables and values, resulting in novel constructs like "hidden variables" and "anonymous constants". That appears to offer no benefits -- and only encourages confusion by introducing undefined terms, whilst not clearly distinguishing values from variables -- with the <strong>only</strong> apparent consistent justification being that it "avoids nesting", as if the "nesting" implied by the universally-familiar notion that "a variable contains a value" is somehow difficult to grasp.}

           You have not clearly established the existence of a canonical way of representing variables and values in programmer's minds. (I'm not talking about interpreter writers or experts. They are a small minority.) Repetition of your canonical claim does not make it true. Normal people can see in "Original XML comparison example" under <a href="ValueExistenceProof.html">ValueExistenceProof</a> that the first set is <strong>easier to work with and less clutter</strong> than the second. I'd bet money most regular developers would pick the first. The addition of nesting serves no notable purpose of the tag model itself. <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a>. Nesting complicates the tag model itself, period. That should be clear to all. Until your it-teaches-bad-habits or violates-canon sort of claims are fleshed out, I'll go with keeping the model simple.

           {How "programmer's minds" may represent values and variables is irrelevant.  I'm interested only in how values and variables are represented in the semantics of popular imperative programming languages.  (It's also what programmers learn in school, so I suspect it is how "programmer's minds" represent values and variables unless they've been particularly forgetful.)  My issue with your definition of values and variables in D1 languages is that your variable has an extraneous "type" attribute that is unnecessary, and your value is missing a "type" attribute that is necessary.  Your solution to this  is to conflate values and variables into a single construct in which you ignore the "type" attribute when you use your construct as a variable and ignore the "name" attribute when you use your construct as a value.  That seems awkward.}

It's a technique that's too bloated for machine efficiency, but creates a nice bread-crumb-like pattern to make it easier to grok and trace for humans. It's not objectively "wrong" (outside of machine performance scores perhaps). And why get into another <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> fight?

           There are some "modularity" discussions about such on this wiki, but I don't see it relevant here. There are not objectively two separate things. YOU claim there should be two separate things, but they don't have to be two. In system design, one looks at the variations in attributes and makes a judgement call on whether to implement/represent a variation-on-a-theme via attribute differences or make them separate "types" of things (separate entities). In this case, there is not enough variation to justify the second. In fact, there is very little variation, since all such objects are named in my model, per model rules.

As soon as you're dealing with semantics, comparisons between your model's semantics and actual language semantics are inevitable.

Or at least realize there is a real gap in existing knowledge on the subject and acknowledge that instead of stubbornly cling to arbitrary pet models (or models optimized for machines instead of for humans). <strong>Good scientists are not stubborn in the face of weak evidence.</strong> (A good scientist can still be tenacious at <em>finding</em> better evidence to back a pet theory, but that's not the same as tenacious insistence of true-ness.

Then again, maybe it wouldn't be "odd"; maybe it would be useful, I don't know.  I do know that no popular imperative programming language does it.

      <p>
        {"Add", in most languages, is binary addition, acting on the representation of a value.  In most languages, assuming canonical types, it is implemented by a CPU's machine language "add" instruction.  "Add" does not operate on variables, it operates on values.  In my model, there is never a "variable --> value --> type" operation.  There isn't one in any <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> language.  There is only a "variable --> value" operation and a "value --> variable" operation.}
      </p>
      <p>
        You have not objectively demonstrated your claim about what "Add" does. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {I'm not sure what "objectively demonstrated" means in this case.  I do demonstrate how interpreters invoke "Add" at the bottom of <a href="ValueExistenceProof.html">ValueExistenceProof</a>.}
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as the second part, in your model reference, you have the following structure, and it has "type" as a component of "value".
      </p>
      <code>
        <variable name="splat"><br/>
        <value <strong>type</strong>="int" representation="3423"/><br/>
        </variable><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        {Sure.  In Category D1 languages, values have a type reference property but variables do not.  Variables simply contain values.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Nested-ness does NOT de-have-ify in typical usage! How many damned times do I have to repeat this??? In YOUR model, variables contain values and values contain types. Thus, it's fair to say that "variables contain types" using typical usage of "contains" in IT. Nesting does not diffuse such a relationship.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Nothing in the implementation of a <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> language ever makes reference to a "variable's type", so there's no reason to model it.  Therefore, your model of variables having a "type" attribute is at best redundant, on average misleading, and at worst incorrect.}
      </p>
      <p>
        It appears to serve the same general function as the "type=" attribute in your XML model for D1. And it is needed because type info is NOT kept "in" your "representation".
      </p>
      <p>
        {Nor does it need to be.  "Type info" is kept in values.  A value is a pair consisting of a representation and a type reference.}
      </p>
      <p>
        That's specific to YOUR model, not a universal need in order to match I/O (input includes source code).
      </p>
      <p>
        {I'd be curious to see how you can match I/O without it, given that every language implementation requires it.  In short, how do you (or the interpreter) know what a representation -- i.e., a string of bits, usually -- is, without an associated type reference?  For example, what does this string of bits represent: 1 1 0 1 1 0?  Should we use string operators on it?  Integer operators?  Floating point operators?}
      </p>
      <p>
        {Now, what if I <strong>tell</strong> you it's an ASCII character or 'char' type?  Or an integer?  Or a monochrome image?  It's only when I tell you the associated type that you (and the interpreter) can recognise that it's ASCII character '6', or the integer 53, or a tiny picture with six pixels.  Without an associated type reference, it can be anything.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep the type tag in the variable, that's how it can know.
      </p>
      <p>
        {What variable?  How does that work in a variable-less statement like writeln(3 + 4)?  If you claim that 3 and 4 are "variables", then all you're doing is renaming "value" to "variable".  (Erroneously, I might add, because 3 and 4 aren't variable.)}
      </p>
      <p>
        The parser determines the type, and stores it with the variable. In my model, it uses two hidden variables, which are then processed to assign to the programmer-visible variable. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {Again, what variable?  There's no "programmer-visible" variable, and "hidden variables" can't be variables, because they're not variable.}
      </p>
      <p>
        They are internally defined in the model that way. If you don't like it, then think of them as snazzjoomps.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Then you're using <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a> for values.  Regardless what you call them, you surely must recognise that whatever-it-is-called has some representation -- usually bits -- but they mean nothing (to humans or machines) without an associated type, as explained above.  Yes?}
      </p>
      <p>
        So what if I use <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a> parts inside the model. That's legal. You use "representation", which is also a <a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, "representation" is not a </em><a href="PrivateLanguage.html">PrivateLanguage</a>. It's a word.

      </p>
      <p>
        I bet next you claim the "standards" are clear if one reads enough obscure Phd books from mumbly professors in expensive universities. Even IF true, the problem with that logic is the <strong>target audience</strong> is for the most part not exposed to those sources such that it means nothing to them. Thus, they are not "common" standards, but rather <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> standards (if your book claim were true).
      </p>

        {That's a rant, bordering on <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> attack, rather than discussion, debate, rhetoric, logic, or evidence.  It deviates from the key question, which is this: Regardless what you call "values", you surely must recognise that whatever-they're-called has some representation -- usually machine bits -- but they mean nothing to humans or machines without an associated type, as explained above.  Yes?}

        <li>
           {All "standard" meant is that my use of "representation" is conventional, i.e., it's in accordance with standard usage.  If your model "can do it different", then what is it modelling?  Maybe it's not a model, then, but something else.}

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Standard", yeah right. "Value" is often used in colloquial-land for output-like items without any detectable type indicator. Example, "You forgot to put a value in field X. It's required."

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {For the literal (which is what it is) to be recognisable, a type reference must exist somewhere.  Otherwise, it's just a string.  If the field is in a data-entry form, for example, it's unquestionably built into the form itself or the code behind it.  There's invariably somewhere in the associated database or application code, or the form definition, that the field is identified to be a string, or numeric, or integer, or floating point, or a date, or whatever.}

      <ul>

           But that's often later down the road. It's not of the immediate concern of the speakers in the example. Existence is. Plus, the user usually can't "see" any type mechanism that's behind the scenes (unless perhaps they make a mistake). It's just characters in a box to most users and does not carry any inherent mental type tags/indicators.

        <li>
           {We're not talking about the user's understanding of the field, but how the program interprets it.  To interpret it, there must be an associated type, even if it's implicitly "string".}

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You mean similar to D2 typing? That gets into the fuzzy territory of "what is a type". D2 style programming often leaves "type checking" to the app programmer, and blurs the line between "types" and "validation". It's hard to call all conditionals that "check" something a "standard" except in a very wide-open way. I consider "type" a vague and continuous concept that shares territory with validation, conditionals, etc. And this doesn't really contradict the traditional definition of "type" because just about any input to any process (operator, functions, class, module, etc.) can be viewed as an operand-operator relationship.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Yes, if we assume a field is string, that's similar to D2 typing.  Identifying whether a given literal denotes a value from the set of values described by a type -- what you call "validation" -- is fundamental to every type system.  In Category S and D1 languages, it occurs during <a href="LexicalAnalysis.html">LexicalAnalysis</a> prior to run-time.  In Category D2 languages, it occurs at run-time within operators.  There's nothing vague about it, as proven by the fact that interpreters do it; there's nothing vague about a working interpreter.  Anyway, that's not the point.  The point is that for a literal to be recognisable, a type reference must exist somewhere.  If it's not explicit, the implicit type reference is "string".}

        <em>Since I can go to just about any website that specializes in computer science and find that it uses "representation" in exactly the same way it's used here, your vulgar denial of it being part of a </em><a href="PublicLanguage.html">PublicLanguage</a> is clearly false. Since your target audience also has free access (and in most cases had formal training that includes this use of the word "representation"), your claims that it would mean nothing to them is likely to be false as well.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No they don't. Representation usually relates to output, not INTERNAL "storage"; or at least it's overloaded to refer to both internal representation and output's formatting.
      </p>
      <p>
        {"Representation" can refer to output, storage, input, transfer, display, etc.  That's not "overloading" in the sense that one word has different meanings.  It's one word, with one meaning, that can be used in a variety of contexts.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost everything in coding-land is "representation" such that it doesn't distinguish anything and/or is redundant. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's distinguished by context.  If I say my numeric values are represented using the IEEE 754 standard for binary floating-point arithmetic, then we know exactly what is meant.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the standard defines such within or in relationship to the standard. But that by itself doesn't make it a universal truth; it may just be a standard-specific (part-specific) truth similar to the way each programming language gets to define what a "literal" is per its language syntax charts/rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        {That doesn't contradict what I wrote.}
      </p>
      <p>
        At best you have a <a href="UselessTruth.html">UselessTruth</a>. It doesn't convey anything definitive to the model user. No context of the type you speak of is given in the model itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        {I'm not clear what you're debating, here.  Every value has a representation.  That is indubitable.}
      </p>
      <p>
        EVERY attribute in your XML (or tuple or any XML) is a "representation" of something. Calling one in particular "representation" doesn't tell us anything new. "Value" would be the most natural name for it, but you already used that name for something else. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {As I noted above, the context is important.  In context, the "representation" attribute is the bit string (or whatever) from which, along with a type reference, a value is constructed.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, the "context" doesn't do anything for me. Sure, you can describe what the attribute is for elsewhere, but you could do the same if you called it a nazzblerf.
      </p>
      <p>
        {That wouldn't make sense.  Without a representation, when an operator manipulates a value, what is it manipulating?  Is it operating on bits?  Individual ASCII characters?  Arrays of Unicode characters?  Something else?}
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know. I won't attempt to re-label your particular model.
      </p>
      <p>
        {My question has nothing to do with labelling or "my particular model".  My question applies equally to every programming language.  Of course, as I've mentioned before, a model can gloss over the representation by skipping any mention of it.  For example, you can describe a value as <value type="int">1234</value>, but every interpreter <strong>must</strong> handle 1234 via some representation, whether it's a string of ASCII characters, a string of bits, or something else.}
      </p>
      <p>
        It may be true that "1234" will be processed somehow somewhere in the various models, but that doesn't mean we should model and/or label such processing/handling in the same way for each model. Consistency would be nice, but sometimes different models have different purposes and are thus built different.
      </p>
      <p>
        {There's nothing that suggests "processing/handling in the same way for each model".  However, every interpreter must represent values <strong>somehow</strong>.  A value without a representation is meaningless; it has no data for operators to manipulate.}
      </p>
      <p>
        That PREsumes it needs your version of "values" to begin with. A model can use sniggs and klorps for the purpose of what you call "value" if it wants. Your version of value is <strong>arbitrary</strong> (or at least weakly guided by colloquial notions.)
      </p>
      <p>
        {My version of value is not arbitrary.  It's a concept fundamental to how modern computers and computer languages operate, whether you call it a "value" or a snigg or a klorp.  Of course, if you call it a snigg or a klorp, no one will know what you're talking about.} 
      </p>
      <p>
        By "operate" do you mean actual implementation? If the answer is "yes", then you should know my likely reply by now. If you say "no" and use the word "semantics", likewise. Note that my model has something called "value", but it's not identical to your version of "value". I could instead call that "representation", but then "no one will know what you're talking about".
      </p>
      <p>
        {Except that I define my use of "representation" at the top of <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>, so that it's clear what I mean, and I provide examples to illustrate what I mean.}
      </p>
      <p>
        But that's do-able for any "private" term/usage. It appears to be a double-standard to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        {It would be a double-standard if I were advocating a completely wayward term -- say, "intubation" -- instead of "representation", and didn't define it but used it as if it was already familiar.  Instead, I've defined the term and I am using it in the same manner that "representation" is used in numerous texts.  If you find it particularly objectionable, an alternative for "representation" -- specifically where I've used it -- is "data".}
      </p>
      <p>
        How is the level of wayward-ness or resulting confusion measured? See also <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> tradeoff_rant_48.
      </p>
      <p>
        {By "wayward", I mean it's largely unrelated to the concept to which it refers.  Would the alternative, "data", be more acceptable to you than "representation"?}
      </p>
      <p>
        No. I don't know of a better term at this point. "Value" would be the best term in my opinion, but you used it for a different purpose, and thus are stuck with a goofy trade-off. It happens. I doubt that ANY model can both work (predict) AND match well to existing colloquial usage.
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's hardly goofy.  "Representation" or "data" is conceptually and practically necessary, regardless how it's named.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Fine, you satisfied the necessity part, but it's still a goofy name. Just about everything in all our models is "data" and "representation" such that it's superfluous.
      </p>
      <p>
        {In the context in which it used, "representation" is the usual term, though "data" is also used.}
      </p>
      <p>
        So you claim.
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's consistent with convention.  See, for example (I chose this at random), <a href="http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/DataRepresentation.html">http://www.ntu.edu.sg/home/ehchua/programming/java/DataRepresentation.html</a> }
      </p>
      <p>
        Because it's an overloaded term. It's hard to be "wrong" with an overloaded term (unless one claims it's not overloaded, perhaps.) And the type indicator also has a "representation" in RAM I would note (based on at least one of the overloaded versions). So why are you NOT calling that a "representation" or a "type representation"? It's not any less "representationy" than the other attribute.

           {No, it's consistent with convention because I'm using "representation" in a conventional manner, and it's applicable in numerous areas.  However, my use of "representation" is within a value, so it's a value's representation.}

        "Value" is overloaded such that it's used multiple ways. If it's used 2 different ways roughly 50% of the time for each way, then 1 out of 2 usages will fit your pet version and be relatively easy to find an occurrence of. You'd have to demonstrate that roughly 3/4 of all occurrences use your pet version to have a realistic claim of it being canonical. CSV has "value" in the very name, and it lacks a type indicator component, for instance. (It should be "comma-separated literals" if we use terms usually associated with programming languages, but <strong>"value" is a loose term</strong>. That's just the way it is.)
      </p>
      <p>
        {I've not seen any evidence that "value" is used for anything except values.  "Value" is sometimes used to refer to literals (as in CSV), but that's reasonable -- literals <strong>always</strong> denote values so it's an appropriate shorthand.  Literals, in context, always have a type indicator component which is determined by context.  The type indicator depends on the grammar of the system that reads the literal.  For example, in most imperative programming languages, 123 denotes an integer value, 123L denotes a long value, 123.5 denotes a floating point value, and so on.  In short, the syntax unambiguously denotes the type of the literal, and hence the type of the value it denotes.  (By the definition of "string", every literal is a string.)}

        From your "repr" link: "Representations allow us to write values, which are an <strong>abstract idea</strong>, in a concrete, preferably, compact way." (Emphasis gleefully added.)
      </p>
      <p>
        "Abstract idea" == Head stuff! Kapowww! Right in the kisser! Plus, it contradicts your usage of "representation" because it's not meant to be "external" in your model. Further 2, it does not say types are "inside" values.
      </p>
      <p>
        {As noted above, types need not be "inside" values.  It is sufficient that they be associated with values, i.e., that there be a mapping between values and types.  Whether this is done via inclusion or composition (i.e., "has-a") or some other mechanism is an irrelevant detail, though inclusion or composition is convenient and intuitive for modelling purposes.  Note that many "abstract ideas" in programming have concrete manifestations.  "Variable" is also an abstract idea, but a typical imperative program is full of them.}

      <ul>
        <li>
           Manifestations are not the same as "abstract ideas". Manifestations are <em>shaped</em> by abstract ideas, but that does NOT mean they ARE abstract ideas. As far as your "associated with", stick with one and only one representation to avoid confusion. If you want to use references instead of containment, then change your XML model to show that. No flipping. As currently given in your write-up, variables "contain" types in your XML, per common English usage. Nested-ness does not normally disqualify containment in common English usage.

I'd prefer to stick to "associated with", as it avoids any whiff of implementation strategy that may be implied by "containment" or "references".  Again, that variables "contain" types via a transitive association of variable --> value --> type (such that variable --> type) is -- I suppose -- trivially true in concept, but completely irrelevant and pointless.   As noted elsewhere, in <a href="DynamicallyTyped.html">DynamicallyTyped</a> popular imperative programming languages, every variable reference that isn't assignment retrieves the variable's value.  If that wasn't true, something like typeName(v) where v is a variable would be fundamentally different from typeName(3 + 4).  In other words, we'd need one implementation of typeName() for variables, and a different implementation of typeName() for expressions.  Instead, we simply provide one implementation of typeName() that works on values.}

        And "a lot of heads" may not matter. It's the <strong>ratio</strong> that's important. For example, if 50% of typical programmers use head model X and 50% use head model Y, then the choice of X selected over Y, or Y over X probably won't make much difference (all else being equal). It only becomes notable if it approaches around 70%. And even then, other trade-offs and conflicts might come into play such that it's a weighing game to make the least evil compromise. It would have to approach around say roughly 85% before other tradeoffs should probably be ignored and popularity alone dictates the model. -t

        No they don't. They call it an "abstract idea", meaning it's a concept in human heads.

        {You appearing to infer something from the document that isn't there.  There is nothing in the document to suggest that values exist only in human minds.

      </p>
      <p>
        When something is turned into an implementation, it's RARELY referred to as an "abstract idea". YOU are the one who is "infer[ing] something from the document that isn't there". You read wrong! Your reading is out of step with average humans.

        Like I said, a painting of "anger" is not anger itself. The computer model is a projection of an abstract idea, not the abstract idea itself. Everybody knows this except YOU. Symbols represent abstraction ideas, but symbols by themselves are not <em>equivalent</em> to "abstract idea". A cave painter can paint a scene depicting "hunting". Hunting is an "abstract idea", but the painting is not hunting itself; it's merely a representation of hunting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, if the hunter draws hash marks to track kills, he/she is turning an abstract idea (kill count) into a representation of that abstract idea. The hash marks represent the count, but they are not equivalent to the count.

      <p>
        {So you're arguing that computers don't implement numbers?}
      </p>
      <p>
        Where did I say that? I'm saying implementations are not abstract ideas themselves but a representation of abstract ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Yes, of course.  That's trivially true.  Values are both abstract ideas ("think of a number") and concrete.  Functions in C#, for example, return values.}

      </p>
      <p>
        {Sure.  Fire up a debugger, call a function and watch as the return value is pushed onto a stack by the callee and popped by the caller.  If that's not a value, what is it?  Ignoring the debugger, look at the semantics:  What does a function return?}
      </p>
      <p>
        It appears we interpret that passage differently. I interpret it to mean that the representation is a concrete manifestation of a mind concept, which is referrred to as an "abstract idea" in that passage. It's rare that a computer is said to "have an idea", but it is common to say that "computers can represent ideas" the same way that hash marks on caves (can) represent numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Yes, this appears to be a matter of interpretation.  I saw nothing in the article that suggested values don't have reality in a computational system.}
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you mean by "have" here? A specific representation of ideas, yes. But there are usually multiple diff ways to represent the same idea. And even if the writeup doesn't directly contradict your interpretation of "abstract idea", it doesn't shore it up as the ONLY interpretation either. It does NOT provide an unambiguous definition of "value". Thus, the writeup may not contradict your notion of "value", but it doesn't contradict mine either (that it's overloaded).

        It doesn't contradict EITHER of our claims because it's fucking vague! To me "abstract idea" usually means something in human heads, not machines. But it's not 100% established in the writing such that I cannot claim it with 100% certainty. But it is <strong>a good illustration of how crappy existing writing is about type-related issues</strong>. Perhaps it was meant to convey a general notion, not scientifically valid vocabulary and related tests for matches (falsification). Without the rigor, it's <strong>like a Rorschach test</strong>: each of us projects our world view into the fuzzy gaps in the writings.

        The article does NOT back YOUR particular interpretation of the phrases and terms it uses. The text in the article is the objective subject of analysis, NOT your head's version of it. The fact that it does not rule out your interpretation is not the same as verifying your interpretation to be fully accurate. It doesn't rule out my claim that "value" is overloaded or vague. Further, some sources may use it one way, and some sources another. "Value" currently lacks a clear-cut scientific definition.

        The first sentence I agree with. The rest I don't. The cited sources do not validate that YOUR interpretation of the sources is canonical. They only show it's possible. Possible != Canonical. And this can happen with overloaded terms. A thorough analysis would look something like this:

      <code>
        Total occurrences of "abstract idea": 983<br/>
        Total occurrences that can be interpreted as happening on machines: 684<br/>

        {There is no need for such a detailed analysis, unless you're doing research on descriptions of programming language semantics based on literary analysis.  (Which might be an interesting piece of work, by the way.)  All that is required is <strong>one</strong> document not written by me, that shares my interpretation of programming language semantics, in order to demonstrate that I am not alone in my interpretation of programming language semantics.  As it turns out, the majority of popular imperative programming language manuals would qualify.  That, of course, has nothing to do with what is canonical or not, but then this section had nothing to do with what is canonical or not.  It was solely about disproving your claim that "[my] version of 'semantics' is only in [my] head."}

           "Value" is vague in both. Note this statement: "A computer number format is the internal representation of numeric values in [computers or machines]". To me, "representation of" implies it's a <strong>projection</strong> of a value, not the value itself. But I will not attach any rigorous meaning to "of" there; only give my own interpretation. A projection of an idea is probably lossy in that it's not a perfect replacement for the original or source "idea" in the human mind. It only has to be good enough for the projection's intended purpose, which is usually communication with a machine or other person(s). You are welcome to interpret "of" differently, but I don't have to recognize your interpretation unless proven without a doubt to be the only valid interpretation. -t

        {As for determining whether or not there are canonical popular imperative programming language semantics, that is also trivially done:  Simply note in how many popular imperative programming languages the statement "a = foo() + 3 * c;" has the same semantics.  (Hint: it's all of them.  Those with differing syntax still possess a semantic equivalent, i.e., there's some syntax that allows you to specify, in one statement, "multiply the value in variable c by 3, add it to the result of invoking function foo, and store the resulting value in variable 'a'".}
      </p>
      <p>
        Same syntax is NOT the same as same semantics. You have not established a way to objectively measure semantics. They appear to be a figment of your imagination.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Indeed, same syntax is not the same as same semantics.  I never said it was.  What I wrote is that in every popular imperative programming language, the same Algol-derived syntax <strong>has</strong> the same semantics.  In every popular imperative programming language, the syntax of "identifier <assignment symbol> expression <end-of-line>" means "store the value resulting from evaluation of the expression in the variable named by the identifier."  I don't know of any popular imperative language where that syntax means anything else.}  
      </p>
      <p>
        {If semantics are a "figment of [my] imagination", then interpreters must be imaginary too, because without semantics all we have is syntax recognition.  If all we have is syntax recognition, then we can successfully recognise that syntax like "identifier <assignment symbol> expression <end-of-line>" is correct, but the interpreter won't be able to do anything with it.  Semantics are, quite simply, what the interpreter <strong>does</strong> to the bits and bytes in the machine, given statements that have syntax like "identifier <assignment symbol> expression <end-of-line>".}
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, semantics ARE figments of imaginations. They are an "abstract idea" in human minds. Computers process algorithms, not semantics <em>directly</em>. Computers don't have ideas and notions (outside of AI). And even if I agree that semantics may exist inside machines, for the sake of argument, the claim that the semantics for language A are the same as those for language B is not scientifically measurable at this point. <strong>There is no clear and useful metric for the same-ness of two or more instances of semantics</strong>. SUCH TESTS DO NOT CURRENTLY EXIST. We <em>can</em> measure and compare syntax and grammar rules for computer languages and identify similarities via pattern matching criteria, but there are no known comparable tools for "semantics".

           One can learn to use dynamic typing & languages via trial and error, and that's one of their selling points: incremental absorption (including <a href="LimpVersusDie.html">LimpVersusDie</a>). But that's not necessarily the same as using a rigorous mental or computational model. We've over this already. Anyhow, the tag model offers the possibility of using existing knowledge (XML or tables and imperative code) to create models. No special academic notation needs to be learned. It has two nice features: <strong>1) Does not rely heavily on English and 2) Does not rely on arcane notations.</strong> Your model cannot claim these. The down-side is that it may not mirror actual internal interpreter construction as well. Let the user decide which trade-off path they want. <strong>VIVA CHOICE</strong>.

           If talking about an instance, <strong>yes</strong>. I believe "has" or "contains" would be acceptable or even common. But it would be an interesting language experiment to see if the notation used changes their response. (Hey, what's with the word "explicit"? You are moving the goal posts. Caught!) In stereotypical OO composition, a house may "contain" a garage in a similar manner, and the garage would contain a garage door. Since OO is often supposed to model the real world, a house "has" a garage, which "has" a garage door. Thus, it's common (or at least acceptable) to say the house "has" a garage door. Some even call such a "HAS-A" relationship in OO, versus an IS-A relationship of direct inheritance. I don't know why you are making a big deal about this anyhow; there are different ways to factor/arrange data structures for essentially the same info. Or are you going canonical on me again?

Your model is equivalent to "class Variable {String name, Value value, Type type}; class Value {String value};"  Note how you have an explicit "type" attribute in Variable?  See how that differs from "class Variable {String name, Value value}; class Value {Type type, Representation data};"?  Now, what's different about Variable between the two models?

           What's wrong with that? And what do you mean exactly by "need"? For what goal? Use what you need and don't use what you don't need. That's dynamic thinking, which is not "evil", just different from static thinking. (Static designs are usually better machine-performance-wise I would note, but we are NOT optimizing for that in this model.)  And in my model, every "value" is a variable. It may be inaccessible to the "outside", but inside the model it's just as accessible as any other variable and is addressed and handled just like the "external" variables. (We can play with it to learn). Thus, I don't have "values" of your kind in the model whatsoever. It's not needed, period. I agree such address-ability of "things" is not a necessity to "run" such a model/interpreter, but it's a <strong>human grokking aid</strong>. And when we introduce that aid, the need for a non-named "value" (or your kind) goes away such that we factor out a level. Logical, rational, clean. We don't need your kind of indirection/nesting in THIS model, so we get rid of it. I see nothing wrong or evil about that. It's Factoring 101. If we are concerned with machine performance ONLY, then I agree such factoring is a poor choice because machines don't need "labeled values" (or whatever you want to call them) and they just consume resources. That's probably why the "standard academic model" factors the way it does. Neither approach is "wrong", it's just optimized for different purposes. --top

           <em>An algorithm describes "how", the semantics describe "what".  An algorithm describes the steps or instructions (which themselves can be described in terms of algorithms and semantics) used to implement the semantics.  The semantics of assignment "<variable> := <expression>" in Pascal is "store the result of evaluating the expression in the variable".  Semantics describe the effect of such a statement, they also describe the parts.  What a "variable", "value", "type", "expression", "evaluate" is, is semantic.  By comparison, syntax merely states that a sequence of characters may be followed by a certain symbol which may be followed by a certain set of other symbols and sets of characters, etc.  An algorithm is a sequence of steps, e.g., "1. push the value represented by the first literal to the stack. 2. push the next ... blah blah blah".  Semantics describes what a "literal" is, what a "stack" is, what a "value" is, etc.  By "describes", I don't mean "provides an English definition", I mean it's what these things are in terms of machine addresses, bits and bytes, or whatever other programmatic mechanisms are provided to the implementer by the machine environment.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "How" is implementation, and there are multiple qualifying implementations such that "how" does NOT provide us with a canonical view of "semantics" or anything else resembling "semantics".  And Pascal does not talk like that, at least not before a few drinks. That's YOUR personal interpretation of a code snippet, or at least one of many interpretations or translations into a pet head model or pet terms. Words like "store" or "save" are relative. Re: "What [X] is, is semantics". But there is no known canonical objective "is" for your listed X's, except as described in a particular language's syntax rules. <strong>The stuff in between the I/O nodes and syntax rules is not objective!</strong>. Your view of them is not canonical; it's personal and unique to your head, or at least not universal Again, you are mistaking your personal head models as objectively reality, without realizing it. And the last sentence makes no sense to me. "Is" is a crazy word in virtual-land.

           I'm not sure how to turn your "what does...mean to you" question into rigorous English. Thoughts are thoughts. Colloquially, I'd say "the variable receives the results of the expression". And if you asked me to define/describe "results", I'd probably colloquially say that a "result" has at least a type indicator of some kind, and a thing that could be called a value, representation, data, field, byte sequence, string, and/or literal, but have no solid label for it. I'd lean toward "value" or "literal", but don't claim them ideal. How the type indicator and the value/literal are packaged together (or kept separate) is implementation-specific. There is no single "right" way to package them in terms of getting the right final result. "Result" is just a handy short-hand for the "stuff emitted". It's comparable to saying "the mailman/mail-person delivers mail". "Mail" may be one package, a thousand letters, or all kinds of different postal items. Saying "mail" allows one to be vague about the nature of packaging and contents. "Mail" is the stuff the mail-person delivers. (Postal rules define what's considered a valid delivery items, I would note. Not sure if there is a usable equivalent for our purposes.) In general, <strong>I kind of visualize the expression squirting "stuff" into the variable</strong>, the "stuff" looking kind of like half glue and half gel pill. I don't concern myself with the nature of the "stuff" unless a specific question down the road requires opening or digging into the "stuff" for specific parts, like a type indicator.

           You have not established that your version of "value" is clearly canonical. In fact, colloquial usage often contradicts it since things called "values" often don't carry type info "with" them. We've been over this already. <strong>There is no objective and clear measure of/from the I/O profile of our target languages that reveals the mandatory existence of your version of "value'.</strong>

           We've been over similar territory already in the "form field" discussion. Your "associated with type" was so very open ended such as to qualify just about anything under the sun. There's an "associated with" in my model's "value" also (at least for D1-like languages), such that it perfectly qualifies under "associated with".

           Please clarify how they are "mutually exclusive".

Thus, any characteristics you claim they have (they do this or that) is purely speculative or a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>. Don't make up "fake rules". Actually, the structures we both use are very similar, at least in non-stack models. The only notable difference is that I don't include the type indicator as a sub-component of "value". Further, being anonymous for external users (app programming & running) does not mean it has to be anonymous <em>inside</em> the model. Almost any interpreter emulator is going to need SOME way to reference/ID "values" inside, whether pointers or names. Inside the model, nothing is "anonymous". "Anonymous" is relative.

Therefore, I don't know what you are actually complaining about, unless you are dictating arbitrary implementation specifics, which is a no-no for reasons already given.

           Sorry, I'm not following. Perhaps an example would help. I mean source code of the "original" test case, not the modelling source. The modelling source may not even be written in the same language. The mutability/non-mutability profile matches that of "regular" code in the "regular" interpreter. A programmer using my model as an interpreter to run their app code (if completed to that level) CANNOT do extra "mutating" (changes). They can only do such if they "break into" the model and tweak the guts, which is true of the original production interpreter also. For example, if one fiddled with the source code of a Php interpreter or mucked with the machine code in the EXE of the interpreter. That's what I mean by "mutable inside only".

           <em>I don't know what you mean by "source code of the 'original' test case" as opposed to "the modelling source".  The rest, I'm afraid, I do not understand either; I think the context has been lost.  A value is never mutable, neither at a language level, nor inside its interpreter.</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Of course the "internal guts" of an interpreter are mutable, if one has access to the guts. Any byte in the interpreter EXE or stack is potentially alterable. Viruses do stuff like that all the time. And I've worked with debuggers that let one fiddle with various aspects of "internals" which would not otherwise be alterable via source code. Non-mutability generally happens at a higher level of abstraction. The tag model acting like a "regular interpreter" would NOT allow the altering of the intermediate values/variables or whatever one calls them. (The technique is explained in the "notes" section.)

           I don't see how this relates to the question. It's primarily a model of language behavior. But, since it uses a "toy" interpreter, or parts thereof, to serve it's (virtual) explanation, sometimes one wants to tinker with the guts to explore the toy interpreter.

"It's value" is an abstract idea in human heads, not a concrete objective thing. <strong>The contents of variables and RAM slots are mutable. Whether there is some middle-man thing called a "value" that is immutable is model-specific.</strong> There's nothing externally objective that says such a thing must exist. It again appears as if you are mistaking your personal head model for universal truths.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>In terms of popular imperative programming languages, abstract programming code and physical hardware employ exactly the same model.  A value is stored in a slot.  The contents of the slot -- i.e., what value is in the slot at a given time -- is mutable.  What is stored in the slot at that given time, however, is immutable.  You do understand that an immutable thing can be stored in a mutable slot, yes?  Imagine, for example, a bucket.  A bucket can hold different stones at a different times.  Thus, the contents of the bucket are mutable.  However, the bucket cannot change -- it, like a machine address, is immutable -- nor can the stones change.  Each stone remains exactly the same, no matter where we put it or use it.  The only mutable thing is what stone is in the bucket at a given point in time.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm not clear what specific parts of the bucket analogy map to parts of RAM chips and related processing. Please elaborate on parts mapping in the analogy. Note that as a working assumption, I agree that the "slot" specified by a RAM address is "immutable", but that's not an issue that I can see.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Bucket = memory address (or variable).  Stone = value.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So the bucket itself is not mutable, we both agree (for practical purposes). Right? But the "contents" of the bucket ARE mutable, as we can put in and take out different content to and from the bucket. Agreed? However, <strong>rocks are a problematic analogy</strong>. In the physical world, you typically have to remove the existing rocks to put in new rocks. It's not practical to smash the rocks into dust and then rebuild new rocks (unless maybe we are recycling pottery). But with electronic flip-flops, we don't have to remove any existing physical "thing" to put in a new/different physical things. It's more equivalent to switching a gate(s) to change the flow of fluid (or flowing electrons). Signals change the direction or "state" of "fluid gates" to alter the flow to a different path (gulley), as needed. Values (content) are NOT solid "things" in the chips such that your rock analogy is a poor fit. There is nothing clearly equivalent to your rocks in chips. Any such mapping requires indirect and contrived fittings or associations or additional layers of pretend or abstract hardware. (I don't believe common notions about languages to be heavily influenced by hardware, but I'm entertaining your claim to see if it provides some insight into the origins and nature of your rather curious and seemingly alien notions about common beliefs among programmers.)

           <em>It's a casual analogy, intended to clarify.  It's not meant to be a precise "rock and bucket" model of </em><a href="VonNeumannArchitecture.html">VonNeumannArchitecture</a>.  It's better to skip analogies entirely, and recognise simply that slots (memory addresses or variables) contain values, slots are mutable in that a different value can be stored in a slot, but values are immutable.  With this simple model, the distinction between values, variables and types can be easily explained and understood.  Without this simple model, it's likely that values, variables and types will continue to be unhelpfully misunderstood as an indistinct muddle, resulting in a poor grasp of programming language semantics which leads to poor programming.<em></em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If that's the case, then values can never exist in existing RAM-based hardware because every bit/slot of RAM is potentially mutable. Mutability is relative. My "values" are not mutable to the app code writer, but are mutable to a model fiddler. Same with your "values": they are mutable to a model fiddler, or at least to a RAM hacker.

           And re: (above) "There is nothing in any popular imperative programming language, or in any popular machine architecture, where a value 3 can change into a value 4." This is false, <strong>most regular programmers would agree this is an accurate or sufficient description</strong> of changing the "value" at a given memory address. It wouldn't be any different to saying one can "change the value at cell B3" in a spreadsheet. (Typically, it would be "change the cell at B3", but using "value" wouldn't raise an eyebrow.)

           For one, regular programmers are the tag model's target audience, not PhD's. And see above near "ghost forces" about your apparent misuse of the term "replace". And you are wrong about regular programmers, who would agree that the <em>slot</em> at the memory addresses is mutable. I'd bet money that at least 75% would say "Yes" if you asked them if the slot referenced by a memory address in typical RAM is "mutable" (change-able), assuming they were familiar with machine language.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Of course the </em>slot<em> at a memory address is mutable, but the value that can be stored at that slot is immutable.  An address is mutable by virtue of the fact that the immutable value currently stored at a given address can be replaced with a different immutable value.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The slot is there, most would agree, but a "value" separate from the "slot" is an invention of your mind. You seem to be picturing a kind of value sticker that is slapped into the slot. When the "value" is changed, the old sticker is removed and the new sticker placed on the slot. That's a valid mental model, but not unique and not ubiquitous. An equally valid mental model is horizontal wheel dials with digits on them (sort of like a thumb-enabled analog odometer). To change a slot's contents, one moves the dials. (If we assume a binary model, toggle switches will do.)

           Somewhere I gave a fairly thorough description of "I/O profile". (I don't know if it qualifies as a "definition"). If I find it again, I'll link to it. "Semantics" is just too poorly defined to use in these type of discussions. And "random" is matter of perspective.

           Either way, there is <strong>no agreed-upon way to measure semantics</strong>, such as verifying its existence or absence in a given thing, or testing/comparing for equivalency/similarity of one instance of semantics to another. Those are the basics of measuring.

Some draw little trees resembling an <a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a>; others reduce it one operand at a time, repeating the non-changed parts; some do the sub-parts at different parts of the paper and then put the mid-level results back together near the answer, etc. And one can even use a stack, like actual interpreters do. It's fairly clear they prefer a different way of organizing their computations, which probably reflects different thought processes.

           It's a matter of scope. They are treated as opaque for evaluating whether a model passes the "match" test. But, they are not opaque for studying how a specific model works inside. All models probably have to process and dissect such a string, but there are multiple ways to do it, and thus "do" is not canonical from the implementation perspective (assuming we define "do" that way). The match qualifications do not require dissecting the source text, but it's an <em>option</em> legitimately available to a given model. In theory, we could construct a huge look-up table that maps the two inputs (data and source) to the output byte stream such that there is no need to parse: it's simple look-up. However, such table would have difficulty fitting in this universe. (In theory it would be infinite, but that's only if we assume the I/O can be of infinite size, which would fail existing interpreters because our computers have finite resources and addressing space. Thus, in practice the mega-map does not have to be infinite to be competitive with the existing ones.)

        You first need to demonstrate that semantics can exist in machines (interpreters). And then you need find a way to objectively compare two I/O-matching interpreters and say whether their semantics are the same or different. Thus, if semantics exist in software, how can we compare two instances of software to see if they have the same semantics?

        That's called "algorithm", not "semantics". Anything at a higher abstraction than "algorithm" is in human heads and only human heads (barring an AI-based interpreter, which perhaps we can't rule out either). It's true that algorithms can be influenced by human semantics, but that's not the same as <em>being</em> semantics. Influence != Being.
      </p>
      <p>
        {An "algorithm" is a specific arrangement of operations intended to perform a specific task.  "Semantics" are what the operations do, individually and/or as a whole.  A "sort" algorithm is the operations required to put a set of items in a specific order.  The semantics are "puts a set of items in a specific order."  Each operation within the algorithm has its own semantics, like ":=" in Pascal has the semantics "store the value on the right hand side in the variable on the left hand side."} 
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, that's clearly the human head side of things. It's ridiculous to say that those concepts ARE IN the machine. Those concepts may shape/influence the algorithm, but that doesn't mean they are actually in the machine any more than "hunting" IS IN my cave sketch of a hunting scene. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's ridiculous to say that those concepts ARE IN the machine?  Really?  A variable isn't in a machine?  There isn't a right-hand-side and a left-hand-side in a typical assignment statement?  We'd better tell the compiler/interpreter people about this; it appears they've been coding ghosts.}
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a representation and/or projection of variables "in the machine". A painting of a hunting scene is not hunting itself. And the left-hand/right-hand thing is a syntax issue. We present ASCII bytes in a certain order by convention, and can use this convention to say a given symbol is "to the left" of another. We have syntax conventions that we can use to describe syntax, but I think most would agree that syntax is not semantics itself. (It's shaped by semantics, but influence is not equivalence.) It is generally acceptable in colloquial-land to say a variable is "inside the machine", but that's probably <strong>not suitable for rigorous analysis</strong>. When their OS crashes, people often say that "my PC is sad". But that's not intended to be a rigorous or objective statement. People use social and physical terms or analogies to describe equipment and virtual worlds at times, but it would be a mistake to take those literally.
      </p>
      <p>
        {What is a "representation and/or projection of variables 'in the machine'"?  Presenting "ASCII bytes in a certain order by convention" is syntax.  What that syntax describes in terms of machine actions, are semantics.  "Variables" are defined by the semantics of a programming language.  Syntactically, there are no "variables", there are only identifiers (which are character sequences that follow certain rules), symbols, literals, keywords, and the various allowable arrangements of these.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: '"Variables" are defined by the semantics of a programming language.' -- Where exactly? A syntax processor can distinguished between sub-classes of "identifiers", including "variables". The processor can usually say whether a certain byte in the source string belongs to a variable or a function name, etc. (I should point out that some interpreters delay making that distinction until it actually uses an identifier, but informally one can usually tell by reading the source code.) The "semantics of a programming language" is not an objectively observable thing. You might as well talk about unicorns and bigfoot: things we have yet to catch and study. Maybe you are religious and worship "semantic" spirits? Your descriptions are a lot like religious descriptions. Maybe if we approach them like a religion, this whole thing will start to make sense, or at least have a common reference point with something else we are familiar with. Otherwise, I'm a loss to do anything concrete with your claims. To me "semantics" are not a concrete thing, just human thoughts. Human thoughts cannot be measured or observed directly, but only by their impact on other things, and so far we have no universally accepted model of thoughts/ideas/notions by which to communicate about them effectively and rigorously.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Semantics are described in language documentation and the code that implements compilers and interpreters.  That is objectively observable.  However, unlike syntax -- where we have semi-standardised notations like EBNF to describe it -- aside from formalisms like <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> and <a href="HoareLogic.html">HoareLogic</a>, we don't have standardised notations to express programming language semantics.  Nonetheless, semantics exist.  Note that "a syntax processor" as you've described it does not deal with notions of "variables" -- except to the extent that some syntax parsers do a certain amount of groundwork on behalf of the subsequent semantic processing, which only occurs once an <a href="AbstractSyntaxTree.html">AbstractSyntaxTree</a> has been created.  A token like <variable> in a language grammar isn't recognised as a variable by the parser; its name is only for our benefit.  In most cases, <variable> in a grammar specification is merely a synonym for "identifier" (which is itself a synonym for the rules defining an allowable or valid sequence of characters) which only appears in certain places in the grammar.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Language documentation is vague and overloaded when it comes to "types" and related. If there is no standard notation for language semantics, then it's very difficult to compare and contrast, including demonstrating universality or canonical-ness. It's almost like doing science before math. We need some kind of notation to demonstrate anything objective, or at least mutually agree about some characteristic of the thing being analyzed. I don't dispute that semantics exists, but there is no universally agreed representation for it. "Love" and "hate" and "sorrow" also exist (as ideas or notions in the mind), but we have no universal representation or notation for it to <strong>measure/prove exactly where it is and where it is not, nor equivalency; and thus are stuck with messy spoken language as a consolation prize.</strong>

        I'm not going to get into a definition fight over "variable". One can generally informally recognize one by looking at the source code (at least in terms of syntactical representation of one) and distinguish between function names, language keywords, etc. Now in dynamic languages sometimes names can be reused such that syntactical analysis may not be sufficient to classify accurately. But colloquially, one can identify most from the source patterns and peers will agree, at least if they know the purpose of the program and get hints from intent.
      </p>
      <p>
        {In other words, you can recognise the semantics of a language by looking at its source code, because similar syntax invariably implies the same semantics?}
      </p>
      <p>
        As already explained, different AI techniques can identify the same patterns, demonstrating that same output does not imply same processing. You have not demonstrated that all correctly matching outcomes proves a consistent semantics framework behind it. "Single path theory", I shall call it. Same-outcome != same-semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Can you demonstrate these "different AI techniques" creating an alternative but viable interpretation of programming language semantics?  It is certainly conceivable that alternative but viable interpretations of programming language semantics might exist.  I have never seen such, and even your model describes conventional semantics with added redundancy to (apparently) avoid "nesting" in your choice of notation.}
      </p>
      <p>
        No, it's an analogy, not an implementation. I cannot X-ray human minds in sufficient detail and neither can you. What exactly is "redundant" about it? Maybe "analogy" is the wrong word. It's proof that matching I/O profiles does not automatically imply matching processing/thinking. (I consider neural nets "thinking".) It takes only one case to bust a rule that says matching I/O profiles always implies matching semantics (thinking). I/O profile matching may be considered weak evidence to back a particular case, but not sufficient by itself. It may be a prerequisite, but not a sufficient condition by itself to claim equal semantics.
      </p>
      <p>
        {What's redundant about your model is that when your valvarueiables are used as values, the "name" attribute is redundant, and when your valvarueiables are used as variables, the "type" attribute is redundant unless you're describing Category S languages.  I have no idea what neural nets have to do with this, or why you consider them to be "thinking".  The rest continues to smack of conflating the semantics of human languages with the semantics of programming languages.} 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I don't see redundancy. You'll need to be more specific on where exactly the duplication is. As far as neural nets, yes, I consider them to be "thinking". Oh shit, not a <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> mess over "think". Noooooooo! You guys are the ones using English to convey "semantics", not me. True, there may not be a lot of choice, but that's because semantics has yet to be scientifically tamed.

        If all values must include a type component, then your model of variable and its parts in D2 language is wrong, because there is no "type" component for D2. If the type association is so strong in human notion-land (semantics?), then that notion would supersede languages categories.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In category D2 languages, the type is the same for all values.  There's no need to put a reference to "string" in any value when a reference to "string" implicitly applies to every value.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One could say the same for just about any casual usage of "value". It's basically a wiggle-room clause to make anything be or have a "type" when you need a type to exist for your pet definitions/models.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You need a type to know what value a representation denotes.  For example, given a binary representation of 110110, what is the value?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yes, but in dynamic systems, such is often tracked <strong>via convention or design assumption</strong>, not explicit "type" indicators. Thus, a need for an explicit side component is not a necessity for being a called a "value". The assumption that something down the road knows how to interpret a series of bytes is a given, whether it be a machine or a human or both. But that down-the-road thing may be fairly remote so that it doesn't have to be kept WITH the "value". The tight coupling of your model is thus not tied to the actual rules or non-rules of value usage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>That's why "is associated with" is so often used in this context.  An implementation may separate the representation from the type, chronologically or physically or both.  However, every value must consist of a representation associated with a type, otherwise -- as I've shown above -- there is no way to interpret the representation.  Again, given a binary representation of 110110, what is the value?  The obvious -- and inevitable -- question you must ask, before you can answer my question, is "what is its type?"</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Okay, but it doesn't have to be part of a model because one may assume the app programmer or the reader or a distant machine will apply the correct "type" view.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The fact that a value needs a type </em>'somewhere<em>' is sufficient to warrant its inclusion in a model.  Whether the type reference is distant or nearby (how near is "distant", and how far is "nearby"?) is irrelevant.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How does that follow? If it's up to a remote entity that is outside of our model's scope to determine "type", why does it have to be in the model? If it's up to the reader to "give meaning to" a set of bytes, does that mean we have to model the human reader? Good luck with that.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I'm presuming you're modelling a programming language.  If you're modelling the transfer of an opaque data type -- like a BLOB in SQL terms -- from one system to another, that's something else entirely.  This has nothing to do with a human reader.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But in some cases, such as D2, the "types" are not part of the language itself, but rather part of the application code and/or the reader's head. Thus, the "type" falls out of the scope of what is being modeled. My original point is that a <em>close association</em> between "value" and "type" is not a necessity of "types" as used in the real world and colloquial-land. The association can be so remote that it stretches outside of the scope of something being modeled. Yes, in a specific language they may be closely associated, but that does not mean in general that a tight association is necessary. Developers and users often encounter "distant" associations of such, per form example. I'm talking about common usage of "values" here, not so much about interpreter modelling specifically. The output of the model may have to match the target language, but the internal guts of the model don't have to use the same type-related assumptions. <strong>Any type-related restrictions that apply to the target language don't necessarily apply to the internal guts of the model.</strong> For example, it's possible to emulate D1 languages using D2 languages.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Types as "part of the reader's head" are irrelevant.  In D2 languages, values have a representation that belongs to a type (which is typically "string") that can encode values of other types as literals.  The literals are "parsed out" of those values' representations on an operator-by-operator basis.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But your type-attribute version of "value" (such as found in the D1 version) is not needed to model that. Thus, a <strong>close</strong> association of "type" with "value" is not a necessity in general and is thus not a <strong>universal</strong> characteristic of "value". 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>In D1 languages, a value is modelled as a representation-type pair where the type may vary.  In D2 languages, a value is modelled as a representation-type pair where the type is constant.  Hence, in D2 languages an effective shorthand is to model a value as just its representation, because it's recognised that the type is always, say, a string.  "Close" (or "far") is a qualitative judgement that is impossible to measure and generally meaningless -- different interpreters model the relationship between (say) a representation and a type in various ways, but they're all indubitably an association between a relationship and a type.</em>

      <ul>

           Ohhhh, so NOW you are permitting shortcuts and factoring to legitimately exist. Gee, I wonder what else we can simplify for particular models. Hmmm, let's see what might have unnecessary nesting....
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           So I likewise have the "shortcut" of factoring your "value" and "variable" together to avoid a nested structure because it's the primary structure used by the model user and "values" of your style are rarely if ever used in the model.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>However, a problem with your "shortcut" is that "factoring 'value' and 'variable' together" conflates them.

           It's not fucking "nonsense"; YOUR canonical claims are nonsense because you have no rigorous proof of it, only vague hand-wavy repetitious English. "Values" may be a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> in some cases, but they are <strong>not required to exist</strong> to produce a matching I/O profile. (I suppose if a definition of "value" is made wide enough, then one can force its existence using word-play.)

In the context of popular imperative programming languages it's nonsense, because no popular imperative programming languages have functions that return variables.

           Your sample expression is probably a syntax error in the target languages. It can't happen (won't run) such that it's a non-issue; a test that proves nothing. (If you find a case where it works, let me know.) As far as "functions return references to variables", that can be modeled as putting the address of the target variable instance in the "primary" variable, which would be <strong>just like receiving an integer</strong> from the function. The indirection is processed/applied by whatever uses that variable/thing/object later on. It's not really different from your approach, except my version of your "value" has an extra attribute that allows it to be addressed (internally) like a variable. That extra attribute doesn't kill puppies. It's a <strong>super-set</strong> of your structure such that it can do at least the same thing and process such address indirection probably the same way you would. (I say "probably" because I'm not clear on some of the details of your model.)

           <em>Of course it's a syntax error.

           I'm not following what you are getting at. You are inventing features out of the blue. Functions returning variables automatically implies they should also accept "results" of expressions? How does that logically follow? A generator of something doesn't automatically have to be a taker also. My reply to the rest would resemble <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> tradeoff_rant_48.

The other thing is a question, asking you what you mean by "Functions generating variables is NOT the same as BEING variables".

           Okay, I think I now see what you are getting at. "foo() = a + 3" can be viewed as equivalent to "t=foo();t=a+3;" <strong>inside</strong> the model. That may be true, but the first version is still a syntax error for EXTERNAL code and thus could not happen in actual source. Yes, we can fiddle with the internals in ways the black box user couldn't. But that does not violate the matching criteria for models since we are not measuring fiddle-ability of internals by those can get at the guts of a particular model. You are only demonstrating ways to "tweak the guts". Is this a model user-access security question? (The model does not explicitly model the parsing step at this stage in order to keep it simple and focused. But the syntax processing stage is where such syntax errors would be normally be caught.)

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {No, if foo() returns a variable, we could assign to it because variables allow assignment, so "foo() = a + 3" would be valid in languages where foo() returns a variable.  It's not valid because foo() doesn't return a variable, it returns a value.  We can't assign to values.  The syntax checking in popular imperative programming languages merely reflects these semantics because it's convenient to eliminate such errors syntactically.  Using conventional semantics, "t=foo();t=a+3;" merely states that the value returned by foo() is assigned to 't', and then the value resulting from evaluating the expression 'a + 3' is assigned to 't'.}

           Error message note: I suppose one could claim error message text should be part of the "matching criteria", but generally they are not. If vender A's interpreter for Footran gives somewhat different error messages from vendor B's interpreter for Footran, generally that's not sufficient to disqualify equivalency. Now, one not flagging while the other does flag may be of concern. Anyhow, syntax error detection is outside of the scope of my model, regardless. I've seen cases where one version of an interpreter flags a pattern during runtime, while a future version flags it during "compiling" or parsing. But most don't use that as disqualification either. (Most error messages from the common languages are very crappy, I would note, probably reflecting internal guts out of laziness or speed/size tradeoffs.)

By the way, what in your model prevents "foo() = a + 3" from working?

Of course, since "a + 3" evaluates to a variable, we should be able to assign to it, too.  Shouldn't "a + 3 = foo()" also be legal in your model?  If not, why not?}

The packaging of these two concepts differs per model, and as long as these two things are "kept" for a while in some manner and are accessible to the model's guts, the models have sufficient info to "do their job".

        And most programmers (and form users) barely notice a difference between D1 and D2 in practice such that it's not going to significantly shape their vocabulary interpretations.

        Wrong. That value thing is your specific model's requirement.

      <p>
        They DO return "values" in my model, but they also return other things. Also, I don't necessarily claim such statements are a universal truth; they could be model-specific. Without an established and clear definition, it's hard to say.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't claim such statements are a universal truth either.  Note how I've always been careful to use the phrase "in popular imperative programming languages" because in those, functions always return values, variables always store values, and expressions always evaluate to values.  I don't know of any imperative programming languages (popular or otherwise) that don't embody this, but if you feel "popular imperative programming languages" is too vague, think of it as being the top 15 programming languages on the </em><a href="TiobeIndex.html">TiobeIndex</a> as of November 2013.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Even in the top dynamic languages, "value" is not objectively and clearly defined. Source code has no direct "values" (per syntax diagrams etc.), and so if they exist, they are either internal to the implementation (which is somewhat arbitrary), or an abstract idea in human heads.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Remember, every language requires both syntax and semantics.  Without both, there is no language.  "Values" may not have specific syntactic elements (though literals denote values), but they have specific semantic elements.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I would test that claim, but I cannot find where the "semantics" are to yank them out and watch it "run" without them. That's not sarcasm either: one of the best tests for the claim "X requires Y to work" is to yank out the Y and see if it stops working.
      </p>

        <em>This can be done trivially.  Download the </em><a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>, install the source code under Eclipse and verify that it runs by launching Rel3DBrowser:DBrowserWithoutMonitor.  Then go into each of the low-level virtual machine operators in Rel3Server:ca.mb.armchair.rel3.vm.instructions.* and replace the current definition of "execute(Context context) with "public final void execute(Context context) {}".  That eliminates the semantics by turning every language statement into "<a href="NoOp.html">NoOp</a>".  Run it and see what happens.  Hint: When you run scripts, no databases will get updated, no files will be opened and read or written, no output will be produced, nothing will happen.

      <p>
        You are yanking out the algorithms, not semantics. We already agree they need algorithms to work. Your arrow is bigger than the target. Can you leave the algorithms in and yank out the semantics separately? (And I won't let you trick me into installing <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>. Nice try.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Algorithms are used to implement language semantics.  In the </em><a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>, algorithms implement the <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> language semantics.  By "yanking out the algorithms" that implement the semantics, we remove the semantics.  The language semantics are reflected in the interpreter code by the names of the machine instructions, e.g., OpAdd, OpRestrict, OpJump, OpConcatenate, and so on.  The semantics of OpAdd or "+", for example, is "numeric addition on integer values" in English (that's what it means to us) and it's implemented in the "OpAdd" class of the ca.mb.armchair.rel3.vm.instructions.core package by the following (simplified, for illustration) algorithm: "v1 ← pop(); v2 ← pop(); v3 ← do_integer_addition(v1, v2); push(v3));"  That algorithm is what "+" "means" (I'm using a deliberate anthropomorphic term here) to the machine.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought "semantics" were at a higher abstraction level than PUSH, POP, and JUMP instructions. That's arbitrary (non-unique) implementation detail. Let me put it this way; the kind of semantics were are interested in for <em>this</em> topic are those that typical programmers share and use, not chip-level issues. Let's not drag chips into this if we don't have to, it's messy enough as is. And why do you have to deliberately anthropomorphize it? Perhaps because (non-AI) machines don't have notions and ideas? And if they did, how do we measure it, such as detecting its presence or absence or equivalence?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Semantics are independent of the abstraction level.  Semantics describe "what"; algorithms describe "how".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We've been over this already, "What" is vague in this context.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In this particular context, I've been deliberately vague.  In the context of actual language statements, it's not vague at all.  "while (p) {}" is a loop.  That's "what" it is; there's nothing vague about that.  "How" involves details of the mechanisms of expression evaluation, branching, etc.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Is" implies some kind of equivalency, or at least membership to a designated class/category/type. What objective equivalency/membership-verification device are you employing here?
      </p>
      <p>
        [Looking at the language definitions, of course. Can you find a popular language where "while (p) {}" isn't a loop? I tried to and couldn't.]
      </p>
      <p>
        If one builds a regex-like tool to classify such syntax patterns as "loops", does that mean it's using the "same semantics" as programmer heads (or your head)?
      </p>
      <p>
        {I don't understand the question.  What does "programmer heads" have to do with programming language semantics?}
      </p>
      <p>
        What is performing your "isn't a loop" test above?
      </p>
      <p>
        {I'd expect it to be the test code that verifies whether or not the code inside '{}' is repeated as long as 'p' is true, but you can also examine the language documentation or the source code for the interpreter or compiler to see what it's meant to do.}
      </p>
      <p>
        An objective loop detector algorithm? That'd be cool if you can pull it off without relying on syntax. But if we are talking about "typical Algol-style languages", then syntax is probably sufficient, and humans can also use such "historical" syntax patterns to say "yes, it's a loop". They don't necessarily need higher-level thinking to pull it off. In other words, certain syntax patterns are usually associated with loops out of tradition and convention. To "fail" your test above, somebody would have to decide to violate convention. There is no rational purpose to do such, other than jack around with people or hide something.
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's not a loop detector, but simple code -- written in the language under test -- to verify whether it's looping or not.  The only reason "typical Algol-style languages" are "typical" is because they share both common syntax <strong>and</strong> common semantics.  If they shared only common syntax, we'd be talking about how exactly the same statements do completely different things.  We'd be asking why "a = foo() + b" assigns the result of invoking 'foo' plus 'b' to 'a' in C#, but rotates object 'a' about the 'foo' axis by 'b' degrees in <hypothetical but imaginary popular imperative programming language 'x'>.  Therefore, the convention to which you refer is both syntactic <strong>and</strong> semantic.}
      </p>
      <p>
        But this "semantics" is a notion-y human head thing. It's not an objectively dissect-able entity. There are also processing algorithms/rules that are typically associated with such syntax patterns. But to call that "semantics" may be a reach. It could be merely tradition/habit. A tool is built that way because somebody started building it that way in the past and people liked it enough to keep using the same syntax-to-algorithm patterns. It's an association between syntax patterns and processing algorithms that humans either like or live with due to comfort or something else. <strong>To say it "means" something may be giving it too much credit.</strong> It may merely be a useful association habit. To say it "means" moving foo to bar or whatever may not be necessary or accurate: people see the pattern and associate a reaction based on that pattern and past experience. It does not mean they are translating it into a clear set of steps or higher-level meaning any more than we recognize a cat when we see a cat even though we are at a loss to precisely and completely describe how we mentally do that and tell it apart from possums or mountain lions.
      </p>
      <p>
        {No, you're insisting that "semantics" is a notion-y head thing.  Semantics defines, for example, that a variable is a language construct that can be assigned values and that has a name.  A programmer implements the semantics of variables in code by constructing mechanisms (using algorithms, yes) to assign values to variables, retrieve values from variables, and give variables names, and then associates aspects of those mechanisms with language syntax.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Like I said, human mental semantics SHAPES such algorithms, but that is not the same as semantics "being in" the interpreter. Influence != Equivalence. And I don't see how your (non-unique) English version of an assignment statements supports your claim. You keep giving those English snippets, as if repetition will convince me. To me it's just a lossy translation of your <strong>personal</strong> pet head model into English.  That's all; nothing more. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        {Would you prefer that I used some formal notation instead of English?  A formal notation would eliminate possible ambiguity, but for informal discussions -- as opposed to mathematical reasoning -- English is generally friendlier.  Semantics are "in" the interpreter; there is invariably (out of necessity -- semantics become code in real interpreters and compilers) a correspondence between semantics and the code that implements them.  My English version of an assignment statement is the only way assignment is defined in every popular imperative programming language.  If you disagree, please provide a counter-example.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I did provide counter examples already. You ignored them, multiple times. Your English version is not the only way to describe such. If you mean it's the only way "defined", then show where this canonical definition is, beyond anecdotes. And if you use a formal notation, you will need to demonstrate it's truly capturing "semantics" and not something else (such as an algorithm or observations about an algorithm).
      </p>
      <p>
        {What "counter examples" did you provide to show that there are different interpretations of assignment?  In particular, how do they contradict my descriptions?}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The ones where I showed that the word "value" was not needed. And I never claimed they "contradicted" your descriptions. Having more than one way to say or model something does not by itself create a contradiction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Omitting some detail does not mean they have different semantics.  In "a = foo() + b", we can say the value returned by the invocation of foo() is added to the value in variable 'b' and the resulting value stored in variable 'a'.  Or, we can say 'foo' plus 'b' is assigned to 'a'.  The semantics are the same.  They differ only in detail of description.  Different semantics would be something like "a = foo() + b" means rotate object 'a' about the axis labelled 'foo' by 'b' degrees.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not "omitting details", it's not filling in blanks with <strong>arbitrary</strong> or model-specific terms. One can get away from model-specific terms by using pronouns or the like: "The variable stores the stuff generated by an expression". There is no universal rule that says we MUST call that stuff "value". (I like "stuff" over "thing" or "object" because we don't have to specify whether it's singular or plural. In my model the "stuff" is plural.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {There's no reason to use a vague and colloquial term like "stuff" when the conventional term for the concept we're discussing is "value".  It's true that there's no universal rule that says we MUST call it a "value", but it's usually called a "value", so "value" is what I call it.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I would agree, but when making a more rigorous model, the fact that its overloaded can create problems and another word may be needed, as already described many times. (You should have anticipated that if you had a decent or unbiased memory.) "Value" would be a better word for you "representation" also, but you "spent" that money on something else. Tradeoffs.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {There's no "tradeoff" here.  Dealing with an "overloaded" term is trivial: simply make it clear what definition is being used.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If an explanation can be considered sufficient to "fix" awkward areas, why are you complaining about my "value" usage or non-usage? It smells like a double standard.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I have no objection to clearly-defined terms used according to convention, and/or in technically-correct fashion.  I object to the fact that you use overloaded terminology -- like "tag" and "anonymous constant" and "hidden variable" -- without any definition and in ways that do not accord with the usual applications of these relatively familiar phrases.  And I object to your conflation of values and variables.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Value" is overloaded, as are a good many terms colloquially used to describe code and programming. And almost any model is going to have model-specific parts with model-specific names (such as "D2"). I agree I have been sloppy/inconsistent with some of the internal names, partly because I haven't decided on the best words to use yet. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And the "rotate" kind of approach may work for somebody who <strong>thinks mechanically</strong>. Maybe Charles Babbage thought of assignments in a kind of mechanical way: gears, sprockets, pegs, etc. bumping, pushing, and influencing each other. <strong>It's a valid model</strong>, I won't penalize him. (It's not well-suited for today's equipment, but no model will fit every era's equipment well.) -t
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I think you may have misunderstood the example.  "Rotate" is not meant to be some alternative interpretation of assignment.  The "'a = foo() + b' means rotate object 'a' about the axis labelled 'foo' by 'b' degrees" example is intended to illustrate semantics in which 'a' isn't a variable, '=' isn't assignment, 'foo()' isn't a function invocation, and '+' isn't addition.  In other words, it's semantically different from our usual interpretation of the "a = foo() + b;" syntax.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This gets back into the problem with the word "is". One can use a mechanical model of a variable in their head and successfully reason and process such statements just like one use to the school-paper version. Who is to say their mechanical version of "variable" is "wrong"? If they describe that assignment, they may say something like, "rotate sprocket to position "a", triggering the peg matcher, which makes the latch drop when the accumulator is finished...". If you want to say the semantics are still equivalent, you need to describe specifically HOW one tells they are equivalent.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I think you're still misunderstanding the example.  "Rotate" is not meant to represent "a mechanical model of a variable".  It's not assignment at all.  It has nothing to do with assignment.  The 'a' in 'a = foo() + b' isn't a variable, it's something else, and '=' isn't assignment, etc.  The only thing 'a = foo() + b' has in common with its equivalent in, say, C# or Java is that it has the same syntax as "assign the result of adding foo and b to a", but it is something else entirely.}

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I am saying that one could use a mechanical view, regardless of what you intended to mean. Is a mechanical view still the same "semantics"? If so, how does one tell? It's back to the problem of measuring and comparing "semantics". It's something that has not been scientifically isolated so far.

      </ul>

        <li>
           This is not clear to me. And I am not talking about "misinterpretation". A mechanical view is not necessarily "misinterpretation". Put another way, one can look at a math expression, and think of the evaluation process/steps/meaning in mechanical terms, after spending a good while with machinery (or having a natural affinity to it).

"Semantics" is not directly measurable, but "behavior" is such that it's better to talk about "similar behavior" rather than inject "meaning" into machines.

           I "ignore" them because they are not scientifically measurable/measured so far.

           {Ignoring semantics because they "are not scientifically measurable/measured" is peculiar; it dispenses with a fundamental -- and mathematically rigorous -- component of programming languages in favour of what appears to be a portion of natural science.  I don't think "linear algebra" or "trigonometry" can be "scientifically measurable/measured" in the manner you suggest either, and yet they're as fundamental to computer graphics as semantics are to programming languages.

           If you view trig as a tool, then you can test it as a tool. If you represent it in a specific notation, you can say things about it in terms of that notation. Nothing similar has been done with "semantics" yet.

           One can analyze syntax, yes, but that does not by itself mean one is also analyzing semantics in the process. "Meaning" is in human minds and has not been scientifically tamed to any detail. That's the bottom line.

           You again appear to be anthropomorphizing machines. They don't have a "point of view". Interpreters are just dumb "savants" that follow specific instructions for changing RAM. There may be common pattern(s) to the I/O profile of language interpreters for the target language set, but that pattern is not necessarily "semantics", as I interpret the word (and probably many others). I'm tired of arguing over vocabulary. Unless you can scientifically tame and measure your version of "semantics", it's just a vague battle with vague casualties that won't go anywhere.

        As a though experiment, it may be possible for the interpreter/model to not evaluate expressions until it absolutely has to. In other words, store the expression itself (or partially evaluated sections of it), and collect up (append or prepend, perhaps with parentheses) such expression until the last possible moment, perhaps at the output operation. There may be no need to finish each statement at the end of a given statement.  <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>? -t

      <p>
        <em>Sure </em><a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> is fine; it's fundamental to certain <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> languages like <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>.  It's trickier in imperative programming languages, because side effects may require the developer to consider the effects of <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>.  Otherwise, it's invisible to the programmer.<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For example, many DBMS engines use a form </em><a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> to only retrieve rows or tuples as requested by the query result consumer, so that (for example) "SELECT * FROM VastTableOfDoom" will not retrieve any more rows than are asked for by the process that sent the query.

If that process only displays ten rows (say, on a Web page), then only ten rows will ever be retrieved from the DBMS and its VastTableOfDoom.  That's also true of a query like "SELECT * FROM VastTable1, VastTable2", which is an outer join that could produce a <a href="RecordSet.html">RecordSet</a> of COUNT(VastTable1) * COUNT(VastTable2) rows, except that if the query process only ever displays five rows, the outer join will only ever process and produce five rows.<em></em>

        Can you use those to prove there is some kind of universal or canonical "semantics" in typical dynamic languages? Remember, you cannot just show one possible "implementation" (for lack of a better word), but must also demonstrate your claimed patterns are either the only possible semantic patterns, or are those commonly used by regular developers (who many don't know or care how interpreters are actually implemented, I shall remind you).

        Regarding <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a>, see <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> Hoare_Horror. And the bottom question is trying to flip the burden on me, which isn't going to work. The default is not that semantics are the same. I have no way to rigorously compare "semantics" any more than I can compare "hate" in one man's mind to "hate" in another man's mind. Human ideas have have not been universally codified so far. If you claim they are the same then rigorously show they are the same. Otherwise, the default is "unknown".

        Semantics outside the head <strong>cannot currently be scientifically analyzed</strong> in a rigorous way, REGARDLESS of whether it exists or not. (Same probably applies inside the head also). Thus, to say anything <em>specific</em> about these possible in-machine semantics is likely futile. IF you find a way to scientifically isolate and analyze and objectively compare in-machine semantics of interpreters, you may deserve a Nobel/Turing prize. Until then, stop pushing this fuzzy issue. We are perhaps wondering off topic anyhow; what does this have to do with "values"?

      <p>
        <em>Semantics can currently be scientifically analysed, in a rigorous way, using </em><a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        You said the same thing earlier re "obvious". I won't repeat my response to it. If you can demonstrate commonality using <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a>, please do. Fuzzy words aren't cutting it. And remember that the existence of a <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> for such by itself does not establish commonality; it may be one "encoding" among many possible solutions for the same translation/problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        [The existence of other possible solutions is a non-issue. If there exists a single semantic for all of them, that is sufficient to prove (you know, that item at the top of the <a href="EvidenceTotemPole.html">EvidenceTotemPole</a>) that there is a common semantic. All of the languages that I know of (c, c++, c#, php, etc.) use the same semantics for those constructs. Can you come up with any that don't?]
      </p>
      <p>
        For the sake of argument, I'll agree for now that you showed that a common semantic CAN represent our target language set. However, that does not by itself prove that there are NO ALTERNATIVE semantic models that can do it ALSO. Thus, if your semantic model has your kind of "values", that alone does not mean that all possible semantic models have your kind of values. This is what I mean by the "uniqueness requirement". Put a slightly different way, showing that semantic model A is valid for set X does not rule out the existence of another semantic model B that is also valid for set X. What you need to show is that ALL POSSIBLE (valid) semantic models for language set X have feature V (V = your style of "value", or whatever else you claim is canonical or necessary). -t
      </p>
      <p>
        [We haven't claimed that there are no alternative semantic models. There are, in fact, infinitely many. But, they will all be equivalent to the common semantic (just like 1+1 is equivalent to 0+2 by virtue of evaluating to the number 2). So your insistence that we prove uniqueness is just a <a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Arrrg. Fine, then <strong>prove equivalence</strong>. I shouldn't have to ask. We have an objective (or agreed-upon) way to do it with real-number expressions, so make/find/invent the equivalent equivalence-finder for "semantic math". You accuse me of <a href="RedHerring.html">RedHerring</a>, so I'm accusing you of delay tactics. You act like you opened Pandora's Semantic Box, but don't know how to use it right, inventing layers or excuses and what-if's to delay. (Technically, "Feature V" could be "equivalence of your Value thingy". I didn't rule that out above so technically I didn't exclude equivalence. If you want to get anal...) Let me offer an improved version:
      </p>
      <code>
        What you need to show is that ALL POSSIBLE (valid) semantic models for <br/>
        language set X have feature V or its equivalent.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        [Actually, we don't have a unique way to do real-number expressions. The two most common are Cauchy sequences and Dedekind cuts. There are infinitely many other ways to do it that we haven't bothered to name as well. They are all equivalent in that they assign the same truth values to sentences in the language of real numbers. This is, in fact, exactly what is happening with the semantic models for computer languages. As for your proof, in order for two semantics models to be models of the same language, they must give they same results. Hence, they must be equivalent. QED.]
      </p>
      <p>
        What is "same truth values"? I've been out of college for a long time, so have to ask such things.  Re: "In order for two semantics models to be models of the same language, they must give they same results." -- I don't disagree, but how does that relate to our discussion? We need to demonstrate equivalent semantics, not equivalent languages. Or perhaps I don't know what "they" refers to. Anyhow, for arithmetic, most humans with some education have agreed on a standard notation and "processing rules" (for lack of a better term) for this notation. And we've agreed on what "equivalance" means in that notation such that we have an agreed-upon "algorithm(s)" that tells us that "a + a" is equivalent to "2a". More specifically, the notation's rules allow us to convert a+a into 2a and back unambiguously. To do the same thing for semantics, first you need to establish or find an agreed-upon notation and it's rules, and then us it to show that all target languages have equivalence, or at least equivalent parts (such as your version of "value").
      </p>
      <p>
        [The "same truth values" means that the truth values are exactly the same. If one model says 1+1=2 is true, then the other model, to be equivalent, must also say 1+1=2 is true. Similarly with false statements. (Since there aren't any other truth values, we are done.) As for your notational rant, we haven't all agreed on a standard notation, we use a wide variety of notations. E.g. I + I = II. 1 + 1 = 2. One plus one equals two. etc. In addition, there is no need for an agreed-upon "algorithm" that tells us that "a + a" is equivalent to "2a". "2a" is defined, by fiat, to be "a+a". It is, to bring this back to the larger discussion, the semantics of "2a" that allow us to go back and forth between "2a" and "a + a". To show that different semantic models are equivalent, we only need to show that they give the same answer to question about semantics. I.e. What I showed in my previous response.]
      </p>
      <p>
        There's seems to be ambiguity about whether we are comparing equivalency of semantic models, languages (syntax), and algorithms. Maybe we need to invent a pseudo-notation where we can state rules something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        if semanticsAreEquiv(A, B) And languageHasSemantics(lang01, A) And Foo(lang02) Then<br/>
        print("Languages Are Equiv:", lang01, lang02)<br/>

           <em>No, I mean computer architecture.  Notions of "value" and "type" are fundamental to computer architecture.  Machine registers store values.  Machine opcodes operate on values of specific types.  And so on.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Without a clear definition of both of those, I cannot evaluate your claim. The machine-level language certainly has operators that operate on different types (2 byte integer, 4 byte integer, double precision, etc.), but they don't manage or enforce them; it's up to the programmer or compiler etc. Machine language is not Php. There are similarities, yes, but still different kinds of things. Php could be implemented with Tinkertoys or Rube Goldberg toaster parts. One shouldn't assume a programmer has knowledge of machine language anyhow. It's handy knowledge to have, but not a necessity (except maybe if authors choose to base their documentation around such idioms, but that's an arbitrary choice influenced by tradition.)

      <ul>

           <em>The definitions can be found in any standard text on computer architecture.  Type management or enforcement is not particularly relevant; note that Forth has no </em><a href="TypeChecking.html">TypeChecking</a>, and in C/C++ its straightforward to explicitly override it.  Obviously, machine language is not PHP, but the terminology used at the lowest machine level -- values and types -- applies equally to higher-level languages.<em></em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The definitions are vague. We've been over that already. And I'm not sure they are fully comparable. They have some conceptual overlap (as best I can conjure from my mind), but that doesn't mean "applies equally".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>They are not only comparable, they are the same.  Values and types are values and types, regardless of language level.  They may vary in how they're exposed, accessed, or defined, but they are conceptually the same.</em>

           That's a rather non-specific answer. One can observe and "get a feel" for something, but feelings/notions are difficult to communicate across heads.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It is a rather non-specific answer, but an accurate one.  By studying values and types in programming languages, you soon appreciate that they're they're the same in everything from assembly language to popular 3GLs.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Non-specific but accurate? Even if true, it's not a useful answer for our purposes. We cannot scientifically analyze ideas/feelings/notions locked away in heads in any detail.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>There's nothing here about ideas/feelings/notions.  It's about language semantics, which are defined and documented by humans sufficiently to be implemented in interpreters and compilers.  Ideas/feelings/notions may be part of the motivation for designing a language, but they play no role in the specification of a language.  The specification of a language defines syntax and semantics.  Examining the syntax and semantics of assembly language and 3GLs reveals that their fundamental notions of value and variable are the same, modulo some representational issues.  For example, the type of a value is almost invariably assumed in assembly language, because there is no </em><a href="TypeChecking.html">TypeChecking</a>.  It's still (obviously) a value, and published texts refer to it as that.<em></em>

           <em>Yes, it does.  Most language references do not conflate values and variables.  The PHP manual is a notable exception, freely conflating values and variables in a confusing (and occasionally misleading) fashion.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't "conflate" them. They are not the same thing IN my model. YOU conflate them because you try to interpret "value" in the way you want. (Since "value" is overloaded, neither is clearly "wrong" based on common word usage.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Values and variables are distinct in my descriptions, so how do I conflate them?  Values and variables use the same structure in your model, so how do you not conflate them?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They are distinct in my model also. You conflate them when describing my model's usage by using your own personal definition of "value" to re-label the parts. And don't give me the tired line of "that's the way the <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>/Documentation Gods do it also", or I'll kick your cats in the nuts with pointy boots. My model does not contradict informal descriptions (for app programmers), and the implementation-centric documentation is for a specific implementation, not necessarily the "proper" or unique mental model. The informal doc doesn't talk about stacks for example, but the implementer doc does. Thus, existence of a usage of <strong>"value" in implementer docs can't be said to be canonical any more than stacks are.</strong> Usage of "value" is vague or overloaded in app coder docs, and implementation-specific in implementer docs. You can't seem to have your cake and eat it also.

           <em>Dude!  What is it with you and my cats?  They don't even </em>'have<em>' nuts, given that one has been neutered and the other is female.  Your model conflates values and variables unnecessarily and pointlessly, and your claim of "simplicity" by avoiding nesting is specious at best.  There's no evidence that programmers, even weak ones, have difficulty with "nesting".  Your choice of XML as a notation, in fact, completely eradicates this as an argument, because XML is almost invariably nested, usually to multiple levels.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As already described, it does NOT conflate them. Your claim is false. You are using and repeating personal definition favoritism out of stubbornness. If I used your definition/description of "value" in my model, then it may indeed be "conflation", BUT I AM NOT USING YOURS. And the rest are issues I've been over at least twice, probably around 5 times. There will be no 6.

           You are playing word-games here. You are using your pet definition of "value" to compare.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You are defining value as "the structure that expression(s) return", it appears. <strong>You made that definition up</strong>. I shall not accept made-up definitions as "canonical". Some personal or writer's notions may reflect that, but it's not universal, as "value" is a hazy, overloaded word. As a working assumption,  I do agree that expressions "return values", as they do in my model (and return other things), but your addition of "structure" is contrived. -t

           Incorrect. Not the way you stated it, no. That may be your personal interpretation of what you read, but that does not make that particular wording canonical.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>No, it is correct.  A value is always a representation associated with a type.  I can't think of a case where a value isn't that.  Without the type, we can't interpret the representation.  Without the representation, there is no data with which to perform operations on.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Like I said before, it *is* associated with a type in my model also. And being "associated with" is not necessarily a "structure". You are being waffly and playing fast and loose with language.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"Associated with" is shown with a notation.  One way to notate it is to use a structure.  The problem with your model is that when you associate a type with a representation in your model, you use that same notation to represent variables, in which it is inappropriate to associate a type.}</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I agree that "one way to notate it is to use a structure" but it's not the only way and thus should be removed from your definition as an absolute requirement. As far as the tag model, if we are talking about YOUR version of "value" (which differs from mine), my model does not have such. There is nothing to conflate if there is no second thing to be conflated with. It's like doing the tango with yourself. (Well, you probably do, but that's TMI.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>My "absolute requirement" is not the structure, but the clear indication that a value is a representation associated with a type.  The only place your model clearly associates a value (for your use of "value", I use the term 'representation') with a type is in your definition of a variable.  That is contradictory to conventional understanding of dynamically-typed languages.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As it is worded above with "structure", it's wrong then. In my XML, the type is "clearly associated with" the value. "Associated" does not require being on the same level or a lower level of nesting/containment. If you want to put in a level requirement, please do, but I'll hold you to prove such is a canonical rule instead of just claiming it's canonical or common. Claims are worthless without evidence. I already know you THINK it's canonical. You don't have to keep saying it; just prove it this time. Repetition may have worked on your mother, but it does not work on me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, but in your XML, isn't the type "clearly associated with" the variable in exactly the same way it is "clearly associated with" the value, because the same structure is used for both variables and values?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Exactly the same way"? Not sure what you mean there. And, yes, associations don't have to be unique. If you want to refine your "rule" to exclude other family members, be my guest, with the usual caveats. As written, I don't violate your "associate" rule (before the "structure" addition).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I explain "exactly the same way" in the same sentence.  You use the same structure for variables and values, right?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No. Do you mean the equivalence of YOUR version of "value"? My model has no directly counterpart to that, thus there are not two things to compare.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Let me ask a different way:  You use the same structure for mutable slots (aka variables) and the result of evaluating an expression, right?</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yes.

        <li>
           No, it implies nothing. We've been over this already. "Outside" code does not have access to internal variables.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>But it's the "inside" code (i.e., inside the interpreter) that has equal access to both variables and the results of evaluating expressions.  Doesn't that risk unintentionally mutating the result of evaluating an expression?</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We've been over this already. It's a "toy" model for experimentation: we want the parts to be easy to fiddle with, and kept simple; thus simplicity trumps safety.

        Then mine them for the best definitions of words such as "type" and "value", and bring them forth to this wiki to be analyzed.

      <p>
        I thought you admitted that you only target the most popular dynamic languages, and thus ignore possibilities such as "soft" polymorphism in D1 languages? And then I pointed out that I do consider such possibilities because domain-specific and product-embedded dynamic languages are relatively likely to be encountered even though they don't make the top of the charts. (I'm not certain the popular D1 languages don't use soft polymorphism, but won't make an issue of it here.) If you want to agree that our models are for different purposes or language sets, that's fine. I have no problem with plurality of models.

        {I'd be curious to know how you think programming languages actually implement values, types and variables, as opposed to how you'd prefer to model them.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Why does it matter? We have enough issues on our plate such that we shouldn't invent more without reasons. I'm not attempting to mirror actual interpreters, at least not as a primary goal. They are designed for machine efficiency, not necessarily human grokking efficiency. Different primary goals.

        {I think it might significantly help me to understand and appreciate your model, and its justifications, if I understand your interpretation of values, variables and types.}
      </p>
      <p>
        My interpretation of implementation? Or how I personally prefer to think of them? Those may be two different things. In my opinion, it is probably not good to get hung up on such. The tag model does not require a solid definition of any of those; the names used for the parts are merely <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>s for the purpose of the model and are not intended to fully match actual usage (and I doubt any model could match 100%). 
      </p>
      <p>
        {If your "interpretation of implementation" and "how [you] personally prefer to think of them" differs, then it would be most helpful -- and appreciated -- if you would discuss both.}
      </p>
      <p>
        My description of the tag model is pretty close to how I think of the processing now. Whether it was always that way, I don't know. I don't remember. But in general I mentally use or start with an open-ended structure(s) something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        <object name="..." scope="..." type_tag="..." value="..." etc="..."><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A given situation uses attributes it needs and doesn't use those it doesn't need. That way, I don't have to pre-classify everything. Trying to classify and label everything can drive one nuts and is often confusing, unnecessary, and inflexible. (They may nest as needed, such as for arrays.) If I was going to implement it with machine speed and efficiency in mind, THEN I'd try to classify the entities involved into distinct categories and make hard-wired structures. And the resulting structure/entity names and layouts may differ per language.
      </p>
      <p>
        {That certainly addresses "how [you] personally prefer to think of them".  How about the "interpretation of implementation"?  Do you believe that is how interpreters and compilers work internally?}
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure I understand the question, because I didn't describe an actual implementation, but rather the process of going from a draft design or a non-resource-optimized design to one that is. In practice they usually probably push your style of "value" on stacks, but I am not an expert in that area.
      </p>
      <p>
        {I originally said, "I think it might significantly help me to understand and appreciate your model, and its justifications, if I understand your interpretation of values, variables and types."

You responded with your "<object name=...>" example.  I said, "That certainly addresses 'how [you] personally prefer to think of them'.  How about the 'interpretation of implementation'?  Do you believe that is how interpreters and compilers work internally?"  Does that clarify the question?  I'm asking you how you think interpreters and compilers implement values, variables, and types.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think about it much. I'm happy with a predictional model. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {That's fine.  Think about it for a moment, and then let me know how you think interpreters and compilers implement values, variables, and types.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Why should it matter? They are designed and tuned for machine efficiency and thus may not represent a model convenient for human dissection. In fact there is <strong>no reason for an actual interpreter to follow human notions</strong> whatsoever if mirroring such notions results in a performance cost compared with the alternative. (Assuming error messages are still useful to humans.) I've written lab-toy stack-based expression interpreters in college (integers only to keep is simple), and they didn't match the tag model, but again I don't see how that matters. Stacks are not "natural" to humans for expression evaluation and so I don't see anybody arguing to keep them in a type-analysis model, unless one's goal is learn how to make production interpreters.

      <p>
        Like said, I don't think that much about how they actually do it. I will agree they probably model "values" similar to how you do it, because it's machine-resource-friendly to do it that way, as already explained.

        <strong>Assumption of Notion Existence</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the sake of argument, even if there were a very common and solid notion of your flavor of "value", what's wrong with breaking that notion to simplify a particular model? We can add disclaimers to make sure the deviance is known. Is it too "sacred" or important to dispense with? Road maps quite often dispense with actual stuff to simplify their model of roads. Light-colored cement roads are still printed in the same dark ink as dark roads, for example. And the road width is often not to scale. Plus, it's a compromised projection of a round surface into flat paper. (Rounded paper is not impossible, just impractical.) The map reader knows the maps lies about many things, but accepts those lies to keep the map easier to read for the purpose of navigating roads. <strong>The road-map lies to tune it to a specific purpose.</strong> Why can't a "type" model do that same?
      </p>
      <p>
        {Your model's conflation of values and variables is complex (your model demonstrates <a href="StampCoupling.html">StampCoupling</a>), confusing, contrary to common understanding, and implies that your value/variable conflation can be assigned to in contexts where assignment is pointless.}
      </p>
      <p>
        You keep claiming it's more confusing etc. than your model, and I call bullshit. Repetition of bullshit doesn't make it non-bullshit. You just got used to a particular (machine-centric) model and mistake it for "common understanding". As far as <a href="StampCoupling.html">StampCoupling</a>, it's only a suggestion, not a "hard" rule, and needs to be weighed against other design "suggestions" and techniques. (See also <a href="WaterbedTheory.html">WaterbedTheory</a> and <a href="CodeChangeImpactAnalysis.html">CodeChangeImpactAnalysis</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        {Even if we accept <a href="StampCoupling.html">StampCoupling</a>, it's still confusing to treat values and variables as the same, and it implies that your value/variable conflation can be assigned to in contexts where assignment is pointless.}
      </p>
      <p>
        But I don't have your kind of "values", so there is nothing to treat as the same. Thus, there is no stamp to couple. An analogy would be Dell using its own computers for its own employees. It "externally" sells PC's to the public, but it can use those same PC models internally for its own employees and operations. (Sometimes this is called <a href="EatYourOwnDogFood.html">EatYourOwnDogFood</a>.) The public can't touch Dell's internal PC's because they are in locked or secure buildings. This kind of variable usage has the advantage over your "value" of having a model-user-viewable reference name, which makes examining sub-parts easier. And it avoids the need for a nested structure; which appears to be poor normalization (at least in this model, which has no stacks etc.). As far as "it implies", that happens in your head, not reality, and probably not in others. I have no idea what whacky notion made you dream up the "foo()=x" scenario. And even in the rare case the model user smoked the same mushrooms as you to get the same idea and jury-rigged it in, it doesn't do anything; it's a glorified no-op. (Well, I suppose with enough mushrooms one could define and implement reverse assignments to mean "reformat the hard-drive and display an animated GIF of green monkeys flying out of Batman's ass". Oh wait, it's a <em>reverse</em> assignment, so the monkeys should fly <em>into</em> his ass. Semantics.)
      </p>
      <p>
        {You may not have my kind of "values", but you use the same structure to represent variables and what is returned by functions and what expressions evaluate to.  Since variables can be assigned to, and since you're using the same structure to model variables as you use to model both what is returned by functions and what expressions evaluate to, then it follows that you can assign to that which is returned by functions and you can assign to that which expressions evaluate to.  If you can assign to that which is returned by functions, and assign to that which expressions evaluate to, then it follows logically that the assignment "foo() = 3;" and the assignment "1 + 2 = 5;" are both valid.}
      </p>

        You are lying or delusional. My model is not forced to do that. Stop being stupid already; I'm tired of debating such a preposterous and distracting claim. There is no gun to its head to force it accept and/or process such syntax, nor God of Logic forcing it to via lightning bolts. Your head is playing tricks on you. <strong>Reboot your head and try it again.</strong>

        {No one said your model is "forced" to do anything.  What your model does is permit assignment in places where assignment wouldn't normally be permitted.

It's true that there is "no gun to its head to force it [to] accept and/or process such syntax", but there's nothing to prevent it, either.}

           It does NOT "permit meaningless or pointless things" unless you let it. Trivially changed? How exactly? Note that every model/implementation is probably "fragile" in different ways, meaning small changes can result in big problems, but in different areas. It's sort of like human genes in that in certain genes, small mutations make for big birth defects. I doubt any design is free from such; it's a matter of trading one fragile spot for another. Perhaps a current design can be shored up via redundancy, but then it's also harder to change when you want to change it, and is more bloated.

           Okay, the constructor-only approach is reasonable for a <em>production</em> system, but this is not a production system. We want to leave them mutable so experiments can be done, and we want them (internally) addressable similar to a variable so experiments can reference them. Efficiency and safety are <em>not</em> the primary goals. Further, we <strong>can make them immutable without nesting them</strong>. For example, we could add another attribute called "mutable", or perhaps "object-type" and have the object type enumerations of "external-variable", "internal-variable", and maybe "constant". (I'd call the XML entity "object" in a fancier model, not "variable", per below.) But in my opinion that's <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> for the purpose of the model. <strong>Safety equipment is purposely removed to keep the guts simple and visible and tweak-able.</strong> Based on experience with your personality(s) on this wiki, I expect you to balk loudly at this decision.

           Yes, the Tag Model and it's ilk are indeed a "lab toy" for experimentation and study. I thought I've made that clear already. I've already agreed that your version of "value" is probably more efficient for machine-centric production interpreters. For one, stacks don't need explicit "value ID's" because they use stack positioning to "line up" the parts properly (assuming no nesting-oriented syntax errors). But stacks are too unintuitive to many for the purpose of studying type-related behavior explicitly. Thus, it uses an approach more similar to how one does it on paper, but with explicit "labels" for each step, making the "values" (for lack of a better word) closely resemble variables; and since they are so similar, I roll them together with "external" variables so that users don't have to learn about and remember the rules and API's of two different "kinds" of objects. Incidentally, I have seen another language use a very similar "internal variable" approach for expression reduction, at least in debug mode. Unfortunately I don't remember the language name, though. It may have even been a compiler, not an interpreter. But it stuck with me as a clever and KISS-y metaphor, or <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a>.

One does not have to worry about 4 byte numbers versus 8 byte numbers, etc. But even from a practical "external" matter, machines aside, floating point precision should probably have some upper limit. Otherwise writing un-formatted test output would take up gajillion screen-fulls. Thus, I'm not even sure I'd consider floating point precision limits to be a machine-centric issue. Maybe the existing limit is too small, but that's a minor thing to quibble about. For roughly 99.9% percent of programming thinking, I don't have to think about such machine issues (performance aside). (Note that I have not encountered issues with integer size in CF.

           That statement difficult to verify. It more appears as if the <strong>marketplace determined which coding style became popular</strong>, not hardware builders, and we cannot rip open millions of consumers from that era to study their neuron patterns (if they are still alive). You are welcome to present indirect evidence of such an association, but it's probably only spotty evidence and not reliable enough to make such generalizations. BASIC was pushed by the early microcomputer hardware builders because it was cheap, relatively familiar, fit in RAM, and didn't require a RAM-hogging code editor. However, despite temporarily popularity, programmers eventually drifted back to Algol style. Thus, hardware concerns were not sufficient to control the language choice in the longer run in that case.

If you simply don't want to bother to defend that particular statement at this time, that's fine, just be clear about that decision. It's rather accusational in tone such that I feel entitled to some form of closure here.

           I get a "not found" error on that PDF. And I don't dispute that languages share many things in common with VN, but sharing traits is not necessarily proof of causality. Like I said, many language styles have and had been floating around in the market place and orgs could use any they wanted. I see no evidence that fitting hardware was the primary driver of choice.

        Another thing, if I replaced my XML structure with yours, the kit API's would do pretty much the same thing they did before such that if they have a flaw that allows bad assignments (for the sake of argument), it's not due the data structure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {Then the flaw in the data structure extends to the API.}
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no flaw. (By the way on the deleted "spat": I'll try to be respectful in this topic if you are likewise respectful to me. No calling people childish, stupid, liars, etc. Agreed? I admit, starting the last "rudeness war" was my fault and I apologize. -t)

           They are only examples. "Childish" is an insult, by the way. Anyhow, let's all try to avoid rudeness and rudeness escalation. I know these discussions can be frustrating because we are dealing with issues of <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> and meta-physics-like realities, which are difficult to describe and explain.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {If I use "childish", it's only meant to be descriptive.  Distinguish that from, say, "shit-head" -- obviously an insult unless, in fact, you have shit on, in, and/or around your head.  (Note that I am not calling you a "shit-head".  In case there's any misunderstanding, I should also point out that I'm not calling you a dick, asshole, fuckwit, idiot, wanker, imbecile, moron, divot, plonker, twit, knuckledragger, cockmuppet, and/or derp, either.)  I don't find these discussions frustrating, but then I don't think they have anything to do with "<a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> and meta-physics-like realities".  As far as I'm concerned, they deal strictly with language syntax and semantics, and sometimes veer (perhaps off-topically) into language implementation.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That's the biggest load of horseshit justification for insults I've ever seen. I have plenty of "descriptive" ways to describe you, but I try to keep it to myself; and if I slip, I readily admit it's an insult. If I call you "stubborn" or "obsessive", for example, that's descriptive AND an insult. It's not mutually exclusive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I don't know about "obsessive" -- maybe I am -- but I am definitely stubborn.  How is that an insult?  Sometimes you write in a childish manner.  How is that an insult?}

      <ul>
        <li>
           I assure you, in the real world, a good portion, perhaps more than 50% of the adult population, would consider both of those words an insult (barring some special context). This should be obvious/common knowledge.

           We'll make a deal: you don't be a stubborn repetitious pedant, and I won't be childish.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {That seems reasonable, but how do you define "stubborn" and "pedant" (I can guess about "repetitious")?  Childish, in your case, is using insults and expletives.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I can assure you, adults use plenty of insults and expletives, especially on the web. That's not a distinguishing factor between age groups.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Indeed, and all such behaviour is childish, regardless of chronological age.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That makes as much sense as your "semantics" definition.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As a semi side note, I believe that some OO languages do allow something similar, as a shortcut for accessors whose logic can be redefined. But I don't remember the language. Thus, "myObject.setFoo(x)" and "myObject.foo=x" would be equivalent, and how the setting is done is up to the class coder such that it can trigger a function (setFoo method) to run. But I'm not necessarily endorsing such.
      </p>
      <p>
        {The language is C#.  The semantics are those of typical accessors (i.e., get and set methods), but with syntax to make them look like references to member variables.  E.g., given "class C {int V {get; set;}} C c = new C();", you can write "c.V = 3; Console.WriteLine(c.V);" which is effectively shorthand for "c.SetV(3); Console.WriteLine(c.GetV());"  It isn't the same as assigning to expressions or function invocations -- e.g., "3 + 4 = 2;" or "foo() = 3;" -- which your model and its underlying API would apparently permit, because variables, expression evaluation results, and function invocation results are all represented by the same mutable structure, using the same API to access it, that permits assignment.}  
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure that's the language. The language I remember allowed one to redefine the "set" method to be anything they wanted, and would be roughly equivalent to "foo()=3". 
      </p>
      <p>
        {Perhaps you're thinking of C++.  It allows you to redefine the '=' operator to be something you want, including things that aren't assignment, but then that's a change to semantics.  There's no way to redefine '=' to assign something to a function invocation or to an expression.}
      </p>
      <p>
        {By the way, given that C++ is a language where you can redefine most operators to change their semantics, an expression like "a = foo() + b" can be made to mean something like "rotate object 'a' about the 'foo' axis by 'b' degrees". Many argue that doing so is questionable, because it no longer reflects canonical semantics.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow my model only "permits" it if you break it or don't finish all parts of an interpreter built with it. Your model can also be jury-rigged. I'm tired of arguing over this; it's a silly obsession of yours. <strong>Do Not Feed The Obsessive</strong>. ENOUGH!
      </p>
      <p>
        Please, find something more interesting to obsess on.
      </p>
      <p>
        {It's not my obsession, but your model's serious flaw.  It can be fixed easily by distinguishing variables from values.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, you are full of it. And using your nested structure probably wouldn't fix the "problem" because it seems to lean toward the API instead, but I'm not certain because I don't even know where this alleged problem is; I'm just guessing based on your vague description. <strong>The parser would typically reject such because expressions are not allowed/expected on the left side of an assignment statement.</strong> There's no reason to allow parenthesis or plus signs on the left of assignments. In fact, <strong>one would have to explicitly tell the parser how to handle such</strong>; it wouldn't accidentally show up. That's <strong>two hurdles</strong>, at least, it has to pass thru: 1. Syntax checking, 2. Translation into API calls. And even IF those two hurdles break down, it would be like a no-op instruction anyhow; not affecting the output. Do you know what a no-op instruction is? I don't even know why I'm entertaining your silly notion. I should ignore it instead of feed stupidity, making it grow. That's why you can't talk to regular programmers, you get mentally caught up in dumb little things that regular people don't care about. "Ooooh, but this bicycle helmet doesn't prevent you from sticking a pickle in your ear! Oohhhhh ohhhh ohhh!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Is your claim this?: My model (allegedly) puts more burden on the syntax/parsing side of things, whereas yours can catch such in a later stage if the syntax/parsing side breaks down or is omitted?
      </p>
      <p>
        {Essentially, yes.  My model cannot implement a situation in which values or variables are assigned to values, or where variables are assigned to variables, or where expression evaluation results in a variable, because values and variables are distinct.}
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue is accepting such statements, not the name of the intermediate parts. I see nothing in your model that would prevent the "foo()" being converted to an intermediate value. (It may be ignored, but the equiv is ignored in my model also, if parsing lets it thru, that is). Anyhow, it's a <strong>non-issue</strong> because the parser and API converter would normally not even recognize such a configuration; one would likely have to go out of their way to implement it (depending on algorithm used). Enough about this <strong>red herring</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        {Even if the result of foo() is an intermediate value, you can't assign to it.}
      </p>
      <p>
        In a section above, I've asked what specifically what prevents such.
      </p>
      <p>
        {The definitions of variable and value.  The former is mutable and therefore permits assignment.  The latter is immutable and therefore does not.}

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Do you agree that for debugging and/or experimentation, having <strong>mutable and addressable (ID'd) "values"</strong> can be useful?
      </p>
      <p>
        {No.  A value is such a trivial structure that requiring it to be "mutable and addressable" is unnecessary.  If a value needs to be "addressable", it is normally contained in a named or indexable structure.  That's the basis for constants in programming languages.  I can't imagine why a value would need to be mutated.  How often do you need to turn a 3 into a 4?}
      </p>
      <p>
        During debugging to test alternatives. "Contained in a named structure"? I thought you were against that because it violated some secret Mason's semantics code or something. Anyhow, in ANY interpreter source code, the implementation of "value" will be potentially mutable. One can put an object wrapper around such to "lock it" from changing once it's created, but one can alter that code and remove the lock if they wanted. I chose to keep the implementation simple, but if you want to put locks on YOUR version, that's perfectly fine. I'm not dictating the absence of such features. A model/kit user can do all the <a href="SafetyGoldPlating.html">SafetyGoldPlating</a> they want. <strong>I don't forbid it</strong>. It's quibbling to complain about such.
      </p>
      <p>
        {What kind of "test alternatives" involving mutating a 3 into a 4 might you need to do that can't be done by using the 4 value instead of the 3 value?}
      </p>
      <p>
        There have been many times where I wish I could test alternative values/inputs without altering the source code or data to fudge it during debugging. I cannot name a specific <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> that's easy to describe at the moment. But that's moot anyhow because one can put locks on any part of my model/kit they want. I don't forbid it. <strong>Lock away!</strong> if you feel that kind of thing is important. I doubt the vast majority of programmers would give a fudge, but if it's your thing, do it. You can even modify it to have "representation" instead of "value". Rename the parts and shape it to make your mind comfy and happy. You can even glue tits onto it if you are feeling horny. 
      </p>
      <p>
        {Your model makes it impossible to "lock away" values without simultaneously having to "lock away" variables, because you use the same structure for both.  Re "glue tits onto it", etc., you're being childish again.  Stop it.}
      </p>
      <p>
        No it doesn't. Add another attribute to the Variable XML structure that the accessor API's use to prevent changes. We've been over such already. One could also create two different "kinds" of variables (objects/things), but that complicates the model too much in my opinion. I'll value simplicity over "safety" since it is not meant for production interpreters. Plus, I want to leave in the ability to fiddle with internal values for experimentation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But you are welcome to adjust your copy any way you want. It's a free country. Instead of complain about it, build your own. Unless you come up with solid evidence it violates "common semantics" or something similar in a big and clear way, there's no justification to keep complaining about my version. You've failed to clearly measure "common semantics". Your version/interpretation of "common semantics" comes from your <strong>personal interpretation</strong> of your favorite written sources, NOT a clear and obvious and measurable pattern. You're being insistent based on weak (if any) evidence, which I interpret as stubbornness.
      </p>
      <p>
        {As long as you make no claim that your experimental interpreter is a model of anything, I shall not object.  That includes not injecting commentary into discussions based on an assumption that your experimental interpreter is a model, such as using "type tag" in place of "type reference" or claiming that a value is an "anonymous variable", and the like.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Please elaborate. This seems to assume some canonical model as a reference point. I already explained in bold that it may not reflect actual implementation of most interpreters. Why is this not good enough? Or are you back to making actual machine-oriented implementation the reference point? (You seem to waffle on that.) Otherwise, <strong>my arbitrariness is no more arbitrary than your arbitrariness</strong>. There is NO ONE RIGHT MODEL. And, I don't formally define "value" anywhere. And "type reference" is not an official certified term; thus, I'm not violating anything real. This again seems to be a case of <a href="MentalModelOverExtrapolation.html">MentalModelOverExtrapolation</a> into a (perceived) objective truth of model, vocabulary, and usage of. Further, "type reference" implies a pointer to some central look-up table or the like, but there's no such table in the model (as originally given. You can add your own if you really want one.) Thus, it <strong>might introduce confusion</strong> without sufficient, if any, benefits to make up for that confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        {As long as you do not use the term "type tag", "hidden variable" or "anonymous constant" outside of discussions about your model; argue that values or programming language semantics do not exist; or treat terminology or aspects of your model that are unique to your model as if they should be familiar terminology and commonly-recognised aspects, then I shall not object.  I recall a couple of instances where you've used "type tag" or just "tag" -- in discussions unrelated to your model -- as if they should be familiar and understood.  If I see you do that or its ilk, I will object.}
      </p>
      <p>
        So you can use working terms like "D2", but I can't? Sounds like a double standard to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        {I have no intention of using "Category D2" outside of either discussion of your model, or discussion of <a href="TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages.html">TypeSystemCategoriesInImperativeLanguages</a>.  I wouldn't expect it to be recognised outside of those contexts, so I wouldn't mention it outside of those contexts.} 
      </p>

        That's fine. If either one of us slips and uses something outside of context, we can kindly remind each other.
