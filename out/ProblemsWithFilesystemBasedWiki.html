        Problems With Filesystem Based Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        I want a <a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a>.
        But, looking at the matter seems to show obstacles:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Briefly</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a> is hard
        </li>
        <li>
           Non-availability of CGI scripting on FILE URLs is a big obstacle.
        </li>
        <li>
           a <a href="CvsBasedWiki.html">CvsBasedWiki</a>, e.g. one based on a <a href="CvsWeb.html">CvsWeb</a> server,  is reasonably easy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Specifically
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> isn't sufficient to do a <a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a>. CGI is not available to FILE: URLs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Java is sufficient to do a <a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a>, modulo security manager issues. But it is questionable as to how ubiquitous Java is.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Detail</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh bloody hell!!!!!! 
      </p>
      <p>
        I typed in a lot more details,
        but somebody else had edited the page before me.
        My save was not allowed.
        I thought that I had copied all the text so that
        I could reapply the edits,
        but I may have lost it.
        Now let's see if I can find out where it is logged...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My experience has been that hitting my browser's "back" button returns me to the edit page with my most recent edits intact.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        AG: <strong>A Windows </strong><a href="FilesystemBasedWiki.html">FilesystemBasedWiki</a> is blocked by the  non-availability of a ubiquitous scripting system on Windows.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        OTHER: I'm pretty sure every current version of Windows comes with VBScript.
      </p>
      <p>
        AG: You're right. I misdiagnosed: 
        CGI scripts don't get run from FILE URLs,
        on neither Windows nor standard Unixes.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        OTHER: Perl works great on Windows, and most Web hosting services have Perl on their Windows servers.
      </p>
      <p>
        AG: again, I am trying to create a non Web-based wiki, as I try to describe
        in FilesystemBasedWiiki. Not a Web-based wiki that just happens to store text in files.
      </p>

      <p>
        Grrr.... just had two edit collisions. Shows how Zwiki's comment-mode is a good idea.
