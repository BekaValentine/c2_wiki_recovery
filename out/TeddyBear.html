        Teddy Bear

      <p>
        An endearing stuffed animal, taken and held for a sense of security and peacefulness. Also the logo for <a href="EddiesWiki.html">EddiesWiki</a> and (IIRC) the icon for DEBUG.EXE in <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>.

        The effectiveness of a <a href="TeddyBear.html">TeddyBear</a> can be shown by a true story:
      </p>
      <p>
        While in college, an associate was bemoaning that his girlfriend was out of town.  He had bought her a teddy bear as a gift for her return.  That evening, he and I and another friend had dinner at a local place where we were wont to eat, and play Spades (a bidding card game).  Someone suggested we play, and when I objected that we had only 3 players, the teddy bear was nominated as my partner, but played by his owner.  The game proceeded, and the bear player bid a blind nil on one hand.  Three tricks later, he picked up the bear's hand, stared at it, and muttered in disbelief "The bear's set my nil!"
