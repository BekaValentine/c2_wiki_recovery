        Looking Near Lamp Instead Of Where Lost
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of my favorite tech metaphors is based on the following joke:
      </p>
      <p>
        A: What are doing here under the lamp-post, son?
      </p>
      <p>
        B: Why, I'm looking for my watch.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Where do you think you lost it?
      </p>
      <p>
        B: I'm pretty sure I lost it in the park.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: Isn't the park three blocks away?
      </p>
      <p>
        B: Yes, it is.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: So, why are looking here?
      </p>
      <p>
        B: Because the light is better here.
      </p>
