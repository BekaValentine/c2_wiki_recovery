        Self Contained Headers
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="SelfContainedHeaders.html">SelfContainedHeaders</a> are header files that can be included <em>top-most</em> in a translation unit, i.e. that do not rely on other headers that have to be included before them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To check that a header is self-contained, include it topmost in the module that implements it, i.e.
      </p>
      <p>
        foo.cpp:
      </p>
      <code>
        // top of file<br/>
        #include "foo.h"<br/>
        // ... other includes<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To make a header self-contained, make sure that it includes any header files it needs:
      </p>
      <p>
        foo.h:
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifndef FOO_H<br/>
        #define FOO_H<br/>
        #include "bar.h"<br/>
        class Foo : public Bar {};<br/>
        #endif<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And make sure that those header files use <a href="IncludeGuard.html">IncludeGuard</a>s:
      </p>
      <p>
        bar.h:
      </p>
      <code>
        #ifndef BAR_H<br/>
        #define BAR_H<br/>
        class Bar {}; <br/>
        #endif<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The goal with headers is to reduce interdependencies, so you should also consider using <a href="ForwardDeclaration.html">ForwardDeclaration</a>s to avoid having to include the other headers at all. (See the <a href="PimplIdiom.html">PimplIdiom</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose that the header was not self contained. Then if you wish to use refer to the symbols declared in that header in a different client, then the new client wouldn't even compile unless you found and pulled the need other headers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The #include's also for a strong marker to the readers of the program as to which other modules are required to compile (and use) this routine.
      </p>
      <p>
        A related notion is that headers should be necessary. ie. Only those headers required to compile _this_ header should be included. You do your clients a disservice to #include other headers you think they may need.
      </p>

      <p>
        To speed up compile times, you may desire to use <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a> as well as ordinary <a href="IncludeGuard.html">IncludeGuard</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of includes another one depends on is normally very low, and thus the negative effects of <a href="RedundantIncludeGuards.html">RedundantIncludeGuards</a> are reduced. The <em>positive</em> effects are higher, because an implementation file is translated only once, but a header is used quite often. Making them self-contained leads to more includes in includes in includes... which enforces the positive effects even more.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an IdealWorld, all this would of course be not necessary.
