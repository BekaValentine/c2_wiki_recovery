        Books Wanted
      </h1>
      <p>
        I recently wanted a book that I thought someone here on the Wiki might have and be willing to part with. There was nowhere then to put the request, so I thought I'd create one. While there are plenty of web-sites to hunt for second-hand or out-of-print books, or even new books, (<a href="WhereToBuyBooks.html">WhereToBuyBooks</a>) this is an attempt to hook up people who have books they no longer need or want with people who are willing, even eager, to take them off their hands.
