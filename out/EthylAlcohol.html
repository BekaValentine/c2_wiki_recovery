        also known as ethanol or just "alcohol", ethyl alcohol is one of the most addictive, poisonous and socially damaging drugs known. Despite this statistical downside, as with many drugs the use of alcohol can be a pleasurable experience even for the non-addicted. Additionally--again as with other drugs--alcohol can even serve as a tool: for instance as a vehicle to altered states of consciousness or vantage points from which to experience and interpret "reality". Throughout most of human history consumption and production of ethyl alcohol has been legal in most jurisdictions, and often government sponsored.

        Unlike most drugs, can be, and is often, consumed without the intention of getting high. Instead, it is consumed with the intention of getting drunk.

        Perhaps by you, not by me. And intoxication <em>does</em> depend on the quantity.

        Not that there is any difference, by the way. Irrespective of your intentions, drinking <a href="EthylAlcohol.html">EthylAlcohol</a> <em>will</em> lead to intoxication.
