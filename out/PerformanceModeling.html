        Performance Modeling
      </h1>
      <p>
        The act (and art) of using a QueuingModel to describe a system (proposed or actual). So why do you need a queuing model anyway? When you have just one user of a system, response times are determined by actual service times. When you have lots of users, response times start getting dominated by queues (waiting times for service) rather than service times. A QueuingModel allows you to analyze this effect.

        With a lot of experience in a particular design space, it becomes possible to model performance by just relating frequently occurring design elements. For example, <em>Improving .NET Application Performance and Scalability</em> describes performance modeling this way in chapter 2.
