        By it's very nature, the accumulation of infinite data, not only would all facts need to be included, but all fallacies and falsities as well. In addition, every word would need to be a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>. A project without end. All we would need is a server with infinite memory and a way to keep the sun from going nova. --MikeShanley
