        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do we deal with a situation or object which has too much detail to comprehend or be useful?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Make all the detail visible at once. Get a big table or a
        blank wall and put everything you know up there at once.
        Use PostIts (or <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s with spray adhesive). Write one
        detail on each card. Spatially sort the details every which way you can think of (what are some of the sorts?)

        When the problem is that everybody sees the trees but not
        the forest, <a href="AbStraction.html">AbStraction</a> is a good solution. Programmers
        jump to abstraction because it is the most powerful tool
        in our thinking toolkit. Often, though, <a href="AbStraction.html">AbStraction</a> obscures 
        the real problem, because not enough is yet known.
