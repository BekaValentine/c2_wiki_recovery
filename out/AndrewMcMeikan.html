        As I have faded from net view lately some may think I am no longer active on the net, I am just with a slightly different strategy. After all, things are slightly different. If you have stumbled across this because you have seen me rant about something in the past and now wonder if I am still fighting for the cause, then by all means contact me, for now I am silent running (occasionally sticking my neck out still).

        I was locked out of any editing by the anti-spam feature (and my time-zone and laziness ;) will hopefully try and re-enter wiki land, although over the last year I have almost dropped off the internet.  I always welcome fixing of my speeling! -- <a href="AndrewMcMeikan.html">AndrewMcMeikan</a>
