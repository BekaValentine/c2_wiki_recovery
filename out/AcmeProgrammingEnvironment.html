        Acme Programming Environment
      </h1>
      <p>
        Acme is a text editor/programming environment written for the Plan 9 operating system (see <a href="PlanNineFromBellLabs.html">PlanNineFromBellLabs</a>). It takes a substantially different tack than other windowing environments. Among its interesting properties are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           heavy and effective use of the mouse, including mouse chords
        </li>
        <li>
           any and all text on the screen can be executed
        </li>
        <li>
           its "extension language" is the shell (rc, for Plan 9)
        </li>

           <a href="TiledWindows.html">TiledWindows</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           no menus or icons
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You might look at
        <a href="http://acme.cat-v.org">http://acme.cat-v.org</a> to learn more about acme. And the paper describing Help, the precursor for acme: <a href="http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/1st_edition/help/">http://doc.cat-v.org/plan_9/1st_edition/help/</a>

        RussCox (and friends) has ported much of the Plan 9 user-space to Unix-like systems.  His
        plan9port package (<a href="PlanNineFromUserSpace.html">PlanNineFromUserSpace</a>) includes acme.  See the home page at <a href="http://swtch.com/plan9port/.">http://swtch.com/plan9port/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="InfernoOs.html">InfernoOs</a> version of acme has been packaged with some extra goodies (wiki editor, irc client, etc) as a standalone program that can run on Windows, Linux and OS X under the name AcmeStandAloneComplex: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/acme-sac/">http://code.google.com/p/acme-sac/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="GaryCapell.html">GaryCapell</a> (and friends) has written an acme imitation for Unix called wily.  There's a home page at <a href="http://www.cs.yorku.ca/~oz/wily/index.html">http://www.cs.yorku.ca/~oz/wily/index.html</a> but wily is mostly deprecated in favor of p9p/acme and acme-sac mentioned earlier.

      <p>
        The <a href="IonWindowManager.html">IonWindowManager</a> organises ordinary managed windows in a similar fashion to Acme. The Wily page above mentions that using the window manager for, er, managing windows might be tidier. Is this a call for a window-spawning text editor with Acme's style of shell integration? Not sure. Will it work under screen(1)?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The early implementation of wily spawned a new X window (process, actually) when you opened a new file. It was a total pain in the rear. I vaguely recall jumping on the window-tiling task pretty early on, but the revision control history might have something else to say about that. -- </em><a href="BillTrost.html">BillTrost</a><em></em>

        Sounds like oberon-v4 to me but i never got that far to use it as
        a crossplatform ide (emacs replacement). see <a href="http://www.oberon.ethz.ch">http://www.oberon.ethz.ch</a>
