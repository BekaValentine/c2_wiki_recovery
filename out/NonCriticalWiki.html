      <ul>
        <li>
           is hosted, but not controlled by someone willing to pay the bill for its space in the ether.
        </li>
        <li>
           is a wiki which has stuff in it which is non-proprietary, not copyrighted, not trademarked, doesn't reveal trade secrets, nor does it contain non-duplicated, backed-up content.
        </li>
        <li>
           does not require sophisticated security features, since its contents are non-critical and can be deleted, modified, added to, or changed significantly as a result of the application of the AnarchyRule.
        </li>
        <li>
           is policed by no person, but also policed by every person.
        </li>
        <li>
           is useful for free-for-all exchanges which are within the bounds of reason and if contradictory, politely so.
        </li>
        <li>
           is open, requires no log-in, membership
        </li>
        <li>
           places no warrantees or certifications on the accuracy or pertinancy of its contents
        </li>
        <li>
           seeks only to exist, and may or may not be helpful, accurate, meaningful or applicable
        </li>
        <li>
           will not be missed or mourned if it completely disappears for a time
        </li>
        <li>
           can and will from time to time be visited and marked by those having no-good-intentions and who vandalize, deface, try to monopolize control, and otherwise use it as a sign of their idea of power and wisdom
        </li>
        <li>
           will sometimes be deleted entirely or in part and may or may not be restored in conditions like it was before such deletion, but will be restored by someone interested in replacing emptiness with non-criticalness. 
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>

        Have I forgotten any charactersitics? If I have, add your own.
