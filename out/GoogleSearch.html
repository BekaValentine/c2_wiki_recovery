        A favorite search engine of many, for many reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Results are sorted by a "relevancy" heuristic that works surprisingly well. <a href="http://www.google.com/technology/">http://www.google.com/technology/</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           It is very fast.

        </li>
        <li>
           They are prompt to fix bugs when reported.
        </li>
        <li>
           They crawl (index) the Web relatively completely and frequently.

        Google critics: <a href="http://www.google-watch.org/">http://www.google-watch.org/</a> SearchEngineWatch also critiqued the critique, and concluded that the concerns had some basis, but were somewhat alarmist.

        I didn't get very far with Google. I stumbled over the <a href="GoogleCache.html">GoogleCache</a> feature which does not pick up pages from the original wiki (these pages) but does pick up the other wikis hosted here.
      </p>
      <p>
        While trying to figure that out, <a href="JohnDeBruyn.html">JohnDeBruyn</a> (May 27, 2001) found a really nifty picture of Ward:

        Best new feature: using words found in building the index as possible corrections allows Google to spellcheck ANYTHING. Just now it corrected me on "Miskatonic". I am duly impressed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Along with spell-check </em><a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> also features an exceptional calculator.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>e.g. </em><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+light+years+are+in+a+fathom">http://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+light+years+are+in+a+fathom</a> <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It didn't do so well yet with this one:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+seconds+are+in+a+nanocentury''">http://www.google.com/search?q=how+many+seconds+are+in+a+nanocentury''</a>

        "Searches are logged by time of day, originating I.P. address (information that can be used to link searches to a specific computer), and the sites on which the user clicked. People tell things to search engines that they would never talk about publicly - Viagra, pregnancy scares, fraud, face lifts. What is interesting in the aggregate can be seem an invasion of  privacy if narrowed to an individual."

        Newsweek (Europe) Dec 16 2002 issue had an interesting article about "The World According to Google", including some of the more troubling aspects in recent times where search results turn out to be filtered for different regions or because of litigation threats.

        How do I use google? I've written, in spanish, how to do an important part of my job using google. The link is <a href="http://www.seedwiki.com/page.cfm?doc=ResolvedorUniversalDeProblemas&wikiid=1460&wpid=0">http://www.seedwiki.com/page.cfm?doc=ResolvedorUniversalDeProblemas&wikiid=1460&wpid=0</a> (it's also a wiki, so you can add whatever you want).

        The following claim has been made on the <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> page: "Google indexes this site every few days." And here above, "They crawl (index) the Web relatively completely and frequently." One should not conclude from these statements that the c2 wiki is indexed completely every few days.
      </p>
      <p>
        The following test was performed 2005-04-25. Go to Google and search for site:c2.com alright. Google reports several pages which it believes contain 'alright'. Some of these pages are <a href="DomainDisputes.html">DomainDisputes</a>, <a href="FilthInterface.html">FilthInterface</a>, <a href="MatureProgrammer.html">MatureProgrammer</a>, and <a href="WikiNumbers.html">WikiNumbers</a>. Yet if you check these pages you'll notice I changed the spellings to 'all right' on 2004-05-21. Conclusion: Google has not indexed these pages in over 11 months.

        <em>Truly shocking.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Agree. If you check the <a href="GoogleCache.html">GoogleCache</a> copy of a page, you'll see the date the page was last indexed. As of 2005-04-27, you can see from the cache that <a href="DomainDisputes.html">DomainDisputes</a> was indexed on Apr 14, 2004; <a href="FilthInterface.html">FilthInterface</a> was indexed Feb 22, 2004; etc. Each of these pages comes from Google's "supplemental" list. Any page Google lists as a "Supplemental Result" has not been indexed in quite a while. Other pages have been indexed within just a few weeks. It's anyone's guess why some pages are indexed much more often than others. -- Eliz

      <p>
        For searching <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> using groups.google.com, the URL for the returned items is a <a href="BigBallOfMud.html">BigBallOfMud</a>. However there is a way to find the threadID, which will locate the item with a much shorter URL.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Unfortunately I can only see the threadID by moving mouse cursor over one of the items in the "view all threads" option.</em>
