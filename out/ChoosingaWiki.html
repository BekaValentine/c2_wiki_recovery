        <strong>Q:</strong>
        I've volunteered my services as a web designer to a group of friends for a site they want to produce/create. While brainstorming I thought that perhaps a Wiki would be a good idea for the site concept. Upon further research I realized it would be a great idea, but there are a few features I'm looking for that I'm unsure even exist in the world of Wiki's. 
        - Is there a Wiki that allows the creator of a wiki article to be the only editor (or maybe them and an administrator)?
        Any help and all answers will be appreciated, thanks! - JA

        <strong>A:</strong> Have a look at <a href="WikiTypeFramework.html">WikiTypeFramework</a> that has a security system which can probably meet your needs. It runs under PHP and MySQL and is simple to set up. It permits authorized users to upload files, including graphics. It also provides the ability for authorized users to embed code on non-wiki pages to enhance functionality.

        <strong>Q:</strong>
        I wonder if anyone can help me at all. I want to create an Encyclopedia-esque webpage for my constructed world (a la Tolkein), however, I don't want to have to deal with manually handling links. It seems a wiki would give me the best functionality, however, I can't figure out which one to use. I can't run it on my machine, I have to use the school webserver which supports PHP, Perl, and MySQL. However, I don't know PHP too well.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Because it is just <em>my world</em>, I want to be the only person with editing capabilities. So I want a wiki that has user access control (and somehow I can hack out that it defaults to only-certain-person-can edit). The main reason I'd like a wiki is to provide the useful backend for editing, cross-linking, and so on (and I don't want to do it from scratch).
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>It's probably easier to get a world writable wiki, but put access to it behind a more traditional login-only gate.</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   That wouldn't be too hard to do. I could probably set up a wiki such that only registered users can edit pages, and then only have one registered user: me.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Ability to template by CSS would be nice (PHP Wiki does this, I think) (PHP wiki is not longer support, for a PHP based wiki you could see <a href="http://pmwiki.org">http://pmwiki.org</a> )
        </li>
        <li>
           As well, it would be rather nice if the code dealing with <a href="TextFormattingRules.html">TextFormattingRules</a> was easy to change. (Something in Perl would theoretically make this easy)
        </li>
        <li>
           I want to be able to disable <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> links. They have as much place as they would in an encyclopedia on Middle-Earth. And the ability to create custom link text (so I can link to an entry without necessarily having to specify the entry's name) would be nice, but not really all that necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
           Internationalization would be helpful, but again, not necessary.
        </li>
        <li>
           Article redirection would be incredibly helpful. Plurals and inflections don't always occur on the end of words, and being able to have one article for all variations would be nice.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I realize I'm looking for something rather specialized, and somewhat non-wiki-ish.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can anyone help me? And if another type of software would be better for me (something other than a wiki, that is) please let me know. Thank you.

        <strong>Q: </strong> 
        I appear to have unusual authentication requirements. I want to run an intranet wiki and require login for all edits. I don't want to have to maintain yet another password database, so I am looking for a wiki which provides a hook for me to supply my own authentication code. Twiki comes close, but requires a mapping from Wiki to site accounts.
        This must be a common requirement - what am I missing?

      </p>
      <p>
        Your requirements are not unusual nor specialized. I think wiki would be well-suited to both of you. Even more simple wiki engines, like <a href="UseMod.html">UseMod</a> can be configured (during installation) to require passwords for editing. You can disallow editing from anyone but the administrator, you can set up multiple passwords for multiple users, or users can set up their own passwords. There are more complex wiki engines which have more features for user login

        <strong>Q.</strong> I've set up a wiki a long time ago and am now looking for another one for a new project. I'm overwhelmed by how many wikis there are now. Can anyone tell if there's a Wiki with good user account management? Every user should only be allowed to see and edit 10 or so specific pages. The other pages would be, in best case, invisible to them.

        "ACLs for reading, editing and commenting"
        <em>allow you to set up per-page access control lists so that you can specify a list of exactly which users can see and/or edit a particular page, and set up a completely different list of users on other pages.</em>

        Q: I am looking for a WIKI (I believe) that will run under Unix; can use Perl, PHP, Python, <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a> or flat files.
        I will be using it as a place for multiple authors to collaborate on multiple books.. all authors will need various right ... their own books, others books and such. Initially private access (authors only) and then read only for public with abillity to make comments later.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Crunch... Authors are not programmers (usually) so WYSIWYG would be nice but the clincher is that most of us don't like endless vertical scrolling material. We want to have 'pages' of fixed length (like a book) where text entered flows from one page to the next and the pages automatically (or at a button click) open a 'new page' and maintain links to one another. Automatic Links within text like Wikipedia are nice but not critical. Oh yeah,,, also free or cheap. Don't mind supporting programers... hate supporting corporations.

        I tried a WIKI sandbox and think I can make do with categories and such but...

        <strong>Q:</strong> I'm looking to set up a Wiki to chronicle an ongoing RPG campaign (Star Wars). I'd be hosting it on my wife's corporate webspace. I spent some time researching a few easy-access wikis, and settled on SWiki. When I queried the sysadmins of her webspace about setting up an Swiki, they replied:
      </p>
      <p>
        "In general, you can run just about any Unix application or script you need to support your web site. There are very few restrictions. One of those restrictions is that you may not install or run any program that runs in the background, or operates non-interactively as a server, and this is what Swiki appears to do. So, to answer your question more directly, yes, you may - in principle - host a wiki, but not this one in particular."
      </p>
      <p>
        In a follow-up email, the sysadmins indicated that their corporation uses <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> internally (so I'm assuming that it would be ok).
      </p>
      <p>
        So, I need help choosing a wiki that meets the sysadmins criteria, as well as my own:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           ease of use
        </li>
        <li>
           password logins (so only the actual playgroup can edit the wiki)
        </li>
        <li>
           images
        </li>
        <li>
           ability to create hyperlinks by means other than concatenating Capitalized words
        </li>
        <li>
           ability to create a Graphical User Interface of some kind (even a simple one like SWiki uses would be fine).
        </li>
        <li>
           ability to set various permissions for different pages (so that my players don't start hacking the menu, f'rex. Or if a page becomes "the one, true history", it can be archived, never to be edited). -- <a href="DarcyBurgess.html">DarcyBurgess</a>

        <strong>Q:</strong> I'm thinking of installing a wiki to control an internal repository of tips and notes that our group maintains. There's quite a large existing repository of Web pages that I would need to import into my wiki. Is this difficult to do on most wiki engines? Are there some that make this easier? We use Apache and run PHP, MySQL and Perl. I don't mind losing some of the formatting in the existing Web pages, I just don't want to have to import them by hand. Any suggestions? Thanks.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> A wiki that supports HTML would make it easy to just import your pages (without the HEAD and BODY elements, though I think TWiki may let you do this even with them). Otherwise, you'd have to write a tool that turns HTML into the wiki syntax involved. I would use TWiki since it's already quite a large repository and used on an intranet - it has a lot of plugins for additional features (e.g. calendars, action tracking, table sorting, charting, project tracking, etc), and has good access control and revision tracking. -- <a href="RichardDonkin.html">RichardDonkin</a>

        <li>
           We tend to prefer Python mildly over Perl, and either over PHP
        </li>
        <li>
           HTML input is not important (some of our team do not know it at all)

        <strong>Q:</strong> I've noticed that Zwiki and coWiki both have the option to display a hierarchy of pages. I know this is a very un-wiki thing to do, but I still wonder, are there other wikis that have this feature?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Not sure exactly what those features are like. TWiki supports the notion of parent and child pages, a page started from another page becomes a child of that page, and the "bread crumb trail" at the top of the standard TWiki skin shows the bread crumb trail for that page. For example, the bread crumb trail for <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/TWikiOnPhp">http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/TWikiOnPhp</a> looks like "TWiki > Codev > PhpNuke > PostNuke > <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> > TWikiOnPhp". See <a href="http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/HowToShowParentTopics.">http://twiki.org/cgi-bin/view/Codev/HowToShowParentTopics.</a> Note that TWiki divides a <a href="WikiSite.html">WikiSite</a> into webs (think, but don't say "directories" or "folders" ;-) ) and there is a way to have a hierarchy of webs - not well known or supported (at least to me). -- <a href="RandyKramer.html">RandyKramer</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Wetpaint.com Wiki has a drill down contents page sidebar, to allow hierarchy of pages.

        <strong>Q:</strong> I'm looking for a wiki I can either A: install on a winXP machine at home and run when I need to, or B: run on the freely provided home.earthlink.net 10 MB Web site. I am NOT experienced with anything perl/php/java all that Web stuff. I am a graphic artist and an amateur game designer, and I'm looking for an easy way to post an editable design documents to work with people online. So far we have been using very crude methods to create our past games and I'm looking for something that will allow more workability and organization. Are there any "wiki for total idiots" sites out there, or distributions which require almost 0 knowledge of a specific Web language? -- ShaharEldar

      <p>
        P.S. something that I can post pictures to would probably be even better than anything I can't...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Maybe you want to look at PWP <a href="http://www.net-assistant.de/wiki/static/StartPage.html">http://www.net-assistant.de/wiki/static/StartPage.html</a> and XAMPP <a href="http://www.apachefriends.org/">http://www.apachefriends.org/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        XAMPP is an Apache webserver with php, perl, mySQL and a lot more features, just unzip it and hit install and you will get it running in 1 minute.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once you've managed to get XAMPP running you can install PWP. PWP uses flat files and will require no configuration at all, just unzip it and it works. Including images on your pages is also easy to do. The best feature of PWP is it's static page export, which generates a bunch of files you can upload to a simple web server without php and sql capabilities (Such as your Earthlink server). People can then still view your Wiki, although no-one can edit the pages. If you still want this, you will have to look for a more advanced web server, and be willing to pay for that.
      </p>
      <p>
        EDIT: I found an even lighter webserver which does just the same: <a href="http://miniserver.sourceforge.net/">http://miniserver.sourceforge.net/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Miniserver (also known as Uniserver) does a lovely job running various WikiWare packages. And it's a lot smaller than XAMPP (because they took out most of the stuff you'll never use). I plan to release a ready-to-go package with Miniserver and <a href="ErfurtWiki.html">ErfurtWiki</a>, for those who want to set up a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        The latest PWP version is 1.4.1 and it was released on 17 October 2003 -- Ewout Stam at 19 April 2004 11:15 GMT

        I installed piki in under 1/2 hour. The design is simple, 1 executable - well, one SCRIPT - file in python. All pages in one dir under the web cgi-bin. I also looked at one of its descendants, <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a>, and although it's powerful, the thing left me quaking at the many places in the system it wanted access to, where many system level things live. Piki is nice and secure, so it has mush less to worry about on the security front, and even is simple to set up! You DO have to go in and edit the configuration items so it knows its path information and a few other things. It could use some more features, but it is a good basic wiki and is a breeze in general. I would recommend it to the pythonista reading these words. Another descendant to look for is pikie, (Extended Piki). VERY nice pages. Although it is easy to use, I have not attempted installing it, and cannot comment on security.

        I started simple, with a perl-based wiki distributed with the book The Wiki Way. Soon I did some modifications and then I realized that I needed much more, so I moved to TWiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want only a Wiki, TWiki is a good choice and easy to install. I didn't manage to make any plug-in work correctly, they all have twists in the installation.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I am moving to <a href="TikiWiki.html">TikiWiki</a>, because I really think a collaboration system is more than a Wiki. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a caveat. I can't convert pages without a lot of work!

        <strong>Q.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm looking for a wiki that is more OBJECT based. Simply put, each paragraph is an object (with an author/date modified/date created/revision history at the paragraph level).
      </p>
      <p>
        Any ideas?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sounds like "</em>PurpleNumbers". I've been told they've been implemented in at least one wiki so far -- see <a href="http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/PurpleNumbers">http://wikifeatures.wiki.taoriver.net/moin.cgi/PurpleNumbers</a> .<em></em>

        Hi I am also looking for a wiki which serves my needs, can anyone help.
      </p>
      <p>
        I already tried four and I am a little frustrated.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are my requirements:
        -php
        -Mysql
        => which leafs only 30 (or so :-)))
        Features:
      </p>
      <p>
        User management
        e.g. I want to create a page where I can specify who sees it. Also the link on the former page should only be displayed when the user has the respective access rights
      </p>
      <p>
        Fileupload
      </p>
      <p>
        Search
      </p>
      <p>
        Categorization (not so important, but if its there great)
      </p>
      <p>
        Easy to install
      </p>
      <p>
        extremely easy to use (!)
      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose is to drive discussions around a software project
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for your help

        <strong>Q: </strong> I am looking for something I can set up for a High School Theory Of Knowledge (Dirty IB Snobs) class so technologically retarded individuals can help create a class lexicon with the openness of a wiki, moderated file hosting, and preferably an automatic directory system as there will be several classes running their own wikis in parallel. I don't particularly care whether or not it will need usernames and passwords, but it should at least record information of each editor. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So what question do you have that isn't answered by the provided resources at the links of the top of the page? We can't very well tell you what to use without constraints from you, and you should at least put in the effort of reading the resources provided.</em>

           Hebrew support
        </li>

        <li>
           uses php & mysql
        </li>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           option to append (discussion after formal version)...
        </li>
        <li>
           each page has a photo-album with upload-mechanism
        </li>
        <li>
           the wiki will show by default the formal version with the open discussion. viewing the open version is optional.

        <li>
           part of the formal page can't be *viewed* by everyone!
        </li>

        I want...
        a flat wiki that requires no database, just a plain/text file.
        Coz, a database cost me few buck every months.
        Yet featureful, like FreeGuppy or FlatNuke (not a wiki though) or <a href="TikiWiki.html">TikiWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A:
        Try <a href="PmWiki.html">PmWiki</a>, which is flat-file out-of-the-box. It has a very vigorous and strong community, a huge Cookbook for plug-ins, entirely PHP, cross-platform independent, portable from server-to-server, and it's GPL. It's about to go to 2.0 release, and is VERY usable and stable as it stands.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Does anyone know of a text file-based wiki engine that keeps pages as single, plain-old wiki-formatted text files? I want to be able to directly edit the page files from my web server shell account or to upload them from my PDA and want the files to be nice, simple, readable, text. I also prefer an engine that's a single, as-simple-as-possible, Perl CGI script.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> <a href="DidiWiki.html">DidiWiki</a> comes close, but has control characters imbedded in the text.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> What control codes? I've only found Ctrl-M at the ends of lines and Ctrl-@ at the end of a file. These are trivial to deal with. Are there any others? (Replies might be better on <a href="DidiWiki.html">DidiWiki</a>)
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Similar to above. I'd like to be able to edit any text within my wiki via gvim, rather than a web browser. I'm hoping to find a wiki that has a flat-file database of text files, so that I can mount it remotely through LUFS (via ssh). I basically want the power of my text editor for managing text, with the ad-hoc organization of a wiki to organize it all. User accounts might be nice, although if it's what I'm looking for, it will be flat-file, and I can probably just use a .htaccess file to manage what areas are public or not. Does anyone hav eany ideas? <a href="DidiWiki.html">DidiWiki</a> seems to come close.... I'd like it to be in perl or php.
      </p>
      <p>
        Edit: I may have answered my own queston. pmWiki seems to do more or less everything I want. Awesome.

        <strong>Q:</strong> I am actually looking for a Wiki which will work on my Playstation Portable (believe it or not). I have 2 gigs of space to work with and would like to have a Wiki that I could port back and forth to work as a PIM. I use it as portable gaming/music already and like it for that, but with its browser features, I was hoping I could put a Wiki on the card as well. It can handle Javascript, but that is about it beyond the standard browser. - Thanks Michael A. B.

        <strong>Q:</strong> I have a client who has written a book and would like to run an experiment with a Wiki. He'd like to show his book's original text on one side of the page and the Wiki-editable text on the other side. Is there a Wiki product that allows display of two versions of a text side by side?  I would prefer Unix over Windows, but will look at anything. - Thanks, Erik
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> I can't think of any wikis where that is the standard display mode. However, many wikis are backed by a <a href="RevisionControlSystem.html">RevisionControlSystem</a> and allow a side-by-side view of different revisions of the page with differences highlighted. (See <a href="VersionControlAppliedToWiki.html">VersionControlAppliedToWiki</a>.) Is that close enough?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> I'm looking for a wiki with good organization features.  What I really want is hierarchical organization that lets a page be a child of more than one page (so that the graph of the wiki structure isn't a tree, but an arbitrary acyclic graph), plus a way to put a map of this structure on the sidebar, preferably with collapsible categories so that it doesn't get enormous.  I know <a href="TiddlyWiki.html">TiddlyWiki</a> has exactly what I want (using TagglyTagging and SiteMap), but I'd like a wiki more usable by multiple people (page locking would be nice...).  
        If there is no wiki with exactly what I want, what are wikis with various nice organization options?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> I'm not sure exactly how to ask, but I'm wanting a wiki that will allow me to have 2 column pages with each side editable on its own. It's for a Wiki game that I'm trying to put together, where one side (or panel) is for discussion (like a forum) and the other side is for actual play (paragraphs in a story). Am I looking for a wiki that can be templated, a special farm, or what?
      </p>
      <p>
        A: You mean, something like <a href="http://wiki.idebate.org/">http://wiki.idebate.org/</a> ?
        Q: Is this something that is built in to <a href="MediaWiki.html">MediaWiki</a> ?

        <strong>Q:</strong> Shouldn't the title of this page be ChoosingAWiki? The current page title shows up as "Choosinga Wiki", which is kinda odd...

        <strong>A:</strong> Yes.

        <strong>Q:</strong> I have a basic website that is hosted for free, so it does not allow PHP, MySQL, CGI/Perl/SS, Frontpage Extensions etc (which are all 'extra'). So I am basically limited to HTML. Is there any wiki out there that I could use?
      </p>
      <p>
        A1: All wiki are CGI extensions (no matter if they are written PHP, Perl, or whatever). So it sounds like you can't start a new wiki on that host.
        However, you may "use" any public wiki that already exists.
        Please respect what the people already at that wiki are trying to build.
      </p>
      <p>
        A2: Also, you can start a new wiki on some other server that has a <a href="WikiFarm.html">WikiFarm</a> or <a href="WikiHive.html">WikiHive</a> like <a href="http://communitywiki.org/odd">http://communitywiki.org/odd</a> or <a href="http://wikia.com/">http://wikia.com/</a> .
      </p>
      <p>
        A3: Perhaps <a href="TiddlyWiki.html">TiddlyWiki</a>?

        <strong>Q:</strong>
        Hello, please could someone advise whether there is a wiki that can do all of the following in the same instance:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           function as an offline wiki in a home network that can be accessed from outside via VNC or VPN
        </li>
        <li>
           display LaTeX maths and diagramme (Imagemagick and Graphviz flow charts and graphs)
        </li>
        <li>
           display oriental text (Unicode I suppose, but I include Japanese, Thai, Chinese, Korean, Vietnamese)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've tried Dokuwiki, TWiki, and Tikiwiki, but failed to get LaTeX formulae to display. Moinmoin, Instiki, and PMWiki look interesting; any advice warmly welcomed.
      </p>

        <strong>Q:</strong>
        Hello, first time poster here (long time reader).  Which wikis support <a href="TransClusion.html">TransClusion</a> of one page (or part of one page) into another?  A simple codebase would be ideal.  I have only found one or two wikis that do--notably PurpleWiki.  Suggestions on general transclusion mechanisms to build a new wiki are also not unwelcome, as I can always adopt an existing codebase (Wi?).
        Other ideal features include flat file format, backlinks, and perhaps an RSS feed, but none is a dealbreaker.
