        You know them, so do them.

        I am not sure I agree with this. In some domains being "nimble and cheap" is the guiding principle. They will tolerate some mistakes in order to be first and fast to market. <a href="YouKnowYoureInaWildWestCompanyWhen.html">YouKnowYoureInaWildWestCompanyWhen</a>.

        Unless the scratch monkey says "No". No means no! Bad human!

        Is this like, "Hey, let's hire a naive programmer for this project. I don't want to waste good scape-goating on one of our own programmers. That would be bad for internal morale."

        <em>Is this why so many projects hire contractors?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, they hire contractors because the indigs aren't up to the task. The fact that you have to ask this question is proof enough of that.

        <strong>Always keep your resume' up to date.</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>make backups</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Always, always, always use good, unabbreviated, correctly-spelled <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a>s.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Learn</strong>. Never stop. There's no reason to; your time is running out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's kind of a contradiction, isn't it? Learning for the medium- or long-term doesn't make much sense if time "runs out" and you have a kissing date with the bumper of a moving bus tomorrow."</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Always</strong> use a <strong>verifiable, repeatable, known-good process</strong> to develop your product from requirements gathering to production test. If you can't verify that it's good then it ain't.
