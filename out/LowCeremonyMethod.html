        Low Ceremony Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> uses a lovely phrase in his book <a href="UmlDistilled.html">UmlDistilled</a>: "low-ceremony process".  I have been searching for a phrase that captures the difference between heavyweight bureaucratic processes and methodologies, and lightweight ones, but that is not so insulting.  Low-ceremony, high-ceremony is an image I like.  For a life-critical system, I am willing to consider a high-ceremony method.

        In general, lower ceremony methods are safer than higher ceremony, where (safety = shipping the software).  Although I believe that statement is true, I don't exactly know how to describe why it must be true.  It has something to do with people being <a href="GoodAtLookingAround.html">GoodAtLookingAround</a> and MethodsReplaceCommunication.

        Alistair to my mind makes a very good case for 'low ceremony' being better in a number of ways than any of the current alternatives. I enthusiastically agree - although making the <a href="LowChurch.html">LowChurch</a> metaphor explicit may not go down so well with either humanists or high churchmen. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        I don't know when I posted that top paragraph, probably late '97, but I have since made progress and written the <a href="MethodologySpace.html">MethodologySpace</a> article (mid '98), which gets closer to why low ceremony methods are safer than high ceremony methods, and now recommend them more forcefully.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>
