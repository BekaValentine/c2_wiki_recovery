        Con Tention

      <p>
        If more CPUs are applied to a parallel
        program than can be kept busy given that program,
        the excess CPUs are prevented from doing
        useful work by contention.
      </p>
      <p>
        Contention results in wanton consumption of CPU time
        for <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> (perhaps in the form of SpinLocks),
        and lots of
        blocked processes and/or context switches for
        BlocKing (perhaps in the form of
        <a href="SemaphoresForMutualExclusion.html">SemaphoresForMutualExclusion</a>).
        Either case results in poor <a href="SpeedUp.html">SpeedUp</a>.
