        Amiga Ee
      </h1>
      <p>
        AmigaE (see <a href="http://wouter.fov120.com/e/index.html)">http://wouter.fov120.com/e/index.html)</a> is a programming language by <a href="WouterVanOortmerssen.html">WouterVanOortmerssen</a>, who is possibly the most prolific language designer on this planet (see <a href="http://wouter.fov120.com/proglang/index.html).">http://wouter.fov120.com/proglang/index.html).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although there exists a theoretical platform-independent language specification called E, it has only been implemented for one platform (<a href="AmigaDos.html">AmigaDos</a>, for which the implementation is called AmigaE). AmigaE was developed gradually between 1991 and 1997, after which development essentially ceased.
      </p>

        Despite being abandoned about 7 years ago, it's elegantly simple design & easily readable syntax still make it stand out today as an example of what programming languages <strong>should</strong> be like. One of it's best features is it's brutally simple OOP model, which still manages to provide pretty much all the useful features of OOP (and none of the traditional cruft); this also makes it ideal for learning OOP.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can imagine it as having the readable syntax of Pascal, the low-level features of C, some of the high-level features of Lisp, and the elegant simplicity of Java. In more depth:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reference semantics, like Java, thus avoiding tons of tedious dereferencing & referencing seen in C (and even more in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           It has hardly any type system, which may sound like a downside, but anyone experienced with fighting <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>'s type system will find this a relief. This feature allows low-level polymorphism.
        </li>
        <li>
           Many unnecessary features are either missing or have a sensible default (in stark contrast to <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> which has every unnecessary feature but no sensible defaults).
        </li>
        <li>
           A good exception handling system, which avoid the complexities seen in Java and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Multiple return values, which avoids much of the need to pass pointers as parameters for returning values (unlike C).
        </li>
        <li>
           Default parameters, which makes it trivial to extend procedures/methods without breaking any existing code. Java really should have had this.
        </li>
        <li>
           No overloading, because overloading is only syntactic sugar, and can easily be misused.
        </li>
        <li>
           Sensible modularization system, which is neither as annoyingly strict as Java's, nor as overly complex as <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>'s.
        </li>
        <li>
           lots more....
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Something that AmigaE shows is that what a language leaves out is just as important as what it includes; unnecessary features make a language harder to use, the source code harder to understand, and it more likely to be abused by a poor (or lazy) programmer. In this respect Java is very much following in the footsteps of AmigaE (albeit unintentionally).
      </p>
      <p>
        Being so old, AmigaE is not without it's flaws (all of which could easily be fixed):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The type system is virtually non-existent; it could be greatly tightened without breaking most existing code.
        </li>
        <li>
           The OOP system lacks interfaces & generics; there is no reason these cannot be added simply.
        </li>
        <li>
           The OOP system has PUBLIC & PRIVATE, but lacks PROTECTED.
        </li>
        <li>
           The constants system is rather basic, but there are many ways this could be changed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I will write more if people are interested.

        <em>Do you have some good references for places where examples of Amiga E code can be found? Maybe add an entry to </em><a href="HelloWorldInManyProgrammingLanguages.html">HelloWorldInManyProgrammingLanguages</a>?<em></em>

        Entry added as suggested!

        There is a <em>ton</em> of AmigaE code freely available from the Aminet (<a href="http://de.aminet.net/aminet/dirs/dev_e.html),">http://de.aminet.net/aminet/dirs/dev_e.html),</a> but <strong>unfortunately</strong> 99.9 percent of this code is either (a) before OOP was added to AmigaE, (b) tiny ultra-specific classes that are of no use to anybody, or (c) written by people who really don't understand OOP (so what's new?:-) .
      </p>
      <p>
        So sadly, there is a total utter lack of any useful OOP classes for free, which basically means you'll have to write your own at the moment. At some point in the future I hope to change that myself.
      </p>
      <p>
        I could make available my now obsolete (and not very good) linked-list class as a big example of AmigaE code, but it is at the stage where it is too big to easily maintain, so that I don't know how useful it'd really be... A quick check shows it is 500 lines of code.
