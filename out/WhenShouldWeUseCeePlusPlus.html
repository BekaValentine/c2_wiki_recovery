        When Should We Use Cee Plus Plus
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WhenShouldWeUseCeePlusPlus.html">WhenShouldWeUseCeePlusPlus</a>? In combination with scripting languages, as a way to <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>. The most comely combo for me right now is <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> + <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> + <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, though of course the most popular way is ASP + VB + COM + <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.

      <p>
        You can, if you are perverse enough, build large systems in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. In fact, most of the systems I see these days are either that or <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, which is just as bad, and often worse for this (See <a href="WhenShouldWeUseJava.html">WhenShouldWeUseJava</a>). But it's an ugly habit and does you no credit in the eyes of the civilized folk. The right place for <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is those little bottlenecks you detect that you need to make go fast. <em>(not that C++ is always fast)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>'s great advantage is over C (<em>Speak for yourself! -- </em><a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em>). Any time you're tempted to use C, use </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> instead. The trouble is the language creators (<a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a> & <a href="AlexanderStepanov.html">AlexanderStepanov</a>) are perverts of the ilk described in the second paragraph above, and go through hoops of fire to try to make the language suitable for building large systems. <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a> seems not to have been in their thinking.
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="WhenShouldWeUseCeePlusPlus.html">WhenShouldWeUseCeePlusPlus</a>? For each really large and complex system where also speed is needed, like OSs, office applications, compilers etc. Often those are written in C, but as others pointed out, C++ is the better choice there. If you are not bound to speed, using Java may be an option. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem in using <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is, one needs to use an intelligent subset. To find the appropriate subset for one's problem is a tough task which needs a lot experience. That's why <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is that unpopular among many people. It is in no way a perfect language. But it is one of (or may be THE one) programming language with the richest, mightiest set of features - as well as probably the language where you can do the most syntax-correct mistakes. So in the hand of the experienced it is an incredible tool. 
        Just another thought: It is easy (though may be a lot of work) to write a library in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, which then allows programming "as if" I'd be using Java or Lisp or Perl and a lot more languages. The other way round it is impossible. -- <a href="NikolaiPretzell.html">NikolaiPretzell</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When I "care about performance", I put a test harness on my app, find the slow parts, and </em><a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a> until they go fast. I haven't done it in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> yet, but my experience in Smalltalk, when I've competed against <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> teams, is that my app is up, running, optimized, and in use by the client before the <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> team has even finished the initial builds. Most of my Smalltalk engagements were from clients who thought that they "cared about performance" and chose <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> - I usually got the call about two years later. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No knock to your smalltalk and refactoring skills Tom, but <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a> would let you do exactly what you do now, and still meet all the performance goals those C++ guys were supposed to hit. I don't know whether you can easily mate Smalltalk with C++ (The <a href="SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator.html">SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator</a> does not do smalltalk.) but I think the opinion above the line above still stands. While we've got you here, though, do you think there's a good reason to prefer <a href="SmalltalkInsteadOfPython.html">SmalltalkInsteadOfPython</a>? -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The immediate reason for me to prefer </em><a href="SmalltalkInsteadOfPython.html">SmalltalkInsteadOfPython</a> is that I can then avoid learning YetAnotherLanguage, which is becoming more and more difficult for me in my advancing senility (especially since my language input port is saturated with <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> at the moment).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I, too, use </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> in the context we're discussing here - what I meant to express is that I only use the "C" portions of it, though. I basically avoid all but the most primitive "object-oriented" stuff in it. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

      <p>
        If C++ had a standard, object-oriented, well-documented set of libraries for every possible thing (like Java and Python have) and nice, pleasant, serializable GC objects available (which can be implemented in C++), you might sing a different tune about it. The problem with coding C++ is that you have to hack together objects around a bunch of vendor-specific C-styled (non-OOP) libraries from a hojillion different sources, while the Java and Python coders get it all "BatteriesIncluded", as the python types say. None of this is because of the weaknesses of the C++ language, but because of the fact that the out-of-box (not to mention Boost) are all focused on speed and expressiveness, instead of being ready-to-use.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can implement Java-like pleasantness in C++. You can't implement C++-like expressiveness and speed in Java.

        And what about the template and generic programming features in the C++ language? How well are they supported in Smalltalk?
        I take it you've never written a server application? Or never had to do one where price/performance is an issue?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Smalltalk has no notion of templates in the C++ sense, because it doesn't need them; the Collection hierarchy is done just using standard Smalltalk objects, and it seems to do pretty well. Templates are only necessary in statically typed languages. And for the record, I write Web applications. We get hammered periodically, and we like the server to not break in half every time somebody gets interested in something I wrote. The bottleneck has never been my Python code; it has always been in the </em><a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> I store the crap in. Gigabit Ethernet? Gee, thanks, does it help Postgres do joins faster? -- <a href="GrahamHughes.html">GrahamHughes</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        FWIW you can readily combine C++ <a href="StlStyle.html">StlStyle</a> generic programming with Python data structures. See <a href="http://cxx.sourceforge.net/.">http://cxx.sourceforge.net/.</a> So there's no good reason to stick with verbose, error-prone C-style C++ when you <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a> with Python.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh, I don't know about that... the forever-and-a-day compile times with anything involving templates, the stunning immaturity of today's template libraries (see Kernighan and Pike's </em><a href="ThePracticeOfProgramming.html">ThePracticeOfProgramming</a> for a good example), the complete inability of today's compilers to generate useful error messages if a template sneezed near the error, the surprising things that happen when you throw exceptions across code that isn't expecting them (even other C++ code), the lack of a name-mangling standard (which makes writing a C++ library that two or more compilers can use impossible) - these are just the implementation problems. I can still come up with reasons to use C. And I hate C. -- <a href="GrahamHughes.html">GrahamHughes</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmm. Someone hasn't followed the proliferation of mature cross-platform <a href="StlStyle.html">StlStyle</a> libraries very closely. <a href="ObjectSpace.html">ObjectSpace</a>, <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a>, and especially <a href="StlPort.html">StlPort</a>!

        Maybe you should have a look at the <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> language. It is safe (an Ocaml program that compiles is nearly crashproof), far more readable, expressive and powerful than C++, and it is at least as fast (see Doug Bagley's <a href="GreatComputerLanguageShootout.html">GreatComputerLanguageShootout</a> for an extensive benchmark).

        I started programming in BASIC, then learned Pascal, C, C++ and Java. At this point I thought C++ is a fine tool for almost everything. Of course, that's a misconception, caused by the fact that I didn't know about many other languages. Sure, C++ is a substantial improvement over C or Pascal. It has a much better type system, but not nearly as good as that of the ML family. The compiler does much more checks for you, but not a many as an ML compiler does. STL-style algorithms are elegant, compose easily and can be reused with unprecedented flexibly, but that's nothing compared to higher-order functions. Objects and inheritance are quite nice, but limiting compared to records of functions with lexical closures. The list goes on and on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Add to that the typical failure mode of C++ programs: SIGSEGV, with absolutely no hint what happened. Sure, it's my own fault, stepping over the bounds of an arrays. But how come I don't overstep arrays in Haskell (where I would get an error message, not a core dump)? These days I'm increasingly convinced, C++ is not nearly high-level enough. Something has to be layered on top of it, be it Python, Tcl, Scheme, Haskell, whatever. But interfacing to C++ is a lot harder than interfacing to plain C. So when I'm writing a program, the bulk will be in Haskell (a personal preference, use whatever floats your boat) with some tight loops or some thin glue to existing systems coded in C. C++ no longer enters the picture, I'm just using the C++ compiler to get some more type checking and a bit relaxed syntax.
