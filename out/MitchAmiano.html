        I am a software practitioner with extensive background in content management, data conversion, database systems, printing systems, and SGML/XML technology. Long time hobbies  include artificial life, Fuller's synergetics, number theory, perennial gardening, and software languages. Clients have included Eastman Kodak, Xerox, Deluxe Business Systems (the cheque printers), Merlin Color, and others. Employers included Merlin Color and Alcatel USA. My current employment is at Agile Markup Corporation, of which I am the President.

        A good deal of my career has been spent developing quality control (ISO900x, CMM), workflow support, and defect/change tracking applications. I have experience in many software languages as well as database design. Since 1994 my attention has been on markup language technology. I'm fascinated by how markup can be used by humans, as a principle of executable designs and accessible workflow integration.
