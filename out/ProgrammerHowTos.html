        Programmer How Tos
      </h1>
      <p>
        Part of the success of the <a href="LinuxOperatingSystem.html">LinuxOperatingSystem</a> is due to the <a href="LinuxDocumentationProject.html">LinuxDocumentationProject</a> and its collection of <a href="HowTo.html">HowTo</a>s. The <a href="HowTo.html">HowTo</a>s offer information on how to install hardware and software, configure it, and get it running.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if you're a programmer it's rather hard to find information that tells you how to write various programs. <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> has the MicrosoftPlatformSdk, which at least explains the <a href="MicrosoftWindowsApi.html">MicrosoftWindowsApi</a>. But it still doesn't tell you everything you need to know, such as how to communicate with non-Microsoft stuff.
      </p>
      <p>
        There should be a collection of <a href="ProgrammerHowTos.html">ProgrammerHowTos</a>. A programmer can write one if he wants to share his programming knowledge. Then other programmers who want to learn will have another place to turn to besides the bookstore and the university.
      </p>
      <p>
        These <a href="HowTo.html">HowTo</a>s could even be placed on a Wiki, although not necessarily this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe they already exist somewhere. Please edit this page and say where if you know of any!

        This is a cool idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        One problem relates to context and categories. One reason for the success of the linux howtos, is that the context is limited to <em>install hardware and software, configure it, and get it running</em>. A series of howtos for programming would do well to be organised around some simple and well respected categories like algorithms and data structures (since <a href="AlgorithmsPlusDataStructuresEqualsPrograms.html">AlgorithmsPlusDataStructuresEqualsPrograms</a>), then delving into levels of increasing complexity.

        <em>The big hard ones are I/O, and the use of system facilities (such as multithreading). These are also the ones that are most likely to vary from platform to platform, and sometimes even on variants of the same platform. There are also Internet protocols which are the same everywhere but which may need to be implemented anew from time to time. How about:</em>

        In my <a href="BazzaWiki.html">BazzaWiki</a> I discouraged this by the technique of making wiki pages whos first paragraph was just an url act as links directly to that url. <em>Sounds like </em><a href="TransClusion.html">TransClusion</a>.<em> This made it easier to refer out to external info than to retype it. everywhere you mention eg </em>ApacheManual linked directly to the ApacheManual - and you could change the link location globally later on if you get a local copy of the pages. -- <a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>
