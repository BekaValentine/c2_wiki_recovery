        Wiki Warrior
      </h1>
      <p>
        An overzealous person who, in reference to his or her pet topic, removes criticisms and adds blindly positive commentary.  This is similar to astroturfing (i.e. a fake grassroots movement).

      <p>
        or better yet: WikiWussy
      </p>
      <p>
        (I initially put together this page after noticing a <a href="WikiWarrior.html">WikiWarrior</a> with a penchant for <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> removing even mild criticisms of said language.)

        <em>How can you say that?!?! There is no such thing as a </em>'mild<em>' criticism of Ruby! I demand satisfaction, sir!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>No, no!  Such a feeble paranoid, engaged in such un-Wiki like practices, does not deserve the honorific Warrior.  Seems more like an </strong>UnWikiWorrier to me!<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see warrior as more of a sarcastic title in this case.  A </em><a href="WikiWarrior.html">WikiWarrior</a> is not a self-assured person.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed; probably similar to the U.S. perjorative "Weekend Warrior" to describe military reservists.
