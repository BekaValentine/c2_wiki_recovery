        Objects In Groups
      </h1>
      <p>
        As was discussed in <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a>, it is very useful (especially in distributed applications) to organize agents in "groups".
      </p>
      <p>
        From <a href="DougLea.html">DougLea</a>'s paper of the same name:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>An object-oriented application may consist of a sea of objects; perhaps thousands or millions of objects. Subsets of these objects often possess discernible structure that is not well-captured by common object- and class-based concepts and notations... ...a group is a special kind of set, consisting of one or more objects ( members) bearing a common abstract relation, common external access policies, common connectivity, and common internal policies.</em>
      </p>

        You can read the paper here: <a href="http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/groups/groups.html">http://gee.cs.oswego.edu/dl/groups/groups.html</a>

      <p>
        Some practical examples of "objects in groups": 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           GroupCommunicationSystems, a fault-tolerance model implemented by toolkits such as ISIS, Horus, and iBus. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The <a href="UbiquitousComputing.html">UbiquitousComputing</a> vision of many different agents communicating world-wide in a self organizing manner.  See <a href="http://www.distributedcoalition.org">http://www.distributedcoalition.org</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="LindaTupleSpaces.html">LindaTupleSpaces</a>, or <a href="JavaSpaces.html">JavaSpaces</a>, for instance, could be considered minimalist object groups (in concept).  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This was one of those "aha!" concepts that opened my mind to the great possibilities of widely distributed computing.
