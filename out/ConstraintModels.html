        Constraint Models
      </h1>
      <p>
        Constraint Models are a method of programming in which two or more values are bound together in a manner so that a change in one value is automatically relected by a corresponding change in the others. Such models are common in certain types of mathematical and scientific modelling, and are a key feature of the <a href="SpreadsheetModel.html">SpreadsheetModel</a>.

      <p>
        A classic example of a simple constraint is the automatic conversion between two different units of measurement, e.g., degrees Fahrenheit and degrees Celsius. If the values are modelled as a constraint, then setting the value of one of the two - say, setting the Celsius value to 100 degrees - would <a href="AutoMagically.html">AutoMagically</a> cause the Fahrenheit value to be reset to 212 degrees, while changing the value of Fahrenheit to 98.6 degrees would cause the Celsius value to be reset to 37.0 degrees.
