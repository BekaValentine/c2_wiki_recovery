        Mac App

      <p>
        <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> was the first widely available <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> application framework. It was written in <a href="ObjectPascal.html">ObjectPascal</a>, a proprietary extension of the <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>, and ran on the Macintosh. In addition to being an application framework, it was a largely successful effort to demonstrate how to write an elegant, robust Macintosh application. Apple ported <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> to <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> for version 3.0.
      </p>
      <p>
        Brown University (IRIS) ported <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> to "Object C", a proprietary extension to <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, where it provided the infrastructure to Intermedia, a multimedia hypertext used by scholars for research and course work. <em>Given that this Object C is not the THINK/Symantec dialect and is not </em>NeXT's <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>, what is it? A language? Or well-structured C? Please enlighten.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Early versions of <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> encouraged several <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s such as inheriting from container classes. (<a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> often uses is-a where it should use has-a relationships.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Lisa Toolkit (<a href="AppleLisa.html">AppleLisa</a>?) included an application framework written in Clascal (Pascal with OO extensions). Clascal evolved into "<a href="ObjectPascal.html">ObjectPascal</a>". Mac Pascal and Lightspeed/THINK/Symantec Pascal could compile Object Pascal. Borland implemented and expanded upon this dialect in its <a href="TurboPascal.html">TurboPascal</a> series.

        <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> is being kept alive by a dedicated group of developers who have maintained and enhanced the framework since Apple stopped supporting it in 2001. <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> has been updated to fully support Carbon Events, Universal Binaries, Unicode Text, MLTE control, DataBrowser control, FSRefs, XML parsing, Custom Controls, Composite Window, Drawer Window, HIView Window and Custom Windows. <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> also has C++ wrapper classes for HIObject and HIView.
      </p>
      <p>
        At WWDC 2005, it took a single developer 48 hours to update <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> and the <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> example apps to support Universal Binaries.

        Apple's page bears the bad news that as of October 2, 2001 it will do no further development or maintenance of the code base.

        I "accidentally" made a link to this <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> in <a href="InexperienceGeneratesFailure.html">InexperienceGeneratesFailure</a>. I would not have created this page but given that it's here, can the WikiSharedMemory help with the following questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           When did Larry Tesler's Clascal become <a href="ObjectPascal.html">ObjectPascal</a>?
        </li>
        <li>
           This happened after a visit of <a href="NiklausWirth.html">NiklausWirth</a> to Apple, right?
        </li>
        <li>
           How much did <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> for the Macintosh derive from the earlier Clascal framework for the Lisa or was it a totally separate set of class libraries? (I only remember that Atkinson's <a href="QuickDraw.html">QuickDraw</a> was called by both)
        </li>
        <li>
           Was the <a href="CommandPattern.html">CommandPattern</a> in the original Lisa Clascal object framework?
        </li>
        <li>
           Was <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> the first known occurrence of <a href="CommandPattern.html">CommandPattern</a>?
        </li>
        <li>
           Who claims responsibility for originating this pattern? (Maybe we should start IhadThisPatternFirst)
        </li>
      </ul>

        An interesting bit of trivia is that Adobe <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a> was originally written in <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a>/<a href="ObjectPascal.html">ObjectPascal</a>. Here is an article about its development: <a href="http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec7/art7.htm">http://www.byte.com/art/9402/sec7/art7.htm</a> and details how <a href="AdobeSystemsInc.html">AdobeSystemsInc</a> ported it to <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a>.

        Whether this is another case of trivia, or interesting historic information, I don't know. But back in 1991 or 1992 a friend handed me a photocopy of an article, which I believe was authored by a group of <a href="MacApp.html">MacApp</a> developers, possibly including Larry Tesler and Larry Rosenstein, discussing the extension of <a href="ObjectPascal.html">ObjectPascal</a> to include many C++ features in a more "Pascal-like" manner, as a language called Pascal '9x. I have only been able to find two slight references to this proposal, both in issue 5, volume 2 (april 1991) of <a href="FrameWork.html">FrameWork</a> Magazine, now archived at MacTech Magazine (www.mactech.com). One of the links talks about <em>Derick White's several examples from his presentation "Report on Pascal '9x." </em>, the other is a parenthetical remark <em>(Compare this to Object Pascal; it has no such data hiding syntax, at least not until '9x comes around, so everyone has access to everything about the class.)</em> I still have the photocopy somewhere, but I wonder if it may be available anywhere on the web? -- <a href="LasseHp.html">LasseHp</a>
