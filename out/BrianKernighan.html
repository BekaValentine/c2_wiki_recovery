        <a href="BrianKernighan.html">BrianKernighan</a> is the "K" of "K&R" or <a href="KernighanAndRitchie.html">KernighanAndRitchie</a>, authors of the classic book on the <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <em>The C Programming Language</em>.  He's also done a LOT of other work over the years, almost all of it worth finding out about... maybe at: <a href="http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/index.html">http://cm.bell-labs.com/cm/cs/who/bwk/index.html</a>

        <em>I thought that </em><a href="BrianKernighan.html">BrianKernighan</a> and <a href="DennisRitchie.html">DennisRitchie</a> were the inventors of C and Unix, respectively. That's a lot more important than writing a book about C.<em></em>

        With Aho and Weinberger, he wrote <a href="TheAwkProgrammingLanguage.html">TheAwkProgrammingLanguage</a> in 1988 which remains the most concise description of the <a href="AwkLanguage.html">AwkLanguage</a> and a brief introduction to <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>.

        He also wrote the essay <a href="WhyPascalIsNotMyFavoriteProgrammingLanguage.html">WhyPascalIsNotMyFavoriteProgrammingLanguage</a>, which is worth reading even now, 20 years later.
      </p>
      <p>
        He invented the <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> program.

        Isn't <a href="KenThompson.html">KenThompson</a> also the co-inventor of C? A fundamental concept in UNIX's design is that it's NOT written in assembly, but in a higher level programming language, C.

      <ul>
        <li>
          Nope.  The original versions of Unix were written in PDP-8 assembly language.  Rewriting it in C was a purely pragmatic decision, and intrinsically holds no value towards what makes Unix Unix. --SamuelFalvo
