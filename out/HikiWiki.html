        Hiki Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hiki -- <a href="http://hikiwiki.org/">http://hikiwiki.org/</a> compact, feature complete wiki usable on low end
        browsers (dillo). On better browsers some Ajax goodies are available.
      </p>
      <p>
        The setup is easy, no dependencies except ruby, can use builtin webrick or external server. Needs to copy a few files and do some manual configuration before first startup.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feature list is overseeable but fully sufficient. Includes good history, bbs and issue tracking plugins, RSS and web admin interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very good hiki-mode.el for (X)Emacs freaks, lets you edit the wiki with the full comfort of a real editor. Usage of that mode could be slightly streamlined but well worth the effort if you enjoy (X)Emacs.

        Has some support on <a href="http://eigenclass.org">http://eigenclass.org</a> ( <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> ) (triggers virus warning) which is a pretty good ruby oriented site
        running hiki btw.

        Some Japanism's hidden inside code and docs, may need to fix content-type in a few places.

        Data storage is plain text files in a flat direcotory with some metadata in an extra directory. So far no data disasters but if anything happens this is very reassuring:) Also the content is easy to index or process with external tools.

        Hacking the code is fairly straightforward, no javaisms -- just plain old <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. Writing plugins is very easy.
