        Separate Static Content From Dynamic Content
      </h1>
      <p>
        When I get a few minutes I'll add more here.  However, suffice it to say for the moment that keeping these two separate is key to using <a href="JavaServerPage.html">JavaServerPage</a>s especially when combined with <a href="JavaServlet.html">JavaServlet</a>s and <a href="JavaBean.html">JavaBean</a>s in a <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> architecture.

        Microsoft <a href="ActiveServerPages.html">ActiveServerPages</a> encourage mixing static and dynamic content.

        I think Kyle and Eric are saying the same thing in a different way.  Both JSP and ASP define the static content and include markers where the dynamic content is placed (by COM components or <a href="JavaBeans.html">JavaBeans</a> respectively).
      </p>
      <code>
        <H1>This is static</H1><br/>
        <BEAN: insert dynamic here> (or <OBJECT: insert dynamic here>)<br/>
        <H1> Static again</H1><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        So in one sense, static and dynamic are separated, and in another, they are mixed.
      </p>

      <p>
        Netscape's Server-side <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> also allows (I wouldn't necessarily say encourages) static and dynamic content to be jumbled together.  
      </p>
      <code>
        <SCRIPT><br/>
        <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> to be run in the client browser<br/>
        </SCRIPT><br/>
        <H1>I'm static</H2><br/>
        <SERVER><br/>
        <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> to be run on the server as the page is being served up<br/>
        which might print more HTML or client-side <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a><br/>
        </SERVER><br/>
        <B>More static</B><br/>
        <SERVER><br/>
        More server code, (running in the same execution context, so all the 	<br/>
        variables from the previous <SERVER></SERVER> chunk still exist<br/>
        </SERVER><br/>
        <I>Help me!</I><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I fell into this trap once and quite enjoyed myself for a while - but never again.

        I think ASP allows you to do the same with <% server side VBScript %>.

        Kyle's comment above referring to MVC is important.  In web pages, the dynamic content is analogous to the Model.  The static content is all presentation: it's the View.
      </p>
      <p>
        The drive to separate these two things is one of the big draws (for some) of using XML on the server.  One server-side process generates the dynamic content as an XML document that contains no static presentation-oriented content at all:
      </p>
      <code>
        <ticket-quote><br/>
        <departure><br/>
        <location>DFW</location><br/>
        <time>11:45 am 11/05/1999</time><br/>
        </departure><br/>
        <arrival><br/>
        ...<br/>
        </ticket-quote><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (I just made that up; it's not an instance of any XML document type I know of.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Then something else --- another server-side process, probably, but perhaps also the browser --- takes that data and injects it appropriately into the static content.  In the browser, that process would probably be directed by some sort of stylesheet; the same could be true on the server, if desired.
      </p>

        I don't have much experience with this way of doing things, so I don't know how well it works in practice.  But the idea appeals to me.  -- <a href="GlennVanderburg.html">GlennVanderburg</a>
