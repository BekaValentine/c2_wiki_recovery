        Let's raise the tone of our converse<br/>
        By rhyming everything in verse;<br/>
        To rhyme is harder than to prose<br/>
        But pithier and less verbose;<br/>
        A poem, ripe with potent signal<br/>
        Displays wisdom in its original<br/>
        Text, received pure from the Muses,<br/>
        Unsullied by noise, rust, and abuses.<br/>

        Further rhyming enlarges the mind<br/>
        Exercising forebrain with the hind<br/>
        Mental quarters - what better than scansion<br/>
        To add some rooms to your mental mansion?<br/>
        In even doggerelish limericks<br/>
        Lie enlightning, delightful gimmericks<br/>
        Dispense with prose and all blank verse!<br/>

        <em>Rhyming is only one of several methods of forming sound linkages in poetry. Actually, a poem is defined as a bunch of text presented in structured form. So that if it is reproduced, the line breaks and positioning need to be reproduced as well. This paragraph is not a poem then.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, poetry has nothing at all to do with the presentation of text on a page. Poetry is a verbal medium; poems are meant to be spoken and to be heard. Line breaks help to determine the intended spoken rhythm of a poem, but "a bunch of text presented in structured form" is not a poem any more than "a bunch of lines and dots written on staves" is music.
      </p>
      <p>
        "No, not exactly.  Not all poetry needs to be read aloud or heard.  That is certainly where poetry was started, but poetry can be designed specifically for the page.  In this case formatting issues would be absolutely critical.  So although poetry can be a verbal medium, it is not defined that way, at least not these days.  Visual poetry is legit, too."

        Observing the above, the rhyming portion is a lot easier to grok than the <a href="HaiKu.html">HaiKu</a>. Rhythmic poetry in general seems too hard. But then others may find it easier to <a href="HaiKuMe.html">HaiKuMe</a> than <a href="RhymeMe.html">RhymeMe</a>. Try it and let's see!
