        [Please note: this is not a "discussion" board <em>per se</em>. Delphi is certainly a valid topic for the C2, but these pages are all meant to eventually become <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> as opposed to <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>. Perhaps you have some specific contribution you'd like to make concerning the use of Delphi?]
