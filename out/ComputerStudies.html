        <em>Sometimes.  It's mostly back to being called IT, but modern IT focuses on business analytics including </em><a href="BigData.html">BigData</a>, business intelligence, databases and data management, and user support including technical writing and trainer training.  There's little to none of the old-school standards: systems analysis and systems design with lots of E/R diagrams, DFDs, and SSADM.  <a href="ComputerStudies.html">ComputerStudies</a> has fallen out of favour -- nobody knew what it was.  Typical higher education degree choices offered in computing -- at least among institutions that know what they're doing -- are IT and/or <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, possibly with specialisation options in either or both.<em></em>
