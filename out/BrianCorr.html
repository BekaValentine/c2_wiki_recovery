        <strong>I live at </strong><a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, but I thought I'd set up a vacation getaway here....<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been reading up for a while at <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> and decided that this looks like a good place here
      </p>
      <p>
        I try to keep the following queries in mind as I work:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>--> Working on Wikis</strong>: <em>The Four-way test from Rotary International</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Is it the truth? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Is it fair to all concerned? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Will it build goodwill and better relationships? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Will it be beneficial to all concerned? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>--> Working with others on Wikis</strong>: <em>Queries from the Religious Society of Friends</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do I approach others with respect and concern? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Am I concerned with community and its needs? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Am I an agent for tolerance and acceptance? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Can I forgive others easily? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Is there harmony between what I believe and how I act?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>--> Five nice ideas from a Wikipedian</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Make others feel welcome (even longtime participants; even those you dislike)
        </li>
        <li>
           Create and continue a friendly environment
        </li>
        <li>
           Turn the other cheek (which includes walking away from potential edit wars)
        </li>
        <li>
           Give praise, especially to those you don't know (most people like to know they are wanted and appreciated)
        </li>
        <li>
           Forgive
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'd love to hear from you...
