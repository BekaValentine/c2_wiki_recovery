        Usb Keychain Drive
      </h1>
      <p>
        Also called USB stick or FlashDrive. A device the size of a thumb, so you can wear it on a keychain or put it into your pocket. It consists, mainly, of anywhere from 32 megs to 2 gigs of NAND Flash RAM and a USB connector. You plug one into your USB port and can then use it as just another drive.

        This is immensely practical already, as it is more portable (smaller, more practical form factor), more reliable (no moving parts) and much faster than floppy disks. It also gives you two to three orders of magnitude more storage space than a floppy disk. Wasn't it <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> who said something to the effect that when you have a large enough change in quantity, it enables a jump in quality, i.e. something completely different (quote, anybody?) <em>I don't have the quote handy, but I'm pretty sure it was Karl Marx. -- </em><a href="AndrewMcGuinness.html">AndrewMcGuinness</a>.<em> (I heard it was </em><a href="CarlSagan.html">CarlSagan</a> talking about Cars and Spaceships.) Following this logic the jump in speed and storage space, the <a href="UsbKeychainDrive.html">UsbKeychainDrive</a> is an open invitation to us, as programmers, to find new applications for the genre "portable storage space" which were not possible with floppy disks.

        <strong>The price</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As with any technology, the highest-end version carries a premium. Right now (late 2003), the price curve looks about like this (all prices in $US from pricewatch.com, but the general idea is universal)
      </p>

        So, on paper at least, the best value is about two steps down from the top. This pattern is true for most consumer computer hardware, by the way.

        <strong>Installation and removal</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        On a Macintosh or modern version of Windows (Win2K, XP, etc.; many models come with drivers for Win98/ME in the package), you just plug the device into a free USB port (even while the computer is running) and you are all set.  On Windows 2000, you should 'unmount' the drive by clicking on the "removable device" tray icon before removing, otherwise the last write you made may not be flushed to the device.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many recent releases of Linux (for example, Fedora Core 1 and the latest Suse) work the same way; for older versions, you have to make sure some the module usb-storage is loaded, and can then normally mount and unmount the drive, which is generally recognized as a SCSI device.

        Apparently, <a href="UsbKeychainDrive.html">UsbKeychainDrive</a>s have been determined to be a security risk by many companies, at some it is reportedly a firing offense to be in possession of one while in the office. (Lots of sensitive information, apparently, can be stuffed in a gigabyte.... :)

        I assume that CDs, floppies and encryption are similarly outlawed... but I'm probably wrong. -- <a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a>

        <em>My organization seemingly wants to ban USB sticks, but due to budget cutbacks, they don't have staff to evaluate exceptions to the rule as they come along. Plus, executives love them, and they usually call the shots. Battles between gizmo and technology-loving executives and the security staff can be fierce.</em>
