        Wooden Language Examples

        A collection of fine pieces of wood from around the <a href="WikiDom.html">WikiDom</a> (and possibly the <a href="WebTwoPointOh.html">WebTwoPointOh</a>).

        From Wikipedia's entry on object databases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Benchmarks between ODBMSs and relational DBMSs have shown that ODBMS can be clearly superior for certain kinds of tasks. The main reason for this is that many operations are performed using navigational rather than declarative interfaces, and navigational access to data is usually implemented very efficiently by following pointers." (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_database)</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        "the dead pretentious language of officialdom, dressed up to disguise poverty of thought and, often, the absence of any real meaning."? You can include almost the entirety of Wikipedia in that.
