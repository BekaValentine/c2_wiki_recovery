        Web Framework Roadmap
      </h1>
      <p>
        An attempt to classify features and tools of "web frameworks" to help one navigate this wiki for ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>RDBMS</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ActiveRecord.html">ActiveRecord</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Pros:
            </li>
            <li>
               Cons: Hiding SQL completely is a "smell" to some
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HelpersInsteadOfWrappers.html">HelpersInsteadOfWrappers</a> - utilities that help with the tedious aspects of SQL without attempting to completely wrap it away.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>GUI Interface</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Strait HTML
          <ul>
            <li>
               Pros: Simple if you already know HTML
            </li>
            <li>
               Cons: May make switching GUI's more difficult (<a href="SeparateDomainFromPresentation.html">SeparateDomainFromPresentation</a>)
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Counter: Happens infrequently in practice
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Mix of strait HTML and custom functions/methods, such as "drawFormRow" (see <a href="HelpersInsteadOfWrappers.html">HelpersInsteadOfWrappers</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           AJAX:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Pro: More desktop-like interaction capability
            </li>
            <li>
               Con: Immature
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Bypass HTML/DOM entirely
          <ul>
            <li>
               Java:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Pro: Can get a more desktop-GUI-like feel
                </li>
                <li>
                   Con: Tends to marry your app language choice to Java. Cross-vendor support still a work-in-progress.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

        Perhaps this should be named WebFrameworkPatternRoadmap or perhaps WebFrameworkPatterns  because it is not a list of specific products, but rather a list of techniques. Name needs more pondering.

      <p>
        <em>If this page is a list of techniques, I don't think the name should contain "Framework." I think of a framework as a big, honkin' downloadable or off-the-shelf dingus into which you plug some code and some templates and </em><a href="ItJustWorks.html">ItJustWorks</a>. -- Eliz<em></em>

        I don't think they are that simple except in the demos, or in the hands of those intimately familiar with it. But I agree that the title needs work.
