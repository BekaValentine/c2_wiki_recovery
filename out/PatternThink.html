        Pattern Think
      </h1>
      <p>
        My thought is that the notion of Patterns in Software (derived from Patterns in Architecture) can be analogized in other fields. My formal training is in law and computer science. I have some thoughts (<a href="GabrielWachob.html">GabrielWachob</a>) that the legal domain is in fact a great example of <a href="PatternThink.html">PatternThink</a>, and might even be described with a big huge Pattern Language. Of course, I might be totally missing the point here. I don't think so. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, I'm thinking that Pattern-style thinking might facilitate inter-domain communication. What do others think?

        Tom Erickson at Apple has a paper on patterns in workplace studies, where he points out that the most common use of patterns in architecture is for non-architects to communicate their needs/desires to the professionals.  Since inter-domain communication involves precisely that, there's certainly an opportunity.  There would need to be a higher-level approach to many of the patterns/pattern languages, perhaps only a level or so down from the application definition level, for this to work in the software area.

        <a href="PatternThink.html">PatternThink</a> definitely applies to solutions in very different domains: buildings, software, the design process, organizations, ... (Do these solutions have something like PatternNature in common??). There are even <a href="PatternsInChess.html">PatternsInChess</a>.

        Somewhere on wiki somebody wrote that he writes "with a strong <a href="SmalltalkAccent.html">SmalltalkAccent</a>". I guess <a href="PatternThink.html">PatternThink</a> can be described as thinking with a pattern accent. :-)
