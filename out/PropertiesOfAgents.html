        An agent can be a person, a machine, a piece of software, or a variety of other things. The basic dictionary definition
        of agent is one who acts. However, for developing IT systems, such a definition is too general: IT-related
        <a href="SoftwareAgent.html">SoftwareAgent</a>s need additional properties. Some of the properties that agents <strong>may possess in various combinations</strong>
        include these <a href="PropertiesOfAgents.html">PropertiesOfAgents</a>: 
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Autonomous</strong> - is capable acting without direct external intervention. It has some degree of control over its internal state and actions based on its own experiences. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Interactive</strong> - communicates with the environment and other agents. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Adaptive</strong> - capable of responding to other agents and/or its environment to some degree. More advanced forms of <a href="AdaptiveAgent.html">AdaptiveAgent</a>s can modify their behavior based on their experience. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Sociable</strong> - interaction that is marked by friendliness or pleasant social relations, that is, where the agent is affable, companionable, or friendly. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Mobile</strong> - able to transport itself from one environment to another. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Proxy</strong> - may act on behalf of someone or something, that is, acting in the interest of, as a representative of, or for the benefit of some entity. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Proactive</strong> - goal-oriented, purposeful. It does not simply react to the environment. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Intelligent</strong> - state is formalized by knowledge (i.e., beliefs, goals, plans, assumptions) and interacts with other agents using symbolic language. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Rational</strong> - able to choose an action based on internal goals and the knowledge that a particular action will bring it closer to its goals. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Unpredictable</strong> - able to act in ways that are not fully predictable, even if all the initial conditions are known. It is capable of nondeterministic behavior. (See also <a href="EmergentBehavior.html">EmergentBehavior</a>) </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Temporally continuous</strong> - is a continuously running process. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Credible</strong> - believable personality and emotional state. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Transparent and accountable</strong> - must be transparent when required, yet must provide a log of its activities upon demand. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Coordinative</strong> - able to perform some activity in a shared environment with other agents. Activities are often coordinated via a plans, workflows, or some other process management mechanism. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Cooperative</strong> - able to coordinate with other agents to achieve a common purpose; nonantagonistic agents that succeed or fail together. (Collaboration is another term used synonymously with cooperation.) </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Competitive</strong> - able to coordinate with other agents except that the success of one agent implies the failure of others (the opposite of cooperative). </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>Rugged</strong> - able to deal with errors and incomplete data robustly. </dd>
