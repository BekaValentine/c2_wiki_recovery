        This is a description of what one must do in the writing of an article or a wiki page. It is important that instead of just saying something, that you have something to say.
        When you have discovered and valued something because of its meaning and usefulness, you might find that describing it will enhance its value to you and make it available for others to appreciate and include in their own collections of valuables.
