        Wiki Mind Wipe
      </h1>
      <p>
        The process of systematically erasing a large amount of contribution to the <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> forum. The act is considered vandalism unless the erased contributions are one's own.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The concept was coined during its first occurrence around the Summer of 1999 (<a href="WikiMindWipeDiscussion.html">WikiMindWipeDiscussion</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki restoration from <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> or <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/history">http://c2.com/wiki/history</a> may at times reduce its impact.

        If you don't like <a href="WikiMindWipe.html">WikiMindWipe</a>s, one way to avoid them is to avoid making someone so upset that they'd contemplate one.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Doesn't that lead to stifling one's opinions based on fear of reprisal, the opposite of the trust Wiki is based on?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the contrary. Trying hard never to offend someone is a wikizen's duty to the community and to Jah. We should all try to pander to the community and Clorox our beliefs until we achieve uniformity - then we can prevent anyone from hurting us when they get upset.</em>
      </p>

        But seriously, let's not forget politeness and its contribution to <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>.

      <p>
        Why must life be seen by so many people to be a function of absolute extremes? It <em>is</em> possible to routinely avoid offense without compromising one's standards. If someone takes offense at a statement offered in a calm and rational manner, that is hardly worth worrying about. If we routinely speak in a confrontational and disrespectful fashion, we can do better.

        In either case, I take delight in expending 0 effort vandalizing something.  -- <a href="VincentLowe.html">VincentLowe</a>

        If I might add in a bit of variety here... there might be a case for mind wipes being fairly good for the community as a whole. The causes may be less than ideal, and although painful at first, the new growth that accompanies it can be quite worthwhile...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Mind wipes don't seem to have been necessary for Wiki to continuously grow in the past, and I don't see how they should help growth in the future. After all, who says what will come after a mind wipe will be better than what was there before?  </em><a href="JoelSpolsky.html">JoelSpolsky</a> has something about always wanting to rewrite a (software) system, and why you shouldn't, which seems applicable here...

        <em>Maybe </em><a href="WikiMindWipe.html">WikiMindWipe</a> can be considered <a href="WikiSpringCleaning.html">WikiSpringCleaning</a>? If the bulk of Wiki just keeps accumulating, maybe occasionally it's good for someone to go clear out some cobwebs, some hardened crud? Especially in <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> pages.

        I don't think so. In another life I dealt with vandals of a more physical kind; you would be surprised to know how infrequently they had higher motives. There is a great deal of difference between the careful but robust pruning of the loving gardener and the wanton destruction of a work of art. I cannot necessarily think that the latter re-energizes the creative spirit of a new generation of artists. Wanton destruction diminishes society; that's why society tries to protect itself against it. The dilemma is that sometimes the protection is equally destructive. - johnH [<a href="http://www.hulbert.net/].">http://www.hulbert.net/].</a>

        There should be a HappyMedium between total destruction and planned pruning. That's what we're learning from ForestFires in national parks -- <a href="PhilJones.html">PhilJones</a>

        <em>That's funny; I thought "</em><a href="WikiMindWipe.html">WikiMindWipe</a>" might be what happens if you spend too much time <a href="WikiWalking.html">WikiWalking</a>, I mean like twenty-four hours at a stretch, your mind might be wiped, so... -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a><em></em>

        Maybe that's "WikiWipeMind."

        Technically, all the texts contributed are here under a mutual agreement between every contributor and <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>. So to put it simply: if I or anyone else decide to withdraw our contributions here, this is a matter of private business. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

      <p>
        And if I wish to show what somebody else wrote in the past by posting the same text again, that's no different in principle from giving a url in the <a href="InternetArchive.html">InternetArchive</a> to see the same information. -- Anon

        May 2006: The latest victim of anonymous abuse is Colin Wright, a long time contributor who has chosen to wipe his contributions and attributions when leaving. Perhaps it is time to reconsider anonymous editing?
