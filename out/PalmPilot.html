        Note that Palm, Inc. has not sold anything under the "Pilot" brand for a few years, due to trademark conflicts with the company that makes Pilot pens.

        The markup on the hardware in a <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a> must be on the order of 1000%.  This is a particularly good example of the <a href="ValueDrivenPricing.html">ValueDrivenPricing</a> that applies to most high-tech goods and services.  (I'm not making a value judgement, it's just a phenomenon.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I have to question the 1000% number.  Palms sell in the range of $100 to $500 USD and that just does not jive with what I see as the cost of goods sold.  --<a href="ScottElliott.html">ScottElliott</a>

        This is interesting because technology people sometimes assume "objective" measures (MIPS, storage, speed) correlate directly to value to the customer.  In this case, most of the figures of merit for the hardware are fairly unimportant.

        <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a> notes that of course there are other costs to be recouped, including

           licensing fees for portions of the OS that Palm licensed to help get the product to market faster,

        <li>
           amortized software development expenses, to pay down the ongoing expense of developing and extending the <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a> platform,
        </li>
        <li>
           the cost of maintaining a support organization,

        <li>
           the cost marketing and public relations, so that the world knows what the Palm Pilot is
        </li>
        <li>
           the overhead necessary to maintain the organization then that number may be about right.

           The PalmIII did well in the ZDNet "destructive tests": <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/*http://www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,368951,00.html">http://web.archive.org/web/*http://www.zdnet.com/products/stories/reviews/0,4161,368951,00.html</a>

        Because <a href="MyMindKeepsWandering.html">MyMindKeepsWandering</a>, I have to <a href="WriteItDown.html">WriteItDown</a>, where "It" is pretty much everything. I tried to <a href="WriteItOnaCard.html">WriteItOnaCard</a>s (apologies for wiki-mangled grammar) as a <a href="PersonalAnalogDevice.html">PersonalAnalogDevice</a>, but I kept forgetting about the cards. I tried the LilaChapterTwo approach, but just couldn't make it stick. So, despite resisting handhelds for a long time, last year I bought a second-hand Palm Vx. I had great time with <a href="PalmWiki.html">PalmWiki</a> as a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>, using it as an organizer and digital <a href="JunkBox.html">JunkBox</a>. It was good for writing spur-of-the-moment haiku in, too. I never forgot to take it with me, because it had an excellent permanent, physical quality - it was a chunky little machine. Unfortunately, only a few months later I got burgled, and it was one of the things they took.

        Fast forward to this January and I'm now the happy owner of a Palm m505. Much the same thing but faster, with more memory, <a href="UniversalSerialBus.html">UniversalSerialBus</a> connection, and a color screen no less. It even has a SecureDigital slot for memory cards, which makes the limited internal storage a non-issue. It's five years out of date, but I love it. Generally I'm not very keen on devices, and I dislike the current trend of integrating everything - I don't <em>want</em> a camera in my phone, I have a perfectly good one already. On the other hand, I have my Palm, which seems to fall firmly into the slot of sophisticated enough to be useful - I can install real software on it - but not over-complex and junk-laden. Its essential simplicity - calendar, notebook, <a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a> list, contacts database - is superb, in addition to its satisfying shape. I firmly believe that it has the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>. <a href="IsAnythingBetterThanPaper.html">IsAnythingBetterThanPaper</a>? In this case, yes.
