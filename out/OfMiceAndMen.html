        Of Mice And Men
      </h1>
      <p>
        A line of the poem "To A Mouse" is often quoted: "The best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men" to mean that well-planned plans can go wrong.
      </p>
      <code>
        But, Mousie, thou art no thy lane,<br/>
        In proving foresight may be vain; <br/>
        The best laid schemes o' Mice an' Men,<br/>
        Gang aft agley,<br/>
        An' lea'e us nought but grief an' pain,<br/>
        For promis'd joy!<br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        'Gang aft agley' is Scottish and means 'Often go wrong'. 
      </p>
      <p>
        More directly translated:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          gang = 'to go'
        </li>
        <li>
          aft  = 'oft' (or often)
        </li>
        <li>
          agley = 'askew, awry' (i.e. wrong, badly. 'Gley' is 'squint', so more literally would be 'off squint')
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em> 'Aft' in this context has no relation to the nautical meaning of 'aft', but is a Scottish form of 'oft'.</em>
