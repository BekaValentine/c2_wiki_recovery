        Quantum Bogo Sort
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="QuantumBogoSort.html">QuantumBogoSort</a> a quantum sorting algorithm which can sort any list in O(1), using the "many worlds" interpretation of quantum mechanics.
      </p>
      <p>
        It works as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Quantumly randomise the list, such that there is no way of knowing what order the list is in until it is observed.  This will divide the universe into O(n!) universes; however, the division has no cost, as it happens constantly anyway.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            If the list is not sorted, destroy the universe.  (This operation is left as an exercise to the reader.)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            All remaining universes contain lists which are sorted.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        As described above, is not a <a href="StableSort.html">StableSort</a>. A stable version might be produced as follows:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            Configure the quantum randomiser to produce random code, rather than shuffle lists. Instruct it to generate some code.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            If the resulting code is not a stable <a href="QuantumBogoSort.html">QuantumBogoSort</a>, destroy the universe.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
            All remaining universes now have a stable <a href="QuantumBogoSort.html">QuantumBogoSort</a> algorithm.
        </li>
      </ol>
