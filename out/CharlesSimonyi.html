        Team leader of Bravo, the first WYSIWYG word processor (for the Alto at <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a>). Team leader for <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a> and other projects there. Inventor of <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a>, though he would argue he had a different purpose in mind for it than its current simple-minded application. Also started the <a href="IntentionalProgramming.html">IntentionalProgramming</a> project. And now a cosmonaut (<a href="http://blog.intentionalsoftware.com/intentional_software/2006/04/space_news.html).">http://blog.intentionalsoftware.com/intentional_software/2006/04/space_news.html).</a>

        "Mr. Simonyi's start-up, based in Bellevue, Wash., is called the IntentionalSoftwareCorporation. Its goal is to build software tools and technology to make the task of programming less complicated and more productive. These programming tools may use graphic images or charts, as well as text-based computer languages, to represent the underlying programs."

        Perhaps now we will see what is meant by <a href="TimeForaParadigmShift.html">TimeForaParadigmShift</a>. Charles was free to think, but now he will be free to innovate, and translate that innovation into knowledge as well as into <a href="ProcessImprovementTools.html">ProcessImprovementTools</a>. It would be well if his new company is organized as a <a href="LearningOrganization.html">LearningOrganization</a>. In any case, it should be a hotbed of activity and a place worth watching. Time will tell.
