        Currently, I am a programmer at medium-sized J2EE developing company in the Netherlands.  I used to be a Dutch PhD student in astronomy.  I found c2 when surfing the web for information on Python and XML programming.  I successfully applied some of the XP practices to both my programming exploits and my academic work.  I have used <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a> on my astrophysical research and it's going so fast! :-)  I'm still trying to fit XP into my work in the IT business.  The company I work with still adheres to some of the <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a> ideas, but release schedules are pretty agile due to influences of DSDM.
