        Stone Society Flaws
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> is an interesting idea but it swept a lot of stuff under the carpet. In particular:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How do you intelligently evaluate one option of one auction against all the other options of all the other auctions?
        </li>
        <li>
           How do you prevent monkey business - spam and so on - from appearing as options of auctions?
        </li>
        <li>
           How do you stop people bidding politically - ie. to disenfranchise minorities and so on?
        </li>
        <li>
           How do you prevent the prevalent value system - money - from dominating stone interactions?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Stones was only intended to work on a small scale ... but without answers to the above I don't think it's a complete solution, which I guess is why I haven't fielded a working system for it or even a representative set of functional tests. It remains, at best, a work in progress. --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
