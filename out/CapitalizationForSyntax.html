        Capitalization For Syntax
      </h1>
      <p>
        In some programming languages, how a symbol is capitalized has an effect on how the language is parsed (above and beyond the trivial case of keywords in a case-sensitive language; just because "class" is a C++ keyword and "Class" is not isn't sufficient to trigger mention here). Coding conventions not enforced by the compiler (i.e. declaring C macros in ALL_CAPS) don't belong here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, case-insensitive languages like <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> won't be listed here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> (see <a href="SelfUsesCapitalizationForSyntax.html">SelfUsesCapitalizationForSyntax</a>): The first word in a KeywordMessage is in lower-case; subsequent words are in upper-case, allowing Self to nest such messages without parentheses.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>: The names of types are capitalized, variables which range over types are in lower case. Integer -> Bool is the type of a function which takes an integer and returns a boolean; a -> Bool is the type of a polymorphic function that can take any type and returns a boolean. Also, functions and name-bound expressions must start in lower-case.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a>, <a href="ErlangLanguage.html">ErlangLanguage</a>: Variables are capitalized, the names of rules and terms are given in lower-case. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a>: Type and module names are capitalized, function and variable names are lowercase.  Since a module name usually equals a file name, all source files have to start with a lowercase letter or else things get Interesting.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>: Capitalized names are constants and lower-case names are variables. The Ruby interpreter uses this to resolve the scope of the variable. I.e., "MY_CONSTANT = 4" in Ruby is roughly the same as "global my_constant; my_constant = 4" in Python.
        </li>
      </ul>
