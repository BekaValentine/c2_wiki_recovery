        Ajax Client Engine Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="AjaxClientEngineDiscussion.html">AjaxClientEngineDiscussion</a> concerns itself mainly with opportunities, problems and solutions related to the use of <a href="XmlHttpRequest.html">XmlHttpRequest</a> object as the Ajax client engine. I understand there are other similar but lesser used alternatives (e.g., <a href="MacromediaFlash.html">MacromediaFlash</a>) which will be left out.

        The above was referenced by the ground-breaking Jesse James Garrett article listed in the parent <a href="AjaxWebApplications.html">AjaxWebApplications</a> page. It appeared to be an article that generated lots of discussion at XML.com. Further references were made there about various considerations, some are listed here in sections below for further exploration.

        A respondent to the anchor article suggested <a href="WebServicesSecurity.html">WebServicesSecurity</a> is required on top of what is presented. He was using <a href="XmlHttpRequest.html">XmlHttpRequest</a> to process <a href="SoapProtocol.html">SoapProtocol</a> messages, and complained that only Office03 MSXML parser kit has some desired security features, and that may not stay available in a future version.

        <em>Would use of </em><a href="AjaxWebApplications.html">AjaxWebApplications</a> expose application logic to a much wider audience that would otherwise be protected on the servers? If so, would that have assisted people with intentions to deceive through <a href="SocialEngineering.html">SocialEngineering</a> measures?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To the first question:  Not necessarily.  AJAX is about improving the user experience of applications that would otherwise be implemented mainly using raw HTML on the client side, with minimal or no Javascript and certainly no use of XMLHttpRequest.  The underlying server-side functionality, including security considerations, <em>should</em> be essentially the same.  Therefore, I am not clear how client-side implementation issues would necessarily expose application logic to a wider audience, any more so than server-side logic would be exposed to a wider audience on any given non-AJAX Web application.  Perhaps I've misunderstood the question?
      </p>
      <p>
        To the second question:  Successful <a href="SocialEngineering.html">SocialEngineering</a> will obtain (for example) the same system user IDs and passwords whether AJAX is used or not.  AJAX is irrelevant in this case.  However, again I suspect I may have misunderstood the question.
