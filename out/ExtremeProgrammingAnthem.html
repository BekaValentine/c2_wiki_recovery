        Extreme Programming Anthem
      </h1>
      <p>
        I feel the spirit of Extreme Practices is beautifully expressed in the following verse.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course we should, with apologies to the poet, reword the last three lines, before it can become an anthem for extreme practices.

        "
        Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high
      </p>
      <p>
        Where knowledge is free
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the world has not been broken up into fragments
      </p>
      <p>
        By narrow domestic walls
      </p>
      <p>
        Where words come out from the depth of truth
      </p>
      <p>
        Where tireless striving stretches its arms towards perfection
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way
      </p>
      <p>
        Into the dreary desert sand of dead habit
      </p>
      <p>
        Where the mind is led forward by thee
      </p>
      <p>
        Into ever-widening thought and action
      </p>
      <p>
        Into that heaven of freedom, my father, let my country awake.
