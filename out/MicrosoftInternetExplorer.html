        <strong>IE7 news and assessments</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        IE7 released Nov06.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beta of IE7 released end Jul05 indicates it breaks common search engines and instant messaging applications. And some complained about lack of adequate CSS2 support in that browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        From IE blog in May05, it was confirmed that tabbed browsing is in. There were also in the same article notes on compatibility, and it appears that applications built using Web Browser component (e.g. <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a>) will continue to work. See <a href="http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/05/26/422103.aspx">http://blogs.msdn.com/ie/archive/2005/05/26/422103.aspx</a>

        <strong>Brief History of </strong><a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(Please note: </em><a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> was built from the <strong></strong>SpyGlass Mosaic<strong> code. </strong>SpyGlass still exists in assorted incarnations (QNX has an implementation), but they left the commercial browser business after the Microsoft deal.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 3 was a major of release that successfully entered Microsoft into the browser wars. Netscape Navigator 3, released around the same time, was probably the superior product.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then Microsoft released <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 4 and included with it a number of essential upgrades to the Windows 95 <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>. The decision to bundle <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> with Windows 95, and later Windows 98, was a major factor in the <a href="MicrosoftAntiTrust.html">MicrosoftAntiTrust</a> case. <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 4 itself was a significant step up from any other browser, thanks to its support for DynamicHTML and improved support for <a href="CascadingStyleSheets.html">CascadingStyleSheets</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Netscape was slow in releasing its fourth-generation product, and released a long sequence of slow and unstable preview release versions that disenchanted many of its users. In early 1998 Netscape announced that it was releasing the code to Navigator as the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a> (though it would be a few years and a major rewrite before it was complete and stable.) Later that year Netscape was purchased by <a href="AmericaOnline.html">AmericaOnline</a>, which mysteriously failed to integrate the browser engine into their products (which embedded IE as the built-in browser) but was content to simply release mediocre 4.x release after mediocre 4.x release, and eventually AOL-branded versions of <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a> without any ValueAdded for users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, Microsoft released <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 5 (shipping in Windows 2000), 5.5 (shipping in Windows XP) and 6. Again, DynamicHTML and <a href="CascadingStyleSheets.html">CascadingStyleSheets</a> support was improved. But few significant features were added after version 4.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nowadays, <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 6 can be considerably improved by using MyIE2 (<a href="http://www.myie2.com/),">http://www.myie2.com/),</a> which provides an improved interface -- tabbed browsing, popup filters, and <a href="MouseGestures.html">MouseGestures</a>.

        Probably the first browser out there that supports the <a href="CommonUserAccess.html">CommonUserAccess</a> or anything like it. Specifically, after you fill out a form you tap <Enter>. You don't transfer a hand to the mouse, find the Submit button, and click (or hit <Tab>, <Space>). Nowadays, this is commonplace.

The behaviour is <em>by design</em>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        That is <em>insane</em>. IE gets the content type by making a request with a special user-agent?! What's wrong with a HEAD request? Didn't it <em>just get</em> the content type, and that's how it knows it needs to use a plugin?! Can't IE cache the data stream and forward it to the plugin once it's been initialized? The page doesn't say anything about IE 6, one hopes they've fixed this crap.

      <p>
        I'm trying to implement a dynamic two-way client-server HTTP connection. With <a href="NetscapeNavigator.html">NetscapeNavigator</a> this seems not so hard - the client can send form data on the fly and the server can send data on the fly by holding the connection open and serially doing 'write data'/'flush buffer' and/or sending a multipart/mixed MIME type message. My problem: it doesn't work with MSIE (Macintosh v5.0). When I do (python) sys.stdout.flush() MSIE keeps on waiting for more (possibly long-delayed) data. When I try multipart/mixed, MSIE says it doesn't know how to handle that MIME type. The MS documentation goes something like: MSIE doesn't support server-push, contact the coder of the website and tell them to re-write their content. It's very frustrating. Of course there are hacks and workarounds, but all I'm asking is for a simple buffer flush; is that so hard? Anyone have any insights? -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

        PageHolder is a feature in a more recent version of <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a> <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> that allows you to split the screen into two regions. The "PageHolder" region is perfect for pages with a lot of links (e.g.: <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>). When you click on a link in the PageHolder region, the link is opened in the right-hand region of the screen.

      </p>
      <p>
        Jeez, judgemental much? Perhaps it's an intranet page and one of those links is Windows Update. Anyway, it's possible with mozilla-based browsers to create a signed javascript that can request unlimited system access, including launching external programs. Of course, it's much easier to just put a note that says "requires IE: click start->run and type 'iexplore <url here>'" and you can even javascript it so you suppress the message if the useragent is IE. Done right, that works with every browser. I've tried launching apps from pages (even file-based pages) in IE, and believe me, it's much more painful than it's worth.

        I know (not in CC definition of knowledge) by reading that some IE6 and below APIs were "replaced". See also comment in <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> for <a href="WebApplicationProblemDomain.html">WebApplicationProblemDomain</a>

        <em>I've been frightened of </em>'everything<strong> Microsoft puts out, ever since "Win2000-certified software" installer scripts insisted on putting a load of indecipherable jibberish in the registry. Creating an installer these days is so mysterious that only a Wizard can do so. Then, of course, the crap probably doesn't uninstall completely, but who can tell when the registry is so full of jibberish? And since spring 2005, when I first played with Gmail, I've begun to get the heebie-jeebies from Google. But maybe it's me. Maybe I'm too old. Maybe my problem is I can't use an iPod... -- </strong><a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a><em></em>

        I am curently using Internet Explorer 8, but when I visit the download page for IE8 on Microsoft's website, I am shown the message "Internet Explorer 8 is not compatible with your system." It goes on to identify my operating system correctly and state "Internet Explorer 8 will not run on your system". No wonder people love it!
