        How To Share State Among Multiple Computers
      </h1>
      <p>
        State is normally held in memory or on disk on a single computer.  Although some architectures can share these resources, in multiprocessor or configurations etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="EntityBeansAreEvil.html">EntityBeansAreEvil</a> only because state cannot easily be shared amongst multiple servers, say on a WebFarm.  Maintaining TransactionalIntegrity becomes a very tough problem given this, and scalability is poor.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would not be a problem if state could be shared amongst multiple machines in some clever manner.  Is this really a software problem?  Or should it be a hardware problem?
      </p>

      <p>
        I presume by "shared state" you mean state in individual servers where you can assume state consistency -- that is, when state changes in one server then the other servers are somehow updated to the new state.

        The typical solution is to use a single database and pull data from that, but there are clever solutions which can keep objects in memory synchronized.  Usually these fall under the <a href="PublishAndSubscribe.html">PublishAndSubscribe</a> model.

        You might want to look at <a href="AtgDynamo.html">AtgDynamo</a> for a solution.

        <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> has been doing this since the mid-1980s.

        This is what distributed algorithms are all about!  A tough problem, especially if you want to be robust in the case of a network failure.
