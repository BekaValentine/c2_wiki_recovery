        The power of Words, Speech, Writing, and other expressions as used by an "average" human being.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           We can value concepts and ideas by describing how we think about them.
        </li>
        <li>
           The power in a language of the PrefixWord in making it possible to use a simple convention to extend or clarify the meaning of what it prefixes.
        </li>
        <li>
           That relatively short (less than 33) character words can by the use of prefixes be caused to include countless possibilities.
        </li>
        <li>
           A prefix can be thought of as a container holding other words, or <a href="PrefixedWords.html">PrefixedWords</a>. (Thus we extend the power of description), all without using mathematics! If math and the concept of extensible expressions is included, the sky is the limit!
        </li>
        <li>
           This is what I consider to be Wiki's greatest strength. It makes it possible to create descriptions via the PrefixedWord making it equivalent to a Dictionary full of Dictionaries, full of Dictionaries, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Add in Abstractions, Objects and Instantiations, and othere manipulative methods and structures in a mechanical or AutomationMachine such as a Computer, and you have the UltimateComputerProgrammingLanguage. (UCPL) Extend it, and you have UCPL1+, .... ,UCPLn+. (grin). Then build the machine to have multiple cores Core2, Core4, Core16, ..., Cornnnn. (Double grin)
        </li>
        <li>
           We haven't yet considered the other end of the thing - <a href="SuffixedWords.html">SuffixedWords</a>!
