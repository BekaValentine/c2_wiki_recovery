        Alan Kay Is Tron
      </h1>
      <p>
        The protagonist in the <a href="TronMovie.html">TronMovie</a> is named Alan, and is fighting against the command-line oriented <a href="MasterControlProgram.html">MasterControlProgram</a>. This was a deliberate allegory of the life of <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>. Alan and one of writers of Tron (BonnieMacBird -- <a href="http://us.imdb.com/Bio?MacBird,+Bonnie">http://us.imdb.com/Bio?MacBird,+Bonnie</a> ) subsequently were married.

        I could be wrong, but "Tron" sounded like it came from the early 8-bit Microsoft BASIC (MBASIC) commands "TRON" (Trace on) & "TROFF" (Trace off).

        Yes.  There were other such references; I think I recall a character named "Rem", which was the only way to do comments in primitive, benighted BASICs.  (also fearlessly dating myself ;-) -- <a href="JoelNeely.html">JoelNeely</a>

        No need to date yourself, the <a href="CommodoreSixtyFour.html">CommodoreSixtyFour</a> had both REM and TRON/TROFF.  <em>And that's not dating oneself? ;-)</em> Well, at least you could range in age quite a bit.

        I'd wager dollars to donuts that the 64 didn't have those trace statements. The 128 did, and it's possible that some of the intermediate machines (+4/16) did too but I'm not up on their versions of BASIC.
      </p>
      <p>
        You're right. If you want to trace, you can GoSub to this line sometimes: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           FORI=4096TO8192:PRINTCHR$(PEEK(I));:NEXT:RETURN
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>128 BASIC also had computed GOTO (A=100+I:GOTO A)</em>

        Steven Lisberger acknowledged in an interview about the original movie, which is on the Collector's Edition DVD, that people have thought "TRON" came from the "Trace on", "Trace off" commands "on computers", as he put it.  He said the original inspiration actually came from the word "electron". -- MarkMiller

        Just a note here, after my recent purchase of the TRON 20th anniversary DVD I listened to the directors commentary in which they stated that while "Allen" was in fact named for Alan Kay the term TRON does not in fact refer to the acronym for Trace ON as at the time of filming they were not even aware that such a thing existed. It is actually a much less dramatic shortened version of the word elecTRON. I know it steals some of the nostalgia doesn't it?

        I am TRON.

        TRON - based on WKRP scene, illustrating ignorance is not necessarily bliss.

        "NeuTRON , elecTRON, proTON"

        TRON is Swahili for "Dude". Jeff Bridges is, "The Dude".
