        I'd just like to point out that my colleague, <a href="JohnSarkela.html">JohnSarkela</a>, is known to select very special days at work to wear in one of his favorite tee-shirts - "Don't make me get my flying monkeys!"

        It also inspired a rather cool (if kitsch) film, Zardoz, with Sean Connery.

        This book (or I guess more accurately, the movie) turns up as a big influence in WizardAndGlass, the fourth Dark Tower book from <a href="StephenKing.html">StephenKing</a>. Which series is, without a doubt, my favorite King work. -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a>

        <em>It would be nice to see this movie remade. The movie is highly abridged and the book is by far more enjoyable. Sadly, the movie is so popular that a corrected remake would seem fraudulent to so many people </em>They used silver shoes instead of ruby!<em> The use of red shoes was due to the fact that red rendered better in the colour film than silver.</em>  Margaret Hamilton, who played the witch, complained about the switch.  She loved the books.

        Don't forget that The Wizard Of Oz is an American film icon; this leads to all kinds of <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>s when discussing anything that might reflect something from the movie. Standout examples include "There's no place like home" and "Pay no attention to that man behind the curtain." One hears phrases like these all the time in engineering circles.
