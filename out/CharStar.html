        Char Star

      <p>
        Wiki spelling of "char *", how one spells "string" in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> (and how string is often spelled in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> as well, despite the existence of the string class).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CharStar.html">CharStar</a>s are, of course, null-terminated sequences of bytes--the representation of a string in C.  Much C folklore centers around their care and feeding (and around how to avoid <a href="BufferOverflow.html">BufferOverflow</a>s and <a href="NonNullTerminatedString.html">NonNullTerminatedString</a>s--both common sources of crashes in C/C++, not to mention popular targets of crackers.)

      <p>
        String literals in C/C++ do two things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Allocate space for the specified string (including a null terminator) and
        </li>
        <li>
           cause the address of said string (the char *) to be returned.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Interestingly enough, when initializing a structure, a string literal can be used to initialize both a "char *" member (in which case the structure member gets the address) or a "char [n]" member (in which case the string data gets copied - with surprising results if it doesn't fit.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In the post-<a href="AnsiCee.html">AnsiCee</a> days (and in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>), this is more correctly spelled "const char *" or "char const *", as a string literal is presumed to be immutable.  Depending on the environment, writing to a string literal may result in a <a href="SegmentationFault.html">SegmentationFault</a> or similar error (or worse, <a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a>), as string literals may be put in ROM or in write-protected memory segments.  Many compilers have a "writeable strings" option for compiling old C/C++ programs that assume that string literals are writeable.
