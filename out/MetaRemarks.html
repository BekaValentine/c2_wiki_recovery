        Meta Remarks

      <p>
        Meta-remarks are ideas about your notes, or remarks about your ideas which you've recorded in a <a href="LogBook.html">LogBook</a>. You see, it's often not enough just to write down every thought that occurs to you or record every action you do. Some reflection may be needed. (Hmm? Why is that? As this meta-remark illustrates, it is while reflecting on what you done or thought that you can get good ideas about what works or doesn't work, what not to do so often or what to do a whole lote more.) -- <a href="EdPoor.html">EdPoor</a>
