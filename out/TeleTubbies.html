      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>

        You have a television that shows PBS and it is some time in the morning, usually around 10:00am.
      </p>

        <strong>Forces</strong>

      <p>

      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Watch the Teletubbies. The use of primary colors and very little dialog/narration is useful for developing your mental faculties and expunging all of that bad stuff floating around in your head and body.

        British developed children's show, based around 4 childlike characters named Dipsy, Laa-Laa, Po, and Tinky-Winky. Any adult who watches will immediately be repulsed, perhaps recognizing the <a href="TeleTubbies.html">TeleTubbies</a> as they really are - Eloi.

        Several of the SesameStreet monsters have trouble with grammar. Elmo, particularly, seems to have an issue with pronouns.

        I gather current belief (e.g. from <a href="StevenPinker.html">StevenPinker</a>) is that <a href="TeleTubbies.html">TeleTubbies</a> has no ill effect on children's language. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        I don't really worry so much about the <a href="TeleTubbies.html">TeleTubbies</a>' effect on language, but I find it interesting that the show was created because very young children didn't have anything to watch on television. Instead, they were forced to do other things like interact with the real world, including with physical objects, the outdoors, and other human beings. Thank God they can watch television now!

        On the other hand, I think the show is quite good for adults in various states of pharmacological agitation. -- francis

        The most insidious aspect of the <a href="TeleTubbies.html">TeleTubbies</a> is their devotional attention to that sing-songy pipe-thing and the weird wind-wheel.  Whenever either of these start operating, the Tubbies go into a "consumer trance" and become almost religious in their attention.

        I am very thankful that my daughter skipped over Teletubbies for Blue's Clues. There's a section in <a href="TheTippingPoint.html">TheTippingPoint</a> that talks about the educational research that went into Sesame Street, and how Blue's Clues was created to crank the notch up on some of those ideas.
      </p>

        <em>Research went into Teletubbies, too. That's why it appeals to children and not to adults. One important difference is that </em><a href="TeleTubbies.html">TeleTubbies</a> is aimed at a much younger audience than Sesame Street. (Also, younger than the programme it replaced in the UK, which is partly why audiences were so shocked over here.)<em></em>

        I find those people interesting who have violent reaction to Teletubbies on the grounds that it is somehow "dumb" (even in the literal sense of that word) even though they still talk to their children in motherese. I guess it's just a luddite reaction? -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        Complaining about Teletubbies on TV is like complaining about Christianity pages on Wiki. The more violent the reaction, the stronger the analogy.

        Have you noticed that one of the <a href="TeleTubbies.html">TeleTubbies</a> is shown mirror-imaged in the opening shots in every episode? -- vk

        Which of the teletubbies characters are supposed to be female? This has to be deduced by listening carefully for the very rare use of words such as 'his' or 'her' which imply gender. Even a woman on the BBC general enquiries team, who claimed to be a fan of the teletubbies, insisted on the wrong answer to this question.
