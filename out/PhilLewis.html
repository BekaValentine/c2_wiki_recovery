        Currently working for <a href="KnowledgeManagementSoftware.html">KnowledgeManagementSoftware</a> in Manchester, UK.

        I saw <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> at Application Development 99. I was impressed by the ideas (this was the first time I'd met Xp), but unfortunately, I was an <a href="ArdentDuffer.html">ArdentDuffer</a> at this time, and highly skeptical about Xp.
      </p>
      <p>
        Times change, and nearly a year ago, we decided to pilot Xp, and saw that it was a Good Thing. So eight months ago we started in earnest, and now we would not ever think about looking back.

        A bit about me.

        I worked in theatre as a stage manager before rediscovering computers a few years ago. I do other things as well, notably <a href="TaiChi.html">TaiChi</a> (Chen and Peking). I have mad crazes about things, currently photography. No doubt the minute I convince my wife we need a darkroom, my passion (for photography, not my wife) will be directed elsewhere.

        However, it is a sad fact that I just love writing software, and actually count that as my main hobby.
