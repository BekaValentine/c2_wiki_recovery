        I develop embedded software. For the last 14 years, I've worked on telecommunications products, but in a few weeks I'm starting on something completely different: portable data loggers, and engine control units.

        I don't have a web page (though now I've got a Wiki one, with a bit of luck). I can be contacted at <a href="mailto:robertd@actrix.gen.nz">mailto:robertd@actrix.gen.nz</a>

        I'd like to find a design notation that is supported by a smart editor (like EasyCase) and is at least as expressive and <em>natural</em> as Tom deMarco's Structured Analysis. I like Data Flow Diagrams, State Transition Diagrams, and Structure Diagrams. I am not comfortable with the current emphasis on Objects, but I enjoy and value the abstraction process. I wish I had more time available to do this well.
