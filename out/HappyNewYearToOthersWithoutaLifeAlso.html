        Happy New Year To Others Withouta Life Also
      </h1>
      <p>
        Happy New Year to my geeky homies out there. Cheers to not having a life! (clink clink)
      </p>

        <em>Ditto! This is the first year in a while I've had no life on New Year's Eve! (glug glug)</em>

        Here's the marital bliss from which I look enviously upon your lifelessness. Xmas for me is _supposed_ to be when I catch up on all my side-projects. Instead, my loving family makes me drive 2,000 miles, total, for no apparent reason, through featureless countryside, and in blithering disregard to all the mass-transit options. Oh, and because of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/General_Motors_streetcar_conspiracy</a> , we can't just take one fucking train ride, like people can in civilized countries.

        Then I finally get to pick the New Year's venue, mercifully across the street from our world HQ...

        Not having a life is a life goal, huh?
