      </h1>
      <p>
        In honor of Simon Bond's classic book <em>One Hundred and One Uses for a Dead Cat</em> (ISBN 0517545160 ), <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> brings you:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>101 uses for black holes</strong>  Only 14 uses have been suggested so far; which means there are 87 more to go.

              <ul>
                <li>
                   Then you call the roto-rooter guy, he comes and pumps out your black hole, and trucks it to who-knows-where.  (Though one wonders how well that giant hose would work in the vacuum of space...)

           Great golf-course hazard.  "And here's Tiger's approach shot...  he's got to be careful here; this shot will take him awfully close to the EventHorizon of the <a href="BlackHole.html">BlackHole</a> here at Pebble Beach--I'd suggest that he try and hit it to the edge of the green.  He lines it up... looks good..." <ball disappears mid-flight>  "Oh!  It went straight into another universe, Bob!  That's a one-stroke penalty; he'll have to hit a perfect approach on the next shot just to have a chance at making <em>bogey</em>!" <crowd groans; Woods curses under his breath>
