        Mozilla Nightly Build
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Mozilla Nightly Build is one of the new web browsers from <a href="TheMozillaProject.html">TheMozillaProject</a> [1]. They are <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, and the nightly builds are new binaries produced every day so that people can test them and report bugs.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One distinction between the Mozilla nightly build and other nightly builds is that Mozilla is built on all supported platforms, using a heterogeneous build farm.
