        A type of <a href="WikiMember.html">WikiMember</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not as bad as a <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a> but even more annoying and pig-headed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Like a <a href="WikiPolice.html">WikiPolice</a> guy (and yes it's always a guy) gone horribly bad, or a <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a>-wannabe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially sometimes a <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a> acting under the guise of <a href="WikiPolice.html">WikiPolice</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Writes in first-person <em>plural</em>.  Pretends to speak for the "whole entire wiki".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Has</em> to have the last word.

        <a href="WikiBoar.html">WikiBoar</a>s love top-posting to a page (TopBlurting). Often in bold or italics for that extra emphasis.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anonymous (IP address only) <a href="WikiBoar.html">WikiBoar</a>s go one step further by often blurting their thoughts right in the middle of other people's sentences. Anonymous <a href="WikiBoar.html">WikiBoar</a>s also especially don't hesitate to resort to vandalism when they feel they are not in control.

        It's a classic case of egocentrism. They are incapable of perspective-taking, or seeing the page from other readers' perpectives. So it doesn't matter to them if a page becomes completely incomprehensible to other readers.
