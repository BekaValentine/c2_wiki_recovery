        Listen, Code, Test, Design. These are the four Extreme practices as expressed by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You listen to many things -- the code, your pair, your customers. Another thing that is important to listen to is the team itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is important to have regular, semi-formal feedback sessions to evaluate how the team is doing. How is your development approach working out? How are your tools working out? 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="DoIt.html">DoIt</a> team tries to apply this practice at the end of each <a href="DevelopmentInterval.html">DevelopmentInterval</a> -- not that they always succeed. The team sits around a table and asks the following questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What worked well?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What didn't work so well?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What do we want to do differently next time?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We decided that calling this session a <a href="PostMortem.html">PostMortem</a> was just too depressing, and so used the term <a href="PostPartum.html">PostPartum</a> instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        I especially like this term because it so effectively captures the ambiguity of your feelings at this time. Ecstatic that software has been delivered, but at the same time a little disconnected and sad... -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a>
