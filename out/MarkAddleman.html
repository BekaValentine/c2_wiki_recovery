        Dear WikiDiary,
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I performed my first <a href="WikiRefactoring.html">WikiRefactoring</a> moving particurlarly interesting discussion (at least to me) from <a href="RefactoringMercilesslyHidesTheForest.html">RefactoringMercilesslyHidesTheForest</a> to WhenIsRefactoringFinished (<em>now moved to </em><a href="WhenToStopRefactoring.html">WhenToStopRefactoring</a><em>).  Before I refactored, I browsed Wiki and found </em><a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a> and <a href="GoodWikiCitizen.html">GoodWikiCitizen</a>.  Although I broke the first rule <em>Don't refactor live threads</em>, I thought the discussion was important enough to deserve a page of its own and was careful not to touch any of the content of the pages.  I made sure to MakeWikiPageBackups, so if anyone is terribly upset over my refactoring, I can put things back the way they were.

        Dear WikiDiary,
      </p>
      <p>
        I have begun thinking about refactoring the whole discussion of <a href="ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch.html">ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch</a> to remove the <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> stuff.  It's a huge task, but, lately, I've had TooMuchTimeOnMyHands and I need to do something I feel is productive.
      </p>
      <p>
        Along the same lines, I've been reading of the older pages and I <a href="FeelLikeWritingSomething.html">FeelLikeWritingSomething</a>, but I learned long ago that thinking you have something to say and actually having something to say are two different things.

        Dear WikiDiary, 
        I haven't visit in 10 years and so much has changed in my life.  I feel like revisiting an old friend or, more specifically, old friends.  While it violates the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>, I want to reread pages that influenced me 10 years ago.  Some are here but others, I'm <a href="LookingForPages.html">LookingForPages</a>.
