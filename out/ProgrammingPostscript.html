        Programming Postscript
      </h1>
      <p>
        Does anyone know of any good online sources to learn to use postscript for programming?
      </p>
      <p>
        At <a href="http://www.rightbrain.com/pages/book-download.shtml">http://www.rightbrain.com/pages/book-download.shtml</a> you can download the PDF version of the excellent 'Thinking in <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>'.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you run Windows, don't be tricked into thinking you have to pay $50 or the eMatter version (what a scam!). The PDF will work perfectly well.

        Linux focus had an intro article.  It doesn't cover postscript as a programming language, and I'm not sure that it is really "correct" but oh well.  <a href="http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/May1998/article43.html">http://www.linuxfocus.org/English/May1998/article43.html</a>

           Actually, it <strong>is</strong> about programming in Postscript, but it focuses on the core issues of drawing graphics and rendering fonts rather than on the loops and conditionals that might be considered the core of other languages. This is appropriate for an introduction to Postscript, since those are the kinds of things that people almost always want to do in their first postscript programs. I only skimmed it, but I didn't see anything incorrect in it. Looks pretty good to me, I give it two thumbs up.

        There are the <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> faqs, <a href="http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.postscript.html">http://www.faqs.org/faqs/by-newsgroup/comp/comp.lang.postscript.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there is also All About Postscript.  Haven't read it thoroughly, but it looks like it might be good.  <a href="http://www.quite.com/ps/">http://www.quite.com/ps/</a>
