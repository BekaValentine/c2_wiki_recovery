        Pascal Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Pascal is the most famous--and arguably the most influential--of the <a href="WirthLanguages.html">WirthLanguages</a>. Its initial implementation was completed in 1970, on a CDC 6000-series mainframe at ETH in Zurich, Switzerland, and soon reported by <a href="NiklausWirth.html">NiklausWirth</a> (1971a).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Pascal source code, and a later <em>p-kit</em>, were widely distributed. Wirth (1971b) wrote that his new language, named after the mathematician <a href="BlaisePascal.html">BlaisePascal</a>, was designed, in part, "[t]o gain more insight into the methods of organizing large programs and managing software projects." Just a few years later (1975), he had not gained much objectivity about its shortcomings. More than a decade later, Wirth (1982) insisted that Pascal was "designed as a general-purpose language", but it was widely used -- perhaps mostly used -- as a <a href="LanguageForTeaching.html">LanguageForTeaching</a> in the 1980s (i.e., as a tool to introduce students to <a href="ImperativeProgramming.html">ImperativeProgramming</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Pascal was originally an <a href="ImperativeLanguage.html">ImperativeLanguage</a> in which the source code for an entire program was expected to be contained in a single file, to allow <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> (i.e.: <a href="CompileTime.html">CompileTime</a> type-checking).  That was sometimes too restrictive, because in Pascal as originally designed, array <em>dimensions</em> are part of an array's <em>type</em>. Thus, the language did not allow generalized array-handling or character-string-handling <em>functions</em> or <em>procedures</em>. Pascal does allow explicit storage allocation, via the predefined <em>new</em> procedure, and later its reverse by the <em>dispose</em> procedure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because of the proven usefulness of <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> for avoiding run-time errors, programmers began increasingly to try to use Pascal for serious programming beyond what was supportable by a <a href="LanguageForTeaching.html">LanguageForTeaching</a>. A <a href="ModularProgramming.html">ModularProgramming</a> construct was very high on the list of extensions made to Wirth's Pascal to make it practical for teams of programmers to develop software in Pascal. The <a href="UcsdPascal.html">UcsdPascal</a> <em>unit</em> was a very usable example of a modularity extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, several extensions for <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> were developed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="TurboPascal.html">TurboPascal</a> (the <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> features arrived in version 5.5).

        Pascal has numerous descendants:

           Pascal Plus (1984)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Pascal also seemed to provide an almost spiritual heritage for other languages:

           Ada (<a href="AdaLanguage.html">AdaLanguage</a>)

        This predates the last revision that added some object-oriented stuff.

        One thing I loved about Pascal was sub-functions (sometimes called <a href="NestedFunctions.html">NestedFunctions</a>). See <a href="LongFunctionHeresy.html">LongFunctionHeresy</a>. They simplified a lot of scope and function name collision issues.
      </p>

        One thing I love about Pascal is the order of declarations. It forces programmers to design before coding using a technique known as top-down design/bottom-up implementation.  Code developed using bottom-up techniques is much easier to verify for correctness because it supports "unit testing," which is not supported very well by top-down implementation methods.  Top-down coding requires one to perform "string testing" to verify correctness.   String testing is both more labor intensive and less reliable.

        <em>This is the result of Pascal using a single-pass compiler.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {I found that feature annoying. I like the "main" stuff at the top and the details at the bottom. Just about every other writing technique puts the details toward the bottom, why change that?}
