        Drive By Slander
      </h1>
      <p>
        A slur in passing, usually in a context that precludes an opportunity for rebuttal.
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Deliberately misspelling the name of a company or product in a suggestive way, especially as part of discussing an unrelated topic.  For example, if I were talking about a Windows application, and I deliberately misspelled Windows as ``<a href="WinDoze.html">WinDoze</a>,<em> I would be making a slur against Microsoft.  Anyone who wanted to rebut this slur would have to change the subject of the conversation, and would be starting out in a defensive position.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Making a disparaging remark about a politician while talking about something unrelated to politics (``Speaking of politicians, my next song is about stupidity<em>).</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This technique works particularly well when you expect your audience to be sympathetic and respectful of your opinions about the main topic.  In such a context, you can say all kinds of implicitly nasty things about other topics, and people will almost always be too polite to say anything.

        <em></em><a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>:  Comes from "drive-by shooting", a not-uncommon occurrence in some inner cities where persons are shot from the window of a passing car while minding their own business.  In most cases, such shootings are not random--and in many (but certainly not all) cases, the victim is involved in some form of gang activity or criminal enterprise and is shot by rival crooks.<em></em>

        Please remember that slander implies "false accusation" - It's not slander if it is true(Microsoft has a monopoly), or obviously comedy(i.e. Micro$oft Wind0ze). DriveByInsult would be a better name for what this page describes. Also, slander is spoken, libel is printed.

        <em>That's an </em><a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a> in itself.  Truth is not always an absolute defence, and in any case defamation is still defamation.<em></em>

      <p>
        Luckily in America truth is an absolute defense. (Usually). Yay FirstAmendment!
