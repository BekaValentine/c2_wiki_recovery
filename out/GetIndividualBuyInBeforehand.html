        Get Individual Buy In Beforehand
      </h1>
      <p>
        When you need unanimous agreement from each member of a group, get each individual to buy in beforehand. Do several rounds of meetings with each member alone, building up to a situation where they each individually become convinced that only an idiot would say no. When the time for the group meeting and vote arrives, the whole issue is settled.
      </p>
      <p>
        Almost any other approach risks getting at least one "no" on the judgement day.
