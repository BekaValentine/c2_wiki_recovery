        Joel Spolsky On Extreme Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>'s leading blogger advocates gets much less credit than he deserves for promoting each of XP's values and practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<em>I haven't found Spolsky's articles particularly pro-XP. And since this page is called "Spolsky on XP" and not "Spolsky for" or "against XP", I suggest it's rather disingenious to try to suggest he's supporting XP. So, while it's perfectly OK to give both pro and con quotes, let this page be more about debating whether he's either.</em> <a href="DeleteWhenCooked.html">DeleteWhenCooked</a> that's the point he openly hates XP, while espousing its practices anyway. Please don't ruin the joke!]

The reason is that they think the old code is a mess. And here is the interesting observation: they are probably wrong. The reason that they think the old code is a mess is because of a cardinal, fundamental law of programming: <strong>It's harder to read code than to write it.</strong> This is why code reuse is so hard. This is why everybody on your team has a different function they like to use for splitting strings into arrays of strings. They write their own function because it's easier and more fun than figuring out how the old function works."

           In "Five Worlds" Spolsky expressed doubt at Kent Beck's claim that <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> development (in particular <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>) can prevent software bugs almost completely. He follows with examining the bug database at his own company and concluding that very few of the entries would have appeared under XP. First, some of them were features, due to their liberal use of their bug tracking software for tracking ideas as well. Second, of the entries that were bugs, some appeared only under specific use conditions that would most likely not occur to any developer to test for. Third, in specific development environments some of the bugs would be dismissed altogether, since the conditions they occur in would not be considered relevant. And it is these environments that XP is most likely to be used in, which means Kent Beck is right, but <em>only in particular circumstances</em>, which makes Joel end with these cautionary words: "When somebody tells you about methodology, think about how it applies to the work <em>you're</em> doing."

           "Priority list in hand, we set out to more or less work down the list in order until about March, when we plan to stop adding new features and start the integration and testing phase. We'll write specs for each (nonobvious) feature right before implementing that feature. (The nattering scorekeepers of the BDUF/Agile beauty contest are now thoroughly confused. 'Was that a vote for BDUF? Or Agile? What does he want? Can't he just take sides for once?!')"
