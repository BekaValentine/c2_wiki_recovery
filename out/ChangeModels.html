        In a conversation with my son, just minutes ago, I was caused to think about how fast and how proliferated change has become.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The thing that could make the changes necessary to handle this constant occurence and make it both nearly painless and cost-effective would be the creation of </em><a href="ChangeModels.html">ChangeModels</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this an age of nearly instant messaging, plus the face-to-face Video-Audio conversations and group-to-group Video-Audio conferencing information and planning dialogs sessions, the landscape is a-changing, even more quickly than we could have imagined just a few years ago. People are occupied more and more in KeepingUp with change.
      </p>
      <p>
        In order to cope, it is essential that the hardware, software and the infrastructure to handle the WayThingAre be created so that change is anticipated.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is a place for the exposition and development of ideas about the Models and FormFactors that will best handle change in the NearTime as well as the FarTime.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some <a href="ChangeModels.html">ChangeModels</a> have already revolutionized the way commerce is transacted. There is no reason why we cannot make model changes by creating models which are designed to handle the constantly appearing change in people and society so that they can be enabled to live fully and freely, with the minimalization of change related costs, whether they be monetary, physical, mental or psychological.
