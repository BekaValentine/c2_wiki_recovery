      <p>
        A Java library and code generator that allows you to run your <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> tests as if they were written in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> for <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>. The code generator produces both <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> code and Java code. The C++ code can be compiled with your <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a> tests to produce a shared library which the generated Java code uses to implement the Test interface. You can treat the Java class just like any other Test. It can be run on its own or combined with other Tests to form a suite.

It contains some utility classes that are used by the generated C++ code.
