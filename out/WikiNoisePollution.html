        <a href="WikiNoisePollution.html">WikiNoisePollution</a> refers to the <em>EXTERNALITIES</em> mentioned in the <a href="GeoffBrownWikiExperiences.html">GeoffBrownWikiExperiences</a>. It was a true "exit-interview" of an individual whose name has been masked out out of respect for his privacy.

        <strong><em>Too many Externalities</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Externalities</em> - Economist speak for behaviors whose cost is born by people not directly involved in a transaction -- like air and water pollution. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hand-wringing about" behavior and a few cases of ambush (snotty comments and deletes on pages marked only by IP addresses in the logs...) were cited by the original contributor.

        Without drawing attention to individual participants, can we characterise different types of offensive behaviour, and ways we can manage our reactions to them?

        hi! i'm a new user. i'm persistent and generally non-stupid unless green cordial is supplied. i am enjoying leeching information from this site, but i must say that the reason i am hanging around to leech, and not moving onto something broader or more to my creative side, is the people who have spoken to me. even though it seems they have spoken to me from 'different sides' of the 'fence', if you 'get' what i 'mean', they have been relaxed and encouraging me to participate in the community activity as much as i feel i want too. -- <a href="SusanRoy.html">SusanRoy</a>

        <em>aka Beverage Truth Debate </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I did not know (nor interested) in the details of <em>"Jon Stewart recently made a quip about Coke and Pepsi debating "beverage truth". " <from entry made by someone in MicrosoftSlave </em>, but am concerned that we at times get religious in small things when there are larger challenges or threats facing the community as a whole. -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
