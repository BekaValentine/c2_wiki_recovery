        Massively Parallel
      </h1>
      <p>
        As opposed to minimally parallel, one must suppose. 
      </p>
      <p>
        No, that would be maximally parallel. Massively parallel, of hardware architectures, means that there are many, many processing elements, rather than just a few. A <a href="ConnectionMachine.html">ConnectionMachine</a> is massively parallel. A dual-processor server isn't.

        <em>I suppose it's like the distinction between a </em><a href="WorkStation.html">WorkStation</a> and a <a href="PeeCee.html">PeeCee</a>, then: A moving target that slides to be just a bit "better" than what is on your desktop right now.<em></em>
