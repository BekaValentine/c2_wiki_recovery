        Evil Or Stupid
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s, wherein it asserted by the speaker that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Speaker's position is the "right", "correct", "best" position, etc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Furthermore, the goodness of the speaker's position should be evident to anyone with half a brain.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           To actively oppose that which is good makes one EvIl.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Due to the manifest and obvious goodness of the speaker's position found in premise #2--anyone who believes that another position is better must be stupid.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           To oppose the speaker's position therefore means that a) the opponent is opposing that which is good; or b) is too dumb to tell the difference
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Opponents of the speaker's position are either evil or stupid. [Usually unspoken follow-on: Which one are <em>you?</em>]
      </p>
      <p>
        This arguments is fallacious because either of the first two premises (on which the whole argument is based) could be wrong -- either the speaker's position could be incorrect, or there could be reasonable disagreement on the question; or there could be no clear way to discern what is best. Usually, users of EvilOrStupid want to deflect attention from <em>these</em> deficiencies; and therefore use EvilOrStupid to put the opponent on the defensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        EvilOrStupid is a type of <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a> attack; as it shifts the topic of argument from the question at hand (the merits of some X) to the merits of the opponent.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One clever retort to EvilOrStupid is to note the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A person who is both evil <em>and</em> stupid will a) wish to oppose that which is good, and b) not be able to tell the difference.
        </li>
        <li>
           Such a person will conclude that !X (where X is the speaker's position) is the best one (because he is stupid), and therefore support !!X (because he is evil).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A person who is both EvilAndStupid might well agree with the speaker!
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, this argument is as fallacious (if not more so) than the EvilOrStupid argument above. But it's amusing nonetheless...
