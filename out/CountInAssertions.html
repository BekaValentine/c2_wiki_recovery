        Count In Assertions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Say there's a bug that causes a program to hang, but it's hard to reproduce.  It might be worth inserting assertions in code that traverses a linked structure to check that the length is less than some (very large) maximum:
      </p>
      <code>
        int chk_count = 0;<br/>
        while (p = p->next) {<br/>
        twiddle(p);<br/>
        chk_count++;<br/>
        ASSERT(chk_count < 1000000);  // way too large<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If the assertion fails, then you know that somehow the program's got a cycle in the list, or something else has gone wrong.  Hopefully the assertion failure produced a core dump, and you can grovel through that to find the problem.
