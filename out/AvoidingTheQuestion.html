        Avoiding The Question
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s.  Actually, this one isn't an argument at all--it's the practice of ducking a question that one cannot, or would prefer not, answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ways to avoid the question.  Often these are combined for greater effect.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Attack the speaker--ArgumentAdHominem
        </li>
        <li>
           Respond with a question of your own--expecting the speaker to answer <em>your</em> question before you answer his.
        </li>
        <li>
           Question the legitimacy of the question (sometimes this is legitimate)
        </li>
        <li>
           Use a defense such as "isn't it obvious?" or "Everyone knows that"
        </li>
        <li>
           Attempt to change the subject
        </li>
        <li>
           Provide a non-answer (or a vague generalization that may or may not apply to the particular question--and which if it does, can be denied later).
        </li>
        <li>
           Provide generic references to the literature or some other authority
        </li>
        <li>
           Terminate the discussion ("Sorry, I have to go now...").  Especially popular with talk-show hosts.
        </li>
        <li>
           Answer the question you wish had been asked instead.  The answer should be long enough that the real question is forgotten.  Especially popular with politicians.
        </li>
