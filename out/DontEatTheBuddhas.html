        <em>Saturday I walked to the travel bookstore downtown to purchase a map</em>
        of Australia.  I thought that it would be useful in combination with
        other resources (guidebooks, the web, you :) to add to our list and
        figure some things out -- I was having a hard time conceptualizing
        where things were in relation to each other.  At the cash register,
        they had these little red, yellow, and orange clear plastic buddhas.
        There was a sign next to them reading "Please don't eat the buddhas --
        they are not gummi, they are plastic!"  I laughed at the sign, and the
        guy manning the register pointed at a buddha-shaped lollipop taped up
        on the wall.<em></em>
