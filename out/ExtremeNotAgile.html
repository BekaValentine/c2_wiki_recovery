        Extreme Not Agile
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've just been involved in an <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           we didn't <a href="PairProgram.html">PairProgram</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           we didn't <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           we didn't <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           we used no <a href="IndexCards.html">IndexCards</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           we didn't have an <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a> or a <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           we didn't use the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           we didn't measure <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a> or use a <a href="BurnDownChart.html">BurnDownChart</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We stuck stories and tasks into a hacked on trac, which was also used for bug tracking. We used <a href="DabbleDb.html">DabbleDb</a> to check off tasks micromanaged by our non-technical CTO. We used heroics to supplement poor planning, spiked as a way of life, and grumbled into our beers almost constantly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, we were <a href="CowboyCoder.html">CowboyCoder</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I and everyone said that was just fine because, hey, we're doing <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a>, not <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. Well, gee, sorry, but cowboys are agile desperadoes riding for a fall. That may look good compared, with, say, a PRINCE2 PMO nightmare with Gantt Charts up the wazoo. And maybe that's all it takes to be agile - to not do <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But I sure wouldn't do <a href="AgileDevelopment.html">AgileDevelopment</a> again. I only want to do <a href="ExtremeNotAgile.html">ExtremeNotAgile</a> from now on.

        For the other equally nonsensical Agile pole, try <a href="BigAgileUpFront.html">BigAgileUpFront</a>.
