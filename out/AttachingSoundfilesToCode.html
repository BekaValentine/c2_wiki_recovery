        Attaching Soundfiles To Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        What I really would like to try out is attaching little soundfiles with spoken comments to classes/methods. Does anybody have any ideas (or even experience) on how to do this?

        You could embed the URL to a sound file in the comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then write an editor macro to identify sound urls (i.e. with a regular expression) and play the audio file in response to user input such as a mouse click.
