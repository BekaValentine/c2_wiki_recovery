        Java Programmer

      <p>
        A person dedicated to implementing the perfect automatic coffee bean machine (Like <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> but different).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the perfect automatic coffee bean machine must start with growing the beans themselves, as the quality of the beans is a crucial aspect of the quality of the resulting coffee. Sweeteners such as sugar can typically be supplied in a processed form, but other products used in the manufacture of coffee (such as milk) may need to be produced by the machine itself.
