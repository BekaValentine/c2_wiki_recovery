        Limited Success
      </h1>
      <p>
        A project outcome in which Development are happy (relieved it's all over), but either Management (who were expecting to get paid for their delivery) or the Customer (who was expecting a delivery for their payment) is unhappy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LimitedSuccess.html">LimitedSuccess</a> gets "declared" rather than having reached a designed termination point in the project plan. While all objectives of the effort have not been accomplished, there are a number of measurable, positive and productive developments which would not have occurred otherwise. 
      </p>

        Some would say the C3 was a <a href="LimitedSuccess.html">LimitedSuccess</a>, since it did produce usable product up to the time it was terminated. It was limited because it was shutdown before all work was completed to everyone's satisfaction and before funding of the project ceased.
