        Inductive Reasoning Aptitude
      </h1>
      <p>
        Inductive Reasoning Aptitude is the aptitude for taking large amounts of very often incomplete data and intuitively making sense of it, rather than using logic or some other recognition aptitude. It is essential for air traffic controllers and very important for programmers, scientists, doctors, auto mechanics and IT people. It is disruptive for salespeople because it can often lead to a critical nature and having salespeople being naturally critical of their customers and products doesn't work.
