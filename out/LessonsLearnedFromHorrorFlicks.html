        Reading about the <a href="TortoiseAndHare.html">TortoiseAndHare</a> alg. and watching a Friday the 13th movie on the same day lead me to this <a href="AhHa.html">AhHa</a> moment regarding why the ever so slow moving psycho, in this case Jason Vorhees, always catches up to the running-for-their-life victim.  If you accept that  the psycho is the tortoise and the victim the hare, it becomes obvious that all trails in horror flicks contain cycles.
