        Illegal Argument Exception
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Java exception which should be deliberately thrown by methods that don't like their parameters. It extends <a href="RuntimeException.html">RuntimeException</a>, which means it does not need to be caught.
      </p>
      <p>
        The singular name notwithstanding, can represent unsatisfied constraint between more parameters.
        The more you use and check the parameters, the more you move towards exception in the method invocation proper.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many cases, code that is throwing <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> should be argument-checking and throwing this, with a decent explanitory message. 
      </p>
      <p>
        See: <a href="IllegalStateException.html">IllegalStateException</a>

        I always want to "throw" this exception (preferably at my opponents' heads) during philosophical debates. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        I actually do prefer throwing <a href="NullPointerException.html">NullPointerException</a> when one of the arguments of a method is null, but filling in the explanatory message.  To me, its semantic is more correct: you tell the caller it passed a null parameter, which is, in many case, the sign that something is wrong in the caller code.  -- Julien Delfosse

        Null is not an "illegal argument" it is a non-argument. NPE is specific to the problem and IAE is not. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of times that null would be valid is relatively small. Seems like the exceptional cases (where null is valid) are the ones I should say something about. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If I attempt to do something with a null that you pass me I get NPE for free without writing boilerplate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        NPE is expected behavior when I attempt to do something with null. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The cost of the VM throwing an NPE when it attempts to dereference your null arg is not significant. The only reason checking the arg would be a performance advantage is if you did a bunch of expensive stuff before you attempted to use it. In that case your method is probably doing too much.
