        Eyes Wide Shut
      </h1>
      <p>
        Quite possibly the worst movie ever made. A tremendous disappointment compared to every other <a href="StanleyKubrick.html">StanleyKubrick</a> film (though I haven't seem <a href="AiTheMovie.html">AiTheMovie</a> yet). Finally saw the ending last night after falling asleep during it a couple of times previously; this movie definitely deserves its place on the <a href="TheWorstEnding.html">TheWorstEnding</a> page. -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        What in the world was this movie about?

        I liked it. I'd watch it again, which is not something I say often.

        <em>What did you like about it? The ridiculous overacting? The complete lack of chemistry between Cruise and Kidman? The way every scene was drawn out to twice the necessary length in a lame attempt to heighten suspense? Yeah, I liked all those things too.</em> (ad hominem)

        I also liked it.  The acting was only tolerable but the cinematography was gorgeous.  I liked it all the more once I realized it was the <em>Alice in Wonderland</em> story--complete with the white rabbit, mad hatter, caterpillar, even a red queen (king) shouting "off with his head".  Think of Cruise as Alice, or even better, as Kidman/Cruise as Alice ("this curious child was very fond of pretending to be two people") and suddenly all sorts of things fall into place. (Kidman's character is even named Alice, by the way.)
