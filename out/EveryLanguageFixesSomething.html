        It was a nice idea, but this page ended up being full of quibbles over minor points, claim and counter-claim about intent, and finally I got convinced that it was a complete waste of time when someone wrote that it was impossible to get it right because we could never read a language designer's neurons.

        I find this concept important, even if the arguing over the details is meaningless.  It reminds me of the first CS class I ever took, where the teacher said that the purpose of computers is not to communicate or store data or do math, but to <em>solve problems</em>.  The programming language is the tool we use to express a solution to some problem.  Every language is built with a certain type of problem-solving in mind.  It is important to remember that.
