        Marylebone Cricket Club
      </h1>
      <p>
        A private club, familiar throughout the world as the MCC, that for many years became the de facto rulers of the game of cricket from the aptly named Lords Cricket Ground in London.

        The MCC are not England and vice versa. However the MCC was probably the first club and has played a pivotal role in the development of the game.  See <a href="http://content.cricinfo.com/england/content/team/1166.html">http://content.cricinfo.com/england/content/team/1166.html</a> and <a href="http://www.lords.org/mcc/about-mcc/">http://www.lords.org/mcc/about-mcc/</a> for more detail and history.

        The Marylebone Cricket Club wasn't the first. Isn't Hambleton the oldest club at 225 years old?

        I was fortunate enough to stay in a flat right next to Lords while working in London. I was so inspired after 3 weeks of watching matches that I purchased some equipment at LillyWhites in PiccadillyCircus and now occasionally hook up with "the other MCC" in my home town Portland, Oregon.
