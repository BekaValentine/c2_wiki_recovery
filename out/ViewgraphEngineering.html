        It can be defined as the situation where the developers are involved in producing documents or viewgraph for the management. They are not actually working on what they know best i.e. development. This is the problem when we have document-driven software development, rather than process or architecture driven. Documents are the only tangible way of representing various software development components, but without the actual construction of the software, all the documents are useless.
