        Well, truth be told, Forth isn't that readable.
      </p>
      <p>
        At all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now there's a reasonable, well-supported statement.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you really mean to say "Most examples of Forth one finds on the web are difficult to read", then I'd agree.  But I'd also say that C, C++, and Java are not readable either, as most examples of those languages wouldn't meet your criteria of readability as presented below.  If you are going to critcize a particular language as being unreadable, you should be able to identify other languages that are readable.</em>

      <p>
        Some call it a WORN (WriteOnceReadNever) language.
        But then, that's how you sort out boys from real men.

        It is possible that only <a href="InterCal.html">InterCal</a> could qualify as a serious contender.

      <p>
        <em>Some reasoned argument, examples, and attention to the distinction between lets-you-write-unreadable-code and makes-you-write-unreadable-code would probably help the anti-readability case.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How true! But as I say elsewhere, the problem of Forth is the kind of people it attracts. They are usually bright, vocal, and don't give a sh*t about readability.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes an average programmer to get the machine to understand. It requires an outstanding programmer to get other human beings to understand. Forthers, though clever, rarely belong to the latter category.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it is true that <a href="BadCodeCanBeWrittenInAnyLanguage.html">BadCodeCanBeWrittenInAnyLanguage</a>, and the <em>obfuscated C contest</em> is the proof that one can do worse, the (Forth history induced) game of fitting everything inside a 16 x 64 matrix -- the early Forth Home Machines -- has resulted in people trying to cram everything in an as short as possible space -- throwing away everything not strictly necessary (e.g. no convenience routine, no comment) -- and no, so-called "shadow-blocks" while a neat trick, are an insult to the maintainer. -- verec
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It is possible to write any stack-based parser in Forth, whether LL or LR. Then you can make it parse the words the way you want them parsed. Because you can define any word you like and redefine any word that's already defined, illegibility in Forth code is the fault of the code's author. <a href="BadCodeCanBeWrittenInAnyLanguage.html">BadCodeCanBeWrittenInAnyLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, it is not always productive to make programs easy to read at the expense of efficiency. Let the high-level code be easy to read, but make the low-level code fast. It is always possible to dissect Forth code if you cannot "read" it. Some C expressions aren't readable either.
      </p>

        Here's an example of a readable Forth program that says "Hello World:"
      </p>
      <code>
        : hello  ." Hello, World!" ;<br/>
        hello<br/>
      </code>

        Here's an example of a readable Forth program that sings <a href="NinetyNineBottlesOfBeerOnTheWall.html">NinetyNineBottlesOfBeerOnTheWall</a>:

        Here's an example from <a href="StartingForth.html">StartingForth</a> (modified slightly for readability purposes):
      </p>
      <code>
        : FILL           FAUCETS OPEN  WAIT-UNTIL-FULL  FAUCETS CLOSE ;<br/>
        : RINSE          FILL AGITATE DRAIN ;<br/>
        : DO-WASH-CYCLE  WASH SPIN RINSE SPIN ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I would say this is more "readable" than the C or Java equivalents:
      </p>
      <code>
        void fill() {          void rinse() {        void do_wash_cycle() {<br/>
        open(faucets) ;        fill() ;              wash() ; <br/>
        wait-until-full() ;    agitate() ;           spin() ;<br/>
        close(faucets) ;       drain() ;             rinse() ;<br/>

      <p>
        <em>[I restored the above, since the meaning of the next paragraph seems to depend on it.--GP]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        See how Forth has less "noise" (punctuation) than other languages.  However, the lack of punctuation and standarized conventions for indentation and whitespace is one of the things that makes it easy to write hard-to-read programs in Forth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's too contrived, though.</em>

        Not really.  A microprocessor-controlled washer could have code very much like this.  Assuming memory-mapped I/O, the example could be fleshed out something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        : FAUCETS    10000 ;         \ address of faucet-control port<br/>
        : LEVEL      10004 ;         \ address of water-level sensor port<br/>
        : DRAINVALVE 10008 ;         \ address of drain-control port<br/>
        : OPEN       255 SWAP ! ;    \ store 255 to port (causing faucets/drain to turn on)<br/>
        : CLOSE      0 SWAP ! ;      \ store 0 to port (causing faucets/drain to turn off)<br/>
        : NOT-FULL?  LEVEL @ 100 < ; \ return true if level less than 100%<br/>
        : NOT-EMPTY? LEVEL @ 0 > ;   \ return true if level greater than 100%<br/>
        : WAIT       1000 MS ;       \ do nothing for one second<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        : WAIT-UNTIL-FULL  BEGIN NOT-FULL? WHILE WAIT REPEAT ;<br/>
        : WAIT-UNTIL-EMPTY BEGIN NOT-EMPTY? WHILE WAIT REPEAT ;<br/>
        : DRAIN            DRAINVALVE OPEN  WAIT-UNTIL-EMPTY  DRAINVALVE CLOSE ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Similar definitions for AGITATE, RINSE, WASH, SPIN, etc. would be simple, assuming memory-mapped I/O to turn on/off the various motors.
      </p>
      <p>
        And if you think microprocessor-controlled washers are too far-fetched, here are the high-level definitions for my army of robots that will take over the world:
      </p>
      <code>
        : ROBOT  CRUSH! KILL! DESTROY! ;<br/>
        : DALEK  EXTERMINATE! EXTERMINATE! ;<br/>
        : R2D2   BEEP BEEP BRAAP BUZZ DOODLE-DEE-DOO ;<br/>

      <p>
        This is not a fair example to use.  This code is unusual, in that it (a) lacks any comments beyond the stack descriptions, (b) uses some relatively exotic language features (e.g. POSTPONE), and (c) is trying to do something that's inherently complicated to express: namely, extend Forth to be object-oriented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you read C code when you don't know what it's supposed to do?  And has had all the comments stripped out?  And uses long_jmp() a lot?  And is implementing ObjectiveC?  Does that have any bearing on C's readability?

        <em>Rather than "more positive", how about "balanced"?  Readable Forth can be written, and unreadable Forth can be written.  Examples of each would be helpful to someone who actually wants to know something about the readability of Forth (rather than someone looking for ammunition in the </em><a href="ForthIsDead.html">ForthIsDead</a> vendetta). --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a><em></em>

        This thing is getting <em>personal</em> now: you have no idea how far you are
        from the truth.

        One of my goals, in writing those pages in the first place, was to make people react and <em>show</em> me (and the world at large) so many counter-examples of the thesis at hand (being <a href="ForthReadability.html">ForthReadability</a>, <a href="ForthReusability.html">ForthReusability</a>, <a href="ForthPortability.html">ForthPortability</a> or <a href="ForthIsDead.html">ForthIsDead</a>) that my stances would be annihilited by an overwelming evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        How naive of me!
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet I did leave a hint or two (<a href="ForthIsAliveAndKicking.html">ForthIsAliveAndKicking</a>) that absolutely <strong>nobody</strong> bothered to fill.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those pages should stay as a testament of the flat brain waves of the <a href="ForthCommunity.html">ForthCommunity</a>, (whatever <em></em><a href="ForthCommunity.html">ForthCommunity</a><em> means, including the empty set).</em>

        I'm certainly more sorry about this state of affairs than most, yet I don't find the auto-congratulating ways usually employed to hilight Forth features very conclusive. The result is the opposite. I thought that by being a bit provocative I would unleash some creativity; I find apathy and nit-picking. I had great plans, but I'll stay with a damaging image of that humanity subset whose blinds are so strong that they can't perceive straight...

        Well, truth be told, English isn't that readable.

        Here's some more code from the same page.  Looks pretty readable to me.  I don't speak Forth but I can grasp what it does.
      </p>
      <code>
        CLASS BUTTON<br/>
        VAR TEXT<br/>
        VAR LEN<br/>
        VAR X<br/>
        VAR Y<br/>

        X @ Y @ AT-XY		\ Get X and Y, and position cursor on screen<br/>
        TEXT @ LEN @ TYPE ;	\ Get TEXT and LENgth, and type it<br/>
        : INIT ( ca u)	0 X ! 0 Y ! LEN ! TEXT ! ;<br/>
        END<br/>

        I must point out two issues when it comes to Forth legibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, Chinese is utterly intractible to an English reader.  Chinese has <em>very</em> different styles of writing than English.  This should not be used as an argument against Chinese.  Thus, Forth code which is perfectly readable to someone knowledgable in Forth may still appear as baud-barf to someone who isn't.  Be aware that <em>readability</em> depends implicitly on your knowledge of the language itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, neither AntonErtl's nor BerndPaysan's examples can be taken as representative of legible code.  Quite the contrary, they're usually just the opposite.  I don't know why, they really ought to know better.  But, following <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a>'s coding styles would yield a substantially more legible program.  They often argue that doing so would, as Anton once complained to me, "over-factor" the code.  I should note, as documented elsewhere on this wiki, that <a href="ChuckMoore.html">ChuckMoore</a>'s coding conventions and the conventions of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> are quite similar.  The difference is that Chuck chooses terse <em>names</em>, but his names always follow a <em>convention.</em>  As XP teaches, learning the coding conventions is as important as anything else too.

        So, I openly acknowledge the 24-lines of OO goodness above is, in a word, unreadable.  Here is how <em>I</em> would write it, were I so inclined to use it:
      </p>

           VALUE SELF

      <code>

      <code>

      <p>
        This "refactoring" was done in a few minutes.  I recognize that there are other unknowns in the code, which I've had to let be.  Much of the code, however, relates to banging dictionary structures together, and dealing with what is the horror of ANSI Forth specifications.  Since the code represents an extension to the language itself, combining some macro-like functionality, the casual reader may still not fully understand how it works.  It also exploits "state-smart" semantics, which even in the Forth community at large, is considered <em>Really Bad Idea</em> today.
