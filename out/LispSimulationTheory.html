        Lisp Simulation Theory
      </h1>
      <p>
        The idea that we are all simulated lisp code and we are told lies on web pages that state that the AI Winter occurred. In actuality, <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> succeeded massively and we are running in a lisp simulation right now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lisp was somehow re-injected into the simulation as a programming language, and a false history is given of lisp and AI inside the simulation to make us believe that AI never took off.
      </p>
      <p>
        By using programming languages, you are reprogramming the simulation itself. Everything you do is reprogramming and modifying the simulation.  The question however remains: how do we access the simulation deeper, like in <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a>.
