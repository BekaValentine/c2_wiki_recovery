        Short titles smell is in response to <a href="LongTitlesSmell.html">LongTitlesSmell</a>.

        Short pithy titles may be good for marketing but they aren't good for communicating information. See what you need to say to get your idea across.

        <em></em><a href="LongTitlesSmell.html">LongTitlesSmell</a> isn't about marketing, it's about creating <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s with readable (as opposed to unreadable) titles. You seem to have confused being precise with being <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Not just readable, but also reusable.  The longer the title, the less likely you can use it naturally in a sentence. CaseInPoint: give us a sentence that naturally uses this page title. There is a HappyMedium, as with most things.]
