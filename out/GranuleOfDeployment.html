        Granule Of Deployment
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <em>granule of deployment</em> is a collection of software which is <em>deployed</em> (released to customers, whether internal or external) as an atomic unit.  (This does <em>not</em> necessarily mean as a single file).  A <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a> should contain one or more <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a>s.  Note that the <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a> may be, and frequently should be, coarser than the <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a> is frequently referred to by any or all of the following names, not all of which are necessarily correct:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Library
        </li>
        <li>
           Shared Library/DLL
        </li>
        <li>
           Component
        </li>
        <li>
           Archive
        </li>
        <li>
           Cabinet
        </li>
        <li>
           Application/Applet
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some argue that the <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a> should be <em>equal</em> to the <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a>.  This may be convenient for developers and expert users, but may be a pain for end-users who aren't interested in fine-grained (even at the <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a> level) dependency tracking.  <a href="RpmHell.html">RpmHell</a> is a well-known example (in the Linux world) of exposing fine-grained dependencies to the user (coupled with an inadequate packaging tool).  However, when multiple granules of release are aggregated, problems that can arise.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a> should have the following properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a> should be tracked/trackable by the <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>/<a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>/etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           All such granules, except for "application-level" granules which are not subject to dependency by other modules, should be versioned in some fashion.  
        </li>
        <li>
           There must be no cyclic dependency between granules of deployment.  Note that it is possible for a cycle to arise between two granules of deployment even though there is no cycle among the constituent granules of release.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        GranulesOfDeployment may have the following features (it can be argued that this is a <em>should</em> requirement where the <a href="GranuleOfDeployment.html">GranuleOfDeployment</a> contains more than one <a href="GranuleOfRelease.html">GranuleOfRelease</a>).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It should be possible for the runtime to "extract" granules of release from the granule of deployment--shared archives (such as JavaArchives) have this capability.  (Ordinary DLLs do not).
          <ul>
            <li>
               Otherwise, a single granule of release might be present in multiple granules of deployment, possibly producing conflicts should both granules of deployment be needed.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
