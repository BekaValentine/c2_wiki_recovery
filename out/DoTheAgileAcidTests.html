        Do The Agile Acid Tests
      </h1>
      <p>
        Before sprint one, find out if you are in an agile project at all.
        Here is a few indicators that you are not:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Someone has a CASE tool installed on thier workstation</strong>. If someone is modelling the system using UML diagrams there is a good chance you are in a waterfall project, not an agile project. Agile projects do not have an analysis phase but relies on the principle of <a href="WalkingSkeleton.html">WalkingSkeleton</a> and does not attempt to build reusable frameworks according to the YAGNI (<a href="YouAintGonnaNeedIt.html">YouAintGonnaNeedIt</a>) principle. If you are going to do analysis, do that! Don't attempt to do structured modelling and agile style development at the same time.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Internal deadlines</strong>. Using internal deadlines without actually delivering a fully integrated release to the customer is a sure sign that you are in a waterfall project. Internal deadlines are rarely taken seriously. If the customer has a V-model view of the project, use the V-model to get customer approvals. Use frequent internal releases to FailGracefully.
        </li>
      </ul>
