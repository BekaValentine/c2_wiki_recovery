        An <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> system forms a <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a> of functional and data relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        An RDB forms an undirected graph; <a href="DatabaseNormalization.html">DatabaseNormalization</a> tends to remove cyclic relations. Apart from the obvious fact that an RDB has no functional relations (ignoring <a href="StoredProcedure.html">StoredProcedure</a>s, triggers, etc), it's fair to think of an <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> as a projection; of classes as ordered patterns of relations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Could we, <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> style, add semantics to an RDB until the work of programming classes could be reduced to the work of declaratively defining the tests they are to satisfy?
      </p>
      <p>
        The advantage to that would be that, once the semantic relations were proved correct, many different systems could be automatically generated simply by defining <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> style <a href="FunctionalTests.html">FunctionalTests</a>s. If the semantic RDB were well formed, no <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> would be required of the OO projection.
      </p>
      <p>
        This idea is more general than <a href="RailsScaffold.html">RailsScaffold</a>ing. Some procedural customization might be expected, but basically it's an attack on the fundamental of the OO paradigm - that classes must be coded procedurally. It is of course HalfBaked. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone know of a system that works like this?
