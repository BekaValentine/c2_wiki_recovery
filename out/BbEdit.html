        It is everything you ever wanted from a text editor and an awful lot more of what you didn't expect. I wrote my Ph.D. in BBedit. If you want shortcuts (glossaries) placed around your slection, you have the glossary; if you want to find every occurrence of a word in your 40 Gb of text, it will do it; if you want a list of chosen files readily available in a group window; if you want to use Typeit4me properly. <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> Recordable and highly scriptable. Tech support? Fantastic, as are the various lists. People code in BBedit, people write HTML (huge array of HTML tools... quicker and cleaner than WYSIWYG); people (like me, who can't do those things) just use it because it is amazingly flexible. If you want to type anything, use BBedit.

        You could say that <a href="BbEdit.html">BbEdit</a> and <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a> started from different places but are slowly moving to some sweet-spot in the middle. <a href="BbEdit.html">BbEdit</a> has a much nicer GUI and is slowly gaining more advanced features; <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a> has more advanced features and is slowly getting a nicer GUI. Probably the two will never completely converge; the two are different tools for different users. But yes, there are things that each provides that the other does not. -- francis

        There's a cool feature that you have to know about to get to, i.e., there's no menu or keyboard way of activating the feature: Take a folder or volume icon from the Finder, drag it into a BBEdit window, let go, and in a little while, up comes a <a href="TreeView.html">TreeView</a>. Very handy sometimes.
