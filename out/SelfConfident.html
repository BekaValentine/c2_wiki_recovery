        Self Confident
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SelfConfident.html">SelfConfident</a> is a trait which the people who have it don't talk about; I talk about it because I believe I need it. It is not to think about what you did five minutes ago, and it is not to plan what you are going to say and in which way you will say it. They are saying, <a href="BeYourself.html">BeYourself</a>, but I don't believe in it. Self-confident is how to make people like you when you don't intend to do so. It exists mainly with charismatic people.

        Maybe you are too self-conscious. Forget about yourself, (how you look, how you sound etc.) for a time. Ask people about things they are interested in and try to develop an interest in those things yourself. I don't think that I am especially confident myself, but when my confidence is at a low, it's usually because I'm thinking too much about what others are thinking, or will think of me. The fact is that they have there own thoughts and problems which largely don't include me. People will like you to the extent that you can connect with those thoughts. -- <a href="ChrisSteinbach.html">ChrisSteinbach</a>

        Oh yeah, and when you don't 'connect', don't sweat it. No doubt you'll have many chances to try and do so at other times and with other people. You don't have to have everyone like you. -- cs
