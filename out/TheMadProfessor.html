        The Mad Professor
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TheMadProfessor.html">TheMadProfessor</a> is the pseudonym of Larry Creager. I am an IT professional who has worked in the industry since 1977 in various roles. My alter ego has been associated with me since my college days. I have used the name for posting to various sites for many years both for casual and technical subjects (the latter most frequently at fluffycat.com.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        And yes, I have read the <a href="WikiPages.html">WikiPages</a> regarding the preference for real names - I chose to go with the posting persona I've used for the bulk of my life. Please refrain from any declarations of unethical or devious conduct regarding it. I completely reject any inference of the former and never claimed anything but the latter.
