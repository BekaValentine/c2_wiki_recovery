        Provision of Software Services is truly undergoing a change, with the emphasis being placed on more "bang" for the buck. (<a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a> - meaning more value per unit of currency). The cooperation of governments in the provision of environments, physical facilities and economical incentives, is presently playing a role, which may almost be viewed as a subsidy to the industry. But the future might well prove that such efforts might provide only a short term effect. The globalization of information and communication and the freeing of the workers from physical limitations, may well prove far more powerful in the long term.
