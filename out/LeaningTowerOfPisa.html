        Leaning Tower Of Pisa
      </h1>
      <p>
        Famous tower in Italy - due to settling of the wet sand under its foundation, it leans precariously to one side. Many attempts have been made to fix the tower, but it still leans.

      <p>
        A fine example of an elegant aesthetic design, with strong structural properties - on an utterly terrible foundation. There are many examples of LeaningTowersOfPisa in software design. (One could say this about <a href="WindowsNinetyFive.html">WindowsNinetyFive</a>, <a href="WindowsNinetyEight.html">WindowsNinetyEight</a>, and WindowsMe - though that is far too complimentary to their aesthetic and structural properties.)

        <em></em>WinME is an excellent parallel, considering the <a href="LeaningTowerOfPisa.html">LeaningTowerOfPisa</a>'s history. They built its foundation, and this sank a little. They waited a decade, built its first story, and that sank a little, while leaning to one side. Then, 100 years later, they started building up from a bent foundation. The tower leaned the other way, which is why now from some angles it looks banana-shaped. Similarly, Win95 started on dreadful foundations (mostly 16-bit code inside), and the future versions came out just as twisted. -- <a href="PbsNova.html">PbsNova</a><em> this is also a building! so don't get it mixed up!</em>
