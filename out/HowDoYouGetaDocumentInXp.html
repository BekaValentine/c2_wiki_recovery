        How Do You Geta Document In Xp
      </h1>
      <p>
        You're the owner of an XP project. You need a document - say, a UML diagram of the main classes to show your boss. How do you get it?
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you get anything on an XP project? Well, duh. You write a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> that says "Draw UML diagrams of the main classes in the system." Schedule it in the next iteration. A developer signs up for the story, draws the diagram.
      </p>
      <p>
        Next question?

      <p>
        How do you estimate a task that nobody has any real familiarity with? Assuming that no-one has done a UML diagram of a part of the system yet? Would this be a candidate for a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>, or would you allow for the fact that this job might overrun?
      </p>
      <p>
        You have to either estimate it and try to live by the estimate, or spike it. What C3 will do when we have to do this, if I have my way, will be to bring in <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> to teach his wonderful course on <a href="UmlDistilled.html">UmlDistilled</a>, and to hang about a couple of days coaching us on what to document and what not. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
