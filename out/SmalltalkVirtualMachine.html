        The <a href="SmalltalkVirtualMachine.html">SmalltalkVirtualMachine</a> is a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> that allows a Smalltalk image to run on an underlying platform. The <a href="SmalltalkVirtualMachine.html">SmalltalkVirtualMachine</a> executes compiled methods whose code is expressed as <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> sequences. It includes a process model, stack-frames, closures (sort of), and a variety of debugging hooks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="BlueBook.html">BlueBook</a> described an early <a href="SmalltalkVirtualMachine.html">SmalltalkVirtualMachine</a>, no corresponding <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> was ever actually built. The early <a href="SmalltalkVirtualMachine.html">SmalltalkVirtualMachine</a>s, built by Xerox, varied from the <a href="BlueBook.html">BlueBook</a> in significant ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later versions diverged even more dramatically, including the "HPS" implementation that supported <a href="JustInTimeCompilation.html">JustInTimeCompilation</a>, various compiler optimizations, and several varieties of bit-mapped graphics magic.
