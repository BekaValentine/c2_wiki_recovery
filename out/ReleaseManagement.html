        Release Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        Release Management ties in with the concept of <a href="ProductLinePractice.html">ProductLinePractice</a>.

        Basically, how we enhance, re-test and re-release software to our customers in a controlled fashion:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           without confusing them to bits by introducing new functionality faster than they can be retrained
        </li>
        <li>
           being able to retest the entire solution before release
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        How will we release different "versions" of applications in the Web Services world, where services can be dynamically linked at run-time...? -- MikeMat@nedcor.com
