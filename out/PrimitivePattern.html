        Primitive Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PrimitivePattern.html">PrimitivePattern</a>, in my world view, participates in a Composite structure, with AbstractPattern as a parent and ComposedPattern and <a href="PrimitivePattern.html">PrimitivePattern</a> as descendents.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can someone help me out with the wiki links here? I'd like to show the connection to the Composite pattern described in the Object Structural section of the Gang-of-four book, starting on page 163. In this case, its a pattern of patterns...
      </p>

        I view a "Pattern" as a generator of one or more related classes, methods, and so on.

        Yes. I've certainly come across patterns that fit into
        this structure --- although I'd prefer to call them <a href="ClientServerPatterns.html">ClientServerPatterns</a>
        or CollaboratingPatterns than <a href="CompositePattern.html">CompositePattern</a>.
