        This is a <a href="JavaIdiom.html">JavaIdiom</a> rather than a proper pattern, as it uses dynamic loading. It is closely related to the <a href="AbstractFactoryPattern.html">AbstractFactoryPattern</a>; in fact it's a special case of it.

        Constructor Object.

        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have dynamically loaded a class ("the implementing class") which conforms to a statically known interface ("the main interface"). You need to be able to create instances of the implementing class; this calls for an abstract factory.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        How do you create the abstract factory which matches the implementing class?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You have no static knowledge of the possible implementing classes, so you can't use a map or a switch: you have to dynamically load the factory class
        </li>
        <li>
           All the implementing classes have the same constructor (a prerequisite for using a factory)
        </li>
        <li>
           You can't invoke class methods without evil reflection (so this doesn't apply to Smalltalk)
        </li>
        <li>
           You can dynamically load classes based on their name (so this doesn't apply to C++)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Define an inner 'constructor' abstract class in the main polymorphic interface, which defines methods for creating instances of the main interface (as it were). In each implementing class, define a static inner class with a standard name which extends the constructor class and has a no-args constructor. The constructor objects thus serve as lightweight factories which can be obtained in a simple manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        /*
        Consider a drawing package, where we have Drawings and Tools which can be applied to them. We want to be able to load Tools dynamically.

      </ul>
      <code>
        public class Drawing<br/>
        {<br/>
        // details not important here<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>

        this.d = d ;<br/>

        {<br/>
        /*<br/>
        // minor gripe; what i want to do is:<br/>
        Class cl = Class.forName( clName ) ;<br/>
        Class ccl = cl.getClass( Tool.Constructor.NAME ) ;<br/>

      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The factory is created by several leaps of faith (there is a class with this name, that class has a no-args constructor, that class implements the right interface, that class does the right thing)
        </li>
        <li>
           New instances are created by a polymorphic but non-reflective call
        </li>
        <li>
           Construction is type-safe
        </li>
        <li>
           Construction is quite fast (if Constructor was an abstract base class and not an interface, it might even be a dozen cycles faster)
        </li>
        <li>
           There may be many instances of the factory
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Tool.Constructor could have some convenience methods as follow:
      </p>
      <code>
        public static Tool createConstructor( String clName )<br/>
        {<br/>
        String cclName = clName + '$' + Tool.Constructor.NAME ;<br/>
        Class ccl = Class.forName( cclName ) ;<br/>
        Tool.Constructor ctor = (Tool.Constructor)ccl.newInstance() ;<br/>
        return ctor ;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public static Tool createTool( String clName, Drawing d )<br/>
        {<br/>
        Tool.Constructor ctor = createConstructor( clName ) ;<br/>
        Tool t = ctor.create( d ) ;<br/>
        return t ;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Rationale</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="AbstractFactoryPattern.html">AbstractFactoryPattern</a> is the most elegant way to handle object creation in this situation; this idiom is just a simple way of getting hold of a factory.
      </p>
      <p>
        What i mean is, "it just seems obviously right to me", which is either a very good or a very bad reason. Hmm.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Known Uses</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I (<a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>) am only aware of one use of this pattern, and that's in a drawing tool that i am writing. I know, <a href="RuleOfThree.html">RuleOfThree</a>, but if this idiom isn't any good, we can erase it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Related patterns</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is obviously very similar to the <a href="AbstractFactoryPattern.html">AbstractFactoryPattern</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Some alternatives.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Define an init method in the main interface which takes the parameters which would go in Constructor.create, and then have a convention that implementing classes provide a no-args constructor; instances can then be created with newInstance and initialised with init. The problem with this is that it allows uninitialised instances to exist; this can be addressed using the EssencePattern.
            </li>
            <li>
               Define the standard constructor in each implementing class and just call it reflectively. The problem with this is that it has less type safety, and reflection may be slow.
