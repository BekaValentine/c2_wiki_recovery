        Turing Incompleteness Theorem
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="TuringIncompletenessTheorem.html">TuringIncompletenessTheorem</a> is a theorem that reads "There are no nontrivial questions about the result of a Turing machine that can be answered by a Turing machine for all Turing machines."
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> for why this is true.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's better known as </em><a href="RicesTheorem.html">RicesTheorem</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ah yes. From the other size of The <a href="ChurchTuringThesis.html">ChurchTuringThesis</a>.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are several ways to prove it, of course, but the one I'm most familiar is to reduce it to the </em><a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>. How does that make it the "other size[side?] of the <a href="ChurchTuringThesis.html">ChurchTuringThesis</a>"?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Because <a href="RicesTheorem.html">RicesTheorem</a> is based from lambda calculus. I believe the fact of identical theorems with both mechanisms was instrumental in proving the <a href="ChurchTuringThesis.html">ChurchTuringThesis</a>.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's not. It's based on TMs. Now one can also prove it based on </em><a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a>, KleenesHierarchy, and some other things, but it's usually done in terms of TMs.<em></em>
