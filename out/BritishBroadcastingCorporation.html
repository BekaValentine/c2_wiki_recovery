      <p>
        The British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) is a publicly-funded organisation in Britain that provides several free-to-air television and radio stations.

        Free?  Don't Brits pay a license to own a TV which supports the BBC? <em>No, we buy a licence [</em><a href="BritishCulturalAssumption.html">BritishCulturalAssumption</a>] for a household to own a TV that is capable of receiving broadcast TV:  a regressive hypothecated tax, in other words<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a reduced level of payment for households where there is at least one person visually handicapped or elderly (I think over 75).

        The BBC's free-to-air channels don't carry advertising. (i.e. they don't do commercial advertising - but they don't miss a trick when it comes to promoting other BBC services.)
        <em>Their rival, </em>IndependentTeleVision, however... that's a different story.<em></em>
