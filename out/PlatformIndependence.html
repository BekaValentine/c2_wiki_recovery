        Platform Independence
      </h1>
      <p>
        Platform independence is a term that describes a technology (usually a <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> or a <a href="FrameWork.html">FrameWork</a>) that you can use to implement things on one machine and use them on another machine without (or with minimal) changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two basic types of <a href="PlatformIndependence.html">PlatformIndependence</a>:

      <p>
        <em>Binary Platform Independence</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages like Java (<a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>) or Python (<a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>) use a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> to run and therefore can be transported from one machine to another in their compiled, binary format. <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> seems to be moving in that direction as well, by way of the <a href="MonoProject.html">MonoProject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Source Platform Independence</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ANSI C (<a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>) and ANSI C++ (<a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>) could be considered platform independent to the extent that the source needs no change (or almost no change) to be moved from one type of machine to another. The source needs to be recompiled for each platform. If the programmer adheres to strict ANSI standards, programs in both languages should compile and run nicely on all platforms.

        <em></em><a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> / <a href="InterpretedLanguage.html">InterpretedLanguage</a> platform independence<em></em>
        <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> can also be listed here - it doesn't compile into a binary distributable and most Perl programs (especially text based ones) can run on many platforms. There needs to be an interpreter for each platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        When <a href="PlatformIndependence.html">PlatformIndependence</a> is discussed, usually the three major platforms are concerned : MS Windows, POSIX/Unix, Mac.  (Although MacOS is unix.  It's only the GUI that's weird. -- <a href="JasonGrossman.html">JasonGrossman</a>)

      <p>
        Cross-compiling is another technique used to write code on one machine and run the correponding executable on another machine. Cross-compiling is heavily used in <a href="EmbeddedSystem.html">EmbeddedSystem</a>s, where the "other machine" may lack a keyboard or enough RAM to run a compiler.
