        Junit With Net Beans
      </h1>
      <p>
        The JUnit module supports unit test generation (with stub tests for public methods), test suite creation, and execution of tests (at both the class and package level).  When 3.2 gets released (around the May/June timeframe), it will be part of the standard download.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is built around JUnit 3.5.
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="http://junit.netbeans.org/">http://junit.netbeans.org/</a> for more detail. This requires <a href="NetBeans.html">NetBeans</a> 3.1 or higher (which means it won't work with <a href="ForteForJava.html">ForteForJava</a> 2.1).
      </p>
      <p>
        Also see <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/moduledescs/junit.html">http://www.netbeans.org/moduledescs/junit.html</a> (this link is broken, someone who knows and alternative URL refactor me pls) for instructions on an alternative means of running unit tests.

      <p>
        <a href="NetBeans.html">NetBeans</a> 3.3.1 makes unit-testing ridicilously easy. I have my tests in a parallel directory structure to the code I'm testing and in <a href="NetBeans.html">NetBeans</a> I mount my source as one file system and my tests as another file system. I can go straight from the sourcecode to the test or just run the test for a class after changing it in some way just by pressing a key combination.
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't yet found out how to run all the tests at once from <a href="NetBeans.html">NetBeans</a> so I just use <a href="JakartaAnt.html">JakartaAnt</a> for that.
