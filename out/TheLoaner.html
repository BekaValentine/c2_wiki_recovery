        <strong>Problem: </strong>
        A project is visibly in trouble.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context: </strong>
        The most visible symptom of project trouble is that it is 
        behind schedule. More troubling is that the rate of schedule 
        slippage is geometric or exponential -- it gets worse with
        every report. That it is behind schedule for reasons other
        than lack of resource is ignored.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces: </strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Project is "too important" to simply kill.
        </li>
        <li>
           Everyone seems busy, therefore the problem is that "everyone" isn't big enough.
        </li>
        <li>
           Project plans are expressed in "person-days," suggesting that "persons" and "days" are interchangeable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution: </strong>
        Management finds one or more resources that are available,
        and "loans" them to the problem project.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context: </strong>
        <a href="BrooksLaw.html">BrooksLaw</a> causes the project schedule to inflate out of
        control, until it is either killed or radically scaled back.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rationale: </strong>
        Nobody loans useful resources, therefore <a href="TheLoaner.html">TheLoaner</a> is going
        to be someone who is "available" largely because they are not
        currently solving someone else's problems. Unless there is a
        lack of problems to solve, this is usually because <a href="TheLoaner.html">TheLoaner</a>
        is under-trained, incapable, or otherwise unable to be
        productive.
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't accept <a href="TheLoaner.html">TheLoaner</a> blindly -- make sure they can actually impact schedule.
        </li>
        <li>
           Negotiate long loan lengths to better "amortize" the fixed costs of the loan of training and bringing the new person up to speed.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TheLoaner.html">TheLoaner</a>'s work <strong>must</strong> be properly documented, because he won't be around when it breaks.
        </li>
        <li>
           Assign them a "stunt double" to work closely with (see <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>).
        </li>
      </ul>
