        Might I suggest that people put "Thoughts for a day" here? Try to make the reader smile. For Example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>A:</strong> Because otherwise it would be confusing.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <strong>Q:</strong> Why is it "Q & A" and not "A & Q"?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Suggestion: don't change this page too quickly. If the last edit was less than 48 hours ago, save your thought for another time.
