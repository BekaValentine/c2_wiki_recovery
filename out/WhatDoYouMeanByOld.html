      <code>
        A continually used term by all ages, to describe older tradition methods, used by everyone <br/>
        including the younger, hypocritical, gen Yhine gen, who reluctantly uses it because they are too busy <br/>
        whining about many other things, for them to come up with a new and unnecessary replacement term, <br/>
        -which had it been created, should have hopefully set them apart as the next new "cool" generation. <br/>

      <code>
        Old age consists of ages nearing or surpassing the life expectancy of human beings, and thus the end of the human life cycle. <br/>
        Euphemisms and terms for old people include, old people (worldwide usage), seniors (American usage), senior citizens <br/>
        (British and American usage) <br/>
        older adults (in the social sciences[1]), <br/>
        the elderly, and elders (in many cultures including the cultures of aboriginal people).<br/>
        Old people often have limited regenerative abilities and are more prone to disease, syndromes, and sickness than younger adults<br/>
        the organic process of ageing is called senescence<br/>
        the medical study of the aging process is gerontology <br/>
        the study of diseases that afflict the elderly is geriatrics<br/>
        the elderly also face other social issues such as retirement, loneliness, and ageism<br/>
        the chronological age denoted as "old age" varies culturally and historically<br/>
        Old age is "a social construct" rather than a definite "biological stage"	<br/>

      </p>
      <code>
        Texas A&M University offers a plan for a “Aging Simulation” workshop.<br/>
        The workshop is adapted from Sensitizing People to the Processes of Aging.<br/>
        Some of the simulations follow:<br/>
        Sight: Wearing swimmer’s goggles with black paper pasted to lens with only a small hole to simulate tunnel vision,<br/>
        Hearing: Use ear plugs to dull the sound of people talking.<br/>
        Touch: Wearing thick gloves, button a shirt or buckle a belt.<br/>
        Dexterity: With tape around several fingers, unscrew a jar lid.<br/>
        Mobility and Balance: Carry packages in one hand while using a walker.<br/>

        Just as many terms/concepts are timeless, such as mini-skirts are always ever fashionable, or term "cool", <br/>
        the current, soon to be replaced gen, is still trying to find a meaningful contribution before hitting middle age.<br/>

               WHAT’S OLD IS NEW: Microsoft’s preview of Windows 10 is sending signals that the tech giant is retreating from its unpopular touchscreen-centric Windows 8 interface back to an operating system that’s more PC user-friendly.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Return of the classic desktop and Start menu. (shown above) Windows 10 will come with a classic-looking desktop, which should please Windows fans who miss Windows 7. This means there will be a Start menu, too, although it looks a bit different from the menu we're used to. As previous leaks had indicated, the Start menu looks like a hybrid of a standard menu and the tiled Windows 8 interface.
