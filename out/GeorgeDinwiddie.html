        <a href="GeorgeDinwiddie.html">GeorgeDinwiddie</a>, of iDIA Computing, LLC (<a href="http://www.idiacomputing.com),">http://www.idiacomputing.com),</a> is a software development consultant and coach, currently working at Wells Fargo Corporate Trust in Columbia, Maryland. I'm also a sailor and the maintainer of the Alberg 30 website, <a href="http://www.alberg30.org/">http://www.alberg30.org/</a> (The Alberg 30 is a particular type of sailboat).
        I've added an instance of <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> to that site. See <a href="http://www.alberg30.org/collaborate/">http://www.alberg30.org/collaborate/</a> .
        I've started a blog/wiki at <a href="http://idiacomputing.com/moin/">http://idiacomputing.com/moin/</a> where I can add thoughts as they come to me.

        I'm interested in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. Anyone else in the Baltimore/Annapolis/Columbia Maryland area? See <a href="AgileMaryland.html">AgileMaryland</a> to find the rest of us. <a href="WashingtonDcAreaXpUsersGroup.html">WashingtonDcAreaXpUsersGroup</a> is another nearby alternative.

        I liked the way <a href="RobertCecilMartin.html">RobertCecilMartin</a> inserted little bits of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> into his Advanced Object Oriented Design sessions at SD2000. It's clear to me that you can start practicing some of these good techniques without selling management on the entire <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> concept. BTW, Robert, every session I attended at SD2000 was good, but yours was particularly excellent. Thanks!

        I'm also very impressed with <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s definition of <a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a>, presented on <a href="XpSimplicityRules.html">XpSimplicityRules</a>

        I often start out with the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> (or, now <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/RecentChanges?days=1)">http://c2.com/cgi/RecentChanges?days=1)</a> page. Maybe I should also keep an eye on the <a href="EjbRoadmap.html">EjbRoadmap</a>. I've used both handbuild <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s and <a href="EasyMock.html">EasyMock</a>, but as time progresses, I find I use them less and less.  Mostly I use mocks at the system boundaries.

        I've started a page of <a href="SoftwareDevelopmentGuideline.html">SoftwareDevelopmentGuideline</a>s to pull together those rules that aren't formal principles, but are good heuristics that will save your butt more often than not.

        I frequently have to remember how to re-energize my <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> and the details of <a href="SimulatingQuoteBlocks.html">SimulatingQuoteBlocks</a>. Sometimes I can't remember that <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/history/">http://c2.com/wiki/history/</a> is the recent wiki history. <a href="WikiWikiWebNews.html">WikiWikiWebNews</a> provides commentary on current events.

        Sometimes I help with the cleanup, deleting older entries in <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/shorts.cgi">http://c2.com/cgi/shorts.cgi</a> or useless <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/orphanWikiPages''''''.">http://c2.com/cgi/orphanWikiPages''''''.</a>
