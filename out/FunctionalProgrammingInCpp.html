        Can anybody give examples how <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> has support for <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>? The Y combinator in C++ would be nice... -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

        This web site is one of several which describe libraries for function programming in C++: <a href="http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/.">http://www.cc.gatech.edu/~yannis/fc++/.</a> The authors give the library the name <em>Functional Programming in C++</em>, which makes it hard to invent a wiki name for it, as the obvious one is taken. <a href="FunctoidsInCpp.html">FunctoidsInCpp</a> is going to have to do. There is also the <a href="BoostPhoenixLibrary.html">BoostPhoenixLibrary</a> which is one of the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a>. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <strong>November 2010</strong> See <a href="CppNext.html">CppNext</a> for lively discussion of functional programming in C++.

        It has support for currying (<a href="CurryingSchonfinkelling.html">CurryingSchonfinkelling</a>) using the binders binder1st and binder2nd. I.e., you can construct a  unary_function by taking a binary_function and binding one of its args to a fixed value. More details can follow if you're interested... Is this the kind of thing the questioner meant?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes it is: BTW this sounds like partial application, not currying. In </em><a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> I can do:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        (define (apply-partial proc . arglist1) <br/>
        (lambda arglist2 <br/>
        (apply proc (append arglist1 arglist2))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>How would one define something similar to apply-partial in C++? -- sh</em>

        C++ provides the following <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> tools and techniques:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s can be used to implement <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s (<a href="FunctionPointer.html">FunctionPointer</a>s can too, but <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s are much better suited to the task), including lambdas.  The <a href="StandardTemplateLibrary.html">StandardTemplateLibrary</a> is the C++ user's first exposure to this, the <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> take it to the next level.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           However, the lack of <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> makes lambdas a bit of a pain--<a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s used in this manner generally have usage patterns that make manual memory allocation/deallocation a pain in the butt.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Could you elaborate on that? I've used Phoenix and more, and don't have the slightest clue what you're talking about. -- <a href="ArneVogel.html">ArneVogel</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The template mechanism is a <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> LazyFunctionalLanguage it its own right (though not a very good one...)

        BTW, there is <a href="InteLib.html">InteLib</a> which provides <a href="LispProgramming.html">LispProgramming</a> within C++ (actually, it is a kind of <a href="LispProgramming.html">LispProgramming</a> without Lisp). However, being the author of it, I still do not consider that <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> is a <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> language. I'd rather consider it an algebraic language which allows almost any <a href="ProgrammingParadigm.html">ProgrammingParadigm</a> to be imported into. -- <a href="AndreyStolyarov.html">AndreyStolyarov</a>

        In the 2004 <a href="IcfpProgrammingContest.html">IcfpProgrammingContest</a> (<a href="http://www.cis.upenn.edu/proj/plclub/contest//results.php#languages),">http://www.cis.upenn.edu/proj/plclub/contest//results.php#languages),</a> there were more C++ entries (25) than entries in any other individual programming language.  (In other words, C++ had a <em>plurality</em>--not a majority).  In addition, Java was 4th (21 entries), Python 6th (16 entries), <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> 7th (15 entries), and <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> 9th (11 entries).
      </p>
      <p>
        Among traditional function languages we find O'Caml 2nd (24 entries), Haskell 5th (20 entries), Lisp 8th (12 entries), and <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> 10th (9 entries).  The EmFour preprocessor (which is <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>) had more entries (2) than did <a href="ErlangLanguage.html">ErlangLanguage</a>, <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a>, bash, and a bunch of other languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's that all mean? Not much, other than a primitive indicator of geek mindshare. It's interesting how much <a href="TemplateMetaprogramming.html">TemplateMetaprogramming</a> has rekindled interest in C++, especially when you consider what a royal pain C++ templates are to work with sometimes (especially when you are doing anything more complicated than simple abstraction over types).
