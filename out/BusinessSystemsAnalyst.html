      <p>
        Some corporations maintain a position titled Business Systems Analyst.  More than serving as the liaison between Operations and Programmers (the role of a <a href="SystemAnalyst.html">SystemAnalyst</a>), a Business Systems Analyst is concerned that corporate <a href="StrategicPlanning.html">StrategicPlanning</a> is expressed in programming projects.  Or, to state it differently, he or she assures that there is no <a href="ImpedanceMismatch.html">ImpedanceMismatch</a> between the strategy of the company and the development efforts of the programming staff.
