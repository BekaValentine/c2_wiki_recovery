        Premature Serialization
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Coder</em>: My program has a big tree in memory, and it must send this tree to a module that is unaware of my data objects, and might be in a separate memory arena. What shall I do?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Alleged Guru</em>: Read the XML propaganda, my child. It discusses the miracle of interoperable data formats. You may write your writer in the one program, and write a reader in the other program, and your data will be flexible. And we may someday put this XML into a file, or cast it out upon the 'net.

        The <a href="DesignSmell.html">DesignSmell</a> "too many strings", "too much string parsing" and "why do these strings have private members?" leads to the PS diagnosis.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Does that mean the correct thing to do is not use non-XML serialization?  Or is all this stuff happening within one memory space, making serialization unnecessary?  (I can't tell if this is anti-XML advice or anti-complicated-interfaces advice.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is advice against doing this (in an arbitrary C++ like language):
      </p>
      <code>
        struct<br/>
        int x<br/>
        int y<br/>
        double z<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        string << q.x << ':' << q.y ':' << q.z;<br/>
        passToAnotherModule(string);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Ultimately, the other module could perform "switch on type code". A case for mature generalization.
