        Wiki Sync
      </h1>
      <p>
        A tool for the synchronization of Wiki databases. A good <a href="WikiSync.html">WikiSync</a> program is a godsend to those who are frequently offline, such as commuters.
      </p>
      <p>
        I commute to work. I get 45 minutes of offline usage of LaptopJenny, twice a day. I have a cablemodem at home, and T1 at work. I'd like to do things on LaptopJenny without the need to do a ManualSync. Among those things is reading this Wiki, and contributing to it. At a minimum, this will require downloading all of this wiki (in a friendly way). I'd be happy to share the results once I get it all working, of course.

        Specifications:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The <a href="WikiSync.html">WikiSync</a> program should know when the last sync was done so there is no need to compare all the documents!
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The <a href="WikiSync.html">WikiSync</a> program should be able to download only the texts which are modified after the last download.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           If you have created new pages and they are not in Wiki then they should be uploaded.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           If you have changed pages and they are not changed in wiki they should be updated.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           If the changes have been done in both of the copies then some kind of a "resolve changes" page should appear, so that you can merge the differences.
        </li>
      </ol>

        Such a thing exists, and funnily it is also called "<a href="WikiSync.html">WikiSync</a>". It is however bandwidth exhaustive and doesn't support the open Wiki APIs (XmlRpcToWiki and such), it is tied to one <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> and probably only useful for a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>. Have a peek at <a href="http://erfurtwiki.sf.net/tools/">http://erfurtwiki.sf.net/tools/</a> and <a href="http://readonly:test@erfurtwiki.sf.net/tools/t_sync.php">http://readonly:test@erfurtwiki.sf.net/tools/t_sync.php</a> specifically.

        I think it should be possible to use <a href="BayleShanks.html">BayleShanks</a> <a href="WikiGateway.html">WikiGateway</a> to make a real cross-wiki compatible <a href="WikiSync.html">WikiSync</a> program; and I think I also heard of another Wiki providing such a feature (can't remember which). -- MarioSalzer

        I think wix might do this for mediawiki: <a href="http://search.cpan.org/~markj/WWW-Mediawiki-Client-0.16/bin/wix">http://search.cpan.org/~markj/WWW-Mediawiki-Client-0.16/bin/wix</a> -- <a href="BayleShanks.html">BayleShanks</a>

        Anything that implements <a href="WebDav.html">WebDav</a> (plus versioning) could also simply use 'sitecopy' or similar tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        See also <a href="FwSync.html">FwSync</a> for use with Microsofts <a href="FlexWiki.html">FlexWiki</a>.

        I urge any solution to be friendly and be globally compatible. The ability to edit data locally is needed for speed and security, while the global synchronization is needed for synergy. -- <a href="KenWeide.html">KenWeide</a>

        <em>Consider ways to use </em>'rsync<em>'. Using existing tools in novel ways is the sign of true genius.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Question - what if two off-line users edit the same page. How do you do resolution. First to sync, wins? If you've done a lot of editing off-line that could be a real bummer.</em>

        I have a version of this that I use for a wiki-like system with some colleagues. It doesn't scale, but for what it's worth, here it is.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Each person has their own pages database, each works with their own pages database, and everyone else has a read-only copy. Each changes their own pages however they like, and regularly <strong>rsync</strong> the pages to the other machines.
        </li>
        <li>
           The "wiki" then presents a unified view. If one person likes what someone else has written, one click (like the <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a>/<a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a> "Accept Changes") and it's copied to the local version of the page and the difference disappears. Pages should converge rapidly unless there's a genuine disagreement. Then a 'phone call or email can be used to sort it out.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Should work a treat with a small number of people.

        There already exists open source project called Wiki Synchronization Tool which solves these problems. Project homepage is on <a href="http://wikisync.dev.java.net">http://wikisync.dev.java.net</a>
