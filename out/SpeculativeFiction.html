        Speculative Fiction
      </h1>
      <p>
        A term largely equivalent to <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a>, but with a subtly more literary slant; <a href="SpeculativeFiction.html">SpeculativeFiction</a> takes in <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> and fantasy, but also (depending on the weather) <a href="AlternateHistory.html">AlternateHistory</a>, horror, fairytales and <a href="MagicalRealism.html">MagicalRealism</a>. Perhaps the most useful definition is that it is any fiction which is not MimeticFiction.
