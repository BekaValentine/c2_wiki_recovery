        There are those on this forum that refer to Wiki participants as "Wikizens" (see <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a>). A play on "citizen". Adding the caps on the Zen emphasizes the "one with" angle, per the western popularization of the Zen <a href="EasternPhilosophy.html">EasternPhilosophy</a>...less interestingly called a <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a>.

        I think by <em>One With</em> they are really trying to say <em>Total Awareness Of,</em> basically the same thing. Don't argue about the words. Just sit.

        No matter.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't look for <em>total awareness</em> or <em>oneness</em> or anything of the sort. Welcome them when you find them, but don't become attached. All attachments are distractions, even attachment to non-attachment. <em>One with</em> is self-defeating. Learn to be <em>not two</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't even think <em>two</em>. When in doubt, just say, <em>Not two.</em> And please do not confuse with the two's complement!

        But...one can't be "one" if "one" has no mind...???
      </p>
      <p>
        The mind is not what one has. The mind is also not what one <strong>is</strong>. So what is the mind (just the mind), other than a route to confusion. The Way is so much more than the mind... this is why we consider Zen.
      </p>
      <p>
        One is a Way. We can feel One even more concretely than we can feel "the mind". It is a good path.

        <em></em><a href="LaoTse.html">LaoTse</a> sez life's a big river, and we're all just waves on its surface. Suffering, dissociation, personality, and all those other words are flashes of sunlight reflecting and refracting, not something to fret about.<em></em>

        One/"we" cannot use words to *speak* of "any-thing." As soon as one/"we" uses words, dissociation occurs. Wittgenstein says, "Whereof we do not know, we may not speak."

        Wittgenstein et al.: shut up I say, although your are absolutely correct. We may not speak, for sure, as there are always the nay-sayers and neglecters and finally subduers that will make hush up the ones that say the unbelievable, the no-thought, the inevitable truth.

        It is important to remember Zen is One(1) and One(1) is Zen.   Zen is truly "The path to inner peace", or "enlightenment" if wewikiwill.  "Zen", if wewikiwill, is the result of Buddhism beginning in India and traveling through China, then Korea into Japan.  The early Japanese schools imitated fairly close to their Chinese models, and both were from the Hinayana and Mahayana schools.  These are also referred to the "greater" and "lesser" vehicles.  Some refer to Zen being the petals of the flower, (in regards to Japanese "Zen").  Dosho(629-700), the founder of the Hosso school, introduced Ch'an ( a Southern School--"Sudden South, Gradual North") to Japan, however "Zen" itself wouldn't take root for another five centuries.  One(1) is the number of our creator...before one(1) there is nothing, after one(1) there is nothing.
