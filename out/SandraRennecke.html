        Hmmm, I am the one complaining about "Yet another stupid Markup Language" in the sandbox, in case that is still there. Heard about this place from a friend and wanted to check it out; it seems like a very neat idea to me. Still experimenting :)

        edit: found this on google and seems I gave up experimenting with this wiki back in 2001. Gonna experiment some more though and add a poem-like thing I wrote to this.

        Once upon a time there was an Inventor
        who built a beautiful robot.
        This robot could cook and clean
        as well a get drunk
        work as a doorman as well as a maid.
      </p>
      <p>
        But alas the robot was so beautiful,
        that all who saw it envied the Inventor,
        and soon the Inventor lost all his friends.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus he turned of the robot
        and put it in the garden as a fountain ornament.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the small and cute
        robins and sparrows perched on it
        and drank from the fountain
        and now the Inventor himself became jealous.
      </p>
      <p>
        So he put the robot into a big
        sunny attic, where he hid old memories.
        But cobwebs threatened to cover it
        and mice came out, munching on the colourful cables.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Inventor did not know anmore where to put this thing
        he had created
        and finally decided to limit it's functionality
        and gave it to a zoo.
      </p>
      <p>
        There the robot now sits in a cage
        and the robot becomes friends with the apes.
