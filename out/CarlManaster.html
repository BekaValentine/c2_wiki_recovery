        Welcome to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>! I see from your link above that you are principally a programmer who has worked in the specialty of MiningCadSoftware. Since the site is involved in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, could you tell us some more about this? Did you use it in developing your software? -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>

        Short answer: No.

        If anyone knew about XP back when I worked in Mining, I wasn't one of them. This was in the time period 1985-1993. I was doing object-oriented programming (using Object Pascal), but that's about as far as it goes.

        I only learned about XP roughly when the White Book came out; I haven't had a chance to do much of "big" XP (like pair programming and onsite customer), but I do what I can - <em>lots</em> of TDD and refactoring. Hoping to do more.
