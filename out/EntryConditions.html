        Entry Conditions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Before a task can begin, the entry conditions must be satisfied.  Generally this means that some prior deliverables are available that are necessary to accomplish the task.  It also means that the necessary personnel with the necessary equipment, skill-sets and support are available at the time the task kicks off.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since often the tasks in a plan are poorly defined from the standpoint of entry conditions, the sequencing and timing of the plan is adversely affected because things are not ready when the task should start, leading to logistically based delays.
