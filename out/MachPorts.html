        Mach Ports
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="MachMicrokernel.html">MachMicrokernel</a> provides a simple <a href="InterProcessCommunication.html">InterProcessCommunication</a> mechanism based on <em>ports</em>. Basically, a process can open a port, and other processes can then send messages to it which can be received by the owning process; a message is basically a block of bytes. Mach manages the ports, and provides guaranteed, in-order delivery, with large messages being handled efficiently by sharing pages between address spaces. There is a sophisticated permission mechanism which restricts the operations that processes can perform on ports.
