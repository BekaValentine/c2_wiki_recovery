        Alas, <a href="SmalltalkReport.html">SmalltalkReport</a> was discontinued in 1998.

        The <a href="SmalltalkReport.html">SmalltalkReport</a> was a <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>-only trade magazine published by SIGS [<a href="http://www.sigs.com].">http://www.sigs.com].</a>
        Its editors were <a href="JohnPugh.html">JohnPugh</a> and <a href="PaulWhite.html">PaulWhite</a>, two fine gentlemen who are also co-founders of <a href="TheObjectPeople.html">TheObjectPeople</a>.

        What about publishing a Smalltalk ezine? Why not leverage various articles and focus upon increasing the profile of Smalltalk. Smalltalk truly is a better language and development environment than Java and C++. -- <a href="JohnGardner.html">JohnGardner</a>

      <p>
        There are a couple of Smalltalk e-zines of various forms around. e.g.:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.whysmalltalk.com">http://www.whysmalltalk.com</a>

           <a href="http://www.goodstart.com">http://www.goodstart.com</a>
        </li>
      </ul>

        There's also a Smalltalk Web ring recently started up which would help find others. -- <a href="AlanKnight.html">AlanKnight</a>
