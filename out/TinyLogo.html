        Limited logo but small (total impact about 80kb) and fun to play with if you are learning basic logo. The simple graphics stuff works and there's a good set of examples.

        Lacks a lot of the more advanced constructs in <a href="BrianHarvey.html">BrianHarvey</a>'s UCBLogo so can get frustrating very quickly if you are trying to become a savvy Logo programmer. I found Logo itself a fun way to learn list-oriented, recursive thinking but as a longtime OO person have devoted my energies to learning <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> as my latest language.

        Requires the PocketC runtime interpreter. Being based on this means there's an awkward means of entering text requiring use of the scroll up key.
