        Siddharttha Gotama, lived and taught in northern India some 2,500 years ago. It was he who in historical times became known as 'the Buddha'; that is 'the Awakened One', one who has attained great wisdom through their own efforts.

        Whilst browsing this page, my ladyfriend saw it and said "Read Siddharttha by <a href="HermannHesse.html">HermannHesse</a> - it's a wonderful book!'.
        <em>not his best work (prob. magister ludi), a bit lightweight but entertaining.</em>

        Thanks - she's going to look out for it, but being a native German speaker she's going to have to wait until she goes back for a holiday before she gets it!
