        'living god': <em>that's a bit much, isn't it? He's just this guy, you know... (apologies to Douglas Adams)</em>

        A bio and list of his books is here at the O'Reilly Books site:
        <a href="http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/344?x-t=book.view">http://www.oreillynet.com/cs/catalog/view/au/344?x-t=book.view</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most significantly, he is the author or co-author of several advances in PL/SQL programming including the Unit Testing Framework for PL/SQL (<a href="PlSqlUnit.html">PlSqlUnit</a>), a definitive approach to PL/SQL exception handling (an extremely challenging area of that language for most beginners), and one of the first and arguably the language's best commercial code library, PL/Vision.
