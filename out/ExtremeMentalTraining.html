        Extreme Mental Training

        Some time ago I read in a IT marketing magazine, that there are ca. 1.3 million highly qualified Indian programmers.

        I guess that quite a lot of them know or <strong>practise Yoga</strong>. From the Patanjali aphorisms and other sources I know that the Yoga adepts are admonished not to share their knowledge with third parties.

      <p>
        As the Yoga literature is freely available now, I see no reason to hide these experiences.

        Wouldn't it be nice to be able <strong>mentally to</strong>

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>edit whole pages</strong> and rush them in the computer in one flow, or 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>simulate/debug routines</strong>?
        </li>

        <em>It is said, that the composer </em>'W.A.Mozart generated whole music pieces mentally<em>' on a walk and put them down mechanically afterwards.</em>

        While browsing the Web I came across a homepage, where the concept of
        <strong></strong><a href="CyberYoga.html">CyberYoga</a><strong> is developed. This Yoga is a challenging </strong>synthesis of classical Yoga, Autogenous Training and Computer Science<strong>. I just drop the German author an email with a link to this page. Perhaps he might be interested to present some of his ideas.</strong>

        The exact opposite of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. XP is about doing, not imagining. XP is about sensing the <em>real</em> program, not dreaming about an imaginary one. For me, it's what a man <em>does</em> with his head that counts.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        A good imagination goes well together with 'doing'. -- fp

        The operative word being <em>together</em>, perhaps.
