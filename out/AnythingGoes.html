        Quotes from philosopher <a href="PaulFeyerabend.html">PaulFeyerabend</a> (<a href="AgainstMethod.html">AgainstMethod</a>).
      </p>
      <code>
        'anything goes' is not a 'principle' I hold...but the terrified<br/>
        exclamation of a rationalist who takes a closer look at history.<br/>

      <code>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The only principle which does not inhibit progress is: anything<br/>
        goes.		<br/>

        And from philosopher ColePorter:
      </p>
      <code>
        Times have changed<br/>
        And we've often rewound the clock<br/>
        Since the Puritans got a shock<br/>
        When they landed on Plymouth Rock.<br/>
        If today, any shock they should try to stem,<br/>
        'Stead of landing on Plymouth Rock,<br/>
        Plymouth Rock would land on them.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        In olden days a glimpse of stocking<br/>
        Was looked on as something shocking<br/>
        Now heaven knows, anything goes<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Good authors too who once knew better words<br/>
        Now only use four letter words writing prose<br/>
        Anything goes<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The world has gone mad today<br/>
        And good's bad today<br/>
        And black's white today<br/>
        And day's night today<br/>
        When most guys today that women prize today<br/>
        Are just silly gigolos<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        So though I'm not a great romancer<br/>
        I know that you're bound to answer<br/>
        When I propose, anything goes<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The world has gone mad today <br/>
        And good's bad today, <br/>
        And black's white today, <br/>
        And day's night today, <br/>
        And that gent today <br/>
        You gave a cent today <br/>
        Once had several chateaux. <br/>
        When folks who still can ride in jitneys <br/>
        Find out Vanderbilts and Whitneys <br/>
        Lack baby clo'es, <br/>
        Anything goes. <br/>
