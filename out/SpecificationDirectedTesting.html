        The only formal specification I've ever seen which a program could be proven against was an algebraic (sp?) one. Even for simple examples, they tend to become quite complex to read  --IljaPreuss

        <em>It is possible, with practice, to write specifications in a "contract" style that can be converted to formal notation as needed.</em> --Myles

        I do it the other way round.

      <p>
        Write the formal specification first, then simply convert the spec into a set of <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> artifacts. Then I use the same spec to quickly derive the set of tests required for the s/w (this process is known as specification-directed testing) .
