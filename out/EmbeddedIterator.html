        Embedded Iterator
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="EmbeddedIterator.html">EmbeddedIterator</a> is a single <a href="ExternalIterator.html">ExternalIterator</a> embedded in the aggregate it iterates over.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What do you mean by embedded?</em> The aggregate has both aggregate and iterator semantics. The aggregate is an iterator over itself.
      </p>

        For example, the Microsoft C++ wrappers for WMI include a class IWbemClassObject. This represents either a WMI class or an instance of a WMI class (ugh!). You iterate over the properties of an instance by first calling IWbemClassObject::BeginEnumeration, then calling IWbemClassObject::Next until the non-error error-code WBEM_S_NO_MORE_DATA is returned.

        From Java: <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a> is both a collection of rows and an iterator over those rows. I think this is crappy. -- <a href="JbRainsberger.html">JbRainsberger</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If during iteration a subroutine were to try to iterate over the same aggregate, it would cause great confusion.

        <a href="EmbeddedIterator.html">EmbeddedIterator</a> could be considered an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>. They are just as hard to use as any other <a href="ExternalIterator.html">ExternalIterator</a>, and introduce additional sources of bugs.
