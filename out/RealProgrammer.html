        A particular sub-variety of hacker: one possessed of a flippant attitude toward complexity that is arrogant even when justified by experience. The archetypal `Real Programmer' likes to program on the bare metal and is very good at same, remembers the binary opcodes for every machine he has ever programmed, thinks that HLLs are sissy, and uses a debugger to edit his code because full-screen editors are for wimps. Real Programmers aren't satisfied with code that hasn't been bummed into a state of tenseness just short of rupture. Real Programmers never use comments or write documentation: "If it was hard to write", says the Real Programmer, "it should be hard to understand." Real Programmers can make machines do things that were never in their spec sheets; in fact, they are seldom really happy unless doing so. A Real Programmer's code can awe with its fiendish brilliance, even as its crockishness appalls. Real Programmers live on junk food and coffee, hang line-printer art on their walls, and terrify the crap out of other programmers - because someday, somebody else might have to try to understand their code in order to change it. Their successors generally consider it a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> that there aren't many Real Programmers around any more.

        I think that <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>s don't program at all, they think in high-level concepts and let their fingers do the programming. I remember that I was shocked a couple of years ago when I was working in an office with no lights, and it got dark; it was then that I discovered that I could touch type. I've been programming for about fifteen years and I finally realized that the reason I can listen to loud music whilst coding is because I don't pay any attention to syntax, it just flows out correctly, in any language I know. I think of higher level abstractions. -- <a href="BryanDollery.html">BryanDollery</a>

        I had a sort of discussion with someone on an interview yesterday. The way we figured it is that a <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> started long enough ago that they had to start with <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> and have done a lot of things the hard way. We lamented the fact that there are mindless drones coming out of 6-month "Web Certification" courses with a smattering of VB perhaps and some HTML who think that they can design software. Whereas many of us who have been doing this for twenty years or so have had lots of Data Structures, <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>, punch cards, etc.

        The first programmers of the modern era used patch cords, not punch cards. (Previous to the modern era of computers, a programmer was a person who gave the instructions to the computer. The computer was a guy or gal with a pad of paper and a mechanical calculator. They used lots of these computers on the ManhattanProject. Whole rooms full of computers worked in parallel. Hardware has changed, but what about software?) --<a href="BobBockholt.html">BobBockholt</a>

        I think a real programmer should know how to communicate, along with how to think.
        Since problems programmers should solve these days are not usually simple for a single programmer - however proficient he is, - to solve in given time, we programmers should collaborate each other. In this regards, I imagine a real programmer as someone who knows how to communicate with others. It seems easy, but many programmers are not good at communication, especially at listening. So, when there is something to discuss, people usually end up with another meeting, which drags a project (and which many of you are familiar with). A real programmer should be able to listen what other programmers are really trying to say, as well as be able to deliver his own thought.
        A real programmer should also be familiar with abstractions and details at the same time. He should be able to choose the level of abstraction he'd work with, so he ought to know about paradigms, patters and specific languages. This does not necessarily mean he should know everything, but what it does mean is, he should know what levels of abstractions there are in the world, and be able to choose properly among them with given problems. -- <a href="JiwonSeo.html">JiwonSeo</a>

        The <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> bit at the top is a stereotype. Like a good horoscope, you'll find a bit of yourself in it.
        And, when you do, it brings both pride and shame. Pride because we like the title of <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>, and shame
        because, well, a part of us is in there and it's not a pretty picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can say it here, for all to read: for years I've been ashamed I wasn't a real programmer because I  like quiche.
      </p>
      <p>
        For the record, a real programmer, in my book, should have a clue what is happening under the hood when he
        compiles source, runs a script, or draws text on the screen.
      </p>
      <p>
        He should probably have written a little assembly, a toy compiler, and
        an interpreter, something graphics, a bit of text processing...Oh! Heck! Just read my resume and put
        diminuatives in front of my accomplishments! (kinda kidding)

        I totally agree. A <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> is able to tell what exactly his code does. Let me elaborate. Any programmer can
        tell you what happens on her end of a library class or function she is using. A <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>, on the other hand,
        is usually able to explain what it is the library is doing; and if asked for details he will go down as far as
        the hardware level.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another property which usually goes with being a <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> is the ability to write huge amounts of code
        without a concrete design in mind. Once a <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> has read the description of a problem, if she is able to
        solve it at all, she already has an abstract model of the complete solution in mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> is often able to express himself in a very broad spectrum of <a href="FormalLanguage.html">FormalLanguage</a>s. If he ever
        comes across a language he doesn't know yet, it will pick up the basics in one or two days (although he will not
        completely master it any earlier than anyone else).
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> also typically has a lot of experience designing algorithms, finding and implementing solutions
        to unique problems, and just coding for fun. However, this can't be measured in years. Someone who has been
        programming for more than 15 years (like me) is not necessarily more of a <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> or more experienced
        than anyone else. The ability to pick up new concepts and adapt to changes is a key ability of a <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ah yes, and something no-one can be sure of is the relation of being a <a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a> to the ability to write code
        in <a href="BrainfuckLanguage.html">BrainfuckLanguage</a>. The matter is being investigated.

        Re: <em>just whistle the binary code into the modem</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I actually used to do this on the job. I once worked at a place that had a DEC/VAX mini with a bank of about 8 modems for VT100-compatible terminals. If there were modem complaints such as dial-in problems, I had to first figure out which modem was connected to which phone number. Others didn't always keep the map up-to-date. Plus, it used busy-roll-over. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The test phone was a ways away from the modem bank for the VAX minicomputer, so I had to keep the modem trying to connect long enough until I got there to see which modem answered the call (via LED). The only easy way I found to do this was to manually whistle an acceptable modem tone into the phone in order to trick the modem into thinking I was a modem trying to connect. This would keep it trying long enough to allow me to run from the test phone to the modem bank. It had to be the right pitch and wavering to work most of the time. I got pretty good at it after a while. I learned to "speak modem" a bit.
      </p>
      <p>
        A computer-room technician once saw me whistling modem sounds into the phone and running back and forth. I later told him why, and he told me I was nuts and mumbled something about whistling sweat nothings to my robotic girlfriends. -t
