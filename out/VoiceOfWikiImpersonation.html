      <p>
        Attempts (or alleged attempts) to make a controversial opinion sound more authorative by authoring it in unsigned <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> (in particular, on its own page so it isn't part of a discussion on a larger topic).  This topic itself is controversial--some folks hold that unsigned <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> content is <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a> (and thus is more authorative, and should be subject to higher standards of authorship).  Others disagree on this point.
