        Java Byte Code

      <p>
        The <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> format used by the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>. Sun tries to sell it as a general-purpose bytecode format. This has had some success: there are now several other languages that compile to <a href="JavaByteCode.html">JavaByteCode</a> resulting in <a href="OtherLanguagesForTheJavaVm.html">OtherLanguagesForTheJavaVm</a>.

        <em>Arguably the Internet needs an efficient, secure, portable, bytecode. The timing was just right to exploit web browsers and anti-Microsoft feeling. The big shame about the bytecode is that it was only aimed at Java in the beginning. Now it has crowded out other more general </em><a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>s.<em></em>

        I'm currently exploring the OO <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> which does all the things that TCL or Perl do but allows you to produce much more readable code. And if the
        <a href="JavaByteCode.html">JavaByteCode</a> does become the network <a href="LinguaFranca.html">LinguaFranca</a> of the next century I know I can
        always use JPython (<a href="JavaPython.html">JavaPython</a>) to run my objects on whatever systems exist in the future. -- <a href="MichaelDillon.html">MichaelDillon</a>

        Agreed. This is partly due to ingenuity of compiler vendors when faced with an unsympathetic machine. I didn't mean to imply that other languages couldn't be done for it, just that they have to work harder and perhaps be less efficient than they ought. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        Where are (major) signs that 'Sun tries to sell it as a general-purpose bytecode format'?

        In JDK 1.4, the debugging architecture was extended for other languages that are compiled to Java sources (to translate the source line numbers). See
