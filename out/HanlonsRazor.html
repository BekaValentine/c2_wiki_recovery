        <dd> The derivation of the Hanlon eponym is not definitely known, but a very similar remark ("You have attributed conditions to villainy that simply result from stupidity.") appears in "Logic of Empire", a classic 1941 SF story by Robert A. Heinlein, who calls it the `devil theory' of sociology. Heinlein's popularity in the hacker culture makes plausible the supposition that `Hanlon' is derived from `Heinlein' by phonetic corruption. A similar epigram has been attributed to William James, but Heinlein more probably got the idea from Alfred Korzybski and other practitioners of <a href="GeneralSemantics.html">GeneralSemantics</a>.</dd>

        <em>"Never ascribe to malice, that which can be explained by incompetence"</em> is a quote from Napoleon.

        <em>It's also been attributed to Machievelli.  Hanlon as a corruption of Heinlein sounds more plausible, but this stuff is basic folk wisdom that's no doubt been repeatedly thought up and independently expressed over centuries.</em>
