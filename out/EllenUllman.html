        She's recently published her first novel, THE BUG (ISBN:0385508603), about a programmer in 1984 struggling with a difficult bug, and the tester who found it.  I've read this book and highly recommend it.  It captures the drama of debugging, the feelings of a programmer under pressure, and typical software company office politics.  Among other things.--<a href="ApoorvaMuralidhara.html">ApoorvaMuralidhara</a>
