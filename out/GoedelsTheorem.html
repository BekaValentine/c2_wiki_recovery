        Goedels Theorem
      </h1>
      <p>
        It is impossible to axiomatize the arithmetic. If you create any finite set of axioms, you can always find a new arithmetic property that can't be proved starting from the axioms.  <em>This is not what Goedel proved.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That assertion <em>was</em> proved by Goedel. See: <a href="http://kilby.stanford.edu/~rvg/154/handouts/incompleteness.html.">http://kilby.stanford.edu/~rvg/154/handouts/incompleteness.html.</a>

        The <em>Goedelic aspect of these axioms</em> is that it has since been proved that God is intrinsically incapable classifying himself as either an actual or a pseudo philosopher.

        This would be fine just so long as we are prepared to conclude that Galileo was not an astronomer. I suspect other problematic examples exist.

        Explanation:
      </p>
      <p>
        A theory is a domain and a set of theorems that apply to that domain.
      </p>
      <p>
        A theorem is an statement that:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Is always true (for all objects in the domain).
        </li>
        <li>
           Can be proven true through something called a demonstration.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        A demonstration is a sorted linear linked list of statements that, based on that the previous statement is true, and a set of statements that allow for transformation of the previous statement:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Prove the next statement is true.
        </li>
        <li>
           The proven theorem is true and therefore can be used as a transformation for proving new thoerems.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        An statement can be true or false given a set of objects in the domain.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Given that a demonstration is a list of statements, it turns out that given a possible theorem, the only way to prove would be:
      </p>
      <p>
        a) to find an infinite number of statements, for which the first we would never have and therefore this is not a demonstration.
        b) to find circular statements, so that there is no beginning and no end, and therefore this would be circular reasoning, also not a demonstration.
        c) to have a defined first statement and walk its way into the result into a finite number of steps. This is the only possible logical answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that that is true, some statements must be assumed to be true from the beginning, otherwise we would never have a first statement. Those first statements are called axioms of the theory and they are assumed to be true. If you take different axioms you end up with a different theory, but in some cases different axioms lead exactly to the same theory, because the set {a,b,c} of axioms allow to demonstrate {d} and the set {a,b,d} allow to demonstrate {c}, etc.
