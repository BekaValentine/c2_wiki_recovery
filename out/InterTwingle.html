        Inter Twingle

      <p>
        <a href="InterTwingle.html">InterTwingle</a> is similar to the <a href="XanaduProject.html">XanaduProject</a> because they're both based on the philosophy that links between things are sometimes as important as, if not more important than, the things themselves. With Xanadu, the things were documents, whereas with the original <a href="InterTwingle.html">InterTwingle</a> idea, the things are people and email messages.

        Etymological speculation: "intertwingle" seems like an intertwingling of "intermingle" and "intertwine".

        There might also be a mapping between this idea and <a href="GraphTheory.html">GraphTheory</a> since representing intertwingled information would require some kind of unweighted undirected graph. I wonder what kind of data structures would be needed to represent this? -- <a href="AdewaleOshineye.html">AdewaleOshineye</a>

        Ted Nelson coined the term "intertwingle" as a kind of synonym for "intermingle" but on steroids, and was fond of the phrase "everything is deeply intertwingled" e.g. in his influential double book "Computer Lib"/"Dream Machines".
