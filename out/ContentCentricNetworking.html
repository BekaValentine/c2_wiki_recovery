        Content Centric Networking

      <p>
        <strong>Content-centric networking</strong> is either of two things... it may be a Xerox Parc project.

        From the name, one might imagine that <a href="ContentCentricNetworking.html">ContentCentricNetworking</a> (CCN) involves locating and communicating resources or data based on their content. Unfortunately, it's a misleading misnomer. CCN is a particular brand of distribution network (not a generic brand) that accesses data by <em>name</em> rather than by content, but involves replicating that named content across the cloud. If we want to access resources by content, it is instead called ContentAddressableNetworking (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_addressable_network)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_addressable_network)</a> or content-addressed memory.

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The misleading nature of the name has some people (including me) resisting its use. But the actual CCN communication model is interesting and integrates security concerns, resource management concerns, and has proven effective enough for voice over IP.

        A content-centric network is a network of data or files organized by their content or <em>name</em> (sometimes using <a href="MetaData.html">MetaData</a>), rather than by geo-location or domain address. Most <a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a> file sharing networks use some form of content-centric networking, through the use of semi-equal peers.
