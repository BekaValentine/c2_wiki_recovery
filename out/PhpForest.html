        Php Forest
      </h1>
      <p>
        PHPForest is planned to be a powerful wiki engine based upon CVS and MySQL. At the moment it's under development (actually, it's just begun) and isn't currently usable, but the intent is to create a highly flexible and powerful website engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic concept is a virtual file system (implemented as a CVS repository with file metadata stored in an SQL table) upon which handlers for various file types performs relevant actions on whatever file is requested. This would include translators for using XML/XSLT, HTML and parsing Wiki pages with the capability of writing additional modules. (Similar to Apache's Handler directive)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Planned Feature List:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> style syntax (with some ideas also borrowed from <a href="PmWiki.html">PmWiki</a>, <a href="FlexWiki.html">FlexWiki</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           SubPages/Subdirectories (again, borrowed from <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Unix-like page permissions (a bit like <a href="CoWiki.html">CoWiki</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Templates
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> compatibility
        </li>
        <li>
           Natural Page Titles (i.e. allow use of <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s for page names, whilst still having easily readable, natural page titles)
        </li>
        <li>
           Full file versioning
        </li>
        <li>
           File uploads
        </li>
        <li>
           Plugin Support
        </li>
        <li>
           Breadcrumbs (navigational backlinks)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Those are some ideas off the top of my head. I shall update this as development moves forward. I don't have any working code, however my website (see <a href="http://stuartl.longlandclan.hopto.org">http://stuartl.longlandclan.hopto.org</a> ) is somewhat close to what I'd want in a Wiki package. This site is purely SQL-based though.

        Update 14/02/2005: Development has moved forward... ever so slightly. - I have a PHP class which allows rudimentary CVS operations (add, get, delete, edit commands). Next step, the virtual filesystem manager class. :-)
