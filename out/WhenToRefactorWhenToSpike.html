        When To Refactor When To Spike
      </h1>
      <p>
        We're told that <a href="MercilessRefactoring.html">MercilessRefactoring</a> leads to well-balanced code ready to <a href="EmbraceChange.html">EmbraceChange</a>, and most of us think we know what that looks like. Basically when you can't smell any more <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s, your code is in good shape. But that's only PinholeOptimization of the design, and PinholeOptimization is notoriously limited.

      <p>
        Being rather more clever than we like to admit, we all know those moments of insight when we see a <a href="LargeRefactoring.html">LargeRefactoring</a> and decide to go for it. This is typically where we engage our brains and <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>. If we can successfully express the <a href="LargeRefactoring.html">LargeRefactoring</a> with a <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>, then we feel like it's safe to deploy across the whole system's design - and then we use the simple ReFactorings to iteratively deploy it. -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
