        <em>But what is an "anti comment"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is anticomment because in a usual code everything is code except that preceded by // or bracketed by /**/ which are comments. Could use <code></code> instead but needs a method to distinguish from space indent if people are just talking informally about code. In this case (wiki) most of the text in a page amounts to <a href="NaturalLanguage.html">NaturalLanguage</a> comments not easily parsed by a machine so by embedding "code" - just attribute and method declarations so far - preceded by // to delimit them they take on the opposite (anti) meaning. Perhaps a better name would be WikiEmbeddedCode but this was the first to come to mind. There could also be a <a href="WikiCodeRunner.html">WikiCodeRunner</a> page to parse this code (see link)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think calling code "code" is more intuitive.</em>

      <p>
        Proposal to have a convention for embedding machine readable data in wiki page text such as but not 
        necessarily //. The code could be pseudo-javascript that is relatively easy to understand by most and os independent. Similar to <a href="MappingSourceCodeWithWiki.html">MappingSourceCodeWithWiki</a> but for real wiki (this) where people knowledgeable in a topic might take the time to identify basic attributes and methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Initially it could be used just as a quick reference by programmers 
        for common object definitions - customers, products, graphics objects even if no detailed code was involved. Later on it could be made more rigorous and interfaces developed to directly extract it by machines. There could also be a <a href="MessageTranslator.html">MessageTranslator</a> to map to existing schemas where applicable ie 2D wiki object definitions  to <a href="ScalableVectorGraphics.html">ScalableVectorGraphics</a>, Chemical to ChemML, music to MusicML, business to ebXML.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes many examples of such definitions are already all over the web but wiki would allow a comprehensive and easily accessible ontology to be developed with the advantage of substantial peer review. Also helps with database design since attributes map to table schema subject to 
        <a href="ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch.html">ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatch</a> but would give a quick starting point for objects never encountered before. A Customer class is easy enough to do in your head but how about a MitochondriaObject, WindshearObject,EconomicAcceleratorObject ?
      </p>
      <p>
        Many pages are just discussions so would not need <a href="AntiComment.html">AntiComment</a>s but where links are classes that might need modelling somewhere why not try to come up with a canonical description.
      </p>
      <p>
        They could go at the end similar to "<a href="SeeAlso.html">SeeAlso</a>" to be easy to find.
