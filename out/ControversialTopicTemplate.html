        Controversial Topic Template
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a suggested template for controversial topics in order to reduce <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>. Coffee is used merely as an example here.

        Coffee is allegedly great for the following reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Helps you wake up faster
          <ul>
            <li>
               Con: Does not work for everyone
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Makes you more productive
          <ul>
            <li>
               Con: Can make you jittery and unpleasant, canceling out any speed-based productivity.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

           Tastes Wonderful
          <ul>

        This is bogus. There's never been a double-blind study of this.

        But they only studied females. I'm a male.

        People like this are that way anyhow. They shouldn't blame it on coffee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not unpleasant, you pig-faced liar!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I rest my case.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's because I drank coffee, stupid. I am not normally this way.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, come back when you stop drinking it.
