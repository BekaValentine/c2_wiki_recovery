        Pattern Writing Aids Learning
      </h1>
      <p>
        It is possible to write Patterns or a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> for subjects
        for which you are not <em>yet</em> a master.
      </p>
      <p>
        The exercise of discovering and documenting patterns can help
        you master a subject.  Of course, these patterns should not be published (or even
        distributed), but if you follow the rule of <strong>revise and rewrite</strong>,
        then they will perhaps improve to the point of being publishable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will use <a href="DonKnuth.html">DonKnuth</a>'s <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> as an example.  By documenting 
        everything as you write code, you are forced to understand what you
        are coding.  You eliminate <em>magic</em> code (code that you may
        have cut and pasted from other sources) because you have to
        explain the magic away.  For example, if you implement a sophisticated
        sorting algorithm in your code, you may not have to understand
        exactly how it works in order to use it.  Re-casting it as a literate
        programming document forces you to understand exactly how the
        sort works.  You may even find that you can improve the implementation of the algorithm.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same can be said for writing Patterns.  
        Writing can be used as an aid to
        mastering a subject. This is similar to, 
        but not the same as,
        writing Patterns as 
        part of the design process.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep in mind that Patterns written as learning aids
        are just experiments, they may not be true.
        In the end they will often be discarded (or archived
        as personal notes).
