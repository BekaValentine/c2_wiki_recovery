        Do you want to know how much money and time is wasted in the U.S. by workers using poorly designed applications? Have computers <em>really</em> improved our lives? This book takes a close look at how computers are failing us due to poor usability.  The cost is staggering.

        The book also offers a solution (one we have all heard before, but the revolution has yet to catch on): <strong></strong><a href="UserCenteredDesign.html">UserCenteredDesign</a><strong>. -- </strong><a href="ToddCoram.html">ToddCoram</a>

        Another "technosceptic" book: <a href="SiliconSnakeOil.html">SiliconSnakeOil</a> by <a href="CliffordStoll.html">CliffordStoll</a>. I found <a href="SiliconSnakeOil.html">SiliconSnakeOil</a> to be far more original and enjoyable. Perhaps this was the case because it didn't try to sound like an academic economics textbook.
        Personally, I find Landauer's great conclusions about <a href="UserCenteredDesign.html">UserCenteredDesign</a> to be a
        little puny and obvious. --
