        </li>
        <li>
           2010-08-24 0157: Charlies doors blown off by Denise.  Major high over Washington state. Catfight in store?  Long arm of Denise extending NE to low in Canada to New Mexico with severe storm front marching east and south across continental US.
        </li>
        <li>
           2010-08-23 1440: Uh-oh, Danielle is hooking left instead of right as of last few hours.  Still plenty of room to hook NE eventually (hope).  What a big mess in Gulf... Wet Highs continuing to form around near it.  <em>Water</em> temperature likely to have risen quite a bit.
        </li>

           2010-08-23 0331: Charlie changing base to Dallas. 0711: Sol taking another swing around.  Record highs and dry weather in Cincinnati vicinity for a while.  Charlie fades as previous Michigan high extends arm SW.  Good news but powerful storm front has formed over the Rockies over night.  Strong high to NW of US to push it eastwards.  High bubbles merging in SW; Charlie story not over yet.  NE US getting drenched.

           2010-08-23 0000-8: The <strong>LORD</strong> possessed me at the beginning of His way, before His works of old. -Proverbs 8:23...  0012: Phew! Thx BlueAngle, Danielle likely to hook NE and remain over Altantic.
        </li>
        <li>
           2010-08-22 1754 milstd: Low over Oklahoma fading out and making room for Charlie.  Midwest badly needs the rain, but do we have to get oily dumped on us?  Storm sewers leaking natural gas all day.  Yick! 1950: Midwest thunderstorms develop as volatile air cools? 1953: Not likely, but Charlie looking mighty strong coming up valley. Low over Oklahoma may fade to an awful wet high pushed up Ohio River valley.  2144: weather pic of 2125 shows Canada to get hit by string of deep lows... Some are bound to get pushed SE from up north. 2242: Connect the dots from Mexico/Gulf high to Denver high to Michigan high.  Setting up a mean left hook for Danielle?

Appeared to be heading straight for Charlie. 10-4. over.  1645: Huge cold spot will be eye of Danielle.  1649: Tropical Storm Danielle has formed well out in the eastern Atlantic Ocean. 1742:  Crud.  1/2 Olde English HD800 kicking my tail.  Putting cork in it and switching to coffee.  Looks like I'm on alert. A good ole Coke will get me kicked started.  Screw, Pop, Phiz, Oh, What a relief it is!  :)

        </li>
        <li>
           2010-08-22 0550 milstd: Perhaps Tropical Depression 6 (not yet Danielle) will put a Whammy on The Great Mississippi River Basin? See <a href="http://www.weather.com/outlook/videos/will-we-have-danielle-soon-6584">http://www.weather.com/outlook/videos/will-we-have-danielle-soon-6584</a>  Definitive Cyclone detected. Latest projected path does not include a hook to the NE.  With Charlie forming also, a long range path is hard to predict at this point.
        </li>
        <li>
           BP probably still milking <em>relief well</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           08-22-2010: Subtropical High now forming over Denver.  To be inverted-hurricane Charlie?  Looks like it will merge with tropical high currently over BP sludge in the Gulf.

           08-21-2010: After an unpleasant and torturous <em>vacation</em>, I am back to work.  Local govt due for a wake up soon. See <a href="http://cnub.org/Lindsly_vs_Worley.ashx">http://cnub.org/Lindsly_vs_Worley.ashx</a> for updates to cover recent history.

           2010-07-15~:  I contacted the local Navy officers repeatedly.  The US was experiencing record high temperatures and severe thunderstorms due to Billy.  We managed to pass a message up the chain of command to the Chief of Naval Operations (Admiral) within a few days.  My news was that the attempted reopening of the cap was to be blocked.  Navy Marines and Seals should run BP out of the Gulf and seal that wound properly.  Dump concrete blocks, nails and cement en mass and permanently floor the area of the blowout.  National Guard was to close in on all BP stations within the US and take them over.  Nationalized stations to be renamed <strong>Porto Flyers</strong> and ownership given to the 51st state: Puerto Rico.  BP polluted the Gulf, no doubt, while fooling around in International Waters.  Weather patterns severely effected by Tropical Depression 2 and Inverted-Hurricane Billy which was seeded by the heat and fumes rising from the black slick.

Please put a stop to it, Mr. Obama.  Iran has plenty of oil.  Perhaps we can ship them solar panels for some of that if they need clean energy.

        Hi all. I have over 20 years in the software development biz. I have handled most areas of the biz from a proprietor's point of view as well as an employee's. I enjoy both high-level design and system level or engine work and definitely have done too much <a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a>. ;) Some nine years ago, my career took a nose-dive as I turned down a major player which had just (in my opinion, hostilely) taken over the company for which I worked. It hurt to see MY work snatched out from underneath me. Needless to say, I was rather disappointed. Feeling disgusted with my career, I took off on a WalkAbout. I explored a lot of the country and did much soul searching. After a while, I realized that I really did enjoy programming work and came back to it. I refocused on small non-computer-oriented companies which needed computer work, but I find that I miss the team environment. I am currently looking for a small game development company which could use my skill set.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is one of my trademarks that I publish only perfected work. Yes, perfection <strong>is</strong> possible. Work on an idea till you are blue in the face over and over again; eventually... Eureka! It is complete. As an example, many years ago, I wrote a book / software system called <strong>The Solid B+ Toolbox</strong> At its core was a <strong><em>B+ tree</em></strong> implementation which I actually managed to <em>prove</em> perfect (correct) -- not by testing, but by mathematical induction. If Microsoft didn't buy it for their SQL implementation, they more than likely didn't do it right - except that they <strong>might</strong> have swiped copyrighted material that was patentable.

        Btw, as an insider, I <em>know</em> that Microsoft <em>intentionally</em> broke the backwards compatibility to MS-DOS mode programs with Windows95. Thinking <em>they</em> would generate new software to replace the classics that would no longer work on machines that should have no problem with emulating MS-DOS 6.22. The Justice Department should storm Microsoft and turn their stolen resources into <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>. No if, ands, or buts about it. No more chances to play clean, Microsoft. You've been playing dirty for too long. I am sure Mr. Bill Gates can see how this once cool little monster called Microsoft evolved into MacroSloth the monopoly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Allow me to clarify insider... Bill and I have been aware of each other by name since 1980. At that time, my column was published throughout the country in monthly microcomputer user group newsletters. For topic material, I discussed ways I had found to extend the power of the TRS-80s BASIC through machine level code. In 1994, I was lead of the Microsoft Flight Simulator team. Though this product carried the Microsoft name (ie. endorsed Microsoft), it was actually owned by Bruce Artwick (the inventor of the microcomputer version of a flight simulator) and I heartily enjoyed working for him and our team. Enter 1995, Bill decides he wants to own my original work on FlightSim 5.1, Space Simulator II, <em>and</em> my future efforts. [there were some other factors in his decision to take over BAO --The Bruce Artwick Organization] Of course! btw, the press release describing the takeover said: <em>All 30 employees of BAO have relocated and are happy with their new positions.</em> I seriously doubt it. A) Their lead was lost. B) Several other key individuals of the team declined positions. C) Microsoft is a grindhouse (slave pen) and the relocated people are not now happy about their decision. Long before I was able to join the team and assume lead, <strong><em>the</em></strong> <strong>team</strong> was well known as absolutely industry leading. It is extremely disconcerting that Microsoft chose to destroy it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Justice Department has issued the statement that "Microsoft is a monopoly". By law, any newly formed monopoly is to be dissolved. "Microsoft, Inc." no longer has any license to operate. That has been canceled. "Windows 2000 Source Code" has been placed into the public domain. Get your own copy and read it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not appreciate any cooperation with defunct Microsoft.

        Thank you.

          /05/2008: The above was written before Microsoft won it's appeal.  So far, Microsoft has somehow weathered the Monopoly storm (See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft).">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_v._Microsoft).</a> It's practices have not significantly changed. (See <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/tag/antitrust-microsoft.htm).">http://www.zdnet.com.au/tag/antitrust-microsoft.htm).</a>  Obviously, a boycott is in order.  Vista truly does suck.  Refuse to purchase any machine that supposedly won't run XP.  We should have learned our lesson with Win95's intentional incompatibilities.  Too late to nip in the bud, but axing the entire Longhorn/Vista/Win7 branch is certainly possible.  See  <a href="http://reactos.org/">http://reactos.org/</a>

        MONSTER BASH Stuff -- <a href="http://www.3drealms.com/bash">http://www.3drealms.com/bash</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I initiated the MB project with Apogee Software Productions (now 3DRealms) with an early and primitive prototype of the FAST system. Funny-ass first main chracter was a fat boy strolling along. Had some pretty cool throwing/launching Javelin-like physics in there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: you might need a techie to help you install and run it. Unfortunately, the game dates from the MS-DOS era which means that to run it, you may need to boot in MS-DOS mode after adding DOS=HIGH,UMB to your config.sys. Although the game is ancient Chinese technology, it is a classic example of pushing the machine to its limits. In my biased opinion, it is worth the look see. Btw, I designed and coded the <em>system</em> software. See the credits page. The term FAST, coined by Apogee president Scott Miller as I recall, stands for Fluid Animation Software Technology. At the time when the game was first published, there was no other technology in its class. <em>actually, there still is no other... it is probably the best EGA game ever produced.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I ran Monster Bash with no special preparation, but I've yet to complete the first level!</em> Hmmm... <a href="WinDoze.html">WinDoze</a> usually doesn't leave enough conventional memory for Bash... SoundBlaster support requires EMS memory too, though the game does put out primitive sounds through the built-in PC speaker. Anyway, I hope you are enjoying it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I use an SB16 card to avoid having a separate amplifier. Don't know if that's relevant.</em> Not really relevant (though that is convenient). It is rather cumbersome to explain how to set up EMS with EMM386.exe and the proper environment string for SoundBlaster support. Setting these up used to be commonplace - hopefully you can get some assistance from someone who has been fooling with computers for a while (8+ years). <em>I like the music, and it definitely comes from the speakers plugged into my SB16 card. The 'blaster' environment variable is set correctly.</em> ;) glad you like the music... To get DSP sounds also you'll need to have EMS.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nothing wrong with EGA - I still have lots of MGA cards! Somewhat demanding, though, to insist that one's version of MSDOS supports DOS=HIGH,UMB. Does the game insist on a true EGA monitor? I just ditched my last controller which can emulate EGA transparently.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, it is not so portable as all that. Basically, it needs a EGA / PC clone. Todays SupraMicro hardware should have no problem running it. The problem is the broken operating system refusing to run excellent programs. The minimum requirements are listed at the bottom of Bash's home page. If you really want to enjoy the game, set up EMS memory and your sound blaster config.

        Yes, that's about as real as it gets. By comparison with the ORiGINAL source, that is quite similar to a file included as part of the Apogee sponsored commercial efforts (MB2 and MB3). It is one of the files included as part of the FAST/Apogee protection/security scheme...
      </p>
      <p>
        BASH1 requires NO crack. It is a free gift to you for sharing with whomever you choose. Oops. If you want to know how this game was written... Write it yourself from scratch-tic-tac-toe-Connect4-AI: A 10K demo master that I copyrighted in 1986 and presented at the 1996 San Francisco GDC (Game Developer's Conference). The game Connect4.COM was universally established as "Game of the Year, 1996". (oops, perhaps some selective recall there... ;) I have since then relinquished the copyright of Connect4.com to the public domain. Much later... With that AI primer, the Connect4 game was completely solved by another person.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am sorry to admit that the structure of MB files is patented by the UN (United Nations). ;) Crackers?! Have FUN with that one! (After a long time in the desert, a drink of water and a cracker tastes like manna). <em>szevvy knows what I'm talking about here :)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have continued to maintain the genuine FAST sources and inspiration: artwork, music, data, codes, and system design. Dianna Gruber may verify that. She has published some of my "industry standard" technology.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, I can offer you these hints: "SEA, Inc." developed the original master compression algorithm and file format (.ARC). It is called LZW compression [Limpel-Ziv-Welch: the scientists who cooperated to create/invent it]. "<a href="CompuServe.html">CompuServe</a>, Inc." used LZW as the basis of their .GIF design. [I call LZW and ZIP "masterful" because they foregoe the "compression lookup table" required by Huffman encoding which was boss before LZW] After MB was published, the LZW algorithm was bought by "UniSys, Inc." and patented. At this time, I am pretty sure that THAT particular patent has expired. UniSys bought it to help protect my copyright (ha! ;). Thanks to Justice Department intervention, Phil Katz then came up with the brilliant .ZIP format to replace LZW and gave it away for free. We owe him a great debt. Unfortunately for us, he has passed on to a plane of higher existence. Thanks so much, PK!
      </p>
      <p>
        I adapted the LZW algorithm for FAST somewhat, but a "standard" decoder for it might decompress the files to the form that they are used internally by MB. Note that, in addition, each of the file types has it own compression/interpretation scheme also (adapted to the particular type of data). MB is actually a HUGE game. Incredible that we managed to squeeze each of the chapters onto single floppies. (toot, toot!)

        PS: id Software (<a href="http://www.idsoftware.com)">http://www.idsoftware.com)</a> gave me the BASH songs in .IMF format (IdMusicForm).
        This is one particular reverse engineering job I've still yet to tackle. I wrote the driver/interpreter for .IMF files [so know how they are organized... (Strictly toward high speed)]. I am planning to convert the .IMFs to MIDI (.mid). (Someday... ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hey Gerald, you mind releasing the IMFs to the public? I love the music from Monster Bash, and I'd kill to get my hands on it. Especially since it's next to impossible to get my computer to play the game with sound. -- Zero X. Diamond</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am glad you enjoyed the music; however, the music files (along with all other Monster Bash resources) are likely to remain copyrighted between 3DRealms(Apogee)/FrankMaddin/myself/id Software and the original composers/artists & programmers (you could ask id or 3DRealms if ya really wanna know who composed the songs).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No chance of any more hints about the compression used in Monster Bash? I've been sitting here for hours changing bits in mb1_h10.txt, firing up the game, and looking to see what the change is... not even a *little* hint? :D -- szevvy</em>

        This would take too much space here on my homepage (<em>well, actually not that much room... LZW source code currently posted to the bottom of this page</em>). I have some C code to decompress the entries in BASH?.dat files. Perhaps post soon? It really crunches out LZW QIK (of course, FAST!) Any requests to see here? VOTES?:

        <em>I've spent countless sleepless hours working out the files for Monster Bash. I'm up to the stage where I can even draw levels with foreground/background-on tiles, draw most sprites correctly, extract all the music, and so on. However, I've found that there's some kind of error in my un-LWZ'ing, and the background data for level 4 in bash1 doesn't work and drops bytes. Please, put me out of my misery and put that "C/386 code to extract the BASH?.dat files" up so I can see what I'm doing wrong.

        btw, LZW actually has a VERY good compression rate. Not quite the space savings of ZIP files but reasonably close for most applications. As you can see, the decompression code is quite short compared to zlib. FAST too. ;)

        Thank you, I am tickled. I guess it is still a work in progress. Mentally, I have the tune/melody, but I haven't written it down. The rest of the composition would fall into place if I would take the time to work it out. I really<em> should </em>work on it. Since the Yahoo! page for that went down I'm gonna repost it here again temporarily. THX:

        "What are we trying to do here?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently known forms of government are hopelessly flawed. Given year 2000.2 and our current machine technology it is theoretically possible to implement a new form of government. One in which the computer will intelligently assist people to achieve goals beneficial to all. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who can do what?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone can do anything for which they are willing to reap the rewards or pay the price: <strong>Responsible Accountability</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        What I really meant by the question was that we need a centralized secure database to house this information: RegisteredIndividuals, home pages, skill sets. 
      </p>
      <p>
        That goes double for: "Who wants to do what?" Jobs, Goals. 
      </p>
      <p>
        "Who can see something that needs to be done and does it without having to be told?" 
      </p>
      <p>
        Bonuses for autonomous achievements. Cooperation will always get you there faster than competition. 
      </p>

        'Inevitably see <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a>.' Perhaps inevitably, but let us not trifle with Stone technology at this point.

        Initially I took a very quick look at <a href="StoneSociety.html">StoneSociety</a> (on the Wiki) and saw something very different than what I see now... Not sure where that went. After scanning <a href="http://home.san.rr.com/merel/ss.html,">http://home.san.rr.com/merel/ss.html,</a> it seems to me that Stones essentially represent money but with highly regulated rules about how they are spent. What I am looking for with Programmable Government is a system where positions/jobs can be matched to people/skillsets. Our current society is too limiting in this respect. Each of us has acquired diverse skillsets and is gifted with individual talents. For example, a programmer job would likely not require adroitness on the piano, but the individual fitted to the job might have this skill. I am thinking in particular of ships (this would also apply to companies) needing a broad range of skills but limited to a small set of personnel.

        'On a somewhat more serious note, see ActiveInstitutions?.' Ok, been making
        rounds... This is most definitely not a trivially proposed project.

        Representative Democracy is undesirable because NONE of US (We, The People) care to have another individual vote for us on issues that matter - particularly not when that individual has proved themself to be an ignorant ladder climber who somehow managed to score high in a popularity contest: ("Hi! This cute sweetie wants your vote and is willing to tell you what you want to hear - integrity, intelligence and wisdom do not matter to me. What was that again? You wanted to hear me say what?")

        Nice shot. I can't picture a more risky safe stab at an evil establishment. Thank you.

        Perhaps we can rebuild, but can we make it a true World Trade Center this time and not a gambling house?

        Hey! Where'd their compiler go? I suspect that they are keeping that superior technology to themselves at this time. Wise move. -- gl

        <em>If this is the technology reviewed at </em><a href="http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/reviews/2940/1/,">http://www.hardwarecentral.com/hardwarecentral/reviews/2940/1/,</a> then the above description is confused. Soundmax is simply on on-mainboard audio solution, high enough quality to obviate the need (at least in many cases) to buy a sound card.<em></em>

        <em>What does a Modula compiler have to do with it? And isn't Modula-2 long obsolete?</em>

      <p>
        Can't stop now to explain acoustics to you at present. <a href="ModulaTwo.html">ModulaTwo</a> still has its uses. Logitech was a fantastic software company long before they changed their public offerings to hardware. <a href="NiklausWirth.html">NiklausWirth</a>! :: The sequence approximately goes like this: 8)SUN. Babbage & Ada: Computer? ENIAC, MACHINE, CPU (IBM:Motorola/Zenith2:Intel-Zilog-AMD:), ASM, VAX, PL/1, LISP, Fortran, Algol, Pascal, CP/M, B, BASIC, Modula, C, Ada, Modula-2, C++, Modula-3, Oberon, Java/Sun -->
      </p>
      <p>
        The key contribution by Wirth is PROVABLE Languages. Total genius. -- gl <em>Perhaps Java is in this realm?</em> Probably... I could almost guarantee Sun borrowed ideas from Oberon (garbage collection for one). I am not sure how provable Java code is. Mutable types would probably cause major headaches.
