        Multi Voting
      </h1>
      <p>
        A pattern to help meetings move along.  This is from <a href="TheTeamHandbook.html">TheTeamHandbook</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a bunch of things you want to prioritize, possibly because you were just <a href="BrainStorm.html">BrainStorm</a>-ing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The number of things to prioritize exceeds the number of participants in the meeting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You want to get this meeting over with.
        </li>
        <li>
           People want to feel they took part in the decision.
        </li>
        <li>
           People want to feel that the priorities really reflect the group's priorities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Do the following:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Assign each participant at least 1/3 as many votes as there are things to prioritize.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Have everyone vote.  Voters can distribute their votes however they see fit.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Remove those items receiving few votes from the bottom.  They are clearly "low-priority".
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Repeat with the remaining items as necessary.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything is now roughly prioritized.  You might want to discuss the high-priority items individually if there is no clear top-priority item.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Rationale</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The group should have consensus, which SingleVoting does not really provide.  By using <a href="MultiVoting.html">MultiVoting</a>, participants can indicate how important to them the various choices are.
