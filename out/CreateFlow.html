        Create Flow
      </h1>
      <p>
        One aspect of good writing is to create flow for the reader. 
        The text has to have a pace, a point and a purpose to it, allowing
        the reader to follow the writing's flow, and thus get into flow.
        Links can be used to great effect here, allowing side-arguments
        to be put on separate pages (with return links) so they are there
        if the reader wants to know more, but don't break the main line
        of narrative. <em></em><a href="ThePleasuresOfCounting.html">ThePleasuresOfCounting</a><em> by T.W. Kï¿½rner</em>
        (ISBN  0-52-156823-4) uses side-notes, rather than footnotes, 
        and this is very effective in helping keep the pace at whatever
        the reader wants.
