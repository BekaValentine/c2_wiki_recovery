        This is a monologue of type two:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Several possible types (starting with three)
          <ul>
            <li>
               One - make a statement via a monologue and if <strong>anyone</strong> disagrees, they can disagreeByDeleting (a monologue made in this fashion will have ultra-short life, for someone who reads it will make it their business to disagree about almost it and delete it) (similiar to walking away from an orator in London's Hyde Park)
            </li>
            <li>
               Two - make a statement via monologue and subject it to reader voting (similar to the Tonight Show where applause level shows audience approval)
            </li>
            <li>
               Three - make a statement via monologue and subject it to a limited lifetime: day, week, month or other such period, after which time the writer or one appointed to do so, will delete it. (similar to writing a message in disappearing ink)
              <ul>
                <li>
                   even though nothing really ever completely disappears once it appears upon the internet, in emails or in a cloud
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
