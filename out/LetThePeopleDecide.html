        Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin (1807�74), in the French Revolution, allegedly said as the Mob streamed off on yet another bloodthirsty venture:
      </p>

        <em>There go the people. I must follow them, for I am their leader.</em>

        It is remarkable that Alexandre Auguste Ledru-Rollin (1807�74) should have said such a thing during the French Revolution, since he was born a number of years after the French Revolution ended. (Actually, the man <em>allegedly</em> said something of the sort during the February days of the 1848 Revolution.)
