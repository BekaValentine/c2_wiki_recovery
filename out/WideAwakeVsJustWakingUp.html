        While the above may refer to geography and time, in the mental and developmental realm, this holds true to people in various stages of awareness, learning, competence and skill.

      <ul>
        <li>
           This is pointed out in the thinking expressed in "<a href="BecomingCompetent.html">BecomingCompetent</a>"

           It does point out in terms instant messaging and communication, that, while we may be ready to communicate, some one we wish to communicate may be "figuratively" in a later and either passive or unresponsive state, or in the position of "drinking that first cup of coffee to 'wake up'"
        </li>
        <li>
           This is particularly true if the parties involved, even in the same place, listening to one another, or in a discussion, or at a seminar, or in a classroom ( listening to a lecture or viewing a presentation), may be typified as either "WideAwake" or "JustWakingUp"
          <ul>
            <li>
               It is this kind of "MixedAudience" we are involved with in everyday discourse and commerce. What we are talking about or expressing is bound to strike resonance with some and be only "noise or clatter" to others. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Particularly when we are involved in one-way (presentation), or two-way (dialogue) communication, to be effective and successful, we must be mindful of this truth.
