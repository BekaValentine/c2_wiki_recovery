        Code Stench
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="CodeStench.html">CodeStench</a> is a really really REALLY bad <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, an odor so bad that it provokes the retching response, an odor so intense that it permeates the deepest corners of the environment and leaves your clothes smelling bad afterward.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with <a href="CodeStench.html">CodeStench</a> is that it is so intense that it tends to saturate the olfactory organs, numbing them to otherwise-noticeable <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        It can also trigger an immediate over-reaction, resulting in immediate mangling of code in an effort to remove said stench ... without the necessary forethought and consideration, or even <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. If you smell something horrendous, do remember to tread carefully. Be a SoftwareMuckraker:

        Theodore Roosevelt coined the term but as fate would have it he became known as one.

        My reaction to <a href="CodeStench.html">CodeStench</a>es compared to <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s is the same as my reaction to 'real' stenches compared to smells: they make me want to work somewhere else.
