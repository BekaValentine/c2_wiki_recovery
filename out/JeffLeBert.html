      <p>
        I've been programming since I was 12.  24 odd years (some more odd than others).  I started in Basic on a Tandy Color Computer (4K memory, 1500 baud cassette player).  Went through assembly language (6809, Intel, vax), Pascal, C, C++, Foxpro, MS Access.  VB was my language of choice since VB 3 came out.  C++ and MFC were just too much work without any real benefits.

      <p>
        I have converted over to C# as my language of choice.  Microsofts just done too good a job not to switch.

        I currently work for Epicor Software Corporation in the Portland, OR office.
