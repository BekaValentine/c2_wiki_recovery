        Here's a simple idea that might be someone's path to fame and fortune: a separate <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> server that would accept notifications of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> on multiple wikis/<a href="MultiWiki.html">MultiWiki</a> namespaces. A <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a>, if you like. Heck, the more I think about it, the more I feel like Mr & Mrs Yahoo at the birth of their new baby. A simple idea with legs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To make this work we'd benefit from the cooperation of the existing wiki providers, Ward especially, but a simple version could simply go grab the various wiki <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> pages and munge them together every time it got hit. A better way would be for it to cache the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> for say ten minutes and then go get 'em again. The benefit for the wiki providers would be scalability. You know, this might be all that's needed to get an <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> working ... well, this, and having a client <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a> notation something like wikisite.<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> or maybe wikisite.wikinamespace.<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> ... --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to be there at the birth too.  Our preference on <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a>'s is namespace.<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> where the token for namespace within the editing language can be defined for maximum convenience and intelligibility locally.  Other than that, when do we start? --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        There is an old joke in the <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> community that is unfortunately true:  <em>If you have seen one Forth, well, you've seen one Forth.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki seems the same.  After I understood what Wiki was about, I got excited and promptly set one up myself (I used <a href="AtisWiki.html">AtisWiki</a>).  Now after having it running for only a week, I've already made changes to the regular expression that defines a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, and I'm working on syntax for color changes and some other effects I find necessary for my work.  But others are doing even more-- we've got people playing around with multiple namespaces and other cool features.
      </p>
      <p>
        My point is this-- I can't see how a <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a> would work.  The syntax for a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> is only the tip of the iceberg.  The <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a> would need to understand the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> syntax for each system that provided it <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The </em><a href="WikiConsortium.html">WikiConsortium</a> defines a standard API. The <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> authors will work to it in order to get visibility for their portals. The trouble with running a <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> in general is that the moment you link to <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>, most of the content ends up going onto <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>. If <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> replaces the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page with a link to the <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a>, the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> should do the work.<em> --PM</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, what the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> means may have context only to the particular Wiki.  For example, on this Wiki, <a href="DealingWithCumbersomeEnvironments.html">DealingWithCumbersomeEnvironments</a> means one thing, but on a Wiki that was set up for handicapped accessibility issues might have a completely different meaning.  How would the end user of a <a href="WikiPortal.html">WikiPortal</a> know from just the name?  -- <a href="JohnPassaniti.html">JohnPassaniti</a>

I imagine <a href="MultiWiki.html">MultiWiki</a>(s) would want to be able to have Wikisite.Wikinamespace.<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>. Hmm. The dots look kind of slender. I wonder whether Wikisite::Wikinamespace::<a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> mightn't work better? I also wonder whether making Wikinamespace itself a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> in the portal might not be a neat way to obtain Categories ...<em> --</em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        [Perhaps all the naming discussion should be moved to something like InterWikiLink or WikiPortalName.  There is already some discussion in <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> and <a href="InterWikiNameScheme.html">InterWikiNameScheme</a>, but the old <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> idea was a much bigger vision of content sharing (rather than just link sharing).]

        A single . seems too little, while the :: names trigger bad C++ flashbacks...  Personally, I like the scheme that the <a href="ZwikiWeb.html">ZwikiWeb</a> has implemented already.  Inter-wiki links are created like:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>:<a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        ...with some configuration file or Wiki page which maps <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> to <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?</a>  The part after the : is appended to the partial URL yeilding <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InterWiki">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?InterWiki</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> link before the : is the site name, and the rest of the text (up to the next whitespace) is the name of the item on the remote wiki.  This scheme allows other wikis to experiment with various structures while still allowing outside links.  See <a href="http://209.67.167.82/zwiki/UseModWiki">http://209.67.167.82/zwiki/UseModWiki</a> and <a href="http://209.67.167.82/zwiki/InterWiki">http://209.67.167.82/zwiki/InterWiki</a> for samples and explanations.  (<a href="ZwikiWeb.html">ZwikiWeb</a> also takes the radical step of making the sitename/<a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a> link be controlled by an ordinary wiki page.  This may go too far for some people.)--<a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>

        Perhaps we need a central <a href="MyWiki.html">MyWiki</a> site which is told about all of the other wikis on the web. In spider-mode, it would gather recent changes using a <a href="WikiInterchangeFormat.html">WikiInterchangeFormat</a> (transferring metadata, rather than content). Users would register interest in categories on <a href="MyWiki.html">MyWiki</a>, and get web pages / email digests with links to the relevant pages and wiki sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        The metadata would specify things like title, author, keywords and category. It would be up to the individual wiki sites to provide some or all of this information for each of its pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, individual wikis could be taught to post changes to a central site using a standard recent changes format, which might include category/author information as well as time and date.

        It's still forming itself, as far as I know. I had a very pleasant chat with Ward, promised to get right back to him, and was immediately swept off my feet preparing the continuation of a non-wiki-related patent that issues early next week.

        Auxiliary question: I was itching to see a kind of XP process online so I could see a working example. The best learning technique I have is subjecting my hapless organization to yet another experiment. LearnByExperimenting/LearnByIntrospection is slower than LearnByExample. Is this online XP project still going on :), or has this all moved offline :(? net.projects are so hard... don't I know. -- ss (who maybe hopes he can get a good learning job at OTI/Ottawa this summer.

        Might it make sense to go non-wiki for handling <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>?

        Wiki portals seem to be oriented toward some desired future with many active wiki sites.  (As of December 1999, there are about 5 public wikis with at least 5 updates/day.)  Most active wikis (all but this wiki?) are tightly focused on a narrow topic range.  How would a portal benefit those sites?
      </p>
      <p>
        A simple <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a> portal could be written in a couple hundred lines of Perl (mostly processing of different RC formats).  I've started writing my own tiny RC-portal--it just concatenates the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> pages after correcting the URLs.
      </p>
      <p>
        It might be useful to create a an ordinary wiki page for "interesting topics on other wikis".  I'm not convinced a public portal is worthwhile for the few hundred people (mostly lurkers) who make up the wiki community.  Then again, I wasn't very impressed when Yahoo was just a public bookmark list...--<a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>

      <p>
        I've given up on the tiny portal idea--I don't think it is worth the effort to parse the RC formats.  The proto-portal I built was less than 20 lines of Perl (it worked with 4 sites).  I'd rather not experiment with the wiki sites without clear approval from the site owners.  I don't believe that the current generation of wiki servers will scale well.

        If all Wikis output legal XHTML, and maybe threw in a handful of semantic tags, the pages would work both in the browser and be machine readable. That way, copying pages between Wikis would be simple. No extra APIs would have to be developed, no markup issues beyond an xml namespace for Wiki, and so on. -- <a href="SteveWainstead.html">SteveWainstead</a>
