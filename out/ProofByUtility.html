        Proof By Utility
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ProofByUtility.html">ProofByUtility</a> is another way of saying <a href="ItWorks.html">ItWorks</a>! (At least most of the time). The proof is that It is used, by many who find it useful. See <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> and <a href="LinuxOperatingSystem.html">LinuxOperatingSystem</a>. The proof is not that it is correct, precise, foolproof or bugproof, but that it is useful.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ProofByUtility.html">ProofByUtility</a> is a classic non-proof, wherein someone says "Look, there are <strong><em>so</em></strong> many useful consequences of this that it simply <strong><em>must</em></strong> be true."
      </p>
      <p>
        Otherwise known as wishful thinking.

        <em>This implies that it has been tried. The name </em><a href="ProofByUtility.html">ProofByUtility</a> does not really fit with the connotation of <a href="WishfulThinking.html">WishfulThinking</a>. How about ProofByAssumedUtility?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not really. If it were true, it would be really useful (so it's not that the utility is being assumed - the utility is evident, it's the truth that's being assumed). AssumedTruthFromUtility would be more accurate, but takes the humor out of it - it's supposed to resemble real proof methods like <a href="ProofByInduction.html">ProofByInduction</a>. It's one of a set of fake "proof" methods (see the entire page at <a href="http://www.bluemoon.net/~watson/proof.htm)">http://www.bluemoon.net/~watson/proof.htm)</a>

        <em>I see that it fits the format of the page you mentioned, but I was expecting it to fit the more formal format used on the </em><a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a> page. Actually, the point I'm trying to raise is simply whether or not the utility has actually been measured, or is just a guess. If it has actually been measured, then yes, you have proved that it is correct because you have shown that it is actually useful. (This is assuming a <a href="PhilosophyOfPragmatism.html">PhilosophyOfPragmatism</a>.) If it has not been measured, then it most definitely is wishful thinking and one of the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s. However, the name '<a href="ProofByUtility.html">ProofByUtility</a>' doesn't fit well with the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a> page because it doesn't highlight the question of whether the utility has actually been measured.<em></em>

        I hadn't read that page (and hadn't expected this page to be taken so seriously)

        There seem to be 2 different fallacies here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           wishful thinking: Although no one has ever tried X, X must be true because it would be so very useful. ("This new subroutine I just finished typing in will fix your problem.")
        </li>
        <li>
           argument by popularity: Many people tried X and found it to work. Therefore X must be the best way of doing it. ("Visual Basic is superior to Lisp."; "<a href="PersonalDigitalAssistant.html">PersonalDigitalAssistant</a> is superior to <a href="PersonalAnalogDevice.html">PersonalAnalogDevice</a>.")
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It seems to me that the argument presented introduces another proof: "ProofByMeasurement?". The implication is that it can only be proven by measurement. This is fine for such things as a "Too tall" proof (where a book is to be placed on a proper bookshelf [one tall enough] But not all things to be proven can be objectively measured, or they have interoperative dependencies (depending on more than one thing, because they are a part of a system). Example: prove that my thermostat "works".
