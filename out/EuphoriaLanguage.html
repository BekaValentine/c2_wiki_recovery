        This is a very simple to use but powerful language that operates on data structures that are either atoms or sequences. Although it is interpreted, scripts run with lightning speed, comparable with compiled languages and many times faster than Java. It has the ability to run under DOS, WIN32, *nix (Linux, FreeBSD, etc.). A particularly useful feature is the ability to bind a script with the interpreter (<a href="http://www.rapideuphoria.com/bind.htm)">http://www.rapideuphoria.com/bind.htm)</a> and other resources to make a stand alone executable. The language has an active user group (discussion forum: <a href="http://openeuphoria.org/forum/)">http://openeuphoria.org/forum/)</a> and many tools and libraries (recent user contributions: <a href="http://www.rapideuphoria.com/contrib.htm">http://www.rapideuphoria.com/contrib.htm</a> ; the searchable archive of code: <a href="http://www.rapideuphoria.com/archive.htm)">http://www.rapideuphoria.com/archive.htm)</a> are available.
