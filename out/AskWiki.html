        The author factored the following contribution out of <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a>, because it could be a new interesting SeedPage:

        There are several services on the Web, like AskYahoo. After my experience, they work very well. Why not <a href="AskWiki.html">AskWiki</a>? This could be a candidate for a set of user-defined <a href="TwinPages.html">TwinPages</a>. As each Wiki community accumulates dedicated expertise, this could be a helpful addon. A page, tagged with <a href="AskWiki.html">AskWiki</a> (with many <a href="TwinPages.html">TwinPages</a> to related peer wikis) could accumulate a list of more or less open questions. By the way, I have not yet searched to see if the domains <a href="AskWiki.html">AskWiki</a>.com, <a href="AskWiki.html">AskWiki</a>.net, ... are registered. If not, take this idea and use it to become a millionaire like the man who sold the domain "wiki.com" for 3 million dollars. I gave the link for this info in (sorry, was just interrupted by my friend, who registered <a href="AskWiki.html">AskWiki</a>.net some seconds later for me, after the idea was posted here) the <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>.
        You may do the same thing with <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a> and join the first <a href="DomainsWiki.html">DomainsWiki</a> as a wiki-entrepreneur.

      <p>
        So my answer for deciding on a new <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           ask yourself if it is worth being registered as a domain-name, 
        </li>
        <li>
           do it in a wiki community with peer entrepreneurs,
        </li>
        <li>
           discuss openly the value of bringing in your own alternative(domain)s
        </li>
        <li>
           feel the joy of being released, to spill out all your best ideas (they will increase the value or your domain and the alternative domains of your peers).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Another approach is to use <a href="AskWiki.html">AskWiki</a> as a tag in a <a href="TagWiki.html">TagWiki</a>, whenever there is an open question. As long as nobody has realized a <a href="TagWiki.html">TagWiki</a>, we have to use an annotation via <a href="DiiGo.html">DiiGo</a> or <a href="TrailFire.html">TrailFire</a>, manually setting the tag "<a href="AskWiki.html">AskWiki</a>".
