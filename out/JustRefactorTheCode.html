        Just Refactor The Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        Simple code has almost always good performance. If the code is simple enough, fixing all the performance problems with just one tweak should be easy.

        <em>I suggest the title be changed to </em>RefactoringForSpeed. Personally, I think some people obsess over speed.<em></em>

        Sometimes this is true, sometimes not.

        I've seen code where this was true - adding a CachingVariable to keep the results of an expensive function call.

        I've also seen code where it wasn't - the simple code was making naiive assumptions that were only justifiable in the small case. Getting there from here with <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> just wasn't possible, it needed a rewrite of the core object, plus updating every client call.
