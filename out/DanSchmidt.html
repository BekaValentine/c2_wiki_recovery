        I'm currently writing real-time music entertainment software at Harmonix Music Systems (<a href="http://www.harmonixmusic.com)">http://www.harmonixmusic.com)</a> in Cambridge MA, concentrating specifically on automated composition.  My background before that was writing 3D computer games.

        I'm still searching for the Holy Grail of programming.  Some things that I have decided are the Right Thing: Emacs (<a href="EmacsRules.html">EmacsRules</a>!), <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <a href="ProgrammersNotebook.html">ProgrammersNotebook</a>.  <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> feels right in many ways (and I have written a few tools for it), but the practice doesn't live up to the theory.  I'm excited about a lot of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> ideas, which I have just encountered here.

        <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> is pretty neat, but it seems so wedded to its environment that it's difficult to use it for a new project.  Many of the things I like about it are present in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>.

        At Harmonix we have been dipping our toes into some XP, mostly through regular <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, which I like very much.
