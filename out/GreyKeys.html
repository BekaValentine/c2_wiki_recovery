        Grey Keys
      </h1>
      <p>
        The keys on the keyboard that do things other than type. Called so because they're often in a darker grey than the letter-number ones.

        On the AmstradCPC the "<a href="GreyKeys.html">GreyKeys</a>" were, on the 464, bright green, bright blue for the "enter" keys, and bright red for "escape" with the main keyboard black, giving it a rather Duplo look. --<a href="KatieLucas.html">KatieLucas</a>

        The function keys on my old <a href="AtariSt.html">AtariSt</a> were once the same color as the case, but now after some years of decay and sun burn, they became <a href="GreyKeys.html">GreyKeys</a> of another (somewhat darker) color than the case. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a>
