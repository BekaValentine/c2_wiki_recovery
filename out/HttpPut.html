        Web pages are normally fetched by a browser using what's called an "HTTP GET" request: it looks like this.
      </p>
      <code>
        GET /cgi/wiki?<a href="HttpPut.html">HttpPut</a> HTTP/1.0<br/>
        User-agent: mozilla/4.0<br/>
        Host: www.c2.com<br/>
        ... <em>more headers here</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Forms are submitted by an HTTP POST, which sends data back to the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the less commonly used commands is HTTP PUT, which sends a page back to the server to replace the existing page. The command normally requires some kind of authentication.
      </p>

      <p>
        So...  "HTTP PUT" is a "copy this file to the server" function, overwriting any existing file.
        Thus, the web server acts more like a file server than a web server (generally speaking).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Right?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's right - but the web server can handle the incoming information however it likes, it need not just write it into a file. Typically it will do access control but it might also for example insert it into a <a href="VersionControl.html">VersionControl</a> system.
