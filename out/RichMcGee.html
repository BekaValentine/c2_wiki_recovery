      </p>
      <p>
        My duties at Cal State include being responsible for both the TRACS and the Web-based registration systems, as well as server support for a wide variety of application systems.

      <p>
        I have a B.A. degree from CSUSB in English Literature, everything except the thesis for an MA in Composition Rhetoric and Theory, certificates in programming, creative writing, journalism and poetry, plus I completed all the requirements for a degree in CS, except for that yucky math part.
