        Note Cards

        <a href="NoteCards.html">NoteCards</a> was done at <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a> in the 1980s. It featured typed objects and links. Each piece of hypertext (a "card") was placed in a separate window on the screen. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NoteCards.html">NoteCards</a> inspired Fuji Xerox to create ViewCards for the Viewpoint office automation system. Similar to some uses of <a href="NoteCards.html">NoteCards</a>, the model was that you were using a box of index cards and linking them together to organize the outline of an article, thesis, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another system was "MailCards" which was a hypertext mail system.
