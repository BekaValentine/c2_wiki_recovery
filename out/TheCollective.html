        The Collective
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TheCollective.html">TheCollective</a> is the set of agents that cooperate either consciously or unconsciously to form a <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>. The scientific community is a good example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trekkies also know this as the happy bunch known as <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a>. However, <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a> is some cross between a <a href="HiveMind.html">HiveMind</a> and a <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>. They are more like a <a href="DistributedMind.html">DistributedMind</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to Star Trek or other reasons, the term "<a href="TheCollective.html">TheCollective</a>" sounds ominous and foreboding. Maybe it should, who knows, but collectives form naturally in many places.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some criteria for a collective are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Must be formed from autonomous, individual agents;
        </li>
        <li>
           Must be self-organizing;
        </li>
        <li>
           The agents must interact in some way;
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A myth is that the agents must be willing to cooperate, but random interactions may cause self-organizing behaviour. See <a href="InsectBehaviour.html">InsectBehaviour</a> for a discussion of this.
      </p>
      <p>
        A community or society is usually a collective.

        In the <a href="GoaTrance.html">GoaTrance</a> subculture, a group that meets to listen to <a href="GoaTrance.html">GoaTrance</a> and MindExpand together is called a <em>collective</em>. -- <a href="SamLey.html">SamLey</a>
