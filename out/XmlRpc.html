           XML-RPC is somewhat older and more limited than SOAP. Especially the support of datatypes in the XML payloads is stronger in SOAP.

        Also it was claimed SOAP 1.2 is much worse than SOAP 1.1 due to the TooManyCooksPattern. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a cook on SOAP/1.1 and barely on 1.2, I can say with some authority that SOAP/1.2 has way fewer errors and ambiguities than 1.1. Moreover, SOAP/1.2 took several of the "dumber" features we put into SOAP/1.1 and annexed them out and/or radically simplified them. --<a href="DonBox.html">DonBox</a>

        Yeah, I think XML-RPC is cool.  Simpler than SOAP but unfortunately not as popular.  I am building a distributed software framework where I plan on selling an "XML Integration" product that includes both SOAP and XML-RPC adapters.  In essence, each node runs a lightweight web server that uses a thread pool to serve requests.  Multiple forms of internode communication can occur simultaneously.  XML-RPC and SOAP are nifty ways to do that.  I'm hip on (and agree with) all the points made above.  --<a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a>

        XML-RPC is cool when you control both sides of the wire and want to do rpc simply and easily. It doesn't support x-language runtime 'discovery' of interfaces and so doesn't have the complex typing baggage required to provide this (compare to soap/xmlschema/wsdl/uddi). - <a href="PhilDawes.html">PhilDawes</a>

        I like XML-RPC for teaching the basics of distributed computing. The easy learning curve allows a quick creation of simple applications. - Marc Conrad (see the perisic link in the link list)
