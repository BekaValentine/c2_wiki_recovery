        Wiki Anti Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        Wiki is a software system and like any such system it contains <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s. Here are some examples of anti-patterns. Note they're not in the traditional form yet as I hope to flesh them out in future.

        Pages that amount to: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "I have this great idea but I need someone to implement if for me"  (In the business world, this is called <a href="ArchitectsDontCode.html">ArchitectsDontCode</a>, <a href="ArchitectsPlayGolf.html">ArchitectsPlayGolf</a>, or <a href="ArmchairArchitect.html">ArmchairArchitect</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           "All existing implementations of Z are crap. I am a genius and will thus implement, in my <a href="CopiousFreeTime.html">CopiousFreeTime</a>, an alternative that solves all problems in the field of Z"
        </li>
        <li>
           "I have this great new idea. All those who don't uncritically accept it are evil."
        </li>
        <li>
           "Programming language A is horrible." or "Programming language A is better than programming language B" (or any other traditional programmer <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> topic)
        </li>
        <li>
           "Managers are stupid, lazy, and evil."
        </li>
        <li>
           "Wiki is great, if only it didn't let people edit everything/had moderators/wasn't about programming/was more like usenet/was more like a blog/had HardSecurity/was more like <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a>/etc"
        </li>
        <li>
           "I don't know much about programming, but I think that the wiki should be categorized/organized this way."
        </li>
        <li>
           Ongoing and never-ending conversation (and arguments) between members of a small group of active Wiki participants, free-ranging over a huge universe of topics, and leaving big piles of <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>.
