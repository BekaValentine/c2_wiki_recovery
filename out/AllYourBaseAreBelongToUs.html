        ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US!
      </p>
      <p>
        "All your base are belong to us" is a quote from the intro to an early-90's arcade game called Zero Wing. (The link above is an animation of the intro) In December 2000, it became fashionable to post retouched images featuring this, and other quotes, similar to the "Mr T vs <foo>" craze of 1999. Now (February 2001), the phenomenon is just reaching critical mass - I first heard of it three days ago, and since then I have encountered it from four totally unrelated sources (an online journal, on <a href="InternetRelayChat.html">InternetRelayChat</a>, a <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> posting, and now on wiki).

        This meme is particularly potent, and I think it owes to the video. Were it not for the video, it would be forgotten already.
      </p>
      <p>
        The video does this for the meme:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Many of us have heard of it before, and seen the screenshots. Maybe our original reaction was "uh, yeah, it's Engrish, whatever." But this time around, all we remember is that we've seen it before, it's familiar, it's friendly, and we're eager to see what's been done with it.
        </li>
        <li>
           It starts by playing the game introduction as it might appear on a real Sega Genesis, were the Genesis version slightly different (and with voice). This makes it real, and watching the script play out makes us feel almost as if we ourselves had discovered the catch phrase.
        </li>
        <li>
           Catchy tune lifted from the original game. Lots of repetition, but mixed with just enough variety that it doesn't get completely tiresome.
        </li>
        <li>
           We are bombarded with photographs, and each one links the meme with another familiar, innocent meme. Cigarette cartons, fortune cookies, road signs, and political figures are among the memes that are suddenly inextricably linked with the catch phrase. Suddenly, anything we think of is less than two degrees of separation from the video.
        </li>
        <li>
           Gaming geeks naturally become excited about something that hits so many of their ain't-it-cool nerves, and emotional excitement enhances the way one remembers events.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        Zero Wing is a Sega Genesis conversion from the original Japanese Coin Op and is quoted as "the worst translated game in history". More details at <a href="http://simmoril.nuintari.net/articles/aybabtu.shtml.">http://simmoril.nuintari.net/articles/aybabtu.shtml.</a> A fine example of letting the tea boy take care of localization.

        The phenomenon of <a href="AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs.html">AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs</a> has taken particular hold among the online <a href="FirstPersonShooter.html">FirstPersonShooter</a> gaming community where "yU0 = f4g0t" passes for some damn witty dialogue.

        I think part of the appeal of the meme is that you have seen many of the images before - the originals have been emailed around because they were amusing in their own right. So seeing them again triggers your memory, but leaves the possibility that something you are already familiar with had a hidden meaning you missed the first time.

        People I know used to use this phrase in conversation in the Math faculty of U.Waterloo around 1998, 1999. Not only is it funny, it will stand forever as an example of how one weakness in the chain of your software development process can adversely affect the usability of the software. Occasionally, after encountering something particularly dysfunctional in the processes we deal with at work, someone drops this phrase.

        The interesting thing about it, to me, is that because of it, Zero Wing has gained a sort of pop culture immortality among gamers.  *chuckles*  If Zero wing had lived on its own quality as a game, everyone would have forgotten about it a long long time ago. It seems ironic, that a failure of sorts can lead to such a success.
