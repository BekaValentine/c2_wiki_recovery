        Pattern Language In Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ever write a script to graph the length of class names in your <a href="CodeBase.html">CodeBase</a>?  With the widespread adoption of patterns, I have seen the numbers skyrocket.  In my own code, the range is [3, 16], mode 8.
        Since patterns, collegues' code base: range [3, 71], mode 14. Rubbish!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Are long names tiring your fingers?  Two solutions:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Eat more carbohydrates.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Get an IDE with auto-complete</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Long names are a good thing, enabled by bigger screens, better editors and higher calorie intake.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [It takes me 10 extra seconds to write a long name (including wondering if the length is pointing to a problem with the code), it can take me hours to figure out what the dev of 3 years ago meant by CMNGVerMn]
