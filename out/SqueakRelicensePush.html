        Squeak Relicense Push

           May 2007 - I notice that the SqueakFoundation is starting a final push to make all of <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> available under OSI-compliant (ie. <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>) terms. <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> is on board, so it remains to get the other contributors down through the years to put their code under the <a href="MitLicense.html">MitLicense</a>:

        As of 1 May it seems that there were still 121 sets of initials in the Squeak codebase whose associated contributions had yet to be signed over. That included a good few sets of initials which had not been (firmly?) identified with an author:

      <p>
        <a href="http://www.netjam.org/squeak/contributors/missingSignatories">http://www.netjam.org/squeak/contributors/missingSignatories</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        So ... 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           if you are or might be a signatory who hasn't been contacted yet, or
        </li>
        <li>
           if you might be able to get in touch with such a signatory, or
        </li>
        <li>
           if you might have a chance of identifying one or more of the mystery signatures,
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        why not take a quick look at the list and then take it from there if necessary?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hey! I spot one:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        ward             <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>The alternative in cases like this is to presume they will not assign copyright, and rewrite their contributions. It is likely that half the folks on the missing list have only contributed a fix or two.</em>
