        Code Completion
      </h1>
      <p>
        When using an editor, a drop down box pops down and let's you know what sub-functions, properties, methods, etc. are available in the scope of the procedure or function you are typing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although this might seem like a lazyman's way to program, the facts are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           it takes less load off your brain and allows you to get on with coding and learn as you go, instead of knowing everything first
        </li>
        <li>
           the human brain is simply not capable of knowing all and everything about a function or procedure.
        </li>
        <li>
          it's faster to use codeCompletion than it is to look up help files. Besides, you could look up help on the function after you've found it in the code completion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It's not really that useful for making the typing go faster, it's more useful as a real time reference. Generally, it is wise to type out your functions at 100WPM versus scrolling through a code completion dropBox. It's just a reference: don't abuse to trying to save time typing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Drop-down boxes are not the only form of code completion.  In <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a>, for example, M-/ provides word completion and skeleton mode can provide boiler-plate expansions.
