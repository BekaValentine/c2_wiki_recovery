        Similar: Anthropologists note that a primitive culture used the three numbers: one, two, many

        Should <a href="FourBlankCards.html">FourBlankCards</a> be limited to ThreeBlankCards, One - for what we know, Two - for what we need, Three - for the simplest.

        Fwiw, many "primitive cultures" use such a system.  For example, in some Australian aboriginal peoples, larger numbers (if needed) are stated simply as, eg. two and two and one.

        Hmmm - so the Aussie Aboriginals were into binary arithmetic first?

        A similar concept is the 'grillion'. It means 'more than 12' and is used as an indication of a wild level of excess. eg.
        How many pints did he drink, how many cars does he have, jobs he's been sacked from etc
