        What You Think Is What You Get

        What we look for is often what we find.

        The mind is a strong determining factor in producing results
      </p>
      <p>
        Plenty of research shows this to be the case. The mind is not a general
        computing mechanism. It works via attention. If we prime the mind,
        say looking for red things, we will be much more efficient at finding
        red things.

        <em>Anecdotally I can attest that the mind has the power to influence outcomes.  Essentially, you don't get what you </em>'want<strong> but rather what you </strong>expect<strong>.  The "</strong>MindOverMatter" paradigm is institutionally trite, but careful observation leads to the conclusion that it can't be discounted.<em></em>
