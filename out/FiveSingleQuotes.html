        Enclosing text in <a href="TwoSingleQuotes.html">TwoSingleQuotes</a> emphasizes it by putting <em></em> tags around it in the document delivered to and displayed by the browser. <a href="ThreeSingleQuotes.html">ThreeSingleQuotes</a> result in <strong></strong> tags. As a consequence, <a href="FiveSingleQuotes.html">FiveSingleQuotes</a> should produce text that is rendered both emphasized and strong.

        As you can see, this isn't proper HTML; the tags are nested incorrectly. However, the code works fine under almost every browser -- in fact, no one has yet cited a specific  browser/platform combination that fails to properly render this. As a consequence, there is no reason to avoid using <a href="FiveSingleQuotes.html">FiveSingleQuotes</a>, but it would be nice if this bug could be fixed, as generating proper HTML is GoodPractice and a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>, whereas trying how far the browsers' error recovery routines can be pushed and encouraging sloppy markup arguably are <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>s.
