        <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> is hardly the pinnacle of <a href="ProceduralLanguages.html">ProceduralLanguages</a> or tools in general. As a <a href="HardLanguage.html">HardLanguage</a>, it is designed for *hardware* performance and providing predictable <a href="RunTime.html">RunTime</a> resource constraints, NOT <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> convenience. It is the "new assembler", with some of the same headaches that <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a> had.

        It's like comparing a Honda Civic to a Toyota RAV for off-road use. That the RAV beat the Civic for off-roading is not surprising.

        If you wrote your <a href="PayrollExample.html">PayrollExample</a> in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> without using the features of the <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a> much, even I would prefer your <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> or <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> version over it.

        The lesson is that if you want software-engineering-friendly tools, then you have to get software-engineering-friendly tools.

        You seem to be focusing too much on YOUR past when you do mental comparing. It's interesting to note that I grew up on <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> (dBASE clones). Although the language was a bit clunky, it taught me the power of and productivity of <a href="DynamicLanguage.html">DynamicLanguage</a>s combined with nimble-and-ready <a href="DataBase.html">DataBase</a> engines. I ran circles around the <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>, <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, and <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> guys.

        <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> was 2 steps backward, with its stiff, hardwired taxonomies and difficult-to-navigate-sift-and-study navigational <a href="ObjectPointer.html">ObjectPointer</a> pasta. Shifting most of the <a href="BusinessLogic.html">BusinessLogic</a> to tables just plain made it easier to manage. Code was more or less a low-IQ foot soldier that simply carried out the features requested by the tables. The tables were the dinner menus and order slips, and the program code was the back-room cooks. Nimble tables are addicting and now I had to suffer withdrawal symptoms as the fad pendulum [<a href="TechnologicalPendulum.html">TechnologicalPendulum</a>] shifted back to ugly, tangled, static, code-centric paradigms. (I know, <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> are more dynamic, but they are still essentially navigational in structure. <a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a> was smart to "fix" navigational. He is the genius, not me. I merely stumbled into his genius.)

        I hear that <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> fans suffer similar withdrawal symptoms when forced to use more restricting languages. Once you've been with Tabitha, Ol' Bertha just doesn't cut it.
