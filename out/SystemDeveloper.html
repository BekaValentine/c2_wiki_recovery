        System Developer

      <p>
        There is a trend among system developers to call themselves <a href="SystemArchitect.html">SystemArchitect</a>. In many cases this is a misuse of words and is done only to be able to charge more. Architecture is a team activity and a team responsibility. SystemArchitecture is not the invention and responsibility of one single guru.

        A methodology like <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> which I'm very fond of focuses more on the job to be done that the hierarcy in the project organisation. I've never used the <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a>, but from what I understand it's very focused on roles and artifacts that persons in different roles should produce. --<a href="AndersMalmros.html">AndersMalmros</a>
