        I am a 32 year old programmer from Cape Town, South Africa. My area of focus has been on Mozilla XUL.

        Why I hear you ask..
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MozillaXul.html">MozillaXul</a> gives you the best of both worlds. It provides an application development platform very similar to HTML, but with a consistent widget set across platforms, no issues with text or style rendering, a rich feature set, cross platform capabilities without any changes to one's code, and a wealth of real application widgets to boot. My only problem is that, like my transition to XML/XSLT, Mozilla XUL is a little hard to wrap your brain around. From my preliminary experiments however, it seems well worth the effort.

        I enjoy travelling abroad, especially India and Europe. If you are interested in staying here you can check out - just look at some of the pics to see what I mean. We are so lucky to live in one of the most beautiful cities in the world.

        Hmm, oh yeah also am a big fly fishing fan, and sometimes go up the east coast on weekends. My record isn't very good only a 32cm but I guess its the effort that counts :)
