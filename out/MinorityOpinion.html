        Minority Opinion
      </h1>
      <p>
        Isn't it interesting how some opinions are minority opinions in printed literature, but have a lot of mind-share on the 'net? Examples may be low-carbing (see LowCarb), High-Intensity weight training (see <a href="ExerciseGurus.html">ExerciseGurus</a>), <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, etc
      </p>
      <p>
        Is this just my perception? Is it the effect of some SelectionBias? Or is the net just moving faster than the rest of the world?

        Could it be that speed is only one of the attributes the net brings to dialogues. Due to the wide exposure possible and the likelyhood that sympathetic or oppositional voices will chime in on almost every topic, the direction and intensity of discourse can journey where the angels of print and the gurus of peer review fear to tred. --<a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
