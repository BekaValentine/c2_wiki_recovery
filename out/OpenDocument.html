        </li>
        <li>
           As an open standard under the stewardship of OASIS, <a href="OpenDocument.html">OpenDocument</a> also creates the possibility for new types of applications and solutions to be developed other than traditional office productivity applications.

           Layout is controlled by a variety of attributes. These include page size, number format, paper tray, print orientation, margins, border (and its line width), padding, shadow, background, columns, print page order, first page number, scale, table centering, maximum footnote height and separator, and many layout grid properties."
        </li>
        <li>

        Conclusions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the past
          <ul>
            <li>
               the main interface for working with information in documents was the software application (an office suite or a text editor of some kind
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           In the Future 
          <ul>
            <li>
               the main interface will be the document itself, no matter what application you use. The <a href="OpenDocument.html">OpenDocument</a> Format will move the world from an application-centric model of computing into a document-centric model of computing. This will mean the creation of new business processes will be as easy as typing a memo on a PC or working with a small connected device. <a href="OpenDocument.html">OpenDocument</a> Format will make access to document data easier. It will give hope to organizations that longer document life cycles and smoother business processes will emerge.
