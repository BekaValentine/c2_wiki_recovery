        <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> is an IBM brand name for products that implement and extend Sun's <a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> (J2EE) platform. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the information below predates the 2005 V6 release of <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> (the <a href="EnterpriseServiceBus.html">EnterpriseServiceBus</a> ready version) and await cleaning up.

        The two main products are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="WebsphereApplicationServer.html">WebsphereApplicationServer</a> - a J2EE container

        <li>
           <a href="WebSphereStudioApplicationDeveloper.html">WebSphereStudioApplicationDeveloper</a> - a J2EE development IDE built on the Eclipse platform (see <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        People often speak of "<a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a>" as a product. When they do, they usually mean the application server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another well known product is <a href="WebSphereMq.html">WebSphereMq</a>, formerly <a href="MqSeries.html">MqSeries</a>, a messaging system product. Other products include the <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Edge Server (consisting of a Caching Web server, an HTTP load-balancer (called an HTTP "Sprayer") and the Andrew File System), <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Commerce Suite, <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Personalization Server, <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Business Integrator, and <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> Site Analyzer.

      <p>
        <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> used to be associated with the <a href="IbmSmalltalk.html">IbmSmalltalk</a> product, but it would appear that <a href="IbmSmalltalk.html">IbmSmalltalk</a> is dead or dying (it's been impossible, in practice, to purchase the product for years). Ibm seems to believe that rearranging the names of their suites (apparently this falls under the rubric of "brand management") will help improve business. I've simply given up on them.

        Websphere Commerce Suite
      </p>

        A commercial application to manage stores. This was deleted earlier, for whatever reason, probably because it was considered spam. But before you condemn the mentioning of commercial products, consider downloading the PDF, and take a look at Chapter 4 where some helpful information about the programming model used, which is in this case the MVC (<a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a>). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks.nsf/0/eaad4e49c615f8e0852569bb00530a00?OpenDocument">http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/redbooks.nsf/0/eaad4e49c615f8e0852569bb00530a00?OpenDocument</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many Commercial Products from which an individual might learn things which programming types consider uninteresting or elementary. Those who WouldLikeToKnow can be helped by documents such as the Handbook referenced in the link above. 
      </p>
      <p>
        One might also look at chapter 3 which is about RuntimeArchitecture, to learn something of what it takes to install, support and maintain such an application.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I don't know what's been going on with this page, but I think you're misinterpreting things. Pages about commercial products are not inherently <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>, not at all. But the question is whether a page presents info about a product so as to be of reasonably general interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        If [the readers of the page] need to investigate to get any idea at all, then the page has failed, and such a page could indeed be claimed to be nothing better than commercial spam. (Further, that makes for extremely poor marketing, too!)
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, a page about a commercial product that let the reader know in which ways the product is interesting could make it quite <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>. It seems to me that something being an example of MVC is insufficient; that's like saying it was written in C++/Java -- the same is true of a hundred thousand other things, so that's more just a side point of interest if the product itself has already been pointed out to be of interest for a more central reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        I know very little about <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> stuff, but from the little I've heard, I would think it would be easy enough to describe things that make it interesting. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        <em>Websphere is the worst J2EE app server I've ever worked with.  It's bloated, sluggish and unfriendly.  It fails in mysterious ways for mysterious reasons and produces mysterious error codes instead of useful exception messages.  I recently looked up one of these mysterious error codes at IBM's web site and all it told me was to "see exception for more details".  I suspect that Websphere is primarily a marketing tool for IBM's technical services department.  Anyone who has to use it eventually sells their IT department to IBM.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You misunderstood the error code note; they mean, see "Ronald Exception", he's head of QA. :-)

        <strong>Not Pro MS or pro </strong><a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> - but pro Business, the company that pay my salary<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not know <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> and I do not even know <a href="JavaPlatform.html">JavaPlatform</a>, but I know a bit more about <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> track record (in the past), and had work relationships with real working level technical people there.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> had a reputation of taking care of customers, especially in the area of migration. Whereas their main opposition out to change things so you have to move up, most of the time (in the past) shops that did not want to change could run their assembler code routinees in newer OSs for decades.
      </p>
      <p>
        In regards to <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a>, from my readings it is the number 1 of the big three J2EE supplier. In the beginning <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> (like Visual Age before it) was a brand name of a mix of products, but the problems you still have with <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> should be lesser than other J2EE alternatives. Now if you need interoperability (up with <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> and down with MS) and want to go semi-standard you do not have other options. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to use <a href="JavaPlatform.html">JavaPlatform</a> but don't need to use J2EE it becomes an entirely different story. I would be interested in EH views on what technical infrastructure he would build from scratch, if he have multiple sites in different countries and timezones that need to work together.
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If I had to build a technical infrastructure from scratch that had multiple sites in different countries and timezones I'd build a technical infrastructure that expressed all times in GMT.  I'm not sure how those requirements relate to Websphere or J2EE, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        I probably shouldn't share my views on <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> and Websphere, but what the hell.  I've started to suspect that Websphere is purposefully cryptic because it helps IBM sell support/service contracts.  All equivalent J2EE products suffer from the overly complex yet incomplete state of the J2EE spec.  Websphere has the worst documentation and greatest additional complexity of all of them I've used (Weblogic, Oracle, Orion and JBoss).
