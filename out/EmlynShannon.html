        Emlyn was indeed a good friend, and a soul probably not designed for our time. He will be sorely missed by those who took the time to understand this often misunderstood creature. -

        In the (atypical) event that I sign a paragraph as -- <a href="EmlynShannon.html">EmlynShannon</a>, this should be considered as shorthand for "-- <a href="OpenAuthor.html">OpenAuthor</a>, <a href="EmlynShannon.html">EmlynShannon</a>". Most of my contributions are unsigned, but I may write my name to distinguish between one voice and another in an ongoing discussion.
