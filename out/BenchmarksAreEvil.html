        Benchmarks Are Evil

      <p>
        Are they?

        <em>No.</em>

        Comparing performance can be useful, but not if it's a goal in and of itself. I benchmark my programs against earlier versions of themselves, to see if changes to algorithms help improve overall performance. I don't worry about benchmarking my code in comparison to other code, unless my goal is to write a program that does a given function more quickly than an existing solution.

        What's the alternative? I've put together some hand-rolled benchmarks before using scripts, macros, and duct-tape to run "typical" apps. They may not be thorough tests, but they are tests that the vendor couldn't pre-fudge for.

        <em>Except the author didn't actually </em>'benchmark<em>' the results of partial stroking before making said summarized conclusion. According to one response to the article, the cost of a seek is dominated by the cost to start, stop, and settle the head; however, the author assumed it was dominated by traversal (i.e. that seeking 1/4 the distance results in 1/4 the seek time). According to the respondent, the benefits of partial stroking in his experience amounts to 15%-20%.</em>
