        Alittle Mock Goes Along Way
      </h1>
      <p>
        I believe that one of the most powerful features of <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s is that you can reuse them over and over again. When hand coding <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s (as opposed to using tools like <a href="EasyMock.html">EasyMock</a>, which I haven't looked into yet), there is usually a fairly big upfront cost involved to set up the code so that it works properly with <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s. This usually ends up being very much worth it since the <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> turns a previously untestable class into a testable one. Any other classes that may depend on a <a href="RealObject.html">RealObject</a> can now use the <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>, and they too become testable. Extending a <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> is usually pretty easy, so you get even more reuse there.

        I think this is especially true for <a href="MockingLegacyCode.html">MockingLegacyCode</a>. Does anyone else <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>?

        <em>Yes. When working with a new library, the first few tests can be quite expensive to write. After a while, however, things settle down. I've found that I haven't had to change mock libraries for months after laying down the basics. -- </em><a href="SteveFreeman.html">SteveFreeman</a><em></em>
