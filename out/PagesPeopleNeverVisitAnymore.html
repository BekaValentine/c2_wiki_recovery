        This page is reserved for some smart algorithm that describes the most forgotten pages in <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a>. <em>(Something along the lines of </em><a href="LeastRecentChanges.html">LeastRecentChanges</a>?)<em></em>

        <em>I successfully mentioned </em><a href="ZenWindow.html">ZenWindow</a> for about six months before it was touched and thus not "forgotten" any more. I was pretty amazed it took that long, but it's a perfect page. I could list all the pages not edited since 1995, but I'm not going to. There are <em>only</em> tens of thousands of pages; go discover them for yourself, but keep them to yourself. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a><em></em>

        Last edit April 25, 2002. I found it September 30, 2003. It must be a pretty nice algorithm. -- <a href="JoeWeaver.html">JoeWeaver</a>
