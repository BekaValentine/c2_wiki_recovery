        Xray Crystallography
      </h1>
      <p>
        A technique for finding the structures of molecules. It was pioneered with simple structures (~10 carbon atoms), but really took off when BioChemists applied it to proteins. The largest structure solved to date (in 1999) was the bluetongue virus - roughly a sphere 70 nm across, with 1008 separate protein molecules and 10 DNA strands.

        Protein structures determined using <a href="XrayCrystallography.html">XrayCrystallography</a> and NuclearMagneticResonance (a rival technique which is quicker and more biologically useful, but which only works for fairly small proteins) are deposited in the <a href="ProteinDataBank.html">ProteinDataBank</a>.
