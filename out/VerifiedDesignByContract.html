        Verified Design By Contract
      </h1>
      <p>
        Verified Design-by-Contract is <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a> with mathematical verification that all the contracts are always honored. In other words, instead of <a href="PreCondition.html">PreCondition</a>s and <a href="PostCondition.html">PostCondition</a>s being checked at <a href="RunTime.html">RunTime</a>, the program is analyzed and <a href="ProofOfCorrectness.html">ProofOfCorrectness</a> are developed to show that the pre-conditions hold whenever a method is called and the post-conditions always hold when a method returns. The proofs can be developed by hand (tedious, but often unavoidable) or by an <a href="AutomatedTheoremProving.html">AutomatedTheoremProving</a> system.  Additionally, ProofAssistant's make it possible to develop proofs manually while filling in the most tedious steps using automated methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proofs are also carried out in relation to preconditions of built-in operators. For example, in the expression A/B it is a precondition that B is not zero, and in the expression A[B] it is a precondition that B is within the bounds of A.

      <p>
        Using verified design-by-contract with standard <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>s is difficult because these languages are not designed for precise StaticAnalysis. Even <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a> (which has pre- and post-conditions as part of the language) allows NullValues by default, which is a problem (see <a href="NullConsideredHarmful.html">NullConsideredHarmful</a>). However, the ESC/Java tool goes a long way to supporting VDBC using annotated Java.

      <p>
        Verified design-by-contract is much more practical using a language designed for precise static analysis (such as PerfectDeveloper) or a subset of a standard programming language (such as SparkAda, or the C subset supported by Escher C Verifier). - <a href="DavidCrocker.html">DavidCrocker</a>
