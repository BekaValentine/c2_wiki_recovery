        Types Are Redundant
      </h1>
      <p>
        The basic idea of <a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a> is that safety can be obtained via redundancy.  It is: <em>"I'll tell ya' what I'm gonna' tell ya', then I'll tell ya' what I'm tellin' ya'."</em>  The basic two-phase approach to communication is a major basis for safety; for example, one can use it as one vector to shut down many forms of code-injection ("SQL updates table X; insert into X(a,b,c) values (1,2,3),(1,2,5),(2,5,3)").  To benefit from it safety-wise, the first half (<em>"I'll tell ya' what I'm gonna tell ya'"</em>) must not be a duplicate of the last half.  Usually, this means that the first half is <em>an abstraction</em> of the last half - something with details missing.  And that's basically what types are: a value-type, for example, is a general descriptor of a value, but with details (like exactly which value) missing.  The safety is achieved when the recipient of the message is able to look at what you said you were going to say, and what you actually said, and complain: hey! wait a minute! something is wrong!  
      </p>
      <p>
        Types can do more than just provide safety.  First, they can also provide context, which may (depending on the language) affect the parse.  This is enhanced further if there is some reflection on the types involved, allowing a degree of type-sensitive <a href="MetaProgramming.html">MetaProgramming</a> (where the meaning of an expression varies based upon the types involved).  C++ gurus in design of the Boost libraries and elsewhere have utilized this to great effect with templated code and templated expressions (<a href="TemplateMetaprogramming.html">TemplateMetaprogramming</a>).  This is mentioned in the discussion below as part of code-generation, but any form of <a href="TypefulProgramming.html">TypefulProgramming</a> takes advantage of types in this manner.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, type proofs (like any proof) provide basis for <em>safe</em> assumption, which is the foundation of all safe optimizations.  Every single type says something about what is true or what is not true of a value or expression.  A heavily typed language, at least for <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> or <a href="SoftTyping.html">SoftTyping</a>, has much greater <em>potential</em> for a great number of automated optimizations.  (Of course, one needs to design an optimizer to take advantage of this potential.)  People who largely use <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a> languages tend to scoff at the need for optimization, but they also tend to work on systems that don't involve graphics, audio, realtime, operating systems, device drivers, middleware, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a> systems (including <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a> systems), the analogy would be more akin to: <em>"I'll try 'n discern what you're tryin' ta' tell me, then I'll look'n'see if yer' actually tellin' me."</em>  I.e. one first infers the type-context, then does pretty much the safety check or contextual interpretation as above.  In this case the programmers don't experience the redundancy in any direct manner.  Generally, programmers of <a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a> systems still benefit from the ability to provide manifest types - both at the interfaces to their modules, and to better control the type-context as it is involved in the parse.
      </p>
      <p>
        For parsing, code-generation, and optimization-purposes, types are certainly <em>not</em> redundant.  And, as mentioned, the programmer isn't the entity experiencing the apparent redundancy for <a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a>.  So whether <a href="TypesAreRedundant.html">TypesAreRedundant</a> depends not only on how (and whether) you are declaring them, but also on why you are applying them.  And even where they are clearly redundant - which is in a small minority of cases, at least when <a href="TypefulProgramming.html">TypefulProgramming</a> is involved, they are likely to be providing just the benefit from redundancy that you're looking for: safety in numbers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, all that is subject to you choosing a typed language that supports <a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a> (at least a minimal version of it) and <a href="TypefulProgramming.html">TypefulProgramming</a>.  There are plenty of <a href="StaticallyTyped.html">StaticallyTyped</a> languages that make a nuisance of themselves, getting in your face about up-front manifest declarations of types before you can do anything (and for quick scripts with minimal up-front design, how would you know what types you want before you've done something? eh?).  And those... those languages deserve a good scoffing, at least if they are 'newer' make - from the post <a href="MlLanguage.html">MlLanguage</a>/<a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> era.  <a href="DynamicLanguage.html">DynamicLanguage</a> enthusiasts, and especially <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> enthusiasts, should demand, <strong>at minimum</strong> a simple <strong>auto</strong> type for variable specifications for capturing the return-value of an expressions and for inlined functions, if not full <a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a> (full <a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a> also allows, essentially, <strong>auto</strong> type for function parameters - essentially templates).  Even C++ looks to be gaining limited auto-typing in its next standard revision.

        <strong>Strict Type Checking:</strong> 
        <em>(at compile time)</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>C++</strong> is big on strict type checking at compile time. To make a polymorphic method call on instances of different classes, (1) the caller must use a pointer or reference to (2) a common base class among the instance's classes, which (3) declares the method/function "virtual." #2 means that classes supporting a given polymorphic method <strong>must</strong> all inherit from a common base class, which is (#1) used by their clients. The base class doesn't have to be a "mix in;" it can be an "interface class", which by convention is a class with no data members and nothing but pure virtual functions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>(See also C++ templates, under "Mixed / Code Generation" below.)</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Java</strong> does strict type checking. Each class can only <strong>inherit</strong> from one other class, but can implement as many interfaces as desired. Using interfaces for polymorphism instead of inheritance will often make things easier. If inheritance is needed, try using inner classes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Standard <strong>COM</strong> interfaces, being "just like C++," have strictly defined types on all parameters. <em>But then COM throws in VARIANTS which are dynamically typed for all intents and purposes.</em>

        <strong>Loose Type Checking:</strong>

      <p>
        Methods in the <strong></strong><a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a><strong> don't specify the types of their parameters, so there can be no "compile time type checks." Typically, errors of passing the wrong type of object are found at run time, when the offending object is unable to process method calls made to it.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: If you pass an "Employee" to a Payroll method that expects a "Check," the Employee instance will fail (with "#doesnotunderstand") when the Payroll method attempts a "setPaymentRecipient" method on it. 
      </p>
      <p>

      <p>
        That's the use of type-checking? When we call an objects method:
      </p>
      <code>
        void foo (TObj obj) {<br/>
        obj.bar();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        the type-checking claims to guarantee us at the compile-time two
        following things:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The call of bar() for obj will not fail at the run-time
        </li>
        <li>
           Calling of bar() for obj is not a nonsense and semantically adequate of programmers intention.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        I'll argue, that types are too redundant for these.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's start with the first sentence. Consider the following C++ code:
      </p>
      <code>
        class A {<br/>
        public:<br/>
        void bar(void);<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class B : public A {<br/>
        //<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class C {<br/>
        public:<br/>
        void bar(void);<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void foo (A *obj) {<br/>
        obj->bar();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        main () {<br/>
        A *a = new A;<br/>
        A *b = new B;<br/>
        C *c = new C;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        foo(a);	//OK<br/>
        foo(b);	//OK<br/>
        foo(c);	//O-ops<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Why does the compiler forbid using foo() with object of class C? It knows, how to call bar() for object, referenced by c, so there will be no technical problems this that at the run-time. And I don't want to inherit C from A or B. Of course, I can use multiple inheritance and conception of "mixes", but only to workaround this problem, because I end up with a bunch of mini-mix-classes, with one method per class. Thus the Right Way to solve this problem is to check by <strong>method names</strong>, not by <strong>types</strong>. For example CAML, while claiming to be strict type-checking language, allows write abovementioned code in the following way:
      </p>
      <code>
        class a =<br/>
        object<br/>
        method bar = 0<br/>
        end;;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class b =<br/>
        object<br/>
        inherit a<br/>
        end;;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class c =<br/>
        object<br/>
        method bar = 0<br/>
        end;;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        let foo obj = obj#bar;;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        let a_obj = new a;;<br/>
        let b_obj = new b;;<br/>
        let c_obj = new c;;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        foo(a_obj);;<br/>
        foo(b_obj);;<br/>
        foo(c_obj);;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But hey, where is the types here? Method foo hasn't any explicit type for its argument. Moreover, any class that implements method bar will fit for foo's argument. Is it <strong>type-checking</strong>? Well, of course it could be called special-case-type-checking. But from the viewpoint of application programmer it is none other than a <strong>method-checking</strong>. Types place too strict restrictions, and that's why I think they are redundant here. It is always sufficient to check by method signatures.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        So you'll love template functions then... 
      </p>
      <code>
        template <class T> <br/>
        void foo (T *obj) <br/>
        {<br/>
        obj->bar();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The above literally means "call bar in whatever type I pass in as the obj parameter".
      </p>
      <p>
        So:
      </p>
      <code>
        foo(a);	//OK<br/>
        foo(b);	//OK<br/>
        foo(c);	//OK as well!<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class d { void bar(int x); };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        foo(d);       // ooops... error message will tell you that d <br/>
        // has no bar method that accepts zero parameters.<br/>
      </code>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        And what about second sentence? Does type-checking help to preserve
        semantics of the method? No, it doesn't. At least in the modern,
        polymorphic world. An example:
      </p>
      <code>
        class A {<br/>
        protected:<br/>
        int i;<br/>
        public:<br/>
        virtual void bar (int a) {<br/>
        i += a;<br/>
        }<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class B : public A {<br/>
        public:<br/>
        virtual void bar (int a) {<br/>
        i -= a;		//Ha-ha-ha<br/>
        }<br/>
        };<br/>
        void foo (A *obj) {<br/>
        obj->bar(5);  //O-ops<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I know, I know, it is bad to change the semantics of a method in the derived classes. But languages permit it. Type-checking doesn't help. Thus preserving the same semantics of a method from class to class in real-world programs is just reasonable agreement of programmers, without any support from language and compiler. And of course such agreement can be done without inheritance and type-checking.
      </p>
      <p>
        And what about types? Do they unusable? I think, they greatly fit the niche of object factories, a la <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> classes. But in compile-time checking they are harmful and redundant. -- <a href="MaxFriedental.html">MaxFriedental</a>

      <p>
        What about this <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> example?
      </p>
      <code>
        class ClassWithBar:<br/>
        def hasBar(self):<br/>
        return 1<br/>
        def bar(self):<br/>
        pass<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class ClassWithoutBar:<br/>
        def hasBar(self):<br/>
        return 0<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        def factory():<br/>
        if makeClassWithBbar():<br/>
        return ClassWithBar()<br/>
        else:<br/>
        return ClassWithoutBar()<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        c = factory()<br/>
        if c.hasBar():<br/>
        c.bar()<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You and I know this code will work, and there are arguably legitimate uses for this kind of programming, but the hypothetical compiler is going to reject it, because it knows that factory() can return instances which don't have bar(). -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        What if the hypothetical compiler will treat codeblock (and "suite" in Python) as anonymous function, and all visible variables inside it as parameters of this function? 
      </p>
      <code>
        c = factory()	# first method-checking space<br/>
        if c.hasBar():	 <br/>
        c.bar()		# second method-checking space<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Object c is checked to have only hasBar() in the first space, and bar() in the second space. -- <a href="MaxFriedental.html">MaxFriedental</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Static analysis of factory() reveals that the object it returns will certainly have hasBar(), so the compiler allows the call to c.hasBar(). However, the return value of factory() may or may not have bar(), so the compiler must flag c.bar() as a compile-time error. Although it is valid code, the compiler must reject it. -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, but only if we have to use "hand-written" method hasBar(), that has no semantic relationship with the presence of bar(). If the language provide means to query variable for methods it support, compile-time checking is possible. It could be like this (on pseudocode):
      </p>
      <code>
        foo (arg) is<br/>
        require<br/>
        arg#bar()	//true, if arg has method bar()<br/>
        do<br/>
        arg.bar()<br/>
        end.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        c = factory()<br/>
        if c#bar() then<br/>
        foo(c)<br/>
        end.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Sophisticated</em> compilers can see that foo(c) will be called only if c has method bar and therefore accept this code. --<a href="MaxFriedental.html">MaxFriedental</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        But if your code consistently checks to see if a method exists before calling it, then there's no need for a compiler to verify that the methods exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> If I would check it every time I need to call a method, my source text become an unreadable mess. Besides, 99% of my everyday code calls methods of the known (at compile-time) classes. And it could be handy to have some compile-time checking.</em> -- <a href="MaxFriedental.html">MaxFriedental</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In COM, you can already do this, because when IUnknown::<a href="QueryInterface.html">QueryInterface</a> returns NULL, you know that the object does not support those methods, so you don't call them. Likewise, when a method lookup fails with COM's IDispatch, you can avoid calling it. Likewise, you can use reflection in Java to see if a method exists. And in the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, you can process the #doesnotunderstand message that occurs when you call an undefined method. In other cases, you can probably catch the errors or exceptions that are thrown. So you don't really need any special compiler support to do what you want. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        How do you do static interface checking in a polymorphic language? A polymorphic method call can only be resolved at run time.

        Sunir, I think the idea is that the compiler, through FlowAnalysis, can infer a signature for any object. That signature is not guaranteed to contain all methods that the object responds to, but it is guaranteed to contain <em>only</em> methods that the object responds to. The compiler can use that signature, rather than declared type, for compile-time checking. -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>

        How do you determine what methods target has to be capable of statically? I suppose you could run a flow analysis over the <em>entire</em> program, so you know which types of wizzling are doing on target. But this wouldn't work with dynamic linking or reflection, would it?

      </p>
      <p>
        I believe so. Figuring out what methods are available on parameters is the spanner in the works. And, as you mention, reflection. The rest of the proposal isn't all that hard (it'd be very similar to the algorithm javac uses to figure out which local variables you've assigned to). My gut feeling is that typed-based-on-signature is somewhat less restrictive than type-based-on-class, but still prevent you from doing many useful things that Smalltalk or Python let you do. In addition, it would be a bear to compile. Reflection and being called by outside code would force you to leave large holes in the checking. -- <a href="WayneConrad.html">WayneConrad</a>

      <p>
        I wonder if the extra compile time justifies the extra runtime and the extra flexibility. Actually, in this case, I'd guess it would be more complex to determine "why did the compile fail?" as you have to hunt through the codebase for the offending context. A lot of "magic" happening here. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

      <p>
        I don't think so. The compiler anyway have to track path from the point of passing an argument back to the points of creation of all objects that could possible become an argument.

        Let's take a classic example - drawing 2D shapes:
        We've written some "shape" classes - Square, Rectangle and Triange, which implement methods like Draw(drawing_context), Move(deltax,deltay) and Rotate(degrees_clockwise).
        You wrote and compiled lots of code that uses those methods.
        Let's say you even put it in a library that gets linked in with my "shape" classes.
        That's OK, as all possible objects implement all three methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now I implement a new class, Circle, and I don't bother to implement the Rotate() method, as it wouldn't do anything. I link it in with your code, and you're hosed - unless the system has some really wild dependency checking that knows to recompile your code because it "depends upon" - code which did not exist when it was compiled, and code that it does not directly reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, it tries to recompile your code.
        <strong><em>Problem:</em></strong>
        With this hypothetical compiler, your code no longer compiles because you can't be sure that the Rotate method is implemented in all object instances you might encounter. Your code didn't change, but it no longer compiles. That doesn't seem like a good thing.

Once compiled, it need not to be recompiled (if you place definition of Shape in the one header, and definition of Circle etc in the other).

        Change the definition of <em>I123</em> so that it inherits from <em>I12</em> etc instead of <em>I1</em> etc.
        Make your multiple inheritance virtual.
        With those changes, an object of type <em>Obj*</em> can be passed happily to all the <em>foo</em> methods.

        Thanks. I didn't know that we could do virtual inheritance in C++. About my point. We have a class with three methods, and we need to create seven more classes to cover all possibly uses of the class. If a class has n methods, we need sum[n*(n-1)*...*(n-r+1)/r!],r=1..n interfaces. For 10 methods, it would be 1023 interfaces. So the choice is: either automagically check for required method signatures, or:

      <ul>
        <li>
           create MANY auxiliary abstract classes

           connect they each other by complicated virtual multiple inheritance

           do all of it by hands, trying not to introduce any errors.

        Types are not redundant for a very good reason: encapsulation. Maybe the compiler could figure out an interface definition from a method's implementation. But then, programmers who call the method would need to read the implementation too, and the whole point of encapsulation is that the callers of a method shouldn't need to know the implementation details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, an interface should not depend on which methods are <em>actually</em> called by an implementation, but rather on which methods could <em>potentially</em> be called. As an example, suppose I have a sort method that always compares numbers using the less than operator ('<'). This doesn't mean that callers should be free to skip the implementation of '>' when they implement a new kind of number. If the sort method ever needs to be changed, the programmer should be free to use either '<' or '>' without code breaking because the caller was lazy.

        Although this seems a little off topic for this page, I would argue you should limit an interface to the methods that are actually called.

        Classes are often used in multiple contexts. Either multiple interfaces must be used, or a single interface must be the union of the requirements. The nature of the contexts will determine which approach is chosen. If the "union" approach is used, then the interface may be wider than is needed by one specific client. However, the fact that the interface is wider is not a consequence of method-splurge: its a consequence of multiple uses. And the fact that the interface is wider than is strictly necessary gives an implementer of a service the license to re-implement using the full interface, with confidence that no clients should be broken. -- <a href="DaveWhipp.html">DaveWhipp</a>

        Remember that types are real. Within the computer each type does have its own memory representation and associated operations. When a language hides data types, it also takes responsibility for conversion among types, and must do the conversion without the concept of a context. This recently led to a lot of problems with dates and Y2K and has been an ongoing problem is some C mathematical algorithms (signed vs unsigned, int vs long). Strict type checking forces the programmer to make a decision on a data type based on its intended use. If you don't feel comfortable in defining how you are going to use a parameter, you are probably not ready to write the function. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

      <p>
        Types are real if you work on the implementation (low)level. This is good for some situations, but if you work in a high enough level of abstraction, you don't care how types are represented. You only care about the operations that they support. In fact, you actually point out the redundancy: if you know how you are going to use the parameters, and you write the functions well, why do you need to spell out the details about the parameters explicitly? Other humans should read the docs, and the compiler should infer the types by how you use them. -- <a href="AmirLivne.html">AmirLivne</a>

        The difference between Java (and other <a href="BondageAndDisciplineLanguage.html">BondageAndDisciplineLanguage</a>s) and C++ types is that with C++, the compiler can do all the optimizations it needs to make the code small and fast. With Java, the compiler has a very hard time doing any static analysis because the classes load dynamically. You can wrap a whole class around one byte in C++, but you can't in Java. If you think types are redundant in C++, you just don't understand the compiler. If you don't understand the underlying platform, you're really asking for trouble.

        It seems to be partly a factor of <strong>modularity's desire for each module to be more or less self-protecting</strong>. In strong-typing usually each module will recheck the variable's type as it passes in and out among various modules. This does seem to be redundant. <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> would dictate checking type in as few places as possible. It's somewhat analogous to having your baggage (and ass) checked before you enter the boarding area (or waiting area) in an airport, and once again just before you get on the plane.

        For example, if we read a value from an input screen, once its validated that its an "integer", it shouldn't need to be validated again when converted into SQL code for the "save" step. However, most strong-typed systems/philosophies will indeed do it again.  Thus, "integer" is stated over and over in many spots. Its perhaps a down-side of modularization.

        Strong-typing is intended to guarantee (at least) type-safety, so type checks are only "redundant" insofar as the language model (compiled vs interpreted) or type model (static vs dynamc) or optimisation mechanisms (or lack thereof) <strong>must</strong> perform type checks in order to <strong>guarantee</strong> type-safety.  A given compiled language with static typing might only perform type-checks at compile-time, with none done at run-time.  An interpreted language with dynamic typing might have to execute type checks in every expression evaluation, assignment, function call, etc.
