        Give Away What You Dont Need
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you're a hard-ass in all your negotiating, you can build a lot of enmity. Your colleagues will see you as grasping and set on short-term gain alone. You'll miss opportunities because of this. And you'll get bad karma, which is worse.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="GiveAwayWhatYouDontNeed.html">GiveAwayWhatYouDontNeed</a>. Got some code or a document you can share? Don't sell it to them, just share it with them. Don't mind travelling? Then don't make it a deal-breaker. Happy to get their options? Accept 'em. Give them skills for free if the skills aren't going to be used much. And stop negotiating when you feel content - don't go for the last few pennies.
