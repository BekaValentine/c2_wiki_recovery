        Facade Function
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="FacadeFunction.html">FacadeFunction</a> works according to the <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a> and simplyfies an complicated interface of multiple functions or classes to a bare minimum, a single function. -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Example (using <a href="ThelopLanguage.html">ThelopLanguage</a>): 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>FileCpyUrl( "\remember\FacadeFunction.html", "http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FacadeFunction")</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>How is this different than a regular function call? What makes the above an instance of the </em><a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a>? You have to go a level deeper if you want to show it as a facade or strategy.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is a regular function call (BTW I do not know how to do irregular ones). It is not an instance of a <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a>, but similar to a <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a>. It should be obvious that this function simplifies and unifies a complicated API of multiple functions or classes depending on the environment where you implement it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Isn't this the case with any function that delegates behavior within its implementation?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How is this different from top-down design and stepwise refinement?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no big difference, but I wouldn't use the term <a href="FacadeFunction.html">FacadeFunction</a> for simple functions like FileCpyStr(filename,string), although you could also develop this function top-down, because there is no complexity hidden. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The term <a href="FacadeFunction.html">FacadeFunction</a> doesn't introduce something new (do patterns?). It introduces a new way of looking at or talking about "just functions" (or static methods), which  have been unduly devaluated in the OOP world. <a href="LanguageOrientedProgramming.html">LanguageOrientedProgramming</a> tries to find a new balance between OOP and PP. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why have the term at all? Why isn't </em><a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a> enough? Why does it matter whether the pattern is implemented with a function, method, or class?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What does it matter to be precise and speak of <a href="FacadeFunction.html">FacadeFunction</a>, FacadeMethod, FacadeObject or FacadeClass in these cases? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What new information is provided by creating this new term for people to remember?</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Look at paragraph one of this section. Only time will tell if people like this term enough to use it. That's how languages work. BTW I can't undo it anyway, can I? :-)
