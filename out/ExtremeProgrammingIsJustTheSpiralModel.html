        Extreme Programming Is Just The Spiral Model

        ...but going at 32x.

        ...or so people tend to say. I am not sure I believe it, but it is hard to say what the spiral model actually <em>is</em>, for starters.

        Spiral does not talk about values such as aggressiveness, listening, users on the team, team morale. Spiral does not require <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. Most spiral practitioners would want written requirements and designs. Spiral does not not talk about 100% <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. Most spiral people I have met would be uncomfortable with 1-day spirals (but happy with 3-week spirals). XP iterates like spiral, reduces risk like spiral, so I would say spiral fits within XP (mostly), but XP covers more territory than spiral. That's my version. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        I would say that "spiral" (incremental development, with increasing system scope in each increment) is simply the minimum required of any project that intends to succeed. Doing a project any other way is asking for failure. XP, as you say, hangs some specific development practices on the spiral organizational framework. -- <a href="RobertEikel.html">RobertEikel</a>

        I'm not sure I would equate each day's work in XP with a spiral. Reading Boehm's more recent work, a single spiral is much closer to an XP iteration. -- DanIngold

        Concur. Spiral in my recollection (not even sure where my copy of the original Boehm (wasn't it?) article is) is an iterative risk-first development model. His main point was just that - didn't address the entire process, at least not in the original article.

        I hadn't heard that particular "objection" before, must not be from anyone who posts here. It's really good to have reached the "XP is just" stage of recognition though! ;-> -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Actually, maybe it was ExtremeProgrammingIsJustRapidApplicationDevelopment -- I <em>know</em> I have heard that one before, and even can remember who said it. RAD vs. Extreme? Makes sense from the words, at least. (-:

        Anyhow, Alistair's points are well taken. Thanks. -- BT

        Yup, I agree largely with Alistair, but it's perhaps worth saying in passing that <a href="TomGilb.html">TomGilb</a> was always more extreme than Boehm and would certainly have no problems with 1 day increments. Boehm acknowledged Gilb's influence in the forward to <a href="PrinciplesOfSoftwareEngineeringManagement.html">PrinciplesOfSoftwareEngineeringManagement</a> - and made some good points about our ignorance (at that time, without the additional joys of XP unit testing and pair programming) about engineering towards non-functional system requirements. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        Spiral is what I was apparently doing before I knew it had a name. On my second RealProject at my RealJob (the first apparently proving I wasn't a <a href="BadProgrammer.html">BadProgrammer</a>) my new boss asked about my design given that I was already coding. I told him I didn't yet sufficiently understand the problem or the solution to have a design. To his credit he showed up the next day (and this was pre-web I believe :-) with a paper about the SpiralModelOfDevelopment. Now it turns out, that maybe what I was <em>really</em> doing was <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> (though I'm still reading about what that actually means). Now the credit for any of that goes to my first real mentor. Being unable to afford school without working, I got a part time job in the field and I learned the most valuable lesson they do not teach in school -- get a little tiny piece working, and then build on it. He made me throw out this elaborate infrastructure for controlling 3 (x,y,z) stepper motors in favor of a tiny stand-alone program which made a single motor move which of course evolved into a main and a function for a motor's control, etc. It is, of course, possible that I'm just used to <a href="CowboyCoding.html">CowboyCoding</a> and trying to justify his hard and set ways (and don't we make the worst converts. I can <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a> you to death :-) -- <a href="ChrisHyser.html">ChrisHyser</a>
