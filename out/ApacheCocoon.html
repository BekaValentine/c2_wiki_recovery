        Apache Cocoon
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Apache Cocoon is a Spring-based (since version 2.2 of Cocoon) framework built around the concepts of separation of concerns and component-based development.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Apache Cocoon is an XML publishing framework that raises the usage of XML and XSLT technologies for server applications to a new level. Designed for performance and scalability around pipelined SAX (</em><a href="SimpleApiForXml.html">SimpleApiForXml</a>) processing, Cocoon offers a flexible environment based on the <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> between content, logic and style. A centralized configuration system and sophisticated caching top this all off and help you to create, deploy and maintain rock-solid XML server applications.<em> </em><a href="http://cocoon.apache.org/">http://cocoon.apache.org/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Cocoon lets you do pipelining of web services components and tries to separate out as much as possible content from presentation.  Delivery of web content is defined by a "sitemap", which expresses (in XML of course) how URLs map to content, in terms of: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Generators, which create XML as SAX events;
        </li>
        <li>
           Transformers, which transform SAX events into other SAX events (eg. XSLT);
        </li>
        <li>
           Serializers, which convert SAX events into binary or character streams (eg. HTML) for consumption;
        </li>
        <li>
           Selectors, which allow conditional processing (if, then, else);
        </li>
        <li>
           Matchers, which match patterns to resources; and
        </li>
        <li>
           Actions, which manipulate runtime parameters based on request and application state.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Cocoon 2.0.4 is now available and rock-solid enough for production. Some people are using it. Soon will be available the version 2.1.5 (milestone releases are available now).
