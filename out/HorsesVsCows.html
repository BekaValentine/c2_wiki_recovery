        Horses Vs Cows
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm looking for a quadruped for riding. Should I choose a horse or a cow?

        <dd><em>Definitely a cow. Cows can produce milk, and make nice burgers. I've been using cows for years, and have never found the need for a horse.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        But what about riding?
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Ummm... I've never tried that with a cow. Why would you want to? Let's see... Just build yourself a nice big saddle. Should be able to jump straight on.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The cow doesn't seem very responsive, and doesn't seem to like it much.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Bah, you just train it a bit and you'll be fine. It should only take a few months.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Okay... I've got him trained. Seems a little slow though.

        <dd><em>Don't worry about performance. It'll be </em>'fixed<em>' in the next couple of evolution cycles, I'm sure. In the meantime... Maybe if you attach these rockets?</em></dd>

        <em>As a point of information:  American bison (commonly called buffalo) can do 30MPH (50 Km/h); I don't know how long they can sustain that speed.  Thoroughbred horses sustain average speeds of 45MPH (75 KM/h) for over a mile; quarter-horses can go faster than that over very short distances.  Don't know how other cattle species (including domesticated cattle) fare...</em>

        <em></em>'Fixed<em>'?  Would that be fixed like a car or fixed like a cat?  Err, steer in this example.</em>

        I worked as a stable boy at a ranch for many years, tending both cows and horses. I came to the conclusion that  horses were expensive, obnoxious, and rather useless cows. What can you do with a horse that you cannot do with a cow? Anyone who says cows cannot run fast has never seen an angry cow. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Needless to say, the owners of said horses did not find my opinion amusing. How would you like to be told your $40k luxury car was in fact no better than a Daewoo? -- <a href="DaveFayram.html">DaveFayram</a>

        <em>Win the Kentucky Derby?  :)  Even if angry cows are fast, and would be allowed on the track, I bet the cow would lose.</em>

        <em>Horses do have another advantage:  un-neutered adult male horses are far less cranky/dangerous than un-neutered adult male cows, pigs, sheep, etc...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But here's a question for you:  Why is it that cowboys, when herding cattle, don't just ride a few of the herd?</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And a second question, which relates to the marketing problem cows have:  Why are cattle used for milk/meat referred to as "cows", and cattle used for draft purposes called "oxen"?</em>
