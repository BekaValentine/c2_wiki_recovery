        <em>As opposed to people who understand OO deeply, but aren't very impressed with it?</em>

        If so, how does one tell the difference? Is there a "get it" test?
      </p>
      <p>
        Reading the objections on this page and on OoGroupsBetterClaim, it's clear that for at least the subset of criticisms raised within those pages, any understanding of objects is shallow, at best.

        <em>I kind of disagree with the merging. It is often claimed by trainers that some people *never* seem to "get it". This topic was meant for dealing with those people. The merging assumes it is all about training. However, there may be some fundamental brain differences. Whether you agree or not that the problem is due to lack of yet more training, some people believe there is a permanent barrier. This can also be the place to debate about whether there is such a permanent barrier.</em>

        Things that "bother" me about OOP (cf. <a href="ArgumentsAgainstOop.html">ArgumentsAgainstOop</a>):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Too many methodologies out there with no systematic way to compare them. Procedural/relational design seems more consistent from practitioner to practitioner: nouns in the DB, and verbs (tasks) in code modules.
        </li>
        <li>
           No good books on business modeling in realistic environments.
        </li>
        <li>
           OO seems to lack a grouping granularity between "class" and "application", making an OO app appear like "class soup" to me. Procedural has "task" modules, which seem pretty natural for me and relatively easy to find. I can navigate 200 task modules more easily than 1000 classes. (I would say the ratio is roughly between 1:2 and 1:10.) <a href="BigSoupOfClasses.html">BigSoupOfClasses</a> 
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>I'm no Java expert, but I assume that is part of why it uses packages."</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               But that's not an OOP concept. And the fact that we need another different division or modularization mechanism suggests that classes are not flexible enough.
            </li>
            <li>
               {They're different concepts.  Packages define namespaces.}
            </li>
            <li>
               Classes also define a kind of namespace. It's what allows polymorphism even: same method name, but different implementation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Dividing things up by polymorphic "subtypes" does not reflect how the real world changes, in my observation. <a href="RobertMartin.html">RobertMartin</a> and I once had a discussion about the <a href="MellorsProblem.html">MellorsProblem</a>, and we had to simply agree to disagree about the likely pattern of future changes. Other topics with some OO fans highlighted similar perception differences.
        </li>
        <li>
           Factoring stuff into relational tables makes it easier to manipulate my view of the information to how I want to see it. Code editors can sometimes do this, but not as well as table browsers and query languages. You don't have to factor your code as much if you can alter your view of info instead of have to physically re-arrange it. Code is too static IMO. IOW, move the wires, not the nodes when relationships change.
        </li>
        <li>
           OO proponents are inconsistent on identifying the alleged strengths of OO. If they could identify areas to focus on, the <a href="PeopleWhoDontGetOo.html">PeopleWhoDontGetOo</a> can then focus on those.
        </li>
        <li>
           For the life of me, I cannot translate the lessons of the common shape, animal, and device driver examples into practical business applications. The "regularity" that those examples seem to rely on just does not exist in the real world as I see it. They are just too artificial. The alternative is complex GOF-patterns, which I find cleaner under relational-centric approaches.
        </li>
        <li>
           OO seems to want to find too many "global abstractions", when they should really be quite local IMO (usually task-level or smaller). (<a href="EverythingIsRelative.html">EverythingIsRelative</a> perhaps)

      <p>
        <a href="OoIsPragmatic.html">OoIsPragmatic</a> has a similar "complaint list".
      </p>
      <p>
        My dislike for OO can perhaps be summarized to 3 things:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Too many OO methodologies, definitions, and opinions floating around.
        </li>
        <li>
           Different perception of how the (biz) world tends to change (not favoring "types" and trees).
        </li>
        <li>
           Something about tables and relational that melds nicely with my thought processes and working patterns.
        </li>

        What should such people do? Is there enough procedural or functional work for them? Should they change careers despite being good at their favorite paradigm? Is excess OO hype doing them injustice? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>First I would try to find out whether I can be any good at doing OO even if it's not my favorite paradigm (</em><a href="PlayHurt.html">PlayHurt</a>). After all, most programmers have to work in a different language in their job than what they would pick if there were no restrictions. Also, I would look into <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>, and see if that doesn't fix some of my gripes (one-dimensional vs. multi-dimensional etc). Otherwise, I would try out functional for a change, best with a language where you can mix and match styles (e.g. Python). You might want to read <a href="LanguageTrends.html">LanguageTrends</a>, and make your own guesses where the market might be going next. If all else fails, I would look at other domains (e.g. <a href="EmbeddedSystem.html">EmbeddedSystem</a>s) before looking at other careers.

        OK, my apologies, structs are standard practice in a lot of procedural shops. I guess my point is if procedural guys understand and use structs, why not just take the next logical step to objects. I only mention this because I'm the lone OO guy in a procedural shop, so this issue is dear to me. I really am trying to understand what the mental block to objects is. I feel constantly held back because I'm always defending things like objects, closures, abstraction, interfaces and pretty much anything that steps outside the procedural norm. I get bombarded with silly arguments about overhead and complexity, even though we only write simple business systems. Worse, procedural guys, while arguing about complexity, seem perfectly willing to write 3 page long functions full of nasty switch statements and 6 levels of nested if's. I could certainly be wrong, but I've found very few if any procedural programmers who understand the value of simplicity, abstraction, and an open mind.
      </p>
      <p>
        [That is an interesting statement, because I feel the same about OO. I don't really believe in <a href="AbstractDataType.html">AbstractDataType</a>s for reasons described there. In practice behavior and data are not naturally tightly coupled. If you cannot turn your claims into something externally measurable, then you may not get very far. Does OO make less code? Does it reduce the quantity of code that has to be changed when requirements change? If you think so, then you have to demonstrate this side-by-side with comparable code of the other paradigm. If you just go around saying, "my code is more abstract and high-level than yours, neener neener", then you won't have much credibility with them. I personally now believe that paradigm and tool preferences are largely subjective. We pick tools that best fit our own minds. Assuming this is the case, you cannot convince others to think like you unless you can show some external, quantifiable benefit.]
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree with on that point, we do all pick a paradigm that fits our own minds. But how do you know what fits your mind unless you actually learn and try all the major paradigms. I try to demonstrate the benefits to them on a daily basis, the problem isn't OO per se, they have to work with the code so they see the benefits. Mostly that's through seeing methods that rarely have more than 10 line of code and can be understood at a glance. Fortunately I write most of the code so I tend to shape it the most. But back to my point, the problem isn't OO per se, it's that procedural programmers tend to have a prove it to me attitude. With that attitude, it's very hard to learn. They don't seem to understand that to learn you must put aside what you think you know, adopt the new practice, learn how to do it the new way, and only after learning the new way are you in a place to judge the merits of it. If it doesn't pan out after that, then fine, it's not like the extra knowledge hurts you or anything. But you can't effectively learn anything new if you question every step of the way. I think it comes down to <a href="MappersVsPackers.html">MappersVsPackers</a>. I'm a mapper, packing is too slow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I had a different experience. Before I learned OO, I was using OO techniques in my procedural code. I used C headers to define the public interface to my code. I passed pointers to context structures to the exposed functions, just like C++ does. C++ just added language support to the stuff I was already doing. I could see immediately how it would simplify my life. The procedural programmers I was working with at the time had the same experience, since these techniques were part of our shared "best practices". We'd been burned too many times by tightly coupled spaghetti code and had drifted to these techniques out of necessity.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {{I would like a demonstration of such techniques that allegedly fixed "tightly coupled spaghetti [procedural] code". I am skeptical. Most prior such demonstrations simply had different views/estimations of future change patterns, or had no database to use.}}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You won't get a demonstration out of me. It's been 12 years and the code belongs to previous employers. It has nothing to do with database use. Instead of letting every function call every other function (the procedural equivalent of using GOTO), one groups related functions and the data on which they operate. High level functions are exposed while low level functions can be hidden. That let's you limit the number of entry points without having to write 3 page functions and defines a modules interface to the rest of the program. It's called encapsulation and it's a proven technique for organizing code.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ((Not all procedural languages make every function global. It sounds like a case of <a href="CeeIsNotThePinnacleOfProcedural.html">CeeIsNotThePinnacleOfProcedural</a>. Generally I try to keep each task independent from other tasks, except for shared libraries, by communicating between tasks mostly via the database. This greatly reduces issues of "naked global stuff" that I often hear about procedural. It is <a href="EventDrivenProgramming.html">EventDrivenProgramming</a> in a way. Each event is treated as an independent event more or less. Thus, you don't have one big EXE, but little "programlets". <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a>.

        [Almost every technique that I have adapted over the years that I liked in the end had some clear early benefits. Other more subtle benefits may appear later, but after understanding the basics there were definitely some early good points to focus on in order to motivate one to stick with it before the minor or subtler benefits made themselves visible. Why would OO be different? Why would only it have a "U" shaped "get it" curve? Generally, the harder it is to articulate benefits of something, the more the benefits are probably a subjective mind-specific thing. Or, the benefits are so minor that they are hard to see. Also, how come you are not able to articulate why your methods can be "understood at a glance" while their routines cannot? Maybe to them, their own routines are also "understood at a glance", to them.]

      <p>
        Let me propose one class of programmer who does not seem to "get" OO. These are programmers who rely on the debugger and single step through code.
      </p>
      <p>
        From this perspective, code structure has no meaning; as long as the computer can get to the next line of code to be executed, it does not matter where the line of code is placed. As long as the computer can find a variable or method, it does not matter what they are named. A global variable is really no different than a local variable; they are both just variables to be updated.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is almost impossible to have a rational discussion between someone who is a "code reader" and someone who is a "single stepper." These two types of people seem to have completely different views of the software.

      <p>
        <em>I'm not Eric, but I am another single-stepper who "gets" OO. One of the ways that I've helped "single-steppers" understand OO is to explain to them how an "object" can be modelled (in C or assembler) as a struct (or even array, since the two are so similar) with a pointer to an array of function pointers (a "Class") to "methods", where a "selector" is an offset into the array. Since every "Point" (a good starting point) shares the same array, they all share the same methods. Those arrays can be chained together with pointers and - voila - we have inheritance. This is the basic idea behind </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>, and single-stepping through the code can be enormously revealing. It typically doesn't take long for the subject to begin to appreciate, in this context, how stack frames, temporaries, and literals fit in. The most common reaction I've heard, especially from UI and Game programmers with backgrounds in assembler and C, is "Oh, I've already been doing this for a long time". <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> and <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a> are basically syntactic sugar (more or less) around coding patterns that many of us already "have". -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

      <p>
        <em>The low level approach Tom recommends helps a great deal. Single steppers will want to know what instructions all of this object froo-frah will generate. It may also help to explain how an object provides shared context for its methods and can optimize the number of decisions made during dispatching. Single steppers are often premature optimizers, so these can get them over their objections to additional levels of indirection and object creation time. It also helps to understand how a good garbage collector can optimize memory allocation time by keeping the heap contiguous and all of that.

The particular group I am trying to reach consists of Visual Basic programmers who have never declared a structure beyond the rare collection. When I describe "single-stepper" I mean someone who really does not see any overall code structure. [Thanks again for your suggestions.

        Oh, I didn't know they were VB programmers. Start by teaching them a good assembly language. Make them use that for big projects for 3 or 4 years. Then teach them C and make them work in that for another 3 or 4 years. Then they'll come running to use an OO language. :-) Seriously, I've never tried to convert a VB developer. Most of them seem happy with the tools they have for the jobs they do. Perhaps they should be left alone. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <Tongue in cheek>Even VB "programmers" can be given remedial instruction.</Tongue in cheek> I seem to recall (though it's been many many years) that even <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> has operations for constructing and indexing arrays and types - things like "DIM", "Type", and so on. The following example (copied from a google hit, <a href="http://www.other-space.com/vb/part2/files.html)">http://www.other-space.com/vb/part2/files.html)</a> allegedly constructs a type in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>:
      </p>
      <code>
        Type Info<br/>
        name As String * 20<br/>
        address As String * 50<br/>
        city as String * 20<br/>
        state As String * 2<br/>
        zip As Integer ' 2 bytes<br/>
        End Type<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This type has four string variables, sized 20, 50, 20, and 2 bytes, and an integer which is 2 bytes in VB. The resulting type has 94 bytes for each instance. If I make an array of these, as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        Dim xyz(1 To 100) As Info<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I thus consume 100 * 94 or 940 bytes of space. It takes only a little bit of handwaving to explain the relationship between "records", "types" and structs, and only a little more to explain how arrays and array indexing works. At this point, we're really talking about "indirection", another abstraction that is often hard for people to grok. Many of the <a href="PeopleWhoDontGetOo.html">PeopleWhoDontGetOo</a> that I've worked with don't get indirection. They don't get pointers, they don't get arrays, they don't get JSR, they don't get the distinction between the name of a function and an invocation of that function - they simply don't get indirection.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write all this to emphasize that even if you have to use the vocabulary of <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, the basic ideas can still be described. Many of your programmers will "get" what you're saying. Some will not. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've used a lot of indirection over the years, but don't seem to "get" the benefits of most OO still. The above is merely using VB to make a RAM database-like table. What does it have to do with OOP? OOP is not about DB-like tables. Note that the above can also be modeled via a nested or 2D associative array in a more scriptish language than VB. -t</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I suggest that some people have a natural talent for abstraction. Others find abstraction enormously difficult. For those who are facile with abstraction, OO feels natural and obvious (although not always simple). For those who are challenged by abstraction, OO feels artificial and opaque. I think a similar split occurs regarding recursion -- some people get it, and some do not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This claim is way too general, and needs to be debunked. For example if you don't feel OO is natural and obvious you infer about me that I have a problem with abstraction. Oh, well. Do you want to shame me into not using other paradigms ?</em>

        <em>From the (large or small ?) category of programmers who have a natural talent for abstraction, some of them embrace OO. Others don't. And yet other group of "abstraction enabled programmers" are just about neutral. OO is just one way of several good ways to abstract.</em>

        I would suggest that there are some very apt musical analogies. Almost all of us are either right-handed or left-handed. Those of us who are right-handed experience playing a piano score in a completely different way than those of us who are left-handed. Because of the physical layout of the piano keyboard, and because of the different roles that bass, tenor, alto, and soprano play in music, there is a fundamental connection between the innate nature of the performer and the music that results. Right-handers have a far more difficult time "getting" a bass line then left-handers. Left-handers have a far more difficult time getting a descant.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us are, for better or worse, wired so that we naturally think abstractly - in the same way that some of us are left-handed. Some of us are not. Big deal.

        I'm talking about PeopleWhoDontGetOO - let me emphasize <strong>get</strong>. I've said nothing about those who "get" OO and still prefer other abstractions. I never said that OO use is a good indicator of abstract thinking ability. Some programmers may well "get" OO, "get" relational, or "get" functional abstractions - and may choose some mix of all of them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's try inverting the assertion. People who get abstraction get OO - whether or not they choose to use it. I believe that I "get" the relational paradigm, I "get" the OO paradigm, and I "get" most other software paradigms. I suggest that PeopleWhoDontGetOO also don't "get" the other paradigms. They may <strong>use</strong> them - but they don't "get" them. There is a difference.

           In the real world, the relationship between nouns and verbs in the longer run tends not to be one-to-one. OO lies about that. The things that do tend to be one-to-one, relational factors such typical <a href="DatabaseVerbs.html">DatabaseVerbs</a> into the database, while each and every class tends to reinvent the wheel, AKA poor <a href="InterfaceFactoring.html">InterfaceFactoring</a>. <strong>Encapsulation is faulty.</strong> It is artificial coupling for the sake of dogma. You equate coupling of nouns and verbs as being "higher abstraction". But that does NOT make it a better model. Abstractions can be bad abstractions. The tasks done on something is best considered a lower-level of detail than the entity design, and therefore is intentionally postponed in most relational-influenced designs. <strong>Coupling a data design to only the here-and-now application is one of the problems with the navigational databases that prompted </strong><a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a> to find a better way<strong>. Tasks can be added, changed, and removed in the future without affecting the over-all design, just like adding a village to the shore of the Nile does not significantly change the Nile. Design of the schemas, on the other hand, can have a wide-reaching impact. OO prematurely couples nouns and verbs. Whether that is "higher abstraction" perhaps is not so much the issue as whether it creates maintenance headaches. --top</strong>

           Further, your examples are often physical things.  OOP was born for physical modeling. However, in my domain one is often modeling intellectual property and concepts such as contracts, laws, approval rules, etc., not so much physical things. And the hard part of modeling such is managing the <strong>relationships</strong> between the nouns of the domain, not just each noun by themselves. OO seems to offer nothing to help with relationship management. If I am modeling a vending machine in isolation, OO may indeed be dandy. However, what about managing 100,000 vending machines, and thousands of vending machine technicians, maintenance contracts, part suppliers, etc. --top

        You assume that requirement, not everything needs the ability to do ad-hoc queries on its data. A coke machine takes money and spits out drinks when a certain amount is input. That's all behavior, and requires no need for ad-hoc queries, just definable behavior. Putting a coke machine simulator in a database would be an exercise in ignorance.

        [That page has nothing to do with virtual machines. Every program is a virtual machine, whether it imitates an existing real machine or not. The reasons we create virtual machines instead of real machines is because a) the real machine would be physically impossible or b) the real machine would be more expensive.]

        But the real world is limited. I would rather go beyond its limitations if possible. Dewey Decimal was limited because it had to match the physical placement of books. Now we can go beyond it and search multiple orthogonal categories without forced, artificial nesting. I have seen computer automation that tried to recreate the manual approach, and it was not very effective. Sure, it probably reduced training, but did not result in much productivity gain. (I would note that user interface and internal structure are not necessarily related.)

      <p>
        [You aren't reading what I'm writing. The real world is limited.  That's why we don't use the approach described on ClassicOoModelingApproach. We create any virtual machine we can describe, not any virtual machine that could exist as a real machine.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Make up your mind. If we are able to divorce from real-world limitations, then how about a relational machine? Relational is consistent and powerful, and tables are easy and compact to browse eye-wise. It is friendly on the brain (especially if we can replace SQL with something better), and friendly on the eyes; what more can you want? It fits most apps I have encountered. I can even envision a table-oriented interpreter. It would make debugging easier in my opinion. One's view of the internal state (variables, routines) is not limited to what the original product makers were able to conceive. If you are going to argue that relational rules are too restrictive compared to OO, then present an example at <a href="WhenAreStandardsRestrictive.html">WhenAreStandardsRestrictive</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Read what I write. I've never advocated limiting ourselves to real world machines. I already use relational machines. I also use maps, factories, trees, proxies, threads, priority queues, and many other imaginary machines. I'm not arguing against using relational databases. I just see no compelling reason to use them more than I already do. I've written many apps that used relational databases, but they needed much more than that. If all they needed was a relational database I wouldn't write the app. I won't argue that relational's rules are too restrictive compared to OO because they are orthogonal. OO and relational happily coexist in my work. I don't have to pick one or the other.]

        Good. Then all we have to do is agree on <a href="WhenToUseWhatParadigm.html">WhenToUseWhatParadigm</a>. Note that I have used <a href="NimbleDatabase.html">NimbleDatabase</a>s such that I never had to use dedicated maps, trees, and priority queues because they were so easy to make with the existing table engine. Instead of threads, I would spin off a separate process that communicates with the current one via tables, which have locking and/or transaction handling built in. I do consider relational a <a href="SwissArmyKnife.html">SwissArmyKnife</a>. No, it cannot do everything, but it does a good portion. Perhaps OO is a consolation prize for when the boss won't let you have your favorite table tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, trees, maps, queues are or can be merely <strong>viewpoints</strong> of given information. You get much more adaptability in a system if you can use HAS-A instead of IS-A.  I've written many queries, reports, and processes that produced a non-tree view of what may initially seem only to be a "tree".  Relational helps one transcend your physical, mechanical view of things where each part is and does one and only thing. The relativism aspect of relational is not only a nice bonus, but often a necessity in an org where the same info must be used by different parties interested in different aspects at different times and uses that often cannot be anticipated up-front. (Added after material below was written.) -t

        [I've done the same as you, when performance permits. When you can't afford to keep your maps, trees and priority queues in a <a href="NimbleDatabase.html">NimbleDatabase</a>, don't use one.

        But this topic is about "getting" OO benefits. Is OO all about working with small chips and 1980 RAM/Disk portions? OO is rarely associated with small and quick executables anyhow.

        Top I agree with a lot of your comments in various wikis but disagree with your premise: the primary utility of a paradigm is how closely it maps to reality. With the advent of refactoring tools, mature SourceControl and NUnit tests and so forth, the cost of change is IMO the primary consideration. OOP code when done well with lots of tests is very easy and safe to change. Tables are not. The problem is a lack of sophistication among tools to integrate data and code. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In OOP if I want to change behavior I make the change in the code and check it in (say to add a behavior attribute and implement it). In relational, I make the change to both table and code. I have to generate SQL scripts for the difference, check those in, others have to run those scripts and it has to be deployed. If there is an error, rolling it back is a nightmare (as opposed to one-click undo in OOP source control). --BrianG

        <em>First of all, I never claimed that "the primary utility of a paradigm is how closely it maps to reality". In fact, it appeared to be OO proponents that claimed that, not me.

        I'm actually opposed to OO for broad spectra of applications on the premise that it 'fits the human mind'.  That isn't to say I disagree: the whole concept of 'object' <em>does</em> fit the human mind.  It's just a shoddy justification for using OO for <em>programming</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a>: MultipleViewsOfObjects
      </p>
      <p>
        Humans <strong>model</strong> the world via use of conceptual 'objects'.  Note the emphasis on the word <strong>model</strong>.  Models, even those in the human mind, are best used for <strong>prediction</strong> and <strong>simulation</strong> (computational tasks that are very closely related).  But <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> isn't about modeling the world.  <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> creates <em>real</em> objects in a <em>computed</em> world.  But 'objects' aren't supposed to be real.  'Objects' are supposed to be in the mind - patterns over percept that help us make predictions.  In <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, we're forced to transform a particular 'view' or 'model' of reality (an object model) and <em>make it reality</em> (in the computer).  And that is where it fails: despite us understanding 'object' we also benefit from multiple simultaneous models and views.  Being stuck with just one 'view' is rigid, inflexible, and not particularly well designed for the broader possibilities of modeling and simulation.  We can easily switch from thinking that  "all clouds part of one entity that spreads out and gets thin in places" to "each cloud a separate object" to "there just one atmosphere with spatial distributions of water-vapor".  <a href="ObjectOrientedDesign.html">ObjectOrientedDesign</a> cannot do this.	When programmers impose a particular object model upon their program, they <em>enforce</em> properties upon the 'reality' of the program that should instead be attributed to a 'view' of the program.  On his website and in various pages on this wiki, Top has done a very good job at showing many of the pitfalls to enforcing particular views on data.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> based on 'fitting the human mind' would probably work well enough for simulation purposes.  Our minds 'simulate' by 'imagining' objects in an environment then stepwise calculating how they interact... a process that is essentially the same as is done by computer simulators.  Unfortunately for OO, even for this simulation we are better served by a system that can take multiple views over the data when inferring the future based upon it.  I've rarely been satisfied with any object-based simulators with which I've worked.  In the systems that have proven the most powerful, making the broadest spectrum of useful predictions, the 'objects' of interest are the 'facts' and the 'inference rules' - objects far less associated with 'fitting the human mind' than with 'simulating' it.  Many of the most effective simulators today are expert systems and knowledge-engines, and as progress in the so-called 'weak AI' advances (and becomes more efficient), this will only become more true.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> to do systems software is tolerable; like a clockwork engineer, the programmer can build pieces (domain objects) and fit them together piecewise until he has a working system.  This might appeal to programmers who came out of another engineering discipline where they put objects together with their hands.  It is rather like constructing a real object inside code.  It goes well with the whole simulator angle, except that you might be able to put it to real work afterwards.  But I'm a computer scientist.  I've put together my fair share of things with my hands, but it doesn't 'fit my mind' especially well.  
      </p>
      <p>
        My understanding of computation far exceeds my understanding of mechanics, and when I use ObjectOrientedLanguages for programming, the 'objects' I prefer to model are computational components: values, transformers, ports, message-queues, procedures, continuations, actors, expressions, messages, commands, facts, inference-rules, state-machines, grammars, parsers, codecs, presentation-layers, etc.  All other domain objects will just be poor simulacra of the real things, but computation-objects <em>are</em> the real thing.  I've applied this approach well, and seen it applied, in a broad spectrum of application domains.  Other people have discovered the same... and have built libraries like Boost that are dedicated to supporting this semi-functional 'style' of <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>.  As to whether it is really <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> is an open question - I'm hesitant to call it that after the set of 'domain objects' is reduced to particular facts, tasks, and messages.
      </p>
      <p>
        The best reasons I've seen for <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> have <em>nothing at all</em> to do with it 'fitting the mind'.  Of greater relevance is the ability to hook together arbitrary computations (via polymorphic methods), the ability to easily build configurations for purposes of unit-testing, and the ability to encapsulate code to prevent accidental coupling (which eases maintenance and reduces the blame-game).  And all of these features can be provided by other mechanisms than <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>.  I'd choose lexical closure + first-class processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd certainly benefit more from a language where I didn't need to repeatedly reinvent these computation-components using objects (I'm stuck using C++).  Even Boost is an example of <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>: it's an expensive, massive reimplementation and reinvention of half of common Lisp.  <a href="AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures.html">AreDesignPatternsMissingLanguageFeatures</a>?  I predict that the <a href="FutureOfProgrammingLanguages.html">FutureOfProgrammingLanguages</a> won't be <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>.  You'll be able to simulate <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a>, of course.  But, excepting design and implementation of <em>simulators</em> (and <em>games</em>), you'll have very little need (or desire) to do so.  And even for <em>simulators</em>, you'll eventually be able to choose instead a generic knowledge-system with data and prediction rules, which will provide a far more flexible and powerful simulator than you'll likely <em>ever</em> get by hard-coding a particular object-model.  I predict that, in the long run, <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> will be a passing fashion from which we mostly learned a few good lessons about the virtues of encapsulation and unit-testing.  Either that or <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> will be one more (usually premature) optimization for making interactive simulations fast enough for realtime gameplay.
