        My Confused Idea Of Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        So I jwanted to create a FAQ for my lab using Python and some net stranger pointed me to Wiki. Could this do what I want? Maybe.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like the ad hoc nature of wiki, although others in the groups probably won't. They want to put passwords on the site. Why? Apparently to stop all those crazy hackers who want to put bogus FAQ entries on our precious web site. I can't understand the paranoia, but ...
      </p>
      <p>
        So now I'll see if <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a> can do the job. I want to stick with Python because I like Python and want to get better at it.
      </p>

        Scott, I'd like to hear your results. I tried to get <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a> working, and gave up after a few hours. (I was in a hurry.) I got <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> running in about 10 minutes just by following the directions. (Of course, I am running <a href="RedHatTheCompany.html">RedHatTheCompany</a>, which is what <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> was tested on, if I recall correctly.) -- <a href="RichardBash.html">RichardBash</a>

        <em>Richard, I needed 5 mins for </em><a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a>. :) <a href="PyWiki.html">PyWiki</a> does not run good on Windows (actually, not at all, because of the versioning module). I already extended <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a> at the workplace, and will probably spin a sourceforge project off it. -- <a href="JuergenHermann.html">JuergenHermann</a><em></em>

        <em>If you decide to loosen your constraints about Python, I'd recommend </em><a href="TwikiClone.html">TwikiClone</a> as well. It's very easy to use and setup.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I use <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a> for this sort of stuff at work. I've made a bunch of extensions to it; this was very painless to do. It works very nicely. I must admit that so far I'm the only person who uses it, so I can't talk about (e.g.) scalability issues... -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        My idea on scalability, should it become a problem, is to make <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a> a webserver instead of a cgi script. Easy to do in Python...
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the other changes that I thought of until now:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           First things first, some kind of edit locking, with manual breaking & timeouts
        </li>
        <li>
           Configuration <em>outside</em> the script proper
        </li>
        <li>
           Make it a package, with a small cgi driver (see configuration)
        </li>
        <li>
           Versioning (via CVS), optional
        </li>
        <li>
           Some kind of access authorization, via pages with a special <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Hierarchical <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>'s (grouping of different projects)
        </li>
        <li>
           Support for I18N, especially German <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>'s (Jï¿½rgenHermann ;)
        </li>
        <li>
           Possibly make it a webserver (advantage: configuration is kept in memory)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        -- <a href="JuergenHermann.html">JuergenHermann</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think making it a webserver would be a win. That would amount to replacing a carefully crafted webserver written in C or C++ or something (Apache, say), with something, inevitably much slower, written in Python. You'd gain by not having invocation overhead, but I think you'd lose more. But, hey, what do I know? :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        The only one of your proposed changes I've implemented is versioning. I haven't done edit locking, so race conditions are still possible, but I have made it prevent scenarios of the form <em>A clicks on "edit page", B clicks on "edit page", A saves changes, B saves change</em> (in a very crude way, but it seems to work OK).

        I'm trying to add <a href="ModPython.html">ModPython</a> handlers to <a href="PikiPiki.html">PikiPiki</a>. Will post results here.

        <em>Twisted is another example of a Python-based web server that's faster than you'd think... significantly faster, for example, than Apache + a CGI written in C.</em>
