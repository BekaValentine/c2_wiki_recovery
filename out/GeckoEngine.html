        Gecko Engine
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Gecko Engine is a HTML rendering engine that converts HTML directives with their associated digital objects into viewable Web pages. It is used in many popular Web browsers, including <a href="NetscapeNavigator.html">NetscapeNavigator</a>, <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a> and <a href="GaleonBrowser.html">GaleonBrowser</a>.
      </p>

        The Gecko engine, I can say with some confidence as Web designer and some-time mozilla.org contributer, has bugs, but in the event that a page does not render correctly in Gecko but does in <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a>, the problem is orders of magnitude more likely to be something other than a bug in Gecko. Most likely is that Gecko refuses to recognise mangled HTML that IE attempts to fix, or that Gecko implements <a href="CascadingStyleSheets.html">CascadingStyleSheets</a> directives in the <a href="WorldWideWebConsortium.html">WorldWideWebConsortium</a>-approved way, whereas IE is always doing its own thing. -- <a href="EmlynShannon.html">EmlynShannon</a>

        Mozilla Firefox is the latest Gecko-based browser. To install: <a href="http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/">http://www.mozilla.com/en-US/firefox/new/</a>

        There's been a mass exodus away from Gecko in third party browsers, mainly due to its size I suspect. <a href="EpiphanyBrowser.html">EpiphanyBrowser</a> is now based on WebKit, along with most new  browsers. Galeon is dead.
