        <em>can you explain the difference between this and </em>
        to MusicTeX or MusixTeX<em>?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        MusicTeX or MusixTeX are macro packages that run on top of TeX. They're rather arcane, probably because TeX is not well suited to 2D typesetting: musixtex is a 3-pass system (that involves a separate program for breaking lines). Typical musi?tex input looks like line noise.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you know Mus?tex well already, and especially if you need to have extremely fine control over the output, musi?tex may just suit you fine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LilyPond.html">LilyPond</a> is a stand-alone program, that also supports direct output to <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> (although the TeX output mode is usually more convenient). The input format is much more high-level. This means that learning and using <a href="LilyPond.html">LilyPond</a>  is easier; for example, this is the start of twinkle twinkle little star
      </p>
      <code>
        \relative { <br/>
        \time 2/4;<br/>
        c4 c | g' g | a a | g2 | f4 f | e e | d d | c2 }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Both lily and Musi?TeX are highly tweakable, but <a href="LilyPond.html">LilyPond</a> uses a much more elegant mechanism: the backend is built around <a href="GuileScheme.html">GuileScheme</a>. You can override formatting details by commands that add <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> expressions to objects in the back end; these commands are actually readable. For example, vertically translating a rest downwards is done by 
      </p>
      <code>
        \once \override Rest #'staff-position = #-8<br/>
        r8	% 8th rest<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The hash sign signifies that what follows should be interpreted as a single Scheme expression. 
      </p>
      <code>
        \override Rest #'staff-position = #(lambda (x) (= 1 x) 0 -1)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        would also be valid input, although it would generate a warning, since the staff-position for Rest should have a number value.
      </p>
      <p>
        The above shows part of the Yacc special purpose music language. However, this language is a just a layer of syntactic sugar over
        Scheme data structures. The same might have been entered as
      </p>
      <code>
        #(make-grob-property-override 'Rest 'staff-position -8)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Moreover, it is possible to mix Scheme and lilypond constructs almost seamlessly.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One thing that you should realize, is that music and music scores are two entirely different things. Music is an abstract combination of pitches, durations, articulations, etc, and a musical score is a 2D configuration of lines, font glyphs and other graphic symbols. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LilyPond.html">LilyPond</a> is a program that parses a rather abstract music definition (think pitch and duration), then  transforms it into a 2D layout problem, and solves that layout problem.  Most music-typesetting programs don't make this distinction between layout and meaning. IMO, that makes those programs broken by design.
      </p>
      <p>
        \property sets a property of that transformation-to-layout at a certain point in musical time. In this case, a cons '(staff-position . -8) is pushed onto the layout description of the rest; all Rest objects created from that point on within that Voice are translated downwards.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also set properties that are not used directly in the formatting process, such as location within the measure, or the current bar number, eg.
      </p>
      <code>
        \property Score.currentBarNumber = #21<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I don't know the exact Musi?TeX equivalent, but Musictex commands usually involve a magical concatenations that look like 
      </p>
      <code>
        \zqxxxf<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Lily also includes a music font that looks nicer, IMHO.
