        Yellow Alert
      </h1>
      <p>
        A situation that requires greater alertness, but is not necessarily critical (red alert). Sometimes the word "smell" is used instead, but "smell" implies that it is already deemed bad rather than merely suspicious. Something must already be rotten to produce a noticeable smell. In other words, "smell" has too many negative connotations. We have enough <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s as it is, so I would rather use a more diplomatic word than "smell". <a href="YellowAlert.html">YellowAlert</a> conveys a "check into this carefully" attitude rather than a suggestion to prepare to aim the torpedoes. -- top

        <em>Plus you don't get that annoying "whoop whoop whoop" like you do with a </em>RedAlert. (Wasn't there a "blue alert" once on TNG, when the power went out?)<em></em>

        I like the above term to defuse <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a> :) Problem is, both sides may aim their torpedos your way :(
