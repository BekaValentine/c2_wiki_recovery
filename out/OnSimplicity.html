        On Simplicity
      </h1>
      <p>
        Something I wrote up for an ERP system framework serving dozens of different plants:
      </p>
      <p>
        This framework is best if kept simple.  Simple is easier and simple is better.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep the scope limited.  Don't try to include everything.  Prioritize your focus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep the model open.  Don't try to make the whole world closed and consistent.  Plan for other systems and ideas to link in.
      </p>
      <p>
        Accept some ambiguity.  Don't introduce precision where it isn't needed.  Precision can be a burden.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep to the essentials.  Don't let custom features corrupt the core.  Handle them in local applications of the framework.
      </p>
