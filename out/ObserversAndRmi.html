        Observers And Rmi
      </h1>
      <p>
        hello!
      </p>
      <p>
        A while ago I posted the claim on the <a href="RemoteMethodInvocation.html">RemoteMethodInvocation</a> mailing list that I had implemented a system using RMI where the Stubs could cache data and implement their own behavior--not something you can normally do because the stubs are automatically generated.  You can of course write your own wrappers on RMI <a href="StubObject.html">StubObject</a>s but the rmi transport layer will not instantiate your wrappers so you have to do a lot of housekeeping to manage two different kinds of ProxyObjects, the thin stub and the intelligent proxy.
      </p>
      <p>
        My solution basically has rmi instantiating your proxy objects, which are themselves wrappers on the thin stubs.  The distinction is transparent to clients of these objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore the solution utilizes a generic messaging system to broadcast changes from implementations to their intelligent proxies to keep them synchronized.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got several responses from people who wanted to know more.  I sent this overview to them.  I don't know how useful this is, but if I got more encouragement I might write a paper on it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's the overview:
      </p>
      <p>
        First, I modified the rmi compiler so that it compiled stubs to files named XXX_ThinStub.java instead of XXX_Stub.java.  The trick here is that the rmi code still tries to instantiate XXX_Stub classes to create the stubs.  This allows you to insert your own wrapper class on ThinStub which does the correct remote dispatching.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my XXX_Stub classes, I intercept calls to addObserver, etc., which I forward to a local dispatcher.  This local dispatcher subscribes to changes on this object using a traditional publish/subscribe mechanism (in our case, Tibco's Rendezvous).  Other changes are passed through.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the server side, implementation objects have a notifyObservers() method which notifies local observers but also "publishes" the changes to the network so that subscribers, on behalf of their local observers, can forward the notification.
      </p>
      <p>
        The end result was observable objects whose actual location was transparent to observers.  Observable objects had to implement Remote, but Observers didn't.

        Take a look at the article, <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-11-2000/jw-1110-smartproxy.html,">http://www.javaworld.com/javaworld/jw-11-2000/jw-1110-smartproxy.html,</a> for a way of accomplishing the same thing, without changing the rmi compiler or doing post-code-generation editing.
