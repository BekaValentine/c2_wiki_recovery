        Api Design
      </h1>
      <p>
        Essentially, designing programs for use by other programs.  The designed program has an interface usable by other programs - an <a href="ApplicationProgrammingInterface.html">ApplicationProgrammingInterface</a>.  In common with UiDesign, it is a good idea to <em>not</em> put awkward or dangerous controls in an API.
      </p>
      <p>
        A number of oft-debated programming language features assist in <a href="ApiDesign.html">ApiDesign</a> more than anything else:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ConstCorrectness.html">ConstCorrectness</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           AccessControl
        </li>
        <li>
           StrongTypes
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ExceptionHandling.html">ExceptionHandling</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="AttributesInNameSmell.html">AttributesInNameSmell</a><em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Not all APIs are object-oriented.  Polymorphism is probably the most-sorely-missed feature of such APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> and <a href="SunMicrosystems.html">SunMicrosystems</a> expend considerable effort towards <a href="ApiDesign.html">ApiDesign</a>, apparently to good effect.

        Who says <a href="ReuseHasFailed.html">ReuseHasFailed</a>?
        --<a href="MattRickard.html">MattRickard</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Good point, if I interpret your <a href="ReuseHasFailed.html">ReuseHasFailed</a> reference correctly.  Perhaps reuse has failed for those waiting for software IC's, but from the standpoint of OS provided tools, capabilities, and widgets, reuse has been growing ever since the Macintosh toolbox.

        Why should you emphasise API design?
      </p>
      <p>
        If programs don't have a UI, they are easier to test i.e. you get to <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> instead of doing <a href="GuiTesting.html">GuiTesting</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will have to separate UI code from algorithmic code, so both will probably be easier to understand and maintain, maintaining algorithms won't break the UI, and vice versa.  See <a href="IsolationLayer.html">IsolationLayer</a>
