        Buzzwords In Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> methinks! 
      </p>
      <p>
        We've seen <a href="BuzzWords.html">BuzzWords</a> in marketing literature, brochures,  websites, advertisements... but what is worse?
      </p>
      <p>
        When we see the buzzwords in the actual source code! Not just in the comments, but the actual source code itself.
      </p>
      <code>
        TArchitecturalIntegerFactoryCreator<br/>
        implementorDispatchingServiceProvider<br/>
        end;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Crap</em> like the above buzzword infested code. Unnecessary verbosity that could be made more elegant and more to the point. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually dominant in the type system and declarations when someone has over engineered the program.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've seen buzzwords dominant especially in heavily object oriented languages and frameworks such as Delphi, Java, object persistence frameworks (relational mappers), UML (if this can be considered a language), XML (again, if this can be considered a language). <em>Oh, gee, yet another five-times-abstracted interface. What the hell are we gonna call </em>'this<em>'?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now that you mention it, I've never seen UML that </em>wasn't<em> a litany of buzzwords.</em>
