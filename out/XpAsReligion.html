        Let's see what we can figure out about the UnstatedXpCreed from the sacred principles:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>: XP is monotheist and denies reincarnation or an afterlife.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>: First comes the judgement, but then you get it over with and can enjoy the rest of your life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>: XP advocates an austere, simple life.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, <a href="PairPromiscuously.html">PairPromiscuously</a>: XP enthusiastically supports close interpersonal relationships, no more need be said on a family-oriented web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>: XP promotes a lifestyle of continuous reflection and self-improvement.
      </p>
      <p>
        XP does not object to material success, as it is very compatible with an object-oriented life, but it does not mandate striving after secular achievement.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>XP already has a creed: </em><a href="EmbraceChange.html">EmbraceChange</a>.<em> -- </em><a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        Interesting use of faith/religious terminology. I've never seen a testimonial for <a href="GotoConsideredHarmful.html">GotoConsideredHarmful</a>.

        The anti-<a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> zealots accuse us of this stance, and some of our own testimonials ring of "witnessing".
      </p>
      <p>
        Religion only deals with that which must be taken on faith. Anything proven falls over the wall to science (or just gets fought over as a "loyalty test").
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone who takes XP on faith should not pitch it. XP works best when fully understood.

        XP is a simple mathematical principle - the <a href="DynamicAttractor.html">DynamicAttractor</a> - tuned to attract good code out of thin air. This field is well-studied (especially in terms of evolution) so evolving good code could hardly be seen as divine. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        <em>This is amusing! As the one who just added the "In my experience..." paragraph to </em><a href="PairNonBelieversWithBelievers.html">PairNonBelieversWithBelievers</a> I did react to the word "believers", but I just went with the terminology on the page. -- <a href="AndersBengtsson.html">AndersBengtsson</a><em></em>

        Am I an anti-XP zealot, or merely an anti-(XP zealot)? I accuse many of taking XP too seriously. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        <dd>My <em>mother</em> doesn't take me seriously, so why should you? She's waiting for this crazy "playing with computers" thing to wear off. -- ss</dd>

      <p>
        I dunno about SS specifically, but - yes - some skeptics are zealots. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        Some <em>believers</em> are zealots. Zealotry is orthogonal to the side you are on. The honest answer is pragmatic belief.
