        Distribution Of All Statistics
      </h1>
      <p>
        A multi-university research program has compiled a profile of the effects of all known statistics that have ever been collected.

        This is both true and a joke. It's a joke primarily because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There is no such actual study. Such a study would be the equivalent of "find every acronym nobody uses". And it would have more data points. The page starts with a fabricative introduction to lead one into the ideas involved.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's a joke because it's true. If you compiled every statistic ever compiled, distributed them on a scale between "true", "useless" and "harmful", because you sampled a very large population, and you rolled all its error bars up into one metric, you'd get a bell-shaped curve, almost normalized. Then, because you get what you measure (in both the input samples and the curve), a vanishingly few statistics would "EXACTLY match reality", and a vanishingly few would be "dangerously misleading". Statistics like, "Bread causes crime because 90% of all crimes are committed within 24 hours of eating bread." The families of folks spending their life in jail due to such <a href="PseudoScience.html">PseudoScience</a> would consider this sloppy thinking <em>very</em> dangerously misleading.
