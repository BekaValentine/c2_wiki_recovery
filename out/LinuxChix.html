        Linux Chix

      <p>
        <a href="LinuxChix.html">LinuxChix</a> is an informal, volunteer-run online community where women and men
        with various levels of expertise discuss Linux-related technology
        and issues of gender and computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most activity occurs on three mailing lists with different areas of
        focus (technical, issues-based and social).  A number of regional
        chapters exist which facilitate <a href="RealWorld.html">RealWorld</a> meetings and events.

        A wiki is being considered for the <a href="LinuxChix.html">LinuxChix</a> web site.

        Those interested in encouraging more women in computing fields should take a look at the HOWTO, written by <a href="LinuxChix.html">LinuxChix</a> members:

        lots of food for thought, for men and women.

        Thank you VERY MUCH for the HOWTO! I felt much better after reading this! (The only thing I don't completely agree with is about women "cussing," but then I'm not comfortable with anyone using obscenities. I don't think it shows strength, earthiness or anything positive.)

        But let that pass -- overall this is a wonderful document! -- Websafe.
