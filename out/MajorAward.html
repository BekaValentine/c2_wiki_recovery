(Of course, the on-switch is up there under the miniskirt-shaped lamp shade!) Dad proudly displays this in the living room window for all the neighbors to see, proud of his great achievement.

He's an electrician by trade, and reportedly has installed one or more extra circuits to his home just to power the Xmas lights...</em>
