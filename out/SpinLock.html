        Spin Lock
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a> is not <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>. <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> is an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>, while a <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a> is a <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>. Some <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a>, most notably Windows NT4 (SP4 methinks), has <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a>s only when compiled for MultiProcessorSystems.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>FYI:  NT4.0 SP3 </em>'exposed<strong> a spin capablity on </strong><a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a> objects to allow a wait operation on a <a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a> to spin for a little while while waiting for the <a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a> to become available.  If the spin duration was reached, then a normal wait (using the Win32 function WaitForSingleObject) would take place.  Single CPU systems will always ignore the spin count and just do a normal wait.  (This is regardless of running a single or multi-processor build of NT.)<em> -- </em><a href="JamesTwine.html">JamesTwine</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason for this is that when two processors are executing code at the same time and one of them is blocked on a lock, the typical solution is to do a <a href="ContextChange.html">ContextChange</a>, but that takes a lot of time in CpuCycles. If the other CPU is holding the lock, the locked CPU can spin a few cycles to see if the other CPU drops the lock. After that, if the lock is not dropped, most probably the same CPU is locking itself, so it makes sense to do a ContextSwitch.
      </p>
      <p>
        So as you see, a <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a> is <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>, actually spending a lot of Precious CPU resources but only for a limited amount of time:
      </p>
      <code>
        if ( lock.isLocked() )<br/>
        {<br/>
        CLI<br/>
        for ( int i = 0; i < 200 && lock.isLocked(); i++ )<br/>
        ;<br/>
        STI<br/>
        if ( lock.isLocked() ) // Beware, this is just pseudocode, possible <a href="RaceCondition.html">RaceCondition</a> here<br/>
        lock.waitForLock();<br/>
        }<br/>
        doTask();<br/>
      </code>

        Alternatives to spin locks (<a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a>s, events, ASTs, etc.) can impose unacceptable overhead, especially when it comes to process and thread context switching.  One often finds brief spin locks deep inside the implementation of other forms of resource waits.

           SpinLocks are not used directly in application programs, but internally in <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> concurrency abstractions like <a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a>s and the like. Also they are not useful for uniprocessor systems. -- <a href="GuillermoSchwarz.html">GuillermoSchwarz</a>

        <strong>Incorrect: Confuses </strong><a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> and <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a> is a lazy polling method. "Lazy" because it has a small Sleep, and "polling" because it asks the same question over and over again.
      </p>
      <code>
        startAsyncTask(task);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        while (task.isWorking())<br/>
        Sleep(50);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        task.fulfill();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>* This is slow </em><a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>, not <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a>, see below. SlowBusyWaiting (or LazyPolling like it is incorrectly called in here) is better than <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> because it doesn't burn too many CPU cycles, but it is less responsive than <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> or than MessageQueuss. Definitively I don't recommend <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> or SlowBusyWaiting, but I do recommend SpinLocks, although their scalability is not very good.<em>  -- </em><a href="GuillermoSchwarz.html">GuillermoSchwarz</a>

        It should be noted that the application-level <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> described above doesn't burn too many CPU cycles, provided a call to sleep() (or some other function which yields the processor) is in the loop.  Polling without sleeping is a definite no-no.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kernel <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a>s do burn CPU cycles, of course--in most cases, the number of cycles burned is small.

        Usually one thinks of spin locks at the hardware level. I think you described <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a>s are a rather inefficient way to do locking (any waiting time is spent busily but uselessly spinning - hence the alternative name BusyWait), but since common computer hardware does not provide any other form of concurrency control, it is an absolute necessity. All the more sophisticated locking mechanisms, such as semaphores, are built on top of <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a>s in some form.
      </p>
      <p>
        This kind of spin lock is usually used by neophyte hardware types who are waiting on a <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a> event and don't know how to use the <a href="RealTimeOperatingSystem.html">RealTimeOperatingSystem</a> properly. Hey, I'll admit I did one of these for a quick test on a gig not too long ago and it got checked into the library. Uh, oh.
      </p>

        I would agree with the comments above. The scenario described in the example code is an example of polling or <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a>, not <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a>ing.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are some legitimate uses for <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a>s as I understand it. One being in a parallel environment when the penalty of blocking and being rescheduled can be significantly larger than simply <a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> the lock, particularly when the lock is only held over very small time deltas by any process/thread. It can be worth it but usually isn't - YMMV. Usually it's best to <a href="OptimizeLater.html">OptimizeLater</a> instead, if necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When you call sleep, assuming we are not using a hardware spin lock, you are blocking and</em>
        being rescheduled. You've just fixed your best case latency to the period of sleep is all.<em></em>

        <strong>Seems to confuse </strong><a href="BusyWaiting.html">BusyWaiting</a> and <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="SpinLock.html">SpinLock</a> can be a symptom of other <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>s. Either remove the <a href="PrematureConcurrency.html">PrematureConcurrency</a>, or apply the <a href="ObserverPattern.html">ObserverPattern</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="InternationalBusinessMachines.html">InternationalBusinessMachines</a> <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a> uses spin locks to implement JVM monitors. Application code using spin smacks of <a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a> (and probably not very efficient). 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, some of us have never ever seen them except in their smelly configuration. Like <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>, the spin itself is not harmful, it's what you do with it.
