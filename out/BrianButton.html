        Hi to anyone reading my page. For most of my professional career, I've been a traveling consultant, but I've recently accepted a position with AsynchronySolutions in St. Louis as VP of Engineering and Director of Agile Methods. This lets me stop traveling for the most part and focus on those things that I love doing, which are working with people, teaching them about the agile ways, coaching, mentoring, training, and generally making people happier in their workplace.
      </p>

        I've recently finished up work inside Microsofts <a href="PatternsAndPractices.html">PatternsAndPractices</a> group, where I worked with people like <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, <a href="PeterProvost.html">PeterProvost</a>, ScottDensmore, BradWilson, and <a href="JimNewkirk.html">JimNewkirk</a>. I had a great time there, learned a lot about .Net and C#, and contributed on two major project initiatives, EnterpriseLibrary and the WebServiceSoftwareFactory.
      </p>
      <p>
        Previous to that, I was one of the roving consultants for <a href="ObjectMentor.html">ObjectMentor</a>. Great job, great people, sorry to have left them.
      </p>

        I currently own and maintain a blog focused on agile development and .Net at <a href="http://oneagilecoder.asolutions.com">http://oneagilecoder.asolutions.com</a> .
