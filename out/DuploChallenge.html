        Duplo Challenge
      </h1>
      <p>
        Small children (and their parents) sometimes struggle with the small size of Lego elements. The Lego company therefore introduced (at least 20 years ago) the "Duplo", a line of oversized Lego elements.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most Lego (and therefore Duplo) constructions are generally rectilinear, reflecting the basic shape and obvious connectivity of the elements from which they are constructed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="DuploChallenge.html">DuploChallenge</a> is to construct an approximately cylindrical tower, surrounding an open center, from <em>interlocking</em> Duplo blocks and/or bricks. A square Duplo Block and brick look something like the following (from the top):
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Square</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        +------+<br/>
        | O  O |<br/>
        |      |<br/>
        | O  O |<br/>
        +------+<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>Brick</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        +------------+<br/>
        | O  O  O  O |<br/>
        |            |<br/>
        | O  O  O  O |<br/>
        +------------+<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In most Duplo sets, the squares come in single- and double-height varieties.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hint: You'll want at least 30 or so blocks to build an interestingly tall tower.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll happily provide a picture of the result of anyone would like. Successful solutions can be built from a variety of combinations, and demonstrate surprising variety in size, appearance, and proportion.

        By the way, there are important lessons about modularity, <a href="EmergentBehavior.html">EmergentBehavior</a>, and emergent properties of simple systems to be learned from the exercise.

        Is it legal to melt the blocks first?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, it might be legal, but your children will never forgive you. No, this is a completely non-destructive exercise.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I wouldn't destroy the blocks, just change their shape.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You </em>'must<em>' be one of those software-types. Changing the shape of the blocks will disqualify your entry.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, can I mortar them with PlayDoh?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sounds like you're stumped, and therefore perhaps eager to participate in one of my obscenely expensive workshops on the topic.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not eager to participate in anything that's obscenely expensive.  I've made lego forms that were close to cylinders, but I doubt a true cylinder can be made without deforming the bricks or suspending them in another media.  How strict is your definition of cylinder?  Is a square a cylinder?  An octagon?  Etc?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I mean a closed shape with more than four sides, whose interior angles are equal to each other and each greater than ninety degrees. A pentagon, hexagon, septagon, octagon, etc., will do fine. That's why I said </em>'approximately<em>' cylindrical.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Do the sides have to be filled or can there be gaps?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Gaps are ok, it's the overall shape (looking down from the top) that matters.</em>

        I'd build it from stacked rings of bricks; each ring would consist of 4x2 bricks (long axes tangential to the ring) with roughly brick-sized spaces in between, and the rings would be lined up so bricks were over spaces and vice-versa. The connection between successive rings of bricks would be at the innermost end bumps, which i denote with an X:
      </p>
      <code>
        +------------+<br/>
        | O  O  O  O |<br/>
        |            |<br/>
        | X  O  O  X |<br/>
        +------------+<br/>
        (inside of ring)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        These bumps fit into the sockets in the same positions in the ring above, except that due to the out-of-phase apposition of the rings, the bumps on a given block fit into holes in two different blocks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The curve angle is constrained by the fact that the 'skirt' of the upper brick cannot run through a bump. I can't say what angles are permissible, although 90 degrees is; it leads to a structure like this (only two layers are shown):
      </p>
      <code>
        lower layer:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        +------------+<br/>
        | O  O  O  O |<br/>
        |            |<br/>
        | X  O  O  X |<br/>
        +------------+<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        +------------+<br/>
        | X  O  O  X |<br/>
        |            |<br/>
        | O  O  O  O |<br/>
        +------------+<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        upper layer:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        +------+    +------+<br/>
        | O  X |    | X  O |<br/>
        |      |    |      |<br/>
        |      |    |      |<br/>
        | O  O |    | O  O |<br/>
        |      |    |      |<br/>
        |      |    |      |<br/>
        | O  O |    | O  O |<br/>
        |      |    |      |<br/>
        |      |    |      |<br/>
        | O  X |    | X  O |<br/>
        +------+    +------+<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That would look a lot better in a square font.

        <em>Bingo, that's pretty much the approach. It turns out that the little square ones work well. Once the curvy-trick is understood, you can build squarish modules and therefore vary the "texture" pretty much arbitrarily. I think it's a pretty good example of a property (flexibility) emerging from components that don't appear to offer it at first inspection.</em>
