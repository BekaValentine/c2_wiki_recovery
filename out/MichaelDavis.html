        I am a software engineer for a company in Scottsdale, Arizona.  I write some modeling and optimizing software, and I support the smart guys by doing release management and such.

        I've just been noticing this <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> thing for about about a week (as of
        Sept 13, 2002).  I'm wondering about using it as a tool for in-house communications at work.

        <em>See </em><a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a> for more ideas that might be suitable for an "intranet" or corporate environment.<em></em>

        Thanks much for the suggestion.  I'll go read it now.

        I've finally set up a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> at Work, using the <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> code.  Now for the major propaganda effort to get people to use it.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Update:</em>  This was an almost total failure.  I used it personally and it served my needs well.  On the other hand, even after extensive propagandizing on my part, I got 0 (zip,zero,nada) hits in my server logs that anyone even looked at other than the home page.

        I'm now (March 30, 2005) trying to get a wiki going at my new company.  If anyone knows of a particularly easy way to handle equations (sometimes very complex equations) in a wiki.  I would appreciate hearing about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are some wikis out there that handle equations, usually by calling out to </em><a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a>. Here's one example: <a href="http://mcelrath.org/Notes/LatexWiki.">http://mcelrath.org/Notes/LatexWiki.</a> I was able to hack <a href="LaTex.html">LaTex</a> into my <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> (a modified <a href="ClusterWiki.html">ClusterWiki</a>) with about fifty lines of code. Leave a note on my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a> if you're interested in the details. -- MarkIrons<em></em>
