        The Romo Project
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is a nationwide project that will be used to license commercial enterprises all over the country. The commercial enterprises have categories, and activities, all these classified.

        The government of Angola using this application will be able to get an image of the growth of the commerce in Angola and as well have a decision tool to plan, manage and better administer resources.
