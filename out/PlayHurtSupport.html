        <em>I have a plea- I won't list every detail, but the short story is that a deadline is coming up, the code just reached the out of control point last week, and despite trying to get enough sleep, I'm still feeling really tired.

        Don't allow somebody asking the impossible of you make you feel inadequate for not achieving it. Do the right thing, i.e. do you own very best, try to leave the project/code a bit better than you found it where possible, and try to make it easier for those around you.
