        Smart Generalist
      </h1>
      <p>
        The multimedia industry is made up of either gifted techies or smart generalists. The latter is the people who were bored with highschool; the sort of people to whom the tutor was always saying: "John, you could get an A if you really wanted to."
      </p>
      <p>
        It is suggested that companies seek and employ these people. They peruse marketing, IT, and sales jobs but aren't quite good enough at anything in particular.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once in a company, and there are a few companies that encourage it, throughout their career, they zip between every department on secondments, think tanks, short-term projects and spontaneous, unauthorised MBWA (managing by wandering about) jaunts.
      </p>
      <p>
        They usually leave behind a better situation than they found, but they don't remain anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        They make good project and product managers, with bossiness, insane attention to detail and a new lightbulb over their heads every 5 minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        These people's insight, contacts and knowledge is great for the boardroom, as long as the old school can keep up with them.
