        At the moment, I prefer caps and lowercase, primarily because I'm doing a lot of java and that is the idiom, but also because a number of IDEs treat the underscore as a word break (which, granted, it is) and when I double-click on a variable with underscores, the IDEs only select up to the underscores. In general a lot of tools make it harder to work with underscore separators for something that is actually one thing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said that, I know a good argument <em>for</em> underscores, in the case where you have developers whose native language is not English (or whatever they are trying to code in) and don't know the words so well, it's easier to see the underscores as word separators.

        The value of mixed-case is that it can be easily read as either a series of words or as a single token among operators in the context of a program. Hyphenated Lisp words scan well because Lisp tends to spell its operators and therefore removes the visual competition. Fortran, by the way, allows spaces to be inserted at will into variable names. It didn't take people long to figure out that that was a bad idea. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Lisp doesn't spell more of its operators than other languages, but it uses prefix notation. So the difference between (- foo bar) and foo-bar is more marked then between foo - bar and foo-bar. Infix Dylan distinguishes between the two latter forms and requires spaces for its operators. -- Lieven

        Several years ago, I was involved in a project that had two captives along with about a half-dozen or so rent-a-bodies working on a message-based (pSOS) system. [Never mind what the product was.] There was a typical RWAR raging for a while before the group leader said, "Okay, everybody get your !@#$%! together, and I mean like right now! Come up with a standard for this stuff!" So we did. One of the conventions we settled on was the use of init cap concatenated names applied not only to variables, but to classes and methods as well. Why not? If a naming convention is good for the goose, it's good for the gander. I love to use the example of an input buffer. What do you call the durn thing? Here are some examples:
      </p>
      <code>
        input_buf<br/>
        input_bfr<br/>
        inp_buffer  (oh! too long!)<br/>
        inp_bfr	(ahh, much better)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        You can see how ridiculous this can get. And this is just one lousy entity! We ended up deciding that names, no matter what they described, should be whole words, spelled out, concatenated, with init caps. The variable name is, "Input<strong>'Buffer." It is always created the same way, spelled the same way, accessed the same way. There is no question about slubs - er, sorry, underscores - or abbreviations or any of that noise.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as names getting too long, what are you whining about?!? If you use an OO language like C++ the names are relative to the local entity - class, method, whatever. A name like I<strong>'nputBuffer should only be used in the context of something like a serial device driver or a math processing unit. In fact, there is no problem at all in reusing the same entity name several times in the same program as long as it is used in different scope. Be careful about your naming conventions, design good separation of your objects, and names never get to be too long. Eh? -- </strong><a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        Okay, according to the definition provided on the <a href="CapitalizationRules.html">CapitalizationRules</a> page, the style we settled on is Upper Camel Case (a.k.a. <a href="PascalCase.html">PascalCase</a>). This particular convention violates the Wiki convention of not allowing contiguous capital letters in an entity name. We decided to keep it because that way we would have no exceptions. Even if we had a name that contained a well-known abbreviation the abbr. would be spelled out as a substring of caps (MinorRAMTest). To repeat: this stopped confusion. The rule was the rule. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        What about the Ada style for multiple word variables, which is to use <em>both</em> underscores and capitals. So instead of

        I personally find this most readable and wish it had become more common.

(even if the Romans are arguably quite oppressive?)
      </p>
      <p>
        The run together names are just too hard to read. The underscore names are not as bad, but the underscore detracts too much from the horizontal flow (the lisp convention is thus probably better than either). Perhaps the capitals and underscores work together to avoid the worst of both.

        An identifier should be easy to read, but it should also be easily recognizable as a unit. These goals are contradictory: the more you separate the individual words within the identifier, the easier it is to read. But at the same time, the words appear less to be a unit, potentially making it harder to see the code structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        How much this is a problem of course depends on how much the language syntax and conventions already separate identifiers from the surrounding code.

        I think this is getting quite silly.  I find either method usable.  When I read code, I only try to decipher the name once.  From then on, I merely recognize the pattern of the letters.  This is the way the brain reads; it recognizes a pattern and even with gross misspellings, one can still recognize the word.  When typing in code, I will often use a mix of Camel case and underscores depending upon how much unity and separation I might desire in the name.  When I go back and read the code, however, I am not sure this makes a whit of difference to understanding what I wrote.  Use whatever convention you prefer, it really doesn't matter.

        One very good reason to use underscores, beside readability, it that it is much easier to write regexp to change variable names when refractoring code.

        Some languages have more clearly established patterns than others.  In Java for example, if you don't obey the universally observed case rules it looks very silly (it is no longer Java, it is C#!)

        The otherwise perfect Python language uses this_style, ThisStyle and thisstyle in its core functions, and Guido van Rossum actively encourages developers to use whichever they like in his Python Style Guide.  I find that unfortunate, because it means that I cannot ever really look at a piece of code and say 'this is perfect, I do not want to change a single character', because I am always slightly bothered by the case conventions.  They look wrong/right/strange/great to me depending on what other languages I have recently been exposed to (C, C++, Java, and especially other people's python code of various case conventions).  I don't actually care which it is but I want there to be 'one best way to do it' (otherwise I'd use perl!)  I want to concentrate my thoughts on the code and the meaning, and not to have to think about the case conventions.

        Python style is in PEP 8 - <<a href="http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html">http://www.python.org/peps/pep-0008.html</a>> Except where there's pre-existing project styles or legacy items, casing is now pretty much mandated [I believe the intention is to strengthen the language in PEP 8 some time - probably as part of the push to clean up the library for 2.5]

        I translate between languages occasionally. I use This.Style (This.HTML.Block) or This_Style (This_HTML_Block) in the source, and produce whatever style is appropriate for the destination. This is much more difficult to do when the source is ThisStyle (ThisHTMLBlock). -- <a href="PeterLynch.html">PeterLynch</a>

        I prefer to use a variety of names, each with semantic meaning. This allows an indicator to be embedded into variable names. The convention I use is:
        myVariableName = local variable, parameters
        MyVariableName = property (get/set accessor), method name
        _MyVariableName = the private copy of a variable for each property
      </p>
      <p>
        So in C#, we have this:
        private int _MyVariableName
        public MyVariableName
        {
      </p>
      <code>
        get { return _MyVariableName; }<br/>
        set { _MyVariableName = value; }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
        public MyMethod(string myParm) {}
      </p>
      <p>
        So the initial upper-case and the underscore prefix both indicate that a variable is used in a property, and how it is used. I found this useful.

        Has any language allowed spaces in identifiers? <em></em><a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a> allows spaces in an application's class and property names, but not (as far as I know) in  user-specified variable names. Several languages allow escaped spaces.<em></em>

        There's one good reason for keeping punctuation out of names: punctuation is used for operators. When reading code it takes extra attention to separate the operators from non-operators in names. That's all the justification I need for using camel case for everything.

        <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> is much easier for me to type than underscore_spellings because my fingers type an error about half the time when I stretch for _. This distraction affects my bug rate in two ways. First, I may not catch a misspelling. Second, when I do catch a misspelling, I am distracted from thinking about the algorithm I'm coding. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I like underscore_spellings because they are easy to read. Therefore, I need an editor with an optional feature to convert abbreviations/misspellings to desired spellings, for example us into underscore_spelling. This feature should not show preference to any type of spelling, for example cc might convert to <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>. Whatever the user of the editor configures, and it would be best if the editor remembered a configuration per program as well as one per person. The per-program configuration would be nice if comments at the end of the program configured the abbreviation/misspelling changes to correct spellings. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover, compilers that enforce any kind of spelling rule annoy me. The compiler should not be a spelling enforcer. Programmers, their managers, and program managers should be able to select spelling standards. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, do in Rome as the Romans is OK to a point. However, if the current spelling conventions are causing problems, it is time for <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a>.

        There are many opinions here about which naming form is more readable. Unfortunately, there isn't any data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Someone should put a test on the net with pages to read containing various name styles <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>, with_underscores, Lisp-like, English like, etc. One name style per URL page, basically the same text on all pages, about 250 words. It's probably best to present the pages in random order per person taking the tests, since all will contain basically the same 250 words.
      </p>
      <p>
        There should be a few buttons to push on each page, like a combination lock, that if pushed in the correct sequence cause the reading speed for a page to be recorded in a database. Instructions on which button to push should be located in the text at different locations. For example, "Now is the time for all good men to come to the aid of their country. Now it is time to press three. The love of my life...."
      </p>
      <p>
        A different button combination for each page that contains a different naming style. It's not much security, but a little.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each reader pushes a button to start a timer, begins reading, ... finishes reading, and presses a button to stop the timer.
      </p>
      <p>
        The test would collect the reading speeds and publish the data. It isn't a controlled study, but like c2.com/wiki, people will be honest, mostly.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would do it if I could. Always worked mainframes and minis. Don't have the right skills to do this one.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps there is an easier way to collect the data, anyone else have any ideas? -- <a href="EdwinEarlRoss.html">EdwinEarlRoss</a>

        PS: I made an emacs program to display three different versions of the same text, English, <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>, with underscores, and again English. It gives the reading time for each one. For me <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> is not as quick to read as English, which surprised me, and with underscore is about as quick to read as English. -- <a href="EdwinEarlRoss.html">EdwinEarlRoss</a>

        <em>This makes sense to me; spacing is significant to delineate words, and most words you encounter in reading are lowercase.</em>

        <em>The serious psychologist's way of testing this would be to calibrate reading speed against memorability (e.g. read a list of phrases, then do a quiz on whether certain phrases appeared or not.)
