        Bliss The Lance Young Movie
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bliss shows how barriers to intimacy created in childhood can persist well into adulthood and what it takes to bring these down. Very rare as it deals with sexuality in a mature and tender way that is unfortunately almost never seen in popular American culture, or popular culture anywhere.
