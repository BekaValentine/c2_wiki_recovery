        Wiki Replacing Mailing Lists
      </h1>
      <p>
        Has anyone used a Wiki successfully as a replacement for a mailing list?
      </p>
      <p>
        At Perforce, we recently installed a Wiki. I had the Wiki in mind as a replacement for some of our mailing lists. Today I had a discussion with someone else at Perforce who made the claim that Wikis are best for collaborative documents, and that they wouldn't be particularly useful for discussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        I went out in search of information on this, and found an interesting quote from Ward <a href="InFavorOfDissertation.html">InFavorOfDissertation</a>. Ward says
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>I have done my best to discourage dialog <a href="InFavorOfDissertation.html">InFavorOfDissertation</a> which offers a better fit to this medium. I've been overruled.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        which would seem to indicate that Ward sided with my friend originally, but that the usage (on this Wiki, anyway) moved toward discussion. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So can discussion on a Wiki actually replace discussion on a mailing list? What are the pros and cons? Is email notification of changed pages necessary for this to work?

        Many Open Source-projects seem to have <strong>both</strong> mailing lists and Wikis, even though they have discussions on the Wikis. Maybe a Wiki should be seen as a complement to a list instead of a replacement.

        <em>That's very true -- even PHPWiki (the Wiki we're playing with at Perforce) has a mailing list, and some of the discussion happens on the Wiki, and some on the mailing list.</em>

        <em>So how do you decide whether to post a particular thought on the Wiki or on the mailing list?</em> -- <a href="RobertOrenstein.html">RobertOrenstein</a>

        Another issue is the centralization of the information - a wiki can be lobotomized by the loss of one server, while a mailing list will have many copies of the information saved in local mail folders.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mail also gives the user many options for filtering and sorting. It naturally organizes itself into a work-queue, while a wiki doesn't have a beginning or end.

        I think it is possible that WikiReplacingFaqs is more likely. For instance, both <a href="DocBook.html">DocBook</a> wiki and Dive Into <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> wiki are both utilized as a repository of knowledge. Rather than updating the FAQ, you change the wiki. Mailing Lists are great for meeting announcements, "Hey I found this great resource" messages, and threaded discussion. Wiki does threads, but I think <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> is its weakest 'feature'. -- <a href="SeanOleary.html">SeanOleary</a> (yes, I realize the irony of signing a message critisizing <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>)
