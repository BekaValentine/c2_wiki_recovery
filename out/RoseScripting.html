        Rose Scripting
      </h1>
      <p>
        Can anyone on Wiki share with me their knowledge of, or point me to a tutorial on, <a href="RationalRose.html">RationalRose</a> scripting? I'm being required to use Rose to document some components, but havent been given a licence for reverse engineering, so would like to automate the production of the model as much as possible.
      </p>

        I've got some now, thanks Sunna.
