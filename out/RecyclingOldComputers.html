        At one time, if you desired to recycle some of your old computers, thrift shops would not take them as donations. This has changed, since the beginning of a program by Dell and Goodwill Industries.

        Old Equipment, computers, printers, monitors, nearly anything which connects to computers, can be taken to a local collection center set up to receive them. Check with you local or nearby center if this is something you want to do.

        I have taken some equipment and have some more I will take to my local center. It is using the modern "Green" pattern to recycle rather than trash, such items as will have some intrinsic value, or are capable of being recycled. Wikizens who most certainly have accumulated equipment, and have in the past simply discarded or trashed their old obsolete equipment, can now make it of value and help someone else in the process.

        Placed here, not as spam, but as a way we may minimize the harmful effects of landfill pollution.
