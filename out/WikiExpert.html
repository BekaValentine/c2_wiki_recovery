      <p>
        Here's an idea:  make a Web site, like a wiki inasmuch as it can be modified by anyone, but instead of semantic links it has yes/no questions.  Each question is either allowed at any point, a terminal point on the site, or an intermediate question only accessible under certain conditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Users would be able to edit or modify any question's content, like a wiki page, but also decide what previous questions' answers are required for it to be presented.
      </p>
      <p>
        Possible applications:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A search engine of some sort, where the terminal nodes contain links to things.
        </li>
        <li>
           A game of 20 questions.
        </li>
        <li>
           A really specific, picky personals site.
        </li>
        <li>
           An experiment in conversational <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a>, of sorts, watching what happens when humans let the computer dictate the conversation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The reason this page is called <a href="WikiExpert.html">WikiExpert</a> is because this might be a neat way to make a general-purpose ExpertSystem.
