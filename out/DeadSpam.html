        Dead Spam
      </h1>
      <p>
        A service provided <em>pro bono</em> (that means free, folks! - although small donations to running costs are welcome) by <a href="JonGreen.html">JonGreen</a> to the Usenet community.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you apply for a <a href="DeadSpam.html">DeadSpam</a> email address to put in your Usenet headers, you also provide a subject line and message contents. Spammers get an automatic response containing those things; you get nothing sent to the address. Blessed peace!
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically, the message contains a rejoinder to look at the .sig in the sender's Usenet postings, for tips on how to mail them for real. Of course, spammers who've bought a-million-email-addresses CDs won't know how; real people will. Strangely, many of the messages also include personal wishes for spammers. A few of them are even polite...;)

        <strong>[Update 2002/10/14] The </strong><a href="DeadSpam.html">DeadSpam</a> service is temporarily not accepting new registrations, whilst I get the Web site rewritten, and recover what I can of the last design from a hard disk head crash.  I thought head crashes were a thing of the past ... *sigh*<strong></strong>

        <strong>Check back to the Web site (URL above) every now and then to see when it's back.  I'll try to remember to update here when that's done, but apologies if I don't!  I'm hoping to get the first cut of the redesign done by the end of October 2002.  -- JSG</strong>

        Q1 [Anonymous]: What happens if the from address is actually faked, as is usual with spam?
      </p>
      <p>
        A1 [<a href="JonGreen.html">JonGreen</a>]: It's a valid comment, and there's not a lot I can do about that, unfortunately.  I discourage <a href="DeadSpam.html">DeadSpam</a> users from having personally abusive auto-responders for two reasons: (1) if someone "real" accidentally mailed a <a href="DeadSpam.html">DeadSpam</a> user's address in good faith, they're not going to feel good about getting a torrent of abuse in return; (2) because of the problem of spammers spoofing "From:" and "Reply-to:" addresses, if someone "real", being victimised by a spammer, gets a flood of complaint mail, at least the stuff auto-replied from <a href="DeadSpam.html">DeadSpam</a> users won't be as stressful as some of the flamage they'll get from others.  The default reply message, which most <a href="DeadSpam.html">DeadSpam</a> users use, is polite to "real" people and fairly damning to spammers.

        Q2 [Anonymous]: Nasty Cynical me....
      </p>
      <p>
        How do i know it not been set up by someone who is convinced that I wish to view Ms Spears medical records? 
      </p>
      <p>
        A2.1 [<a href="PaulHudson.html">PaulHudson</a>]: Well, I've worked with <a href="JonGreen.html">JonGreen</a> in the past, and he's straight up. He can be trusted on this one -- <a href="PaulHudson.html">PaulHudson</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        A2.2 [<a href="JonGreen.html">JonGreen</a>]: Thanks, Paul.  In reply to the question: I guess that's a bit hard to prove definitively.  What I will say is that I'm pretty active in the Net community, and reasonably well known, at least in some places.  I'm visible and contactable.  That's not the mark of a spammer, nor of someone who gathers addresses for spammers.  I do wonder what a spammer would want with addresses of people who are prepared to go to considerable lengths to <em>avoid</em> the stuff and punish its purveyors.  Talk about making a rod for your own back!
      </p>
      <p>
        A2.3 [<a href="AndyMorris.html">AndyMorris</a>]: Well I took you on trust, have a dead spam address and have had no problems, so I can reassure anyone who is as cynical as me that its ok. Briliant service many thanks. <a href="AndyMorris.html">AndyMorris</a>@DeadSpam.com

        Q3 [Anonymous] <a href="WhatHappened.html">WhatHappened</a> since last update two years ago? Still relevant? Oct04
      </p>
      <p>
        A3 [<a href="JonGreen.html">JonGreen</a>] It's gone stale.  I've simply not had enough <a href="CopiousFreeTime.html">CopiousFreeTime</a> to keep it maintained.  It may return sometime in the future, but don't hold your breath.  Existing "customers" are still getting service, of course.
