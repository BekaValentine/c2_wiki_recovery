        Patterns Are Accepted
      </h1>
      <p>
        Thankfully, patterns are out of the wow and accepted as part of the programming toolset. -- RodneyRyan

        Unfortunately, patterns are often overused. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hogwash.  Other than the well-written and insightful articles by </em><a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a> on the overuse of specific "popular" patterns in certain instances (namely Command), please provide any examples where patterns have been used too much.  I instead find with ENORMOUS frequency instances where people say that they are using patterns, but in fact are not.  Facade is my favorite example of this, as I see people stating that they are employing the <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a> but in fact have no framework or subsystem underneath the putative Facade object... --<a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a><em></em>

        You are right, I wanted to say what you have said. <em>I instead find with ENORMOUS frequency instances where people say that they are using patterns, but in fact are not.</em> Also, patterns are often used inappropriately, in contexts where they are not needed. E.g. using of the <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> instead of better class hierarchy.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh, yes -- been there, done that one.  Not particularly on Visitor, but I often see patterns used outside of the context where they are needed.  My favorite is Strategies with only a single Strategy... Here the principle of </em><a href="YouArentGoingToNeedIt.html">YouArentGoingToNeedIt</a> often applies. --<a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps, people who use patterns in this way do not adhere to the <a href="OoDesignPrinciples.html">OoDesignPrinciples</a> and the <a href="YouArentGoingToNeedIt.html">YouArentGoingToNeedIt</a> principle and do not strive for the <a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a>.
