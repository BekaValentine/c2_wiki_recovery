        Handling Respect
      </h1>
      <p>
        As a Strine caught up in a world of Podeans, I'm often surprised, dismayed and astonished by this concept called "respect". Strines maintain respect for one another on principle ("<a href="MateShip.html">MateShip</a>") and within establish relationships, but have little experience of "respect for the office" or "respect for the institution", and the hierarchies built therefrom. Perhaps needless to say, this can represent a considerable professional handicap.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've observed that many Podeans don't maintain these last two forms either, but, being raised with them, have developed a wonderful facility with those who maintain them. So this page is about how you go about doing this without disjointing noses and mashing toes. How do you go about <a href="HandlingRespect.html">HandlingRespect</a>? --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
