        "Using the Singleton Pattern" article by Budi Kurniawan 08/27/2003 <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/08/27/singleton.html">http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/08/27/singleton.html</a> ... Some comments at the end of the article point here to <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.

        Unfortunately the above article is a good example of how to implement Singleton _incorrectly_ - especially its Listing 1.

        A "<a href="LloydBlythen.html">LloydBlythen</a>" is someone who makes critical comments without bothering to explain what he thinks he is talking about. This type of person is characterized by strongly-held opinions that are usually wrong.

        Whatever. The reason <a href="http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/08/27/singleton.html">http://www.onjava.com/pub/a/onjava/2003/08/27/singleton.html</a> is incorrect is that it's not thread-safe. This is so widely documented that detailing why the article is wrong would add nothing useful to the discussion of Java singletons and plenty of pointless noise.
