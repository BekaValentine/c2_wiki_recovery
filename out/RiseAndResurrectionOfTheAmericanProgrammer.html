        Interesting, but scrappy.

        More like pathetic. Theme of book: "Remember what I said in <a href="DeclineAndFallOfTheAmericanProgrammer.html">DeclineAndFallOfTheAmericanProgrammer</a>? Well, never mind."

        Latest EY flip flop. After appearing on TV saying that he was moving out to the desert for Y2K, he wrote an article for IEEE Software ( or was it IEEE Computer ) saying that the overexurberance of Y2K prognosticators should not be used to
        play down the real problems revealed by Y2K.

        I think Ed has lost it personally. It seems that many of the great names lose it over time. Perhaps that is inevitable for those who philosophise on the industry.

        <em>I don't know.  He wrote </em><a href="DeathMarch.html">DeathMarch</a> after Rise And Resurrection, and I thought it was a reasonably astute commentary on the state of <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a> at the time it was written.  --<a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a><em></em>

        Reminiscent of one of <a href="ClarkesLaw.html">ClarkesLaw</a>s,<em>When a great scientist says that something is possible, he very probably is right.  If he says something is impossible, he's almost certainly wrong."</em>

        Halfway through reading it now, I'm still waiting for the "rise and resurrection" part.  But in endorsing "Good Enough" software, is <a href="EdwardYourdon.html">EdwardYourdon</a> actually singing the praises of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>? That would seem to be similar to his idea of exposing best practices from the bottom of the organization. It's hard to tell, I'll let you know when I finish the book.  --<a href="MarkSchumann.html">MarkSchumann</a>

        It seems the trend is toward overseas outsourcing again, something he apparently predicted wouldn't happen much. Perhaps it is cyclical.

        The way I understood it, Edward Yourdon didn't predict it wouldn't happen much, he predicted that in the long term US-based programmers would still have the edge due to more modern (dare I say "agile"?) tools.  I wasn't convinced; it's not as though only Americans can use <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>.  --<a href="MarkSchumann.html">MarkSchumann</a>, after having finished the book
