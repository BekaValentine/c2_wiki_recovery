        Dueling Credentials
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s, and a relative of both <a href="AdVerecundiam.html">AdVerecundiam</a> (argument by authority) and <a href="IdontSufferFoolsLikeYou.html">IdontSufferFoolsLikeYou</a>. In this particular fallacy, rather than referring to an allegedly-expert third party, the speaker proclaims <em>him/herself</em> an expert, and insists that therefore he/she has the final say on all matters pertaining to the subject at hand (and thus wins the argument by default).
      </p>
      <p>
        Credentials (degrees earned, a C.V., etc.) to support these claims of expertise may or may not be produced. Sometimes the claim of expertise is replaced by a claim of superior intelligence - a refined form of "I'm smarter than you, nyah nyah".
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes, <em>two</em> parties to an argument will <em>both</em> proclaim themselves experts - and the argument quickly shifts from the topic at hand to a debate on who has the claim to <em>greater</em> expertise (under the assumption that this person will then automatically win the original argument).

      <code>
        A: I've got a master's degree in <foo><br/>
        B: Well, I've got a Ph. D!<br/>
        A: But I've got 20 years of industry experience in <foo><br/>
        B: My Ph. D is from <a href="CalTech.html">CalTech</a><br/>
        A: I submitted a paper on <foo> to the Twenty-Eighth Annual Conference of the <br/>
        Association for <foo>, which was published in the proceedings!<br/>
        B: I was the <em>chairman</em> of that conference.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And so forth. Which sounds rather silly coming from supposed-professionals.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DuelingCredentials.html">DuelingCredentials</a> is a fallacy for the same reason that <a href="AdVerecundiam.html">AdVerecundiam</a> is a fallacy - being an expert doesn't make you right on all issues. In many fields of study, the only proper way to settle a question is through formal, verifiable research - experiments, theorems and their proofs. Conjecture, even from a Ph. D, is still that - conjecture.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, an expert is more likely to be right on a given topic than a complete layman - if a carpenter argues with a plumber on the correct way to amputate a leg, my money rides on the physician (no matter how handy the carpenter may be with a saw). And if an expert is debating someone who has no clue on the subject (but persists in asserting that <a href="EveryoneHasHisOpinion.html">EveryoneHasHisOpinion</a>), pulling rank may be useful.  (Unfortunately, some folks are sufficiently narrow-minded that they consider anyone who disagrees with them a layperson by definition).
      </p>
      <p>
        But in a technical community where most of the participants are familiar with the subject matter at hand (even if not at a Ph.D. level), side-arguments about whose rose smells sweetest are seldom productive. A true expert should be able to win the argument against a (reasonable) non-expert in any case by virtue of logic and reasoning, without resorting to <a href="DuelingCredentials.html">DuelingCredentials</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="DuelingCredentials.html">DuelingCredentials</a> is an anti-pattern that demonstrates that "credibility" for both sides gets affected by prolonged focus on "credentials".<em></em>
