        Data And Code Are The Same Thing
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Code is data, data code,â€”that is all Ye know on earth, and all ye need to know.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Trying to summarize, <a href="DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing.html">DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing</a> can mean at least the following:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Data and code have internally the same representation (most microprocessors, Lisp (in a way))
        </li>
        <li>
           Data can be used as code (sublanguages, domain specific languages) and code can be used as data (encoding booleans, numbers, lists etc. as functions, replacing data structures with behavioural objects)
        </li>
        <li>
           Whether something (a structure, byte stream, whatever) is code or data is metadata: the something itself does not constrain this (codeness is in the eye of the beholder)
        </li>
        <li>
           It's impossible to give a definition that would reliably and uncontroversially distinguish code from data. Think about an interpreter: it takes two inputs, the "code" and the "input", and produces one output. Now, what are the criteria which tell code from input data? Not all interpreters are even for <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a> languages. <em>And if the "code" itself is an interpreter...</em>
        </li>
      </ul>

        Data and code are the same thing to a "stored program digital computer." Other systems may make a distinction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Most of the arguments below are unnecessary due to (unknowingly) being about terminology issues. Philosophically and mathematically it has long been known that it is hard to pin down what "same thing" means without being extremely careful about laying a formal groundwork, which is why you hear the word "isomorphic" so often instead of "identical". The term "isomorphic" can be used rigorously, and often is. The term "identical" on the other hand is almost never used rigorously, and hence generates controversy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is uncontroversial to say instead that </em>DataAndCodeAreIsomorphic and that "in some contexts, such as in a Lisp macro or a cpu simulator, something previously treated as data may reasonably be treated as code (or vice versa)."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, you are going to do nothing but spin your wheels and generate flame wars if you argue about what "is" and "same" means.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>See the philosophical and mathematical history of what "identical" means if you have an interest in such things; it is vast.</em>

      <p>
        And it depends on what kind of "isomorphism" you mean, "isomorphic" should be viewed only slightly less controversial than "same thing" and other stuff. For example you can draw an isomorphism from Haskell programs to TM programs, but you can't say that TM programs and Haskell programs are the same thing. From the perspective of a programmer there's a hell of a difference between Haskell and TM. The same can be said about data and code, yes you can encode booleans, natural numbers, tuples, relations and everything else as lambda calculus abstractions, but it ain't sweet. There's a world of difference rather than "the same thing".

        The issues have been described and formalized in the seminal paper "On the Expressive Power of Programming Languages" (<a href="http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/felleisen90expressive.html)">http://citeseer.nj.nec.com/felleisen90expressive.html)</a> by Mathias Felleissen.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Expressive Power corresponds well to the mathematical notion of "homeomorphism" - i.e. a small change in the source program must have a corresponding small change in the target program. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The conclusion should be that <a href="DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing.html">DataAndCodeAreTheSameThing</a> not when they are "isomorphic" (whatever, if anything at all, isomorphism means in this context ), but when the formal languages used for describing data like for example the relational model and formalism used for code, like Haskell or Lisp, <strong>have the same expressive power</strong>. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the one hand, part of that makes some good points, but on the other hand, I'm not sure you understood me entirely. "Isomorphic" is sometimes used loosely, but it has a very exact technical meaning: identical </em>'in regard to<em>' a particular formal relationship or operation. This improves on simply saying "identical" by explicitly requiring the relevant relationship to be stated. So for instance I could say "data representing Z80 instructions is isomorphic to code under the operation of Z80 simulation", and that would be precise and uncontroversial. Whereas if I don't mention the operation/relation (and it is not unambiguously understood to be implied), then "isomorphism" is not being used technically.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So for you to say "whatever, if anything at all, isomorphism means in this context" seems to mean that either I wasn't clear enough about the context, or that you hadn't heard the technical definition before. Once one establishes clearly enough what isomorphism means in a context, then one is doing mathematics, not random opinion. See </em><a href="CategoryTheory.html">CategoryTheory</a> for the broadest treatment.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Isomorphism" is loose because you specify the objects (for example Haskell and TM code), you loosely specify a relation, but in fact you don't specify an algebra/universe/category for which the isomorphism is defined. For example Z and Q are "isomorphic as sets" but Z is not a field, and they are not isomorphic as rings (anneaux). Now when you say "code is isomorphic with data", you don't specify what "algebraic universe" (is it universal algebra, sets, any specific category, some kind of other formalism) that the data lives in and the code lives in. You most likely specify an <strong>encoding</strong>. You can encode "code" as data (obviously) and you can encode data as executable code: 
      </p>
      <code>
        (define _true (lambda (x y) x))<br/>
        (define _false (lambda (x y) y))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        with the operations:
      </p>
      <code>
        (define not (lambda (x) ( x _false _true)))<br/>
        (define and (lambda (x y) (x (y _true _false) _false)))<br/>
        (define or (lambda (x y) (x _true (y _true _false) )))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Just like you can "encode" a rational number as an integer number. But the above defines an "encoding" not a morphism, because the true/false boolean algebra is not the same kind of thing as lambda calculus. Similarly we can encode all the "data" there is as lambda abstractions, but that doesn't mean we are talking about morphism, but we are talking of encodings, aka representation, aka realization, aka models. That's why I contend that isomorphism is loosely until you specify a precise formal theory that we talk about in which both data (say all relational constructs over the common basic types) and code (say lambda abstractions) are citizens and you prove them isomorphic. Otherwise there's no concept of isomorphism proper, there's isomorphism of groups, isomorphism of fields, isomorphism of Banach spaces, etc, etc, etc. When people say code and data are "isomorphic", I tend to assume, until proven otherwise, that they are talking loosey-goosey about encoding one into the other and vice-versa, but not about any real isomorphism.

        I do not think there is an answer to the question of data or process having ascendancy. There is no separation of data and process - one process' data is the result of another process' process. -- <a href="PeterLynch.html">PeterLynch</a>

      <p>
        <em>I agree. Data and process cannot be completely distinguished. The separation argument still holds, however. Data is usually more transportable than process. Also, given the OO obsession with typing, which is primarily a data issue, I think it is incorrect to characterize them as behaviour orientated. --RH</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not think the separation argument holds for data any more than it does for comms, or arithmetic calculations or any other thing that produces a result. All processes should be separated according to domain. I think we see data as different because of the history - part of which is SQL. When using SQL to access your data, there is an obvious side-effect benefit of reportability, external control, all sorts of things. So it appears to be a QED - because our separation of data has produced so many benefits, it must be the right way.

        It is common to think of "data" and "code" as being different. "Data" is the input or output of an application, and "code" is the set of instructions that specify what to do with the input. However, in most computer architectures, "code" and "data" are both just "stuff" in memory or on disk, and whether you consider any particular set of "stuff" as code or data is subjective.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a simple example, consider a programming-language compiler. The "input data" to a compiler is what a programmer would consider to be "source code". The "output data" of a compiler is object code. That object code will then be used as the input data for a linker, whose output data is executable code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider also a programming-language interpreter, or a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>, or a CPU. Such an entity executes "code", but that code can be considered to be just a form of input data.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, say you have any program that reads some input set and processes it. You can think of the input as "data", but it is also equally valid to think of the input format as a specialized programming language (that is, as "code"), and to think of your program as an interpreter of that language.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, "data" and "code" are just different ways of looking at the "stuff" that computers process. Treating them differently is often useful, but treating them identically is often useful as well.

        Some of the many distinctions made between program and data are as follows ...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A program is something that <em>does</em>. Data is something that <em>tells</em>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               By this definition, the thing traditionally called "program" in declarative languages is "data", whereas the specification of "goal" is the "code".
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A geographical map is data for us. But the <em>act</em> of traveling is a process, a procedure. <em>But the code in this case would be the directions, rather than the actual process, blurring the distinction</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Whenever my computer tries to execute data instead of code, it tends to lock up or do other horrible things, but whenever it zips up code instead of data, it tends to do equally well. <em>That's because you are using a data format in which all input is valid, such as plain text encoded in ISO 8859-1, not because of any inherent property of the concept of "data". There are programming languages which have no concept of "error" - runtime or otherwise.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           My computer loads data into the data segment and code into the code segment. Data does not execute. <em>How do you JIT, then? And is the code in the code segment formed from data?</em> {Which category does it load <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a> into?}
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Code</em> (algorithms + literals) stays constant in a given scope, and <em>data</em> changes. <em>That's in the feeble languages people use today. If I re-(defun) something in my emacs, its behavior changes.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               But, Big ol' databases are mostly static, with just a tiny percentage change every day, but the programmers keep scuttling over and around the codebase <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> it like little crabs. It changes much faster than the data.'
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A constant value is code to modules using it, and an executable is data to the linker producing it. Often, the code in a system has fewer layers of indirection than the data.
          <ul>
            <li>
               By extension, a single piece of data can produce many different results when handled with different programs. These programs are, in a way, different inputs to the "code" of the single piece of data.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The rate of change can vary fairly widely depending on needs, and thus making distinctions based on rate-of-change is not going to be very useful.
        </li>
        <li>
           If <em>code</em> is in a cache, it never gets dirty, so one never worries about coherency. Cached <em>data</em> needs to be checked for write back.

               <em>Self-modifying code may have fallen so far out of favor that processors almost refuse to do it, but nevertheless it is not a law of the Universe that programs never change. And even the self-modification prohibition only applies at the machine-code level; a fully-factored object system tends to look a lot like a syntax tree in many cases, so at a higher level </em>'any<em>' modification to the "data" is also modifying the "code" the data structure represents.</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Keep in mind that if code runs on a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>, both the user's program (<a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> or whatever) and the user's data are in the data cache; only the <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> itself is in the instruction cache. In other words, this distinction disappears. (A good VM will be small enough to be entirely I-cache resident; however VMs put additional burden on the D-cache).
                </li>
              </ul>

        <li>

        Why not? In "foo = bar + 2", the "2" is part of the code (it's a literal). If I have an algorithm that works on dates, I may have a set of strings for month names, and "February" is no more data than the literal 2 is. (But if I localize that algorithm, so it needs to look up at run time what it should print, then the month names look much more like data. Ditto for "foo = bar + x", where x happens to be bound to 2)

      <p>
        In other computer architectures the question of whether "stuff" (a page of words) is code or data is not subjective but is defined by the memory management hardware and virtual memory system of the OS. Pages of memory can be read-only, read-write or executable. For reasons of performance and security, executable pages are not writable.

      <p>
        The distinction is not true for other things that are called "code" (virtual machine opcodes, interpreted language scripts, emulated execution environments, etc.). Also, it is only true when the "code" is being executed; it is not true when "code" is being generated by compilers or processed by other programs.

      </p>
      <p>
        This could be viewed as code or data. I don't think there is any hard distinction. The program that reads the above essentially acts like a simple interpreter. If this does not convince you, then what if it was formatted as:
      </p>
      <code>
        change(customers,23,fname,"Fred")<br/>
        change(customers,23,lname,"Johnson")<br/>

      <p>
        (The "add" operations are considered done to one record if contiguous. A "no_op" or "commit" should perhaps be added to separate adjacent adds. I don't remember how the actual specimen handled this. See Also: <a href="ChangeLog.html">ChangeLog</a>)

        Yes, there is data, and there is ExecutableData (code). And, actually, even "ordinary" data can be executed - with usually undesirable results - but several years ago I actually made one of my programs execute a portion of the copyright message.
      </p>
      <p>
        It happened that (on the Z80) certain alpha characters were the values of instructions that performed simple register manipulations. Given a seed value, after the "copyright" executed, I could verify that this message had not been tampered with, as the result of seed + opcodes-in-text was known.

      <p>
        It is not so much them being the "same thing", but in using the same techniques or mechanisms to manipulate and manage them. If you have boat-loads of data, you generally gravitate toward a database to handle it all. Now that modern systems have boat-loads of code, ways are needed to manage that also. I say the same tools can be used for code that are used with data (with some minor enhancements). Linear or nested text in a bunch of files and/or classes is not sufficient IMO. That leads to <a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a>-like arrangements, which have properly (IMO) fell out of favor. If they failed for data, then they will probably fail for code to (on a larger scale). Thus, I am a <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a> fan.

        <strong>The Argument for Different</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Data is the plural from the latin <strong>datum</strong>, which literally means a "given", a fact. Therefore data are statements of fact, like in <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>. That's how database theory regards data (and this is regardless of paradigm, be it OO, relational, constraint databases). Now, I really don't understand what you understand by code so that you can claim that it is the same thing as data. Of course everybody can say X==Y at any point in time about anything, and especially in computing. After all, we can reduce/represent/encode anything and everything to some stupid <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>s, where everything is a symbol in an alphabet. But that's irrelevant.

        What we are looking here are formalisms. We have two sets of different mathematical formalisms (ultimately meaning syntax + semantics): we have formalisms for data (let's say <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>) and we have formalisms for code (let's say <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a>). We couldn't care less if both those formalisms can be ultimately reduced to some stupid Turing Machine, if I, as a programmer, don't find TM convenient, the hell with them. What we look for in a formalism is some kind of elegance and abstraction that makes it suitable for humans to reason with and solve particular problems effectively, see <a href="BeautyIsOurBusiness.html">BeautyIsOurBusiness</a>. Therefore to say X==Y because ultimately X can be reduced to Y or the other way around is meaningless. To argue differently is truly immature :)

        I'll grant that there are instances when code can be seen as input (therefore a particular kind of data) to another program. Also known as code transformations. As far as I can tell, the biggest effort is to allow these code transformations to be written using the same formalisms as the code itself. For example the latest Haskell template proposal (see <a href="TemplateHaskell.html">TemplateHaskell</a>) is of course using Haskell to do the transformations (unlike C++ templates for example, which are using , "C+ templates"). That's another argument that data and code are not the same thing, nobody apparently wants to be using a data model to model their code. For example s-expr, are very suitable for representing and manipulating code. However, they're not that great for data, using them for databases would be going back to HierarchicalDatabases (don't even try to start me on XML at this point). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Bottom line is that <strong>NO</strong>, I don't see how data and code being the same thing. They may be the same thing for Tom, but then, who cares. I used different formalisms to put some order in my data, and entirely different formalisms to put some order (if any) in my code. If they were really the same thing, we'd be using the GrandUnifyingTheoryOfEverything in software systems.

        That's a non-argument. Computers are not valuable because they approximate Turing machines, they are valuable because they are effective tools in solving some problems, no more, no less. TM are only valuable as an abstraction vehicle to prove some impossibility results, when it comes to actually solving problems, they are close to useless. Do you have an idea how a qsort will look like in a TM? Again, it's a important decision of choosing your formalism. When was the last time you solved a linear equation using only set theory? How about a differential equation? In theory you can do it, but only in a certain, impractical theory. You can choose a better theory to solve these problems.

Any solution you've built with a computer would have to be built as a physical machine without the computer. A qsort in a TM looks like any qsort I've ever seen because every computer I've ever used has been a Turing machine.

        Keith, it seems to me we are talking at cross-purpose here. We clearly have the same fundamentals in mind, but apparently we interpret it differently. You seem to be making convenience as merely a a side issue. Others see the same convenience as one of the most important aspects in Mathematics. That's why mathematicians keep inventing new formalisms, to make it convenient to solve problems. <strong>Convenient</strong> vs. <strong>inconvenient</strong> is now a fundamental distinction in Mathematics (well, at least according to some well reputed authors like <a href="JeanYvesGirard.html">JeanYvesGirard</a> and <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a>, I know there are divergent opinions). Take for example <a href="JeanYvesGirard.html">JeanYvesGirard</a> <a href="LinearLogic.html">LinearLogic</a>: as he himself puts it, everything is expressible in classic logic already, however he invented <a href="LinearLogic.html">LinearLogic</a> and it became one of the fundamental formalisms in <a href="ComputingScience.html">ComputingScience</a>, because it makes reasoning of a certain class of problems easier. It abstracts away unnecessary nitty-gritty details needed to encode that class of problems in classic logic, and those nitty-gritties are enough to make our human reasoning on those problems simply unmanageable. Or take for example relational calculus: it is subsumed from your perspective by TM or <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a>. Try to create databases in terms of lambda abstractions, and you'll be suddenly lost. 
      </p>

        It doesn't matter that "in theory" you <em>could</em> do it, that "in theory" has become a secondary aspect in modern mathematics. The quality of "how" you do it is essential.

I can't interpret what's being said about code and data being distinct in any way other than that the distinction is inherent, inescapable and essential.

      <p>
        For people like me a practical distinction is an essential distinction. Whatever makes a difference between solving a problem and not solving it is essential. To "look" on my tuples and relations through the colored glasses of <a href="ObjectOrientation.html">ObjectOrientation</a> (or pure <a href="LambdaCalculus.html">LambdaCalculus</a> to be less offensive) is exactly the kind of "utilitarian", "non-essential" distinction that will send my project over budget.
      </p>
      <p>
        If it serves me no good purpose to do arithmetic or relational calculus or differential equations in pure lambda calculus, then that's enough essentiality for me: I do arithmetic in decimal notation with +, -, *, /, % and all kinds of non-essential symbols. It works kind of nice and it feels much better than pure lambda calculus, and I won't loose a minute sleep over this.

Who gives a damn if you can represent both code and data using the same abstraction (let's say pure lambda calculus) and make them the same thing? You'll have to pay dearly for this exercise.

        Determining whether an item is data or code depends upon the context being discussed. That said, saying an item is data in one context and saying the item is code in another context does not imply that the item is data and code in either context. It would be correct to say that an executable program is data resulting from a linker in the context of a code build, but it is not code within this context. When the program is executed, it is code in this context and not data. Code is responsible for the transformation of data, and one needs to look at the context to determine whether a particular item is doing the transformation or is being transformed.

Evidence that "side effects" has found an exception to this rule has not been presented. Thus, the rule stands. Whether "process" is code or data is perhaps outside the scope of this discussion.

        Also, any sequence of info or commands can be viewed as a predicate. For example, in "print(string_X);", "print" can be viewed as part of the predicate just as string_X is part of it. (This may resemble the <a href="ProLog.html">ProLog</a> kind of view.) It is true that some have immediate actions and some may not, but that is a matter of degree. Maybe your computer will ask you to select a printer (driver) or prompt for page range before printing. This is merely because one predicate may trigger another. Thus <strong>immediacy</strong> does not appear to be a fully distinguishing attribute. Maybe the concept of immediacy can be worked into a new definition somehow in order to destinqish, but I am skeptical. I will agree that "print" is more "immediate" than hourly rate (above example), but again it's a matter of degree.

        I am also not clear on why you present managing communication versus managing data as a key issue. They may not be mutually exclusive anyhow. Are you saying that commands are communication but data is not? The outcome of a program may not really depend on or care about whether it got it's input from data or communication. The same inputs would normally result in the same output regardless of the delivery mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>{I'm talking about actual communication, actual process, actual behavior.  You seem to think that a command to perform communication is the same as actual communication.

        I would argue that CodeIsMetadata: data *about* data that suggests (with varying degrees of absoluteness) how a processing system can infer new values from given ones. And of course, MetadataIsData. We have a number of semi-standardised approaches to describing such metadata, some of which have standardised 'coding languages' which imply certain standardised 'machines' or 'workflows' or 'evaluation strategies'. C++, Lisp, XSLT and Prolog are all 'coding languages' and some of them are more readily recognised as 'code' vs 'data' to the human eye. But the question of whether *in a given context* a piece of information is 'data' or 'metadata' (and hence 'code') is entirely a matter of position in a system - is it 'inside the processing box' or 'outside' it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Code that produces communications or initiates activity rather than produces new values wouldn't qualify so well under your logic above.  And it is certainly not the case that all metadata is code.  I.e. if I know that I know 21 ways to skin a cat, that isn't code.  In any case, could you please be careful to avoid confusing 'value' with 'information' or 'data'?  Values aren't information without context.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In my view, processes (communications and activity) are merely stuctured *temporal* patterns of information, while what we often think about as 'data structures' are structured *spatial* (for want of a better term) patterns. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Data can be represented as a signal in time, space, or both (as per the proverbial laser bouncing between Earth and Mars).  Not all signals, however, need to represent data.  The computational view of 'time' is simply a partial-ordering of signals (potentially, but not necessarily, including signals from a clock or a physical object).  Interestingly, this computational view of time seems to be perfectly consistent with the current (relativistic) understanding of time we possess through physics, and when combined with the often strange and unintuitive 'observation' properties in the quantum model has led several intelligent and open-minded scientists to the conclusion </em>information<em> - the bit or something close to it - might be the most primitive thing in this universe, even more primitive than atoms or strings or matter or light. (There was a </em><a href="SciAm.html">SciAm</a> dedicated to this, but I can't remember which.)<em>  </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That said, while verbs constitute patterns of percept or action over the temporal dimension (e.g. riding a bicycle), processes themselves don't need to carry structured information or anything meaningful to us.  Your view ought to account also for processes that essentially produce white noise.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The spatial or temporal element is not actually that important: both of these can be produced from what we think of as 'algorithms' or 'data': for example, the Mandelbrot Set is a spatial pattern that can be produced from an algorithm, and an audio file playback exists as an experience in time, but can be represented as a block of frequency/amplitude values. And there is much crossover between the two: a sufficiently compressed 'data file' itself resembles an algorithm. Loops and recursion and tests/conditionals can be viewed as means of removing redundant data items from a description of a sequential process, an interaction, or a decision tree. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The compression structures we tend to consider 'code' tend to describe potentially infinitely-sized, recursive and conditional patterns, but that doesn't make them any the less 'data' unless we choose to arbitrarily limit our view of data to the finite. This is most obvious in lazy functional languages like <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> which allow the definition of infinite and recursive *data structures*. Even two Lisp lists that share internal structure have blurred the distinction between code and data; a Lisp circular list even more so (recursion but no conditional). Whether you view a structured pattern of information as a 'process', an 'interaction', or a 'memory' depends on what *perspective* or context we examine it from. And if we choose to describe or annotate that context in a machine-processable structure itself, that's metadata.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Code itself cannot constitute a whole description of any particular thing or data when its behavior relies upon runtime percept or signals.  If you limit yourself to purely functional code, I'd agree that it can readily be utilized to represent infinite data.  Once communications are involved, the code itself can possibly represent how to acquire data, but could possibly represent any number of other actions that possess no particular meaning and describe or acquire no information.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these ideas are developed further in JGerardWolff's <a href="ComputingAsCompression.html">ComputingAsCompression</a> research. Others in <a href="TedNelson.html">TedNelson</a>'s <a href="XanaduProject.html">XanaduProject</a> and his concept of HyperStructure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I think this is important is that I think increasingly in a parallel, web-distributed world we need to move away from visualising data processing as constructing 'sequences of operations' (the traditional idea of programs or 'code') and toward storing, retrieving, and inferring new values from marked-up pieces of data - moving toward an information architecture or knowledge management point of view. It's the data that is the reason why we have computers, after all.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think video games and pr0n are the reasons most humans have computers.  But information management and analysis are important too.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you liked, you could say that 'code' (in the sense often used by programmers as opposed to librarians or information architects) usually implies one particular, fairly narrow, sense of metadata - a sense that tends to orient toward clustering data into hierarchical 'types' or 'classes' and defining sequential, often stateful, operations (functions or methods) on that data. Neither of which are necessarily the only possible or even best ways of thinking about how to 'infer new values', and a narrow focus on these as the only forms of 'coding' is going to be increasingly unhelpful in the future world of massive parallelisation and personal data remix.
