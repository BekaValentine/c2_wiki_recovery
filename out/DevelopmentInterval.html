        Development Interval
      </h1>
      <p>
        It is extremely important to think of your development efforts as discrete, incremental efforts.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a short project, you need to clearly define the start and stop points so you can drive for completion and success.
      </p>
      <p>
        On a long project, you need to define incremental, interim deliveries that are implementations of real working software. By forcing implementation, you learn a lot about the team, about the tools, about your design, and about your users. You give yourself a nice, clean, formal opportunity to change personnel, change tools, change approach, etc. You feed this learning into the planning and execution of your next interval.

        A standard <a href="DoIt.html">DoIt</a> <a href="DevelopmentInterval.html">DevelopmentInterval</a> is 4 people, 8 weeks.

        I believe it significantly helps in estimating projects to have a "standard unit" like this to work from.

        The best graphical illustration I've seen for why this is important is <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>'s <a href="ValidationVee.html">ValidationVee</a>. -- <a href="BillBarnett.html">BillBarnett</a>
