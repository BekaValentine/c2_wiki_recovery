        Risc Vs Cisc
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page is referenced from the <a href="PowerPc.html">PowerPc</a> page - it might be worth making some general points and moving some of that discussion here. Some of it probably belongs here rather than there anyway, and I suspect this page is worth something by itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps simply some references to get started?

        Besides, is it not the case that the Pentium IV chip is comprised of several ARM cores and a "skin"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>RISC is having the ARM core. CISC is having multiple ARM cores and a load of frontend hardware to turn them into one logical processor with its own non-ARM ISA.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is over-simplification to the point of nonsense. SPARC and PowerPC are both RISC architectures.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Then maybe SPARC and PowerPC aren't RISC anymore, despite what the earilest versions of the architectures were. But see the final line of this comment, below.)

        <em>That is, assuming RISC and CISC mean anything anymore.</em>

        Many <a href="FpgaCpu.html">FpgaCpu</a>s are RISC, to make them small enough to fit on the FPGA.
