        What have you liked and not liked about previous XPAU and ADC conferences?  Or any other conferences you've attended?  Chip in your ideas on how we local folks might help make Agile United a great experience for all concerned.

        I particularly liked these things at ADC and XPAU this year:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I like the icebreaker at ADC, and I like the fun things they do at their finale banquet, like the silly awards.
        </li>
        <li>
           I like the activities to raise money for charity at XPAU.
        </li>
        <li>
           I liked them getting the Calgary Chamber of Commerce to do the ceremony giving cowboy hats to the keynote speakers.  Does anyone have a contact with our C of C, the Mayor's office, or whatever organization might help with something like that?
        </li>
        <li>
           I like the Open Space at XPAU much better, but this year I thought the rooms were not as inviting to casual passersby, and didn't encourage people to wander in, see if a session interested them, and wander on if it didn't.  
        </li>
        <li>
           I liked the conference committee wearing the cowboy hats so you could easily find someone if you had a question.  I don't think we should copy the Western theme, but we should make volunteers and organizers easily identifiable.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The live band at XPAU in Calgary was an awesome concept.  There are a lot of musicians in the crowd and we got to see the likes of <a href="CraigLarman.html">CraigLarman</a>, <a href="UncleBob.html">UncleBob</a>, <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>, <a href="JbRainsberger.html">JbRainsberger</a> and <a href="JohnGoodsen.html">JohnGoodsen</a> get up and play some live music - John was talking about having a jam session room at the conference next year where we can go anytime during the conference and play some music with other musicians.
