        Conventional Economics Doesnt Apply Here
      </h1>
      <p>
        Economics was developed to deal with atoms, not bits (paraphrased from <a href="NicholasNegroponte.html">NicholasNegroponte</a>). Some very fundamental assumptions present in what people think of as "economic laws" simply don't apply here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Limited Resources: <a href="NetworkExternalities.html">NetworkExternalities</a> work the opposite way. Example: The more people use the internet, the more it is worth to any of them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Variable cost for another copy (or 10, or 100000) of a piece of software: practically zero.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cost of Transportation: With bits, there virtually isn't any.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Moore's Law: The price/performance improvement regarding chips is so strong and predictable that it causes economic effects of its own.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The inapplicability of "conventional economics" to these issues is often
        overstated.  People who are really interested in this kind of thing might
        look at: <a href="http://www.stern.nyu.edu/networks/site.html">http://www.stern.nyu.edu/networks/site.html</a>  (warning--although this
        site has lots of useful information, it also has really annoying animated
        icons and sound effects, so be prepared!) --<a href="MatthewWilbert.html">MatthewWilbert</a>
