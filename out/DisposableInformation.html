        Disposable Information
      </h1>
      <p>
        Disposable Information has two complementary meanings:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Information is available and you can use it here and now, e.g. tomorrow's weather forecast.
        </li>
        <li>
           Information has to be thrown away when obsolete, e.g. yesterday's weather forecast.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        However, while yesterday's forecast is not today's forecast, it is an input to today's forecast, so the information is not really disposed of.

        Disposable information is a form of <a href="RealInformation.html">RealInformation</a> because it includes context, ironically, it is the context which is ephemeral and which results in the disposal of the information. -- <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
