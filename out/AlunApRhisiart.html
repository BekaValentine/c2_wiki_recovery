        While writing about Smalltalk, you mentioned <em>it [Python] had libraries, particularly mature(ish) GUI libraries, that Ruby doesn't have</em> I'm curious about your impressions of the FxRuby version of the fox toolkit.  nb  I have nothing against Python, I've just recently started using FXRuby and was curious what others thought of it.
