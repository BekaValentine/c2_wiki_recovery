        Extreme Dim Sum
      </h1>
      <p>
        The best way to celebrate a milestone of an <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> project, conclude an XP course, bootcamp, or any other XP event is to have an <a href="ExtremeDimSum.html">ExtremeDimSum</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To have <a href="ExtremeDimSum.html">ExtremeDimSum</a>, find a Chinese restaurant that has DimSum for lunch. Make reservations for N + 1 people, where N is your team size (includes customers and project manager/funder).  Ask for a round table with a lazy Susan. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Food is collectively shared, but only one person orders. Ordinarily this person is <a href="HakanErdogmus.html">HakanErdogmus</a>. In his absence, the coach or the next wisest person in the team orders. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Project manager/funder can eat, but cannot order.
        </li>
        <li>
           Customers and the project manager/funder split the tab. If this is a course, coaches/trainers pay :-) (New Rule)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I like it.  Instructors should provide a meal during </em>ExtremeGraduation ceremonies!  -- <a href="RobMyers.html">RobMyers</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Always conclude an <a href="ExtremeDimSum.html">ExtremeDimSum</a> with deep-fried sesame balls stuffed with lotus paste. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't consume the fortune cookies on the spot. Take them with you. You'll need them for the next iteration. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Team members who has an MSG allergy or who require kosher food are exempt; vegetarians (and people who don't eat pork) can be accommodated.
        </li>
        <li>
           Always order Chinese broccoli with garlic and ginger (anybody knows the Mandarin name?) in ample quantities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a> knows.  Ask him.  It's rather amusing to hear (and watch) him speak Mandarin.  -- <a href="RobMyers.html">RobMyers</a><em> </em>

        <em>The cantonese for Chinese broccoli is "gailan".  Of course, the dim sum here in </em><a href="PortlandOregon.html">PortlandOregon</a> is nowhere near as good as Toronto.

        Why the extra reservation? Seems to me like <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>? -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>

        Touche! I swear I had a reason, which I thought was a pretty good one at the time! But if I can't remember it now, it can't be that important, so YAGNI might as well apply. -- <a href="HakanErdogmus.html">HakanErdogmus</a>
