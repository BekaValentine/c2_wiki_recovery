        The privates and corporals in an <a href="ArmyOfProgrammers.html">ArmyOfProgrammers</a>; what the vast majority of programmers start out as, and what many remain throughout their careers.

        The typical enlistee coder knows a single programming language (historically, this was most often COBOL or some Basic dialect; more recently, <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> are common), has little or no formal training and limited experience, and is unfamiliar with even the most basic existing algorithms or idioms. While some <a href="EnlisteeCoders.html">EnlisteeCoders</a> are quite talented, most are <a href="LessAbleProgrammer.html">LessAbleProgrammer</a>s who have no interest in programming beyond their next paycheck. Even the best generally start out as semi-skilled labor, and are treated as such by management.

        <em>I suppose. However, just as in the military, incompetent cadets are more common than competent ones, and the rare maverick who rises up through the ranks is often better than a 'genius' who is fresh out of the Academy. - </em><a href="JayOsako.html">JayOsako</a>, who doesn't really know anything about the military from personal experience<em></em>
