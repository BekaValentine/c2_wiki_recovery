        It's hard to make sure you get what you need and still try to get what you want. Do you name a high figure and let 'em bid you down below where you can really afford to go? Do you wait for 'em to name something and then look greedy trying to get what you want? This bit of a negotiation is very stressful!

      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Tell them what you need. Also tell them what you want. Tell them you can't accept less than the first figure, and that you think there's a good chance you can find the second figure. Then go get <a href="MoreThanOneOffer.html">MoreThanOneOffer</a> and be very true and gentle with everyone concerned.
