        Annotations Are Uml Stereotypes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Annotations/Attributes like those available for most <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> platform languages (or in Java) seem to play a role (<a href="AnnotationMetadata.html">AnnotationMetadata</a>) very similar to the role <a href="UmlStereotypes.html">UmlStereotypes</a> play, but <a href="UmlStereotypes.html">UmlStereotypes</a> were invented much before. Are they really the same thing? and if they are: Why did it take so much time for language designers in the industry to add real support for <a href="UmlStereotypes.html">UmlStereotypes</a> in <a href="ObjectOrientedLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedLanguage</a>? and if they are not then... what is exactly the difference?

        <em>For those of us less familiar with the subjects, I'd appreciate a few paragraphs on the background here.</em>

      <p>
        Better now?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Slightly.</em>

        <em>Not knowing much more than what you've written, I'd guess that </em><a href="AnnotationMetadata.html">AnnotationMetadata</a> doesn't seem to 'change the meaning' of a code unit whereas <a href="UmlStereotypes.html">UmlStereotypes</a> allow that sort of semantic modification. I'd be interested in learning how much processing each implies. UML is generally not executable, but knowing what sort of post-processing would be required for <a href="UmlStereotypes.html">UmlStereotypes</a> if the UML was to be made executable would be useful in a comparison.<em></em>
