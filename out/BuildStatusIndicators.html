        Uh, wouldn't a web page suffice?  Or does that involve insufficient gadgetry to merit consideration?  (I remember when putting a Coke machine on the web was considered a cool hack...)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The problem with a web page is that you, the user have to poll it.  The good thing about these approaches is that they are public and passive:  They </em>'transmit<em>' the build status to everyone with eyes (and maybe ears).  You can't miss it; anyone who wonders through the office, or wakes up for a minute, can plainly see the build status.  You don't have to open a browser window and check a web page somewhere.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Have a web page so anyone, anywhere in the building can view it. Have a LavaLamp type display with it, then set up a projector and have it permanently shown on a wall. That way it's both available everywhere and unmissable in the software area.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where I come from, lava lamps cost less than LCD projectors.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, you could replace the boring flourescent track-lighting with disco lights or stage lights; flood the whole work area in green when the build works; red when it breaks.  Or, for that industrial look--just get some of the red/yellow/green indicators used in factory floors to indicate problems with the production line; those are cheap and meant to be driven by a controller of some sort.
        (Or hang a traffic light from the wall).
