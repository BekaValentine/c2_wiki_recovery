        Reads Like Prose
      </h1>
      <p>
        Good code reads like prose once it has been broken up into methods, functions, procedures, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of the refactoring process that results in <a href="WellFactoredCode.html">WellFactoredCode</a> is to give names to chunks of code. When you have found a chunk of code that can be abstracted and potentially reused, you give it a name by turning it into a method or an object. If these names are well chosen and descriptive, then you begin to approach the point where your code <a href="ReadsLikeProse.html">ReadsLikeProse</a>.

        This was one of the ideals that the designers of COBOL had back in the 1950's. Of course some shops utterly ignored the possibilities and had their programmers writing code like:
      </p>
      <code>
        PERFORM 3010-CALC-PAY-BEGIN THRU 3019-CALC-PAY-END.<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          -CALC-PAY-BEGIN.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        MULTIPLY TCD-HRS BY EMR-PAYRATE GIVING PCH-SALARY.<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
          -CALC-PAY-END.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        CONTINUE.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But it was possible to write code like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        PERFORM CALCULATE-CHECK-AMT.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        CALCULATE-CHECK-AMT.<br/>
        MULTIPLY TIMECARD-HRS BY EMPLOYEE-PAYRATE GIVING CHECK-AMT.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now our modern languages have enough syntactic quirkiness that we can't get quite so close to plain English. But then, managers no longer have any expectation of being able to read code either. But that's no excuse for using excessively ungrammatical features of programming languages. For instance, C allows a programmer to write:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (!bufptr){ ... }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        rather than
      </p>
      <code>
        if (bufptr == 0) { ... }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        But the first one does not read like prose and the prose translation <em>if not buffer pointer</em> doesn't make a lot of sense. The second example will compile to the exact same machine code and the prose version <em>if buffer pointer is equal to zero</em> actually makes sense.
      </p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>FWIW, I find the first phrasing more prosaic. Why? Because I read it "if null bufptr". Zero and equality are algebraic concepts that, to my eye, have very little to do with whether the bufptr is null or not. So I'm forced to infer that. My eye also needs to focus to verify that you've used == and not =, which slows my code scanning. I know yours is the conventional wisdom, and of course YMMV, but for me this is less an example and more a counterexample of </em><a href="ReadsLikeProse.html">ReadsLikeProse</a>, with which otherwise I agree.<em> --</em><a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sorry, but I find both of the above examples weak (at least in regards to how much they read like prose).  I would be more inclinded to use something like
        while( Pointer.isNull(bufferPointer) ) { . . . } where isNull is a class method on the Pointer class.  Then isNull would be implemented using one of the two above approaches.  Thoughts? --<a href="HankRoark.html">HankRoark</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[isNull is a horrible name for this action because it has nothing to do with what you want. It stems from the </em>technical<em> domain, not the (local) </em>problem<em> domain. You want to know whether the pointer is valid. isValid() would have been better. You'll find in MFC an </em>AfxAssertValid() macro for this purpose (and others), for instance.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Furthermore, if you consider all objects capable of being evaluated in a Boolean context which returns their validity, then !bufptr makes a lot more sense than bufptr == 0. In C++, I usually have an "operator bool() const { return </em><a href="IsValid.html">IsValid</a>(); }" if there is a concept of validity. The iostream libraries use the same mechanism (though they may return a void * on older compilers).<em>  (Not just on older compilers -- on any standards conforming C++ implementation, as void* is required.  Strangely it turns out that in some ways void* is a better-behaved boolean type in C++ than bool is (and there are better still, but they weren't understood in the mid-to-late 90s. -- </em><a href="JamesDennett.html">JamesDennett</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Moreover, since I'd rather test </em>'rvalue == lvalue<strong> to prevent </strong>lvalue = rvalue<strong> errors, I have to remember to enter this as </strong>0 == bufptr<em>'. What a pain.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Finally, bufptr is one of those really </em><a href="BadVariableNames.html">BadVariableNames</a>. In my opinion, aim for <a href="SelfDocumentingCode.html">SelfDocumentingCode</a> if you want readability. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>]<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>Just rename </em>'bufptr<strong> to </strong>buffer<em>'.</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        if(!buffer) { ... }<br/>

        In the past I have used similar constructs using C macros to emulate what 88 levels do in COBOL. For instance:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           BUFPTR PIC 9999.
          <ol>
            <li>
               NULL-BUFPTR VALUE 0.
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        IF NULL-BUFPTR THEN<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        becomes
      </p>
      <code>
        #define isNull(x) (x == 0)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        if (isNull(bufptr)) { ... }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, to more directly address Peter's comments, I admit that my example was flawed since modern C compilers have a defined macro NULL that could be used like so:
      </p>
      <code>
        if (bufptr == NULL) { ... }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>

      </p>

      <p>
        As for me, I would find a formula such as
      </p>
      <code>
        checkAmount := timecardHours * employeePayRate<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        far easier to read than 
      </p>
      <code>
        MULTIPLY TIMECARD-HRS BY EMPLOYEE-PAYRATE GIVING CHECK-AMT.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        More generally, I hold that in using a programming language, it's important to learn to read it, and write it, idiomatically, as the "native" speakers use it. People often complain about C-isms such as
      </p>
      <code>
        while (*t++ = *s++);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        even though to the practiced reader these are quite clear. While the idea that code should read like prose is an interesting one, it might be best taken other than literally. Code should be clear, elegant, consistent with expert usage of the language in question. It should lead the eye and the mind to understanding. But read like prose? Perhaps not. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        <em>I think the line of COBOL is closer to </em><a href="ReadsLikeProse.html">ReadsLikeProse</a> because it reads left to right, unlike the C version. Any arguments? -- <a href="ShaeErisson.html">ShaeErisson</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The C version also reads left-to-right; it's just not <em>executed</em> left-to-right.  Furthermore, the C ordering seems clearer to me: the goal is stated first, followed by how to get there.  With the COBOL version, I'm most of the way through the sentence before I know what it's driving at.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm mostly in agreement with Ron.  Code should read clearly, left-to-right, top-to-bottom, and focus on intent.  But just as good prose is targeted at skilled readers of the language it's written in, good code should aim at programmers who know the language.  -- <a href="GlennVanderburg.html">GlennVanderburg</a>

        This raises an interesting (?) topic: if there are different ways of perceiving program text, how should we react to this in our coding standards [if at all]?

        When algebra was first invented, people didn't use variables, operators or other notation. They just wrote things out in natural language. Here is an example from Al-Khwarizmi's famous book:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If the instance be, 'ten and thing to be multiplied by thing less ten,' then this is the same as 'if it were said thing and ten by thing less ten. You say, therefore, thing multiplied by thing is a square positive; and ten by thing is ten things positive; and minus ten by thing is ten things negative. You now remove the positive by the negative, then there only remains a square. Minus ten multiplied by ten is a hundred, to be subtracted from the square. This, therefore, altogether, is a square less a hundred dirhems.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare this to (x+10)*(x-10) = x*x + 10*x - 10*x - 10*10 = x*x - 100
      </p>
      <p>
        Now imagine trying to do even simple calculus like this. If there's a lot of essential complexity, I claim that natural language becomes much harder to understand than specialized notation, which is why notation exists in the first place. A good notation is understood on its own terms, not in terms of translation to some natural language statement, for instance, algebraic manipulations are done according to certain rules, without having to re-justify them each time, because of the underlying soundness of algebra.
