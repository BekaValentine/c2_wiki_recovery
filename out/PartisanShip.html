        When it is time to vote, the choice is simple. I have already aligned myself with one party; I'm possibly a member.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong> I vote for the candidate from my party. This occasionally might be me. If the election is in the <a href="HouseOfCommons.html">HouseOfCommons</a>, sometimes the vote isn't a <a href="FreeVote.html">FreeVote</a> and I'm forced to vote along party lines. This is good, because I campaigned on a platform that I must uphold.
      </p>
      <p>
        This way, while I may not agree with the party completely, and I might have voted for someone else this election, I am slowly building my reputation with the party. Or avoiding being thrown out of my job. Or lynched by my constituents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But,</strong> because I usually vote by SecretBallot, I can really vote for whomever I want. I can just say I voted for my party, even campaign for them, and still vote for whomever I want. Sometimes, if I'm the candidate, I vote for the other person out of respect. I doubt this would happen in BritishColumbia, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        In OpenElections, I can't do this. I can CrossTheFloor if I'm a member of a <a href="RepresentativeGovernment.html">RepresentativeGovernment</a> or something similar, however. Some places require me to resign my position and rerun in a BiElection to do this.
