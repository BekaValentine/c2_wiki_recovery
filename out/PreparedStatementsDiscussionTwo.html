           Wrappers can only protect against quote escaping if the authors of the wrappers decide to include such protection. I.e. it's dependent on the implementation.

That's the <strong>easiest</strong> way to implement <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  To make a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementation capable of failing in a manner that causes SQL injection would require a deliberate effort -- and I do mean <strong>effort</strong>, given that implementing them properly is easier -- to make a flawed <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementation.]

           Naked SQL doesn't prevent buffer overflows or other forms of machine language (or p-code or whatever) injection. However, careful coding of the engine that processes the naked SQL could very well be free of such things. Not so careful coding could result in it being subject to those attacks. Therefore, whether or not naked SQL is subject to those attacks is implementation dependent.

      <p>
        <em>What, "author bias" in favour of </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>?  When it comes to avoiding SQL injection, you'd better believe it.  I consider choosing to use filters with dynamic queries on a public Web site or private intranet -- when <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are available -- to be professional malpractice.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not directly about "favoring", it's providing misleading details or impressions. The biggest sign of bias is conflating "naked" SQL issues with wrapped SQL issues, and second, the implication that there are no trade-offs involved. At the very least, it's sloppy writing, but appears to be caused by bias rather than just crappy text authoring ability alone. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>From a security point of view, filters are only infinitesimally better than "naked" SQL, to the point of being effectively equivalent.  The chances of failure due to errors or unconsidered conditions in the filters, or due to inadvertently omitting filters, are unacceptably high for any but throwaway purposes.  There's nothing "misleading" about that, because it's true.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In general it's an IT management decision to use PS's or not. Developers and (low-level) DBA's can make recommendations, but the final call is not theirs. Whether you feel like suing the managers or beating them with a Safety Stick, that's a personal issue. (Just let me know so I can conveniently slip out and not be a witness.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course it's an "IT management decision", but that doesn't mean filters should be treated as equivalent to </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  They aren't.  Any "IT management" that uses dynamic SQL with filters instead of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> should do so fully advised that they're making a profoundly stupid decision, on the basis that using filtered dynamic SQL instead of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is a fool's choice.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And prepared statements (PS) do have downsides, such as <strong>vendor and/or version specificness</strong> to API's that may make it difficult to swap DB vendors or versions. Whether all or most difference can be hidden behind wrappers is questionable, or at least an open question. They also <strong>add more layers</strong> to the mix, and the more layers, the more problems, typically.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Arguing that the negligible effort to provide generic interfaces to specific DBMSs is a "downside" to </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is akin to arguing against having a password that secures your on-line bank account because it will "add more layers to the mix".  And it's hypocritical, given that your filtering wrappers are also adding "more layers to the mix."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Given a choice between filtered dynamic queries vs </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, the <strong>only</strong> argument in favour of filtered dynamic queries <strong>might</strong> be that your application is throwaway and it doesn't matter if gets hacked.  Of course, even that is highly questionable -- every instance of hacking due to classic SQL injection, even if on a throwaway application, calls into question the capability and security-awareness of IT professionals in general, not to mention the fact that you have opened your organisation up to potentially unknown compromises.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Your risk assessment opinions have been noted.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You have NOT made an iron-clad case that these downsides are overwhelmed by the upsides. My approach is to present all known trade-offs and risk/probability estimates and known research studies to the decision-makers (managers & owners). <strong>The final choice is theirs and I will not pre-bias written summaries to tilt them toward my favored selection</strong>, which appears to be what you are doing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you're not "biased" in favour of </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, then you're deliberately courting SQL injection, even if you think your filters are 100% correct and used 100% of the time.  I don't know how you can justify that, let alone argue that the downsides of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are not overwhelmed by their upsides.<em></em>

        Just because somebody likes bungee jumping does NOT mean they WANT to die.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed, but anyone who wishes to choose wooden doors over metal doors should be made fully aware that he's being an idiot, and we're not talking about $50/month vs $200/month, we're talking about spending $19.00 once on a set of windchimes vs spending $19.01 once on a fully-alarmed vault.</em>

        <li>
           <em>Apparently, the risk is high enough to justify the "extra layers" of using filtering wrappers, no?

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They may not be using wrappers. I know of production public software where the programmer put in zero protection, not even quote escaping. That 10% does not tell us much that can be used in this case. We are comparing 3 options and the stats tell us very little about the distribution of hacks among those 3 options.

           <em>I'm not referring to successful compromises, only attacks.  The important factor is that a filter is brittle; it can be compromised by a trivial error in coding or by a trivial omission of the filter.  </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are invariably implemented using parameters to compiled code -- usually as functions based on or using stored procedures -- and so are more robust than filters.  A failure in <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> code might result in a query that doesn't run, but doesn't risk SQL injection.  A failure in a filter might result in a query that doesn't run, but it might also risk SQL injection.

           Can you PROVE it's using "parameters to compiled code" rather than just claim it?

The 'd' in "parsed" appears to be a typo; the usual term is "parse tree", which is a data structure that represents the result of parsing a sentence in a grammar.

           I interpret that as possibly meaning, "IF the system wants to reuse the same query, in this new version it is required to use the same parse tree."

           <em>You interpret incorrectly.  It's a statement of how prepared statements are implemented in </em>MySQL version 5.0 and higher. If you don't believe me, you can examine the source code yourself.  Older versions didn't support prepared statements or stored procedures.  If you know of a DBMS that implements prepared statements using filters and query re-writing, please let us know.  Otherwise, we can safely assume that in the absence of evidence to the contrary, popular DBMS vendors aren't being deliberately foolish or making extra work for themselves by not re-using existing mechanisms -- like stored procedures and related infrastructure -- to support parameterised, compiled code.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not clear enough to back your claim as written. It's too fuzzy about WHEN it does reuse. It's describing HOW it does reuse, not WHEN. You are asking readers to trust your interpretation, i.e, <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>. (We could decide to <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> how to interpret it and end the debate on it.) And assuming "DBMS vendors aren't being deliberately foolish" may be assuming too much. Larry Ellison can be a spinster prick at times.

        If you really want to change people's opinions, then find some solid empirical evidence: for example, a good survey that shows wrappers are 20x more likely to be hacked than PS's. <strong>Science will go a lot further than insistent paternalistic lectures</strong> based on <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>.

      <p>
        <em>In terms of security verification, "empirical evidence" borders on worthless.

      </p>
      <p>
        That's questionable, but where's your "theoretical proof" anyhow?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's the ideal.  Knowing that a mechanism like </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> does not use query rewriting comes close.  Empirical testing, in comparing filters to <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, demonstrates nothing.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Like we already debated, lack of query rewriting doesn't prevent all possible injections, and we don't know if that's how they are actually implemented. As I remember it, you quoted some Microsoft documentation that claimed it "usually" doesn't re-generate the query. That's not very reassuring.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Who said lack of query rewriting prevents all possible injections?  </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> prevent all possible classic SQL injection attacks that result from query rewriting.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But we don't know the ratio (and future) between classic injection and non-classic-injection. If it's 1-to-10, then using PS's to reduce total injection only gets you a 10% reduction in injection attacks and you are asking orgs to complicate their tool stack to get that 10%. It's arguably not worth it. (I personally doubt it is 1-to-10, but will admit my estimates are not backed by solid empirical studies, and neither are yours, such that I shall not be as insistent as you are in your opinion re: "professional malpractice". <strong>THOU SHALL NOT BE INSISTENT WITHOUT SOLID EMPIRICAL FACTS</strong>. That's common sense to almost anybody except the willfully stubborn.)

        I'd argue that insisting you are absolutely right without solid empirical evidence could likewise be considered "professional malpractice".

        <em>The essential distinction is between classic SQL injection vs second order SQL injection.  The former can be organised into subcategories (e.g., blind SQL injection, classic SQL injection due to incorrect type handling, classic SQL injection due to incorrect escaping, etc.) but they all stem from levering query re-writing to redefine a query's logic.  Second order SQL injection results when a seemingly-legitimate user entry -- one not requiring quoting and of the correct type -- is stored for later use and later results in unintended query logic being executed because the value is retrieved and used incorrectly when constructing a dynamic query string.  Hence, the ratio of classic injection to non-classic-injection is irrelevant, because they're different and have different causes.  Of course, proper use of </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> -- with static definitions -- will prevent either form of SQL injection.  Unfortunately, second order SQL injection sometimes appears when constructing definition strings for <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> using user input.

        <em>As for claiming that </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> have not been proven "100% correct", that's true, but nothing has been proven "100% correct."  Indeed, even code as simple and innocuous as a 'while (true) {...}' loop might fail, if the underlying processor has a hardware bug that causes some machine language construct to break after (say) exactly 1.24x10E34 iterations.  That sort of thing happens.  However, what we do know is that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> have a field-proven reliability with no known DBMS-based failures that have resulted in SQL injection.  That's why OWASP and others recommend them.  We also know that filters have a field-demonstrated brittleness, due to the difficulty of writing reliable filters, and the ease with which applying a filter can be forgotten.  It's awfully easy to write $userInput when you should have written sqlStringFilter($userInput).  That's a reason why OWASP and others condemn them.<em></em>

        "100% correct" was YOUR reference metric, not mine. I'm just asking you to <strong>be consistent</strong> with its usage for comparing all horses in the race, not just horses you hate.

If they fail, they fail safely.  I cannot find a documented case of a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementation failing in a DBMS in a manner that causes SQL injection.

           That's a whacky statement. Every non-trivial system probably has flaws and I'd bet money that most PS systems have security flaws of <em>some</em> kind in them. And you haven't found a case of filters failing like you claim either. (Although, a handful of flaws may not be a good statistical sampling anyhow.)

        <li>
           <em>Sure, every non-trivial system has flaws.  But remember how </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> work -- upon execution, they do <strong>not</strong> invoke the SQL parser on SQL source. They execute the parse tree (or other compiled form) that was generated when the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> was created. So, in order to inject SQL, the flawed <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> execution would have to somehow invoke the SQL parser -- which normally has nothing to do with <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> execution -- in a manner that creates a new query consisting of query text of the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> at the time it was originally created, along with the query text that was passed as a parameter, and then execute it.  How would that happen?  It seems rather unlikely. (Speaking as a developer of DBMSs, I'd be inclined to replace "unlikely" with "bloody impossible", but that's not as scientific.)  On the other hand, how likely is it that a typical programmer types $userInput as part of a dynamic SQL string creation when he should have typed sqlNumberFilter($userInput)?  That seems likely to happen fairly frequently.<em></em>

      <p>
        <em>The "easy to write" scenario that causes SQL injection with </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is using external input to construct the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition.

The solution, of course, is to never use external data in the creation of a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>.  It's relatively unlikely that anyone -- once they understand the reason -- would casually forget and mistakenly include external data in <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition.

Dynamic SQL <strong>requires</strong> external data (otherwise it's not dynamic) and careful discipline to wrap <strong>every</strong> external data source in a filter.

        It's possible to attach thing A when you meant to attach thing B because of similar names or The Monday's, etc. Variables/objects are not smart enough to say, "Wait, this violates the shop conventions. Spanks!" Or maybe part X used to come from a literal, but was changed to come from user input, and somebody plugged it in, but "library users" down the road won't know this. Abstraction often hides the sources of things, which is usually good, that's what abstraction is largely for, but it can also be bad sometimes.

      </p>
      <p>
        Given a query like "SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE c1 = 3", popular SQL DBMSs convert the query to a parse tree (or some equivalent) like the following in order to execute it:
      </p>
      <code>
        COMMAND: UNION<br/>
        COMMAND: SELECT<br/>
        COLUMNS: ALL<br/>
        FROM: t1<br/>
        COMMAND: SELECT<br/>
        COLUMNS: ALL<br/>
        FROM: t2<br/>
        WHERE:<br/>
        COMPARE: =<br/>
        COLUMN: c1<br/>
        NUMBER: 3<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Execution is essentially performed by traversing the parse tree. (Though this is a simplification that does not take into account optimisation and/or generation of a query plan, both of which may involve restructuring the tree or using it as the basis for further compilation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        If the query has been constructed dynamically using PHP like "SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE c1 = " . sqlNum($_POST['userinput']), if sqlNum fails in a manner that lets through user input like "3; delete from customers" -- or if the programmer forgets to wrap user input with sqlNum() -- the constructed query may be "SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE c1 = 3; delete from customers", with obvious unpleasant results.
      </p>
      <p>
        With prepared statements, the parse tree (or some equivalent) is created in one step and executed in another.  Thus, creating a prepared statement like "SELECT * FROM t1 UNION SELECT * FROM t2 WHERE c1 = ?" generates a parse tree (or equivalent) like the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        COMMAND: UNION<br/>
        COMMAND: SELECT<br/>
        COLUMNS: ALL<br/>
        FROM: t1<br/>
        COMMAND: SELECT<br/>
        COLUMNS: ALL<br/>
        FROM: t2<br/>
        WHERE:<br/>
        COMPARE: =<br/>
        COLUMN: c1<br/>
        NUMBER: ?<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When the prepared statement is executed, the statement is <strong>not</strong> re-parsed to form a new tree. The already-existing parse tree is executed. Avoiding having to re-parse -- especially to gain performance inside loops, but also for protection against classic SQL injection -- is precisely the reason for having prepared statements.  All that happens is the parameter value is inserted into the parameter position in the prepared parse tree.  If the parameter value is "3; delete from customers", it will be inserted into the appropriate parameter position in the parse tree to create the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        COMMAND: UNION<br/>
        COMMAND: SELECT<br/>
        COLUMNS: ALL<br/>
        FROM: t1<br/>
        COMMAND: SELECT<br/>
        COLUMNS: ALL<br/>
        FROM: t2<br/>
        WHERE:<br/>
        COMPARE: =<br/>
        COLUMN: c1<br/>
        NUMBER: "3; delete from customers"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        At worst, the query will harmlessly crash when it tries to compare the contents of numeric column c1 with the string "3; delete from customers".  At best, it will compare the numeric values in c1 against the string "3; delete from customers" and find that none of them match.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's imagine the prepared statement mechanism is buggy, and (say) somehow incorrectly replaces some other tree node with the user input "delete from customers", like the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        "delete from customers"<br/>
        COMMAND: SELECT<br/>
        COLUMNS: ALL<br/>
        FROM: t1<br/>
        COMMAND: SELECT<br/>
        COLUMNS: ALL<br/>
        FROM: t2<br/>
        WHERE:<br/>
        COMPARE: =<br/>
        COLUMN: c1<br/>
        NUMBER: ?<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It's still harmless, because there is <strong>no</strong> parsing of the input after it's been turned into a parse tree.  The replacement of the first node with the string "delete from customers" will probably cause the query execution to crash, but it won't cause SQL injection.  That's because the string "delete from customers" won't be parsed and turned into a new parse tree, which would be necessary for it to be executed as a SQL command.  At the point where a prepared statement is executed, all the parsing has already been done.  No further parsing will be done, so no string can be turned into a parse tree that can be executed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That only covers "classic SQL injection". We've been over this already.</em>

      <p>
        I only claimed <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> definitively protect against classic SQL injection.  I don't know anyone, myself included, who claims otherwise.  Other forms of SQL injection -- second order SQL injection, for example -- are orthogonal to the issue of dynamic queries (filtered or otherwise) vs <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  However, given the significance of classic SQL injection, it can't be ignored.

        <em>If the "nodes" in the parse-tree are delimited with say Unicode character #4321 internally, and if the value has Unicode character #4321 in it, then the parse-tree interpreter/processor can be tricked into mistaking some of the value for a node delimiter, and "execute" part of the value. Remember, in RAM your parse-tree is just a sequence(s) of bytes. Indirection may reduce the chance of such happening by making the interpreter/processor jump to different locations to get values, but that doesn't outright eliminate the risk (and slows down performance). Your original statement is still wrong as given. (There may be techniques to outright eliminate ALL possible kinds of injection, but you haven't proved those are used in production RDBMS.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You could perhaps argue that such requires knowledge of the guts of a given RDBMS, but classic SQL injection often takes advantage of </em>'vendor-specific<em>' flaws also, and thus generally reflect specific flaws of specific implementations in both cases. -t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not aware of any DBMS (or popular programming language, for that matter) that represents parse trees as strings and executes them by parsing them. (And then what?  Construct <strong>another</strong> "real" parse tree for compilation or execution?  Why?)  They're data structures, executed by invocation of functions or methods -- for example, by storing the nodes in a container class and iterating over them.  Thus, there is no delimiting nor is there anything to be limited by a delimiter.  It is conceivable that buffer overflow injection of native code could be used on such (or any!) structures, but that's entirely orthogonal to dynamic queries vs <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  If buffer overflow issues are likely at all -- and there are ways of avoiding them entirely -- they're equally likely with both <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> and dynamic queries.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Data structures and "container classes" are represented with </em>'sequences of bytes<em>' also. It doesn't change the nature of the problem to call them something different. Whether those data structures/classes/thingamabobs use delimiters or byte counters is an implementation detail that is not revealed for claim verification here. (And byte counting has its own set of problems.) If you wish to claim that "injection can't happen because there are no delimiters whatsoever", then please do. Just be clear about exactly what you are claiming.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The representation of SQL queries in DBMSs is significant in terms of how and where they are vulnerable to SQL injection.  Everything in a computer is represented with sequences of bytes.  However, not everything in a language <x> is subject to injection of language <x>.  <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> in popular DBMSs are implemented as I've described, modulo inevitable technical (and largely irrelevant) variation that I've already mentioned.  Processing the data structures that are involved does not involve detecting delimiters.

      <p>
        Actually, it is your evidence burden, because the notion of representing a parse tree as something other than a tree data structure is, from a language implementation point of view, bizarre.

Whilst a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> <strong>could</strong> conceivably (though pointlessly, in the case of SQL implementations) convert SQL into an intermediate language like that represented by your string, it still wouldn't be subject to classic SQL injection because any subsequent parsing step would be parsing the intermediate language, not SQL.

        <li>
           When you write "most in the field", what field are you referring to?  It's true that the type of attack is of little importance to the victim, but the point here is that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> preclude classic SQL injection but dynamic SQL with filters does not.  If one possible attack vector is closed, that is indubitably preferable to leaving it open.  Of course, that assumes all other factors are equal, and essentially they are.

      <p>
        Processing a parse tree is straightforward, requiring no scanning of delimiters or the like, and my claim that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> do not allow classic SQL injection is based (in part) on that knowledge.  There *might* be string copying involved -- as there is in almost any non-trivial data processing code -- and in some languages and systems string copying is potentially subject to buffer overflows, but that's not SQL injection of any kind.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Classic SQL injection requires parsing strings to convert them into something executable, and I know of no <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementation that does that after the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> has been created.  Furthermore, I don't know why any implementation would do so.  It would be more programming effort for no gain, and much risk.

           I have observed classic SQL injection attacks against Web sites I've been involved with in one way or another, either using custom software or off-the-shelf Web products.  The ones using dynamic SQL without filters have been, unsurprisingly, compromised by SQL injection.  I've never had one with comprehensive filters get compromised by SQL injection, but I've seen compromises on sites using filters where filters were inadvertently omitted.  It seems to be too easy to type "$userInput" when you should have typed "inputCleaned($userInput)".  I've never seen a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> compromised by classic SQL injection.  I've never <strong>heard</strong> of a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> being compromised by classic SQL injection.  Of course, that isn't surprising at all -- and this is the important point, not my anecdotal report -- if we look at the source code of MySQL and PostgreSQL to see how <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are implemented.  Given that, what reason do we have to think that SQL Server, DB2 and other popular closed-source DBMSs are implemented any differently, especially as commercial vendors have a lot more to lose if their <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementations are found to be vulnerable to classic SQL injection?

        <li>
           My evidence for how <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are implemented in MySQL and PostgreSQL is certainly not anecdotal.  It's analytic, based on reading the source code.  My evidence for <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> being implemented in an equivalent manner in commercial, closed-source DBMSs is circumstantial evidence (setting aside, for the moment the fact that some vendors explicitly state that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are more secure than dynamic SQL), but it's strong circumstantial evidence.  In particular, it's trivial to observe that the same performance pattern found in MySQL and PostgreSQL -- i.e., <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> execute faster inside a loop than the equivalent dynamic SQL, which is accounted for by the fact that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are parsed only once -- also appears in commercial, closed-source DBMSs.  Thus, it is reasonable to conclude that the same internal mechanism -- i.e., that parameter values inserted into appropriate locations in the parse tree or query plan in a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> -- is employed in all popular DBMSs and thus they preclude classic SQL injection.  Filters with dynamic SQL do not preclude classic SQL injection; they only block it.

           <em>The gist of your argument appears to be that one can forget to use per-value filters but that PS's </em>'force<strong> one to use API's such that one cannot ever forget to apply the API to values. Is this correct? I've never tested all common brands of PS's to verify there is no way to include values in dynamically generated SQL fed to PS's.

For example, a given report page may be only for retail outlets and thus wish to hard-wire the condition "site_type = 'retail'" into the SQL for that page. If PS's don't allow hard-wiring of that, then it's extra code to process the value "retail" in the code and is a factor against PS's. (In this case it's trivial, but some apps have more involved invariants, especially old DB's with a lot of legacy baggage such as location codes from mergers.) On the other hand, if they DO allow such, then one can make the same "forget to wrap" mistake as the value wrapper approach (even for non-invariants). Thus, there is no "free lunch".

           <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> can be created using dynamic SQL, in exactly the same manner as conventional dynamic SQL.  However, auditing is simplified compared to dynamic SQL with filters.  It's straightforward to identify the points where <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are created dynamically and audit them for possible inclusion of external data.

           Using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> always requires two steps: The first is the potentially-unsafe creation of the statement, which should <strong>never</strong> contain external data, filtered or otherwise.  The second is the execution of the statement, which can be safely passed external data -- unfiltered -- as parameter arguments.  This enforced separation between creation and execution means auditing is only needed at the point where a given <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is created.  At that point, <strong>any</strong> dynamic construction should be viewed with utmost suspicion.  Fortunately, in typical practice most <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are constructed from a static string, which is inherently safe.  Dynamic SQL, on the other hand, must always be considered unsafe until proven otherwise, which always requires careful auditing of the construction of the SQL statement.

           <em>But isn't it also often considered "best practice", or at least common practice, to isolate invariants (constants) into a configuration-like area?

You are instead proposing that one hard-wire them into "main line" string constants (SQL). Like just about anything else in code-land, some parts of queries vary for different reasons such that abstracting away differences on aspect X will differ from the grouping/classification of the abstracting away differences on aspect Y. The difference between user input values and "configuration" values can get </em>'murky<strong> in such a situation.

           It's certainly reasonable to isolate constants into a configuration-like area, but how many invariant queries are subject to configuration?

The vigilance required to ensure <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are not misused on creation is typically trivial: the SQL string is either dynamically constructed somewhere (potentially risky -- look carefully) or it isn't (and therefore safe).

Using PHP as a typical example, it's trivial to observe that all string definitions refer to other string definitions in the same module, with no reference to external strings such as $_POST['externalString'] and the like.  Of course, as usual PHP makes things as difficult as possible; better languages (e.g., Java, C#, etc.) can easily modularise the string definitions in a manner that allows the compiler to guarantee no external references if you don't want them.

The required absence of external data in <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions makes them easier to audit than dynamic SQL, because dynamic SQL requires references to dynamic external data and may have static references, whilst <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions may only have static references.

        Re: I'm not sure what you mean by something being "constant" for one section/grouping and not another.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose you have hundreds of on-line reports for a business-to-business web app. It's a legacy system that has a lot of baggage from mergers and re-organizations. A group of about 30 reports is for retail stores only. The to-be-included-in-WHERE-clause criteria for "retail" locations (offices or buildings) is such:
      </p>
      <code>
        retailCrit = "((loc.org_code between 50 and 64 and loc.org_level < 70) " <br/>
        + " or loc.org_type in ('ST','RE','SA'))";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Keep in mind we'll have other criteria clauses for other types of "locations", but we are only looking at the "retail" reports for now.  (And convoluted criteria like this is fairly common on legacy systems in my experience.)
      </p>
      <p>
        So we have these 30 report modules for "retail", with different net SQL, that use the above criteria. Now a design decision is whether to hard-code (repeat) the above criteria 30 times into each of the 30 reports, or treat it like a "constant" for that set of 30. Most would agree it's "better abstraction" to define the criteria phrase in one shared place rather than copy and paste it 30 times. Thus, if we are using prepared statements, we'll still have somethign like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        prepStat.registerSql("SELECT blah FROM locations loc WHERE x=4 AND " + retailCrit);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        One cannot tell from looking at this line alone whether some parts of "retailCrit" come from user input. One has to know the code and/or remember to go check where such variables are defined/assigned.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Given the above code, the string passed to registerSql is static in most language implementations; it will be constructed at compile-time.  If the construction of such SQL strings is confined to a module, defined in a class, constrained by type, and/or the strings are defined as immutable (say, using something like C++'s "const" or Java's "final" modifier) it's straightforward to determine whether or not they've been tainted by external data or an attempt has been made to mutate them.  Of course, it's possible to subvert such mechanisms and/or obscure the origin of SQL strings behind complexity, but that increases the security risk.  That is at least equally the case for dynamic SQL.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That assumes a "static" application language, and still requires manual back-tracing of some form in the code.  Whether that makes it slightly better or slightly worse than wrappers is moot in the "professional malpractice" accusation, which needs something more far solid than "a little bit better".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>All that "professional malpractice" requires is that "an impartial jury ... find a greater than 50% probability that professional negligence did occur" where professional negligence could be considered behaviour which "deviates from accepted norms of practice" and results in harm.  We know dynamic SQL -- even with filters, if they fail or fail to be used -- can result in harm from classic SQL injection.  Can you provide evidence that </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> have ever resulted in classic SQL injection?  Imagine the prosecution offers these rhetorical questions as an argument.  What do you think the jury will decide?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But a given set wrappers may also have a clean record. The only thing agreed on is that "naked values" SQL is at risk, and that's not the issue. And you have not measured "norms", unless you can trick the jury into thinking Google is a scientific survey device.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Given that wrappers are a barrier to classic SQL injection, there is always a possibility that a future exploitation of flaws in the string handling code will allow a malicious string to fool the wrappers and be passed to the SQL parser, resulting in classic SQL injection.  </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> do not rely on filtering, but on inserting parameter arguments into the parse tree or query plan after SQL parsing has occurred so that classic SQL injection cannot occur.  Surely the jury would recognise that the latter is superior to the former?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Better" is not necessarily enough to justify "professional malpractice". 5-inch thick bullet-proof windows on a politician's car is probably "better" than 4 inches, but 5 > 4 alone does not mean the security-window installer is guilty of "professional malpractice". If the standard or common practice was CLEARLY 5 inches and around for a while, then perhaps "yes".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In a wrongful death suit, choosing 4 inch windows instead of 5 inch, even if the improvement in security is marginal, could well be considered negligent -- especially if all other factors are equal. In this case, they aren't even equal.  We're talking about 4 inch windows that provide no security unless special shutters are manually attached (and we have to be extra careful to make sure the shutters are effective and mounted to every window, but we can't be certain they'll always work) vs 5 inch windows that eliminate the chance of projectile penetration, for essentially the same cost.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> have been <strong>recommended</strong> practice in the J2EE and Web development worlds for over a decade.  I can't say whether they're common practice or not without polling a statistically-significant sampling of development shops, but they're certainly standard practice among the developers I know.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not following your 4 inch windows reply. It makes no sense to me. If you mean that Jurors can be convinced via clever manipulative persuasion techniques that anything shy of the maximum known thickness is "negligence", then I agree. But this discussion shouldn't be about juror psychology, although perhaps that's unavoidable. <a href="TopsLaw.html">TopsLaw</a> again?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The "4 inch window" is like dynamic SQL.  It's insecure unless you have "special shutters ... manually attached", i.e., filters, with which "we have to be extra careful to make sure the shutters are effective and mounted to every window" -- in other words, we have to make sure filters are correct and consistently used.  "5 inch windows" are like </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  They require no shutters (i.e., filters) and cost no more than the 4 inch windows.  In over ten years of use, we have no evidence of them failing due to classic SQL injection, and they're consistently recommended in order to avoid classic SQL injection.  Presented with that evidence, how do you think the jurors would react to your decision to use "4 inch windows" with "shutters" (dynamic SQL with filters) instead of "5 inch windows" (<a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>)?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One could argue that J2EE is trying to hook development stacks to their API's to lock in business. That's always a possibility with vendor recommendations. Commercial vendors have a record of bias. I've mentioned that before, but as usual, you forgot such that I have to reinvent the reply. And you have not provided clear evidence that "Web development" officially/clearly recommends such. You are imagining surveys that don't appear to exist. Hey, unicorns also recommend prepared statements. I just talked one in my bathroom.  -t

        <em>Isn't it more likely that Oracle -- maintainer of both the J2EE definition and the Oracle DBMS -- is fully aware that </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are more secure than dynamic SQL with filters, and therefore reasonably advocates use of <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "More likely" is speculative and weak. It's "impressionistic" evidence, for we cannot smash Larry Ellison's head open to dissect his decision-making neurons. I'm not suggesting such evidence be completely discarded, but it's not any where near enough to raise "professional malpractice" claims over.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oracle Corporation's intent in promoting </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> is not the basis for my accusation of professional malpractice.

      </p>
      <p>
        That's circular reasoning. You brought up what Oracle is allegedly concerned about as some kind of evidence. Why are you jumping out of the Oracle sub-topic now?

      <p>
        <em>Because it's irrelevant.

      </p>

        Adding more vendors does not necessarily get one above <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>.

      </p>
      <p>
        There are different "levels" of evidence. A study that demonstrates "PS's have a 0.001 failure rate while filters have a 0.05 failure rate" with citations is better evidence than "Oracle says so". It might still be wrong, but it's at least more dissect-able than "Oracle says so". It's more "science-able", for lack of a better word at the moment. -t

      <p>
        <em>I've made no claims that something should be done merely because Oracle says so, though if they recommend a particular approach to be used with their DBMS, I'll generally give it greater weight than the equivalent recommendation from outside Oracle.</em>

      <p>
        That's understandable, but it's still far too weak to qualify for "professional malpractice".

      <p>
        Let me see if I have the essence here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prepared statements require a two step process.  Step 1 is preparing the statement: taking a string, interpreting it as SQL (with wildcards filling in for data values to be entered later), and storing that as a prepared statement.  Step 2 is running the statement, filling in the wildcarded data values on the fly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prepared statements promise the user that, no matter what garbage or malice is inserted into data fields at runtime (as opposed to preparation time), it can never, ever be interpreted as SQL code and will simply be really gnarly data.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, whether they can deliver on that promise is implementation dependent.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, if the SQL is being dynamically generated at statement-preparation time, malicious user data can be baked into the prepared statement at that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Closed source RDBMS packages cannot be inspected, so we cannot assume that any closed-source vendor's implementation can deliver on the prepared statement promise based on code inspection.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the above is agreed upon, I would offer the following:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Everything is implementation-dependent</strong>.  Implementation is all that matters.  Broken prepared statement code and broken wrappers will both open you up to vulnerabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no perfectly safe way to run SQL.  There is no perfectly safe way to run anything; <a href="TheKenThompsonHack.html">TheKenThompsonHack</a> proved that.  Even if you fully vet the source code of an RDBMS, you can't prove that the compiler itself isn't sneaking prepared-statement-breaking code into your system.  <strong>No security is perfect</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Even if your prepared statement implementation is perfect, poor programming can still lead to SQL injection attacks.  PS is foolproof, not <em>damn</em>foolproof.  If you allow user generated data in your SQL string <em>at statement preparation time</em>, you open the door to SQL injection.  The answer is to always hard code your SQL, or to only depend on constants set at compile-time.  That is, prepareStatement("SELECT FROM " . table_name . " WHERE TIME < ?") is only trustworthy if you are certain that table_name is set at compile time.  However, if it is set at compile time, and your prepared statement implementation is correct, and <a href="TheKenThompsonHack.html">TheKenThompsonHack</a> isn't attacking your system, then whatever the user enters can be used to fill in the '?' later, and the worst that can happen is that the statement fails to run because the user's data doesn't parse as a date.
      </p>
      <p>
        These don't mean that prepared statements are worthless.  They are the industry standard for preventing SQL injection (see OWASP on that).  That is no proof in and of itself, but let's apply a variant of the <a href="LasVegasTest.html">LasVegasTest</a>.  If a major RDBMS' implementation of prepared statements was less than ironclad, it would be more readily exploited.  Even if it didn't make the news, those in the security field would respond.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work in the credit card business.  The four major US credit cards require that everybody doing business with them (from processors to mom-and-pop stores that accept credit cards) comply with a standard called PCI-DSS.  PCI-DSS in turn requires fixing the top ten complaints in OWASP, starting with injection attacks.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a major RDBMS had incorrect prepared statement code which allowed injection attacks on well-behaved client code (that is, not allowing injections at prepare time), it would be exploited.  Hard.  And the credit card industry, which suffers a black eye every three months or so related to credit data theft, would have published an alert (and notified OWASP) along the lines of "Never use XYZ RDBMS.  If you have it, switch off it within two years or you will be disconnected."  This alone could spell millions of dollars of revenue loss to the RDBMS vendor, and they would either become a laughingstock or fix their implementation right quick, quite possibly both.
      </p>
      <p>
        This has not happened.
      </p>
      <p>
        If such vulnerabilities exist, they are nowhere near the weak points of the system.  Lack of exploits don't prove that the implementations are correct, but that they are correct enough that crackers aren't bothering to find those vulnerabilities; they're happy to exploit much bigger holes.  There are plenty of injection attacks with unprepared SQL or poor use of prepared statements ("let's prepare this with the data we just got back on the HTTP request"), but not with SQL prepared with hardcoded strings and run with variable data.  If it was vulnerable enough to matter, it would be exploited.  I submit the fact that it hasn't been as evidence that this isn't the case.

        <li>
           [The party that got breached might be taken for violating the license agreement, but they certainly won't be the only ones investigating.  When you get a major breach, you're going to get some feds, such as the FBI and the Secret Service, investigating.  You may also have banks and credit card associations investigating.  They don't own the license, so they signed no license agreement with the vendor and can't breach it.]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Perhaps some can, but that doesn't stop security breaches from being publicised by CERT, OSVDB, etc.  By the way, on 13/03/2014 I looked for "prepared statement" in the OSVDB and found 12 entries.  There was one classic SQL injection breach -- <a href="http://osvdb.org/ref/67/snipsnap.txt">http://osvdb.org/ref/67/snipsnap.txt</a> -- in which a command-line argument was used when creating a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a>.  There were 11097 entries containing "sql injection".  A cursory examination shows that many of them contain text along the lines of "not properly sanitizing user-supplied input".

      <p>
        That's based on <em>assumptions</em> of vendor implementations, not empirical attack tests. I will agree that based on their claim of implementation, certain kinds of injection are likely reduced, but that's weak evidence that does NOT justify "professional malpractice".
      </p>
      <p>
        {As has been pointed out before, "empirical attack tests" are not an effective way of gauging security.

We know SQL injection due to failure to sanitise inputs is a significant problem -- see above re the OSVDB and 11097 entries containing "sql injection" -- but "prepared statement" in the same vulnerability database reveals one SQL injection breach, and that was due to creating a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> with external input rather than a flaw in a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> implementation.  We can infer from this that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are not a significant source of vulnerabilities or security breaches.  Whilst we could also infer from this that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are not being used, that seems rather unlikely, given that they are the primary recommended means of avoiding classic SQL injection in database-driven applications.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: "We can infer from this that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are not a significant source of vulnerabilities or security breaches" -- That's not news. I never claimed they were. We have three kinds of fruits we're considering: Fruit's A, B, and C. We only, at best, have stats on Fruit-A and Non-Fruit-A. That won't answer the key question.

        {If <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are not a significant source of vulnerabilities or security breaches, then <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are superior to dynamic SQL even with perfect filters, because we have to remember to use the filters.

      </p>
      <p>
        For non-trivial designs, one has to do the same with PS's, as we already discussed. (Remember, it's what led the the "constants" discussion.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        {Even with complex queries, it is trivial to structure a set of <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definition strings to either exclude all sources of external data, and/or to identify whether or not external data is included.  It is not trivial to determine whether or not a set of dynamic query invocations have incorporated filters on every external data source.  It is not trivial to prove that every filter precludes every possible dangerous input, and this can vary from DBMS to DBMS.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sorry, but I don't see how it's allegedly trivial. The code structure & inspections issues are roughly comparable as I picture such code structures in my mind.

      <p>
        {A set of constant strings used to define <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> will, at most, make reference to each other; there will be no references to external data sources.  A set of dynamic strings used to define dynamic SQL queries will possibly make reference to each other -- same as for the <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> definitions -- but will also make reference to external data sources, along with invocations of filters to sanitise those data sources, along with the definitions of the filters.  Thus, the latter is more complex than the former.}
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I don't see how that's the case. The amount of code needing inspection and the quantity of "reference hops" would not vary much between technique choices, barring some unidentified force tilting code design a certain way.

        {We didn't talk about execution, only the construction of the definition strings.  A typical <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> use looks like the following PHP PDO example:}

      <code>
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE USERNAME = ? AND PASSWORD = ?";<br/>
        $stmt = $dbc->prepare($sql);<br/>

      </p>
      <code>
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE USERNAME = " . sqlStringFilter($username) . " AND PASSWORD = " . sqlStringFilter($password);<br/>

      <p>
        {Of course, the latter doesn't show the definition of sqlStringFilter() -- which doesn't exist in the former -- but the real problem is that the dynamic SQL must rely on the correctness of sqlStringFilter() -- which is non-trivial to prove -- and an absolutely consistent use of sqlStringFilter() and its cousins with every external input.  Neither of these are required with <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.}

           Something has to associate the question marks with input values. That's part of the "concerns" of a developer. Those should be counted also in terms of software maintenance complexity. (Shifting back to their "security" is a change of sub-subject away from "complexity".)

           Are you talking about the first set of snippets or the second? I already explained the issues with the first. In the second, for one, some common PS API's require telling the API what type the parameter is. Second, using positional association is often awkward from a programming standpoint. Third, even as you gave it in the second set, the code is pretty close in size.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {I was referring to the second set.  I assumed that would be obvious by the fact we're discussing <em>array($username, $password)</em>, which appears only in the second set.  The examples are using PHP PDO (see <a href="http://php.net/pdo),">http://php.net/pdo),</a> for which explicit parameter types are not required.  Do you really think a "positional association" for parameters, which is de rigueur for modern programming languages, is worth the risks associated with filtered dynamic SQL?  Do you really think code that "is pretty close in size" justifies the risks associated with filtered dynamic SQL?}

      <ul>
        <li>
           Oh, so you admit now there might be a trade-off? It's a no longer a trade-off-free no-brainer? That's a start. Positional association is fine in some places but awkward in others. There are certain kinds of functions where named parameters are preferred over positional, for example. The positional-versus-reference-versus-embedded choice <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> on usage patterns etc. If the associations are stretched too far apart, then positional tends to grow awkward. And PDO may not need type indicators, but other PS API's do. It's not a universal trait that you can use as a selling point.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Where did I "admit now there might be a trade-off"?  There is <strong>no</strong> "trade-off".  There is <strong>no</strong> justification for using dynamic SQL with external data when <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are available and usable. I'm sure there are rare exceptions to this, but I've not yet seen them cited here, and if they are in the future I would expect them to be clearly labelled as rare.  In the mean time, minor code authoring and maintenance issues -- whether due to type specifications, positional parameters, or whatever -- are irrelevant compared to the duty of care we owe our clients.  Programmers or project managers who selfishly trade their clients' security for (perceived, rarely real) "easy" coding are professionally negligent.  Furthermore, consistently using filters in dynamic SQL string construction is considerably more overhead and programming effort than the type specifications or positional parameters associated with <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.}

           Why are you leaving the sub-topic of complexity then and slipping back into the security issue? It appears to me you tried to pull a security red-herring when your complexity claims were dashed. That's honestly what it looks like is going on. Please justify "programming effort" claim.

      </ul>
      <ul>

           {Why am I "leaving the sub-topic of complexity"?  Because even though it's self-evident that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are simpler than dynamic SQL with filters (look at the examples!), it <strong>doesn't matter</strong>.  Even if they were an order of magnitude more complex, and for some reason we couldn't simplify them, they would <strong>still</strong> be worth it for the level of security they provide.}

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You've said that already elsewhere. Let's try not to wonder off the complexity sub-topic. The examples are misleading for reasons already given. For example, here's another take:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        // Example 2-PS:<br/>
        $sql = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE USERNAME = ? AND PASSWORD = ?";<br/>
        $stmt = $dbc->prepare($sql);<br/>
        $stmt->registerPar($username, "String");  // some PS API's require associating a type<br/>
        $stmt->registerPar($password, "String");<br/>
        $stmt->execute();<br/>
        // Example 2-Wrap:<br/>
        $dbc->query("SELECT * FROM users WHERE USERNAME = " . sqlStr($username) . " AND PASSWORD = " . sqlStr($password));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        .
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Of course.  "Example 2-PS" is a reasonable illustration of using a low-level DBMS API, and if you're building higher-level facilities yourself -- like you want to author a new PHP PDO -- then it's reasonable to employ them.  The majority of developers producing database-driven applications use something like PHP PDO, which provides exactly the interface I demonstrated above.  Various DBMS APIs require more or less information such as associated types, or means to bind programming language variables to <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> parameters, or facilities to define named parameters and so on.  But PHP PDO is typical.}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Giving a parameter type is also typical. For example, Microsoft database API's typically include a CreateParameter method that takes a parameter type as the second argument. (I'd be curious to know how PDO "knows" the parameter type if not explicitly given. SQL dialects typically want to know that info.) And again, positional parameter matching can be difficult to manage for longer queries. While it's nice to have that option, I personally wouldn't want it as the only option.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           {Yes, parameter types are often given.  For cases when positional parameter matching is difficult, some <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> APIs provide named parameters.  There are a variety of facilities available.}

      <ul>

           My anecdotal experience is that such filters were NOT a significant source of maintenance effort. They rarely had to be "touched". I suspect they were written by big consultants and "organically" spread around to medium and small consultants such that the original development effort is spread over a lot of orgs and thus diluted in terms of <strong>per-org</strong> "cost". If that effort is your biggest "complexity" claim factor, then you've made a very poor "complexity" case and are just quibbling about marginal scraps now. -t

The position of curly braces in C and C-like languages, for example, is a source of much watercooler debate -- the end-of-line people think their way is good, and the beginning-of-next-line people think their way is correct -- but it appears to have no significant impact on programming productivity.  It probably doesn't warrant proof, and it certainly doesn't obligate it.}

We've been over this already; so why are you dragging out the same dead horse again? Empty repetition will NOT change my mind. It really frustrates me when you guys do that. That behavior resembles brain damage. Prepared statements don't (universally brand-wise) prevent having values in statements. One <strong>still has to remember</strong> to use the proper API calls for values. In more complex apps with "libraries" of SQL snippets (to avoid repetition of query idioms), it may be easy for value usage to get lost in the shuffle, especially since some of these snippets will typically hard-wire values intentionally (such as category codes). Thus, one has to know/remember which values are intentional and which are accidental. The "machine" cannot do that.

What sort of dire programming practices would permit that?  If that can happen, your entire codebase is suspect -- SQL injection is probably the least of your concerns.

           What exactly is "suspect"? The technique of libraries or shared snippets is described above under "Shared Sub-Criteria and Repeating Snippets". Note that "shared" is not necessarily "global". It's just factoring 101: some parts are common to other parts and we try to modularize the commonalities rather than repeat patterns/idioms/code. SQL is as much subject to this as app code, especially in legacy systems with lots of historical baggage.

        And your complexity measurement seems to count the implementation of the filters but not the complexity of the PS libraries. Why is one library counted heavier than another? Just because you buy them and/or get your libraries from a big company and/or pay for them, does not automatically make them "less complex" to manage as part of a shop's tool stack.

        Almost any non-trivial API or set of API's will carry with them their own annoyances. And as described above, it's very unclear how you are measuring "complexity". I'm focusing on the efforts of the application writer/maintainer. Whether the API's used are from Oracle or the shop itself isn't going to matter much from the app maintainer's perspective. If you want to talk about "complexity" from somebody else's perspective, then name them.

      <p>
        Yeah, "loose sense" indeed. And your sense of "obvious" has consistently proved deviant. And PS's may use filters under the hood. We don't know for sure until we open them.

        {If <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> used filters "under the hood" with (presumably) query re-writing, we'd expect their execution speed to be the same when executed repeatedly as when executed once, and we'd expect that speed to be equal to (or even slightly slower than, due to the filters) executing the equivalent dynamic SQL statement.  In popular DBMSs that is not the case -- executing a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is normally considerably faster than the equivalent dynamic SQL.  That strongly implies that executing a <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> is -- as we can see in PostgreSQL and MySQL -- executing compiled code (such as a query plan or parse tree) and not filtering and re-writing a SQL query.}
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've done such tests, then please present the evidence. That's what this is all about: evidence to back claims. Further, hashing or check-sums can be used to detect if the same query is being issued.

      <p>
        {Had I known this debate would come up in my future, I'd have recorded figures.  I've used SQL Server, Oracle Database, DB2, MySQL, Sybase and PostgreSQL either in production or in-depth testing.  Their <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> performance is <strong>always</strong> as I've described.  If you don't believe me, try it for yourself.  If the same query is being issued, using filters and query re-writing it would still have to be parsed and compiled -- there would be no performance gain even if the same query is recognised.} 
      </p>
      <p>
        That's understandable, but if presentable evidence doesn't exist than it doesn't exist. That's just the way it is, and the result is anecdotal evidence. And you haven't explained why it would have to be re-parsed (if hashing is used to detect same-ness).
      </p>
      <p>
        {If you're using filters and query re-writing, every time a parameter value changes you have to re-write the query.  Otherwise, you're just executing the same query more than once.  As for anecdotal evidence, the industry has been using <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> for over a decade to avoid classic SQL injection and expedite multiple executions of parametrised queries.  That's what they're for, and that's why they exist.  If that's "anecdotal evidence", so be it.  I can imagine performance tests were done when <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> were first introduced, but now their characteristics are treated as given and we have no evidence to suggest otherwise.  If there existed a popular DBMS where <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> were always as slow to execute as corresponding dynamic SQL -- because they're implemented internally using filters and query re-writing -- there would be complaints sprayed all over the Web.}
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought you meant the exact same query, not value changes. Anyhow, you mention alleged performance benefits and alleged security benefits. Then suggest they are primarily "for" security. It appears to be a contradiction. How do you know the actual single/primary reason of usage if they have two areas of benefits?
      </p>
      <p>
        {I don't understand -- if you're executing the exact same query repeatedly, presumably it's not parametrised, right?  Indeed I mentioned performance benefits (they're not just alleged -- try it yourself) and security benefits (they're not just alleged -- try it yourself), but where did I suggest they are primarily "for" security?  <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> provide both performance improvements for multiple executions of a parametrised query and protection against classic SQL injection, though in Web development, protection against classic SQL injection is often cited as the primary reason <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are being used.}

        Most of the common <strong>dynamic languages</strong> don't have "constants".

        I am <strong>not</strong> recommending one use wrappers. The issue at hand is whether doing such is "professional malpractice", as Mr. Handlelack asserted. The ones I've used in the past were probably shop-rolled, but I never dug into the pedigree deeply. I was just told to "use them" by the project manager etc. And in some cases I rolled my own where "simple" values were being passed, such as ID numbers or category & location codes. I filtered them for say digits or digits-plus-letters such that quotes and "funny punctuation" couldn't get through. -t

And like I already pointed out, I did not write most of the ones I used, I simply used (referenced) them and did not study most of them in detail. It's possible many of those shops have since implemented the guts of them with PS's, which is the power of abstraction at work.

        If the question is about whether using wrappers would be "professional malpractice" depends on the definition of professional malpractice.  I've been in the biz for twenty years, and for all that time, large parts of the job were discovering pieces of code that went from "stupid" to "mind-bogglingly stupid".  Some of the stupidity was mine, and some was from others.  It's not all true stupidity, either; most of it is ignorance, and every time one of us grabs a new tool, we are full of ignorance yet again.  In a world like that, my bar for "professional malpractice" has to go beyond "mind-bogglingly stupid" and straight to "malicious", like adding a back door or lying to the client or something like that.
      </p>
      <p>
        If your RDBMS has <a href="PreparedStatement.html">PreparedStatement</a> capability (i.e. comes from a major vendor), and you choose to ignore it and to use unprepared SQL with some homebrew wrapper library instead, I would classify that "stupid", possibly adding "mind-bogglingly" if you're supposed to be a DBA or other DB expert.  But it's not "professional malpractice".  Presumably, Handlelack has different standards.  --<a href="RobMandeville.html">RobMandeville</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I do have a different standard.  I believe strongly that deliberately choosing weaker and/or more complex security over stronger and/or simpler security -- when all other conditions are equal -- is professional malpractice.  In most cases, our clients have neither experience nor training to appreciate the implications of programming choices, so it is up to us to make the right decisions. To do otherwise is unprofessional and unethical.</em>

        Yeah right, <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> is all my fault and none of it yours. And that intro was <em>born</em> "ruined". I was trying to improve the information value of it. I don't "inject comments" without a reason.

        Quote from <a href="http://www.jtmelton.com/2009/12/01/the-owasp-top-ten-and-esapi-part-3-injection-flaws/">http://www.jtmelton.com/2009/12/01/the-owasp-top-ten-and-esapi-part-3-injection-flaws/</a>

           "...there are a couple of things you should consider before implementing protection. First, <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are far more prevalent in industry. They are a solid solution to the SQL injection problem, and are widely understood and available. They’ve also been very widely tested both for performance and security. Essentially, they are a known entity. However, they do not solve any of the other types of injection. The equivalent to <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> do not exist for XML or XPath injection or others. You’d have to handle them differently. As for ESAPI [filter system], it will also <strong>work well, and has been tested for security</strong> and performance, but not nearly as much. Additionally, it does not have the industry reach that <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> do. However, ESAPI has a solution for the other types of injection as well, and a clear model for implementing new encoding mechanisms for new interpreter types. You can even write your own custom encoders if you choose." [Emphasis added]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Although the author believes PS's to be superior (for SQL issues), they seem to be saying that the ESAPI filters have been adequately tested and "work well". This is a far cry from "professional malpractice". -t

        <em>You've not indicated you're using ESAPI -- which would slightly mitigate my concerns -- but in-house SQL filters.  Furthermore, OWASP (at </em><a href="http://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)">http://www.owasp.org/index.php/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet)</a> has this to say about ESAPI (for SQL) and similar filters:<em> </em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"This third technique [filtering] is </em>'to escape user input before putting it in a query<strong>. If you are concerned that rewriting your dynamic queries as prepared statements or stored procedures might break your application or adversely affect performance, then this might be the best approach for you. However, this methodology </strong>is frail compared to using parameterized queries and we cannot guarantee it will prevent all SQL Injection in all situations<strong>. This technique should only be used, with caution, to retrofit legacy code in a cost effective way. </strong>Applications<strong> built from scratch, or applications requiring low risk tolerance </strong>should be built or re-written using parameterized queries.<em>' This technique works like this. Each DBMS supports one or more character escaping schemes specific to certain kinds of queries. If you then escape all user supplied input using the proper escaping scheme for the database you are using, the DBMS will not confuse that input with SQL code written by the developer, thus avoiding any possible SQL injection vulnerabilities."</em> [Emphasis added]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you wish to make a distinction and case between "organized" filters and shop-rolled filters, please do. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>ESAPI is </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, and so has had the benefit of thousands of eyes of examination, which is unlikely the case with shop-rolled filters.  The only distinction is that the former is marginally more likely to be secure, but we're talking in infinitesimals here.  Neither is good, as strongly stated in the OWASP "SQL Injection Prevention Cheat Sheet" quote above.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One could argue a case for <a href="SecurityThroughObscurity.html">SecurityThroughObscurity</a>. I'm not claiming either way, only pointing out there are multiple competing principles here and the one that "wins" is purely conjecture at this point. We need yet more conjecture like a hole in the head.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em></em><a href="SecurityThroughObscurity.html">SecurityThroughObscurity</a> is the poorest form of security.<em></em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I disagree. <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>. I'd judge it to be more unpredictable, but that's not necessarily the same as "bad". But let's not debate general <a href="SecurityThroughObscurity.html">SecurityThroughObscurity</a> here. It's off-topic.

      </ul>
      <p>
        That opinion appears be stronger on the difference than the one I quoted, but we simply have two "professional opinions" that vary. That's hardly strong enough evidence to qualify as "professional malpractice" if somebody favors the first opinion over the second. ("My expert witness can beat up YOUR expert witness.")
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your "professional opinion" puts your clients at greater risk than mine, without any benefit to your clients and with no apparent cost to you other than a slightly different coding style.  That's strong enough to qualify as professional malpractice.</em>

           That's only a claim. Claims are easy to come by.

           <em>No, </em>'you<strong> have "low-grade evidence" -- i.e., none -- to suggest that (contrary to general industry understanding) </strong><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> are subject to SQL injection, or that filters and dynamic SQL are generally as secure against SQL injection as <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Bull. You only present <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a> or metrics that give both sides equal scores.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>How so?  I'm quite certain my metrics don't give both sides equal scores.  Can you demonstrate otherwise?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You have not identified more failures with ESAPI than with say Oracle PS's, for example.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Of course.  ESAPI (or at least the SQL filter parts) was intended by its authors to be as secure as possible, in those circumstances where it's infeasible to employ </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, but even its authors note that its use of filters "is frail compared to using parameterized queries and we cannot guarantee it will prevent all SQL Injection in all situations."  Thus, ESAPI does not demonstrate "equal scores", security-wise, compared to <a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.  This has already been covered.  Go to the paragraph above starting with "You've not indicated you're using ESAPI..."<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Re: "we cannot guarantee it will prevent all SQL Injection in all situations." -- Can they guarantee that with PS's? (Note that I'm not sure a strong distinction can be made between "SQL injection" and all possible injections. I haven't seen a clear-cut definition boundary so far, but don't wish to get bogged down in a <a href="LaynesLaw.html">LaynesLaw</a> mess over such definitions if possible.) -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Whilst I doubt anyone would be so foolish as to make 100% guarantees about anything that runs on a computer, OWASP certainly isn't shy about ranking </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> above use of ESAPI with dynamic SQL, and strongly recommending that applications "should be built or re-written using parameterized queries."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's still <a href="ArgumentFromAuthority.html">ArgumentFromAuthority</a>. There are no objectively verifiable metrics, for example.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What would be an "objectively verifiable metric" for a mechanism like </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> that structurally preclude SQL injection?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I already gave an example, something like "A fails B% of the time per installment while C fails D% of the time per installment". In a decent study, one can follow the citations back to the source to inspect the details of the study.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is no evidence in the literature that </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a> have ever failed in a DBMS in a manner that resulted in SQL injection.  Thus, their apparent failure rate is 0%.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Same applies to ESAPI. <em>Booyah! </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course.  ESAPI (or at least the SQL filter parts) was intended to be as secure as possible, in those circumstances where it's infeasible to employ </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>.

      <p>
        You didn't qualify your hatred of filters at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not sure what point you're trying to make.  I don't "hate" filters.  I regard them as representing a greater SQL injection security risk than </em><a href="PreparedStatements.html">PreparedStatements</a>, for -- at best -- questionable gains that (if there are any gains at all) will only benefit the developer and not the client.
