        Why is this thing listed on <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a>? Doesn't look like it is a <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> or even has any extension which resembles that. Btw, doesn't seem all too professional anyhow (javascript: links all over, spacer gifs, bloated html templates, not even a search function). Appears that "<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>" is just used here once more as promotional <a href="BuzzWord.html">BuzzWord</a>.

        If Promotion means activity and improvement, I am for it, buzzword or not. Let's see where this goes.

        Its not listed as a Wiki on <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a>.  There is a wiki that is written as a module for <a href="DotNetNuke.html">DotNetNuke</a>.
