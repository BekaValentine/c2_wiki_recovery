        Artificial Common Sense

      <p>
        This is what I think is the big challenge in achieving <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a>. Making computers do stuff that we (<a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s) do without thinking.

           Picking up a pen and writing something down.
        </li>
        <li>
           Noticing that the pen is empty.
        </li>
        <li>
           Looking for a new one.

           Walking.

           Stuff a baby can do <strong>and can learn</strong>.

        Creating a system that will beat any living being, past present and future, at chess sounds impressive, but I would be more impressed by a robot that could walk through a door without bumping into the door frame. Or one that could walk down to the market and buy some groceries.

        <a href="WilliamGibson.html">WilliamGibson</a> in his book Idoru, quotes an unknown source (paraphrased) <em>If AI is ever achieved, it will come from the direction we least expected it.</em>
        I think it may be achieved through adding small pieces of <a href="ArtificialCommonSense.html">ArtificialCommonSense</a> until someday the whole gets bigger than the sum of the parts. -- <a href="AalbertTorsius.html">AalbertTorsius</a>

        <em>It would be interesting to find out how much </em><a href="ArtificialCommonSense.html">ArtificialCommonSense</a> has been programmed into Spirit and Opportunity Mars rovers - Spirit was able to reboot itself multiple times and re-establish contact with earth after its <a href="MarsSpiritSoftwareProblem.html">MarsSpiritSoftwareProblem</a>. They have to function highly autonomously, only receiving commands from earth a few times a day and that with many minutes delay. The environment may seem like just rocks but there is radiation, chemicals, temperature, duststorms, unpredictable terrain - all kinds of variables to stay on top of while carrying out a complex mission. The coding involved must be brilliant. Just speculating here but one of the reasons for the Flash memory problem could be more priority was given to <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a> and <a href="CommonSense.html">CommonSense</a> reasoning than more mundane things like memory and file management which could be assumed to be taken care of by the <a href="VxWorks.html">VxWorks</a> OS and standard code libraries. I did read that the memory system was given relatively less hours of testing.<em></em>
