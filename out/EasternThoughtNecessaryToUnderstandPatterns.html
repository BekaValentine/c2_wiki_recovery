        Eastern Thought Necessary To Understand Patterns

        The <a href="EasternThought.html">EasternThought</a> pages are necessary to understanding Patterns. Eastern philosophy deals with resolutions of forces, much as Patterns do, which is why they fit well onto Wiki early on.

        I find most of the eastern philosophy that has been a part of wiki from the beginning to be "noise".

        and then there's the improperly named <a href="ZenConcepts.html">ZenConcepts</a>...

        <em>Note: The original context of this page was </em><a href="WhyClublet.html">WhyClublet</a>'s desire to move Eastern philosophy content from this wiki to theirs; however, that discussion has been deleted to distill the salient points to answer the prompting statement <em>in situ</em>.<em></em>

        So do you need "eastern" thought to understand Patterns?  Or does understanding Patterns mean you understand "eastern" thought?  Does it matter that you understand Patterns or that you understand patterns?

        <em>"Wisdom" is another word that comes to mind. Patterns people and eastern thinkers would like to be wise, or failing that, at least be thought to be wise. -- </em><a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a><em></em>

        I can't see a obvious relation between patterns and Eastern Thought. But there is a correlation between <a href="EasternThought.html">EasternThought</a> and Good Programming. Good Programming knows some rules of thumb like YouCantGetEverything, EightyPercentIsEnough and <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> which all have a certain anti-neurotic and non-extreme flavour. This has a close relation to the middle path of buddhism. People following this path are more likely following the mentioned rules. In that view <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> has some very unextreme corners (no <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> and maybe <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>).

        The historical connection between patterns and Eastern Thought is, I suppose, that <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> was influenced by the Eastern Thought. But then <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a> was influenced by the thinking of Dorothy L Sayers on the trinity as he describes in <a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a>. The ability of Wiki to link such disparate concepts, very informally and anti-neurotically (I like that), has been very cool, very <a href="WabiSabi.html">WabiSabi</a>. But I honestly don't think a real Eastern guru would rate every attempt at wisdom here, would she? -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
