        Old troll sat athrone in the old folks' home<br/>
        type a keyboard, and all grown.<br/>
        Thru many a year<br/>
        lived in constant fear<br/>
        that the winds of change were blowing<br/>
        hoeing, snowing<br/>
        for many a year lived in constant fear<br/>
        that the winds of change were blowing.<br/>

        Up came Beck who warn't no Shrek<br/>
        offerin a hand up out of heck<br/>
        teams far and wide<br/>
        all squirm and cry<br/>
        their processes weren't working<br/>
        lurking, shirking<br/>
        teams far and wide they squirmed and cried<br/>
        for they knew nothing was working.<br/>

        'My lad', thought Troll, 'go jump in a hole'<br/>
        code night and day did take its toll<br/>
        'I know you're right<br/>
        and I see the light<br/>
        I'l be damned if I admit it<br/>
        pit it, sit it<br/>
        I know you're right and I see the light<br/>
        I'l be damned if I admit it'<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        'That's fine with me, but you will see,'<br/>
        said Beck to the troll, 'go Tee Dee Dee<br/>
        no a-naly-sis<br/>
        will work on this<br/>
        you owe it to You to try it.<br/>
        Buy it, fly it<br/>
        the first is free; the rest gray-vee<br/>
        you owe yourself try it.'<br/>
      </code>

        That Troll said, 'See? me smarter than thee<br/>
        you can't sell me no anomaly.<br/>
        Ward count of three<br/>
        won't Tee Dee Dee<br/>
        it's a plot to sell books and get famous<br/>
        shameless, brainless,'<br/>
        repressing his pride deep down inside,<br/>
        said, 'all's a plot to get famous'<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        But nothing's worse than the old-age curse<br/>
        to be set in ways that are all per-verse.<br/>
        To know we're right<br/>
        is the biggest fright<br/>
        he who rails the most won't admit it<br/>
        pit it, bit it<br/>
        and Troll's still there, on his derriere<br/>
        agrees the most, won't admit it.<br/>
