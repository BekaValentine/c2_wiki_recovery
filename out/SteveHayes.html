      <p>
        Originally a traditional methodology kind of guy, I've become a convert to the cause of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. My current role is XP advocate at Khatovar Technology (<a href="http://www.khatovartech.com),">http://www.khatovartech.com),</a> providing XP services in the Asia Pacific region.
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve was responsible for the introduction of XP to the Credit Technology area of <a href="GoldmanSachs.html">GoldmanSachs</a> and coached the team for over a year.
      </p>
      <p>
        Prior to that Steve worked extensively in Smalltalk and developing financial software (and often both at the same time).
      </p>
      <p>
        He and his wife Amanda live in Melbourne, Australia.
