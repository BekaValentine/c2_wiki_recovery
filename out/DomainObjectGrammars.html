        In our efforts to refactor test cases and fixtures, we discovered that creating little languages for our major <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s dramatically improved the readability and conciseness of our test code.

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a> too. I find that diligent refactoring of test cases for objects that come under the repeated and intense scrutiny of large-grained tests (such as customer tests, but not exclusively) results in simple but flexible interfaces which lend themselves well to <a href="MetaData.html">MetaData</a> encodings, and are useful "just in time" in the context of production code as well as that of test code. -- <a href="LaurentBossavit.html">LaurentBossavit</a>

        <em>Does 'little languages' mean an actual programming language, or is to do with nomenclature, or is it more of a metaphor? A concrete example would be helpful, although it might be impractical.</em>
