        Some of the very long pages in this wiki might have been better pages if they had followed a principle of focusing on one subject and linking to related subjects. This only takes the indication withing the page of the desired new subject as a <a href="WantedPage.html">WantedPage</a> with title given as an IntentionRevealingName, a save of the existing page, then the clicking on and the editing of the newly named page.

        New pages may also be created in the navigation line by simply replacing the name of the page you are on with the name of the page you wish to create, keeping the naming characteristics that of a <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>.
