           You say your employer's name, and everybody says "uh, what do you do?" or "don't know them".

           The boss single-handedly created the application you now develop. He made it using drag-and-drop tools.
          <ul>
            <li>
               The application code is so poorly architected and was developed with so poor of a process that adding even a simple feature includes weeks of puzzling over legacy code followed by more weeks of debugging.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Everyone's afraid to fix any part of the architecture because they're afraid of breaking something else in some subtle, undocumented way.
                </li>
                <li>
                   Everyone, including the boss, is on board to redesign using a better process. However, despite the fact that all work on the legacy code takes several times longer than it should, everyone is so busy working on the legacy code that no one has time to work on the new design or even to think about how to migrate to a new design and better process.

           You must lie to the customers or be tossed. (They don't care if they are caught; they're not Enron and the most they could lose is a single customer.)

               Corollary: Engineers talk directly with customers.

               Losing that single customer produces widespread panic, as everyone wonders whence their next paycheck will come.

               If you need the latest version of a source file, it's easier to copy it from the working directory of whoever's working on it, rather than having him check in his changes.

               The source code for the company's main product consists of a single source file, which only the original developer understands.

            <li>
               The products, all of which are variants of the original product, are all kept as separate source streams, and changes that affect all of them have to be made to each source tree separately.
              <ul>

                   ... and the only up-to-date copies of any of them are on the chief developer's workstation.

           There's nothing stopping you from putting <em>anything</em> on your office. You can literally put your living quarters there -- fridge, coffee machine, stove, bed, blanket, your own posters -- and nobody will say anything.

               If the president or the chief developer is out, the office is left closed for the day.

           Your company has been awarded a (single) patent -- a fact which is mentioned prominently in <em>all</em> marketing and investment collateral, as if the patent were for the cure for cancer. (In reality, it's for some obscure improvement to some technology which is easily worked around.)

           True story: at an open-space job interview at a start-up they asked me what my pay expectations were. I replied, "I'm trying to break into this new specialty, so I'll accept peanuts." A voice then rang out from a random cubicle: "Well, that's exactly what they pay here!"

        My last job used to be like this. I hope to work in a company like that again. This is where the fun is.

      <p>
        <em>So just out of curiosity. . . Why aren't you still there? I was at a company like that (<deleted due to stupid lawsuit-happy culture>), great company, free Steak-Out on thursdays, $50 bills for everyone on record months, got up to nearly 300 people, then was bought out, then "dissolved" a few months later. I got out early, it wasn't writing on the wall. It was more like a giant billboard with big letters saying "they have our IP, they don't need us anymore" </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not there because I'm getting a phD and the company grown and right now it isn't as fun as it used to be. But I'll return soon.
      </p>

        [I used to work at a company like this, too. It was acquired, after which we were all laid off. Very sad, and I greatly miss working there. When done right, it's much more like being part of a family than working for an employer.] <strong>Yes, and it sure seems to be a good motivator to all employees. It encourages everyone to do their best, because they feel that sense of responsibility that comes from family. At least it has been that way from my experience. :)</strong> (I'm now back with another company like this. Something occurred to me today: You know you're <em>back</em> in a wild-west company when Dilbert is funny again.) <em>[Negative. Dilbert is always funny, has always been funny, and will always be funny because it's based on reality. Adams hissef admitted that he got the bulk of his material straight out of emails, 85% of which started with the line, "I am not making this up..."]</em>
