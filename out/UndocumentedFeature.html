        Undocumented Feature
      </h1>
      <p>
        A feature which exists, but is not in the documentation. Possible reasons for this include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Feature came out after documentation was written
        </li>
        <li>
           A developer got overly fancy late one night
        </li>
        <li>
           The feature has not been tested at time of release deadline
        </li>
        <li>
           Backward or cross-vendor compatibility. Sometimes vendors want to make stuff portable from the other system, but don't wish to promote competitor's features or API's.
        </li>
        <li>
           Feature was never designed at all; the system behaves a certain way neither required nor forbidden by the specification, and a user finds it handy
        </li>
        <li>
           Bug gets good marketing
        </li>
      </ul>
