        Patterns Form Basis Fora Profession

        Unless a terminology is standardized and published you can not reasonably talk about it and nor is it easy to teach or learn. In interviews I ask "how you can you reduce inter-module dependencies." As a response I should get back more than 5+ strategies. Instead usually I get a lot of silence. This and many other topics are something people should know and be able to talk about as general concepts. People should be able to say I have this problem what are my options for solving it. Without codifying knowledge we can't do this. Imagine a medical profession that didn't standardize on body part names. Imagine if chemicals didn't have standard names. Programming needs this level of standardization and we have quite a number of ideas that can be teased out from craft and made common. This is all patterns are.

        The cynic would say that patterns form a basis for a profession for those who make a profession talking about them. In any event, we already have a common language. Patterns add to that. Apart from which it takes more than a common vocabulary to make a profession.

        Certainly. It's a necessary, but not sufficient condition. If we have a common language for talking about things like singleton I'm not aware of it. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
