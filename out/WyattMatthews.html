        Graduated with a CS degree I never seem to use, but other than that, I'm an explorer of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a>. Site changed. Will one day post it again when I have time to re-build the site.

        Who knows... maybe I will expand things out...

        Currently working on a website using Php and Html > <a href="http://www.wcm-itconsultant.com.">http://www.wcm-itconsultant.com.</a> This is the only link you'll see here to it as it is off-topic....
      </p>

        Also, for those who really want something off topic, check out my thoughts for space colonization at <a href="http://star-colony.blogspot.com/.">http://star-colony.blogspot.com/.</a>

        After rereading some pages I used to frequent, I thought I'd post this thought, although some may agree it doesn't apply:
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider the concept of Infinity. It is defined as the unreachable (or at least) furthest point from where you started. In numbers, there are considered to be 2 infinities: positive and negative.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some cases, it is impractical or unnecessary to consider an unrepresented infinity, consider angles over 360 degrees on a perfect circle (YAGNI!). You could therefore chose a point that is the furthest possible distance to be infinity (180 degrees).
      </p>
      <p>
        So what is the use? We can ponder that later, but consider binary - you only have 2 values.

        I drew up a bunch of story cards recently to try and piece together a clean understanding of certain elements of XP.

        I've read around the site and one thing becomes clear to me.... <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a>ing is not considered mature because we don't have the equivalent of standardized nuts (access method?), bolts (methods?), boards (classes?), and washers (interfaces?). So I am Proposing a new topic line: What is our toolbox? What are our <a href="NutsAndBolts.html">NutsAndBolts</a> of software? I am not talking about introducing language dependent code (that would be a waste of time) but perhaps a good pseudo-code description that can be easily ported to common languages as, hopefully, both OAOO and DTSTTCPW compliant.

        I would hope so Dave. It is my intent to clear that up not only in my mind, but everyone else's as well. WM

        Ach. I still don't know what I wanted with <a href="NutsAndBolts.html">NutsAndBolts</a>. Even a week of not looking at the page still does not help me in summarizing it in an objective way. :(
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, I've given up on my <a href="NutsAndBolts.html">NutsAndBolts</a> project and intend instead to try and make a suitable <a href="PatternTree.html">PatternTree</a> showing Pattern-subPattern relationships as I've understood them.
