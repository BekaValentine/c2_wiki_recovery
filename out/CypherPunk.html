        Cypher Punk

      <p>
        Hackers deriving social background from <a href="CyberPunk.html">CyberPunk</a>, technical approach from <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a>, and attitude from CryptoAnarchism. (more description please)    <a href="JohnGilmore.html">JohnGilmore</a> is a notable example.  Of course there are many personal opinions within this very vaguely defined group.  At one time this all happened on a list at toad.com, but it suffers badly from noise.

        The motto: ``cypherpunks write code<em> is a way of keeping away from the pretension and daydreaming that plagues people who only talk about </em>CryptoAnarchism.
