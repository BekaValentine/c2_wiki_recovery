        I wish people would bother to check that the page looks like they intended. Sometimes I feel that poorly formatted pages should simply be deleted, ratehr than trying to salvage them ...

        A flowchart is described as "cross-functional" when the page is divided into different "lanes" describing the control of different organizational units. A symbol appearing in a particular "lane" is within the control of that organizational unit. This technique allows the analyst to locate the responsibility for performing an action or making a decision correctly, allowing the relationship between different organizational units with responsibility over a single process.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Input/Output, represented as a parallelogram.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Examples: Get X from the user; usually containing the word "Start" or "End", or another phrase signaling the start or end of a process, such as "submit enquiry" or "receive product". 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Arrows, showing what's called "flow of display X. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Conditional (or decision), represented as a diamond (rhombus).
          <ul>
            <li>
               These typically contain a Yes/No question or True/False test.
            </li>
            <li>
               This symbol is unique in that it has two arrows coming out of it, usually from the bottom point and right point, one corresponding to Yes or True, and one corresponding to No or False. The arrows should always be labeled.
            </li>
            <li>
               More than two arrows can be used, but this is normally a clear indicator that a complex decision is being taken, in which case it may need to be broken-down further, or replaced with the "pre-defined process" symbol. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A number of other symbols that have less universal currency, such as: 
          <ul>
            <li>
               A Document represented as a rectangle with a wavy base; 
            </li>
            <li>
               A Manual input represented by rectangle, with the top irregularly sloping up from left to right. An example would be to signify data-entry from a form; 
            </li>
            <li>
               A Manual operation represented by a trapezoid with the longest parallel side utmost, to represent an operation or adjustment to process that can only be made manually. 
            </li>
            <li>
               A Data File represented by a cylinder 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note: All process symbols within a flowchart should be numbered. Normally a number is inserted inside the top of the shape to indicate which step the process is within the flowchart. 
      </p>

        Flowcharts may contain other symbols, such as connectors, usually represented as circles, to represent converging paths in the flow chart. Circles will have more than one arrow coming into them but only one going out. Some flow charts may just have an arrow point to another arrow instead. These are useful to represent an iterative process (what in Computer Science is called a loop). A loop may, for example, consist of a connector where control first enters, processing steps, a conditional with one arrow exiting the loop, and one going back to the connector. Off-page connectors are often used to signify a connection to a (part of a) process held on another sheet or screen. It is important to remember to keep these connections logical in order. All processes should flow from top to bottom and left to right.
