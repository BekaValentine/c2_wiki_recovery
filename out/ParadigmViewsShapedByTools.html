        Paradigm Views Shaped By Tools
      </h1>
      <p>
        If I only had used <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> RDBMS instead of <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a> and other nimble table tools, I might not have been such a table fan. Also in OOP debates, often people's complaints about procedural programming come from limits of the C language instead of limits of procedural, but they associate it with procedural in general. I think one's views of paradigms/techniques are shaped by their experience with specific tools and languages rather than a wider view of what a paradigm/technique is capable of. It is not that I am complaining, but merely pointing it out. We all only live one life and thus cannot experience everything.
