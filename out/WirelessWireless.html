        We are all familiar, and are found using, the commonly known <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> platform for connecting our computing devices to the WWW.
      </p>
      <p>
        What if, in order to enable portable, extensible <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> Networks, the network hub to which devices connect, were portable, self-powered, and connected via a specially designed high-capacity (fast) hub within its range, potentially within a mile, within six-miles, or hovering (as in satellite, blimp, or drone).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           applications
          <ul>
            <li>
               human convening assemblies as in conferences, assemblies, temporary-venues, civilian or military operations (as in disaster-relief), meant to enable a communication and networking potential of portable, relocatable nature
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        How would this, or does this work?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ordinary devices would access the portable <a href="WirelessWireless.html">WirelessWireless</a> call if for fun, the <a href="WiWiFiNetwork.html">WiWiFiNetwork</a>, as they would an ordinary <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> Network
        </li>
        <li>
           The NetworkingDevice would be capable of serving many (hundreds, perhaps thousands of <a href="WiFi.html">WiFi</a> Hubs, placed in convenient locations to service its own temporary and/or relocatable PeoplesUnit 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Convoys
            </li>
            <li>
               Moveable Venues and Mobile Service Units (thinking again - disaster or humanitarian relief units or operations)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The NeworkingDevice would be capable of connecting to a WideAreaNetwork, or a public, secondary, or private Internetwork with sufficient bandwidth and speed as to enable adequate if not exceptional services to its clients.
