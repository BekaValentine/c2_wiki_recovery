        Code generation tool with long Macintosh history, by Spec Bowers, one of the original <a href="FileMakerPro.html">FileMakerPro</a> authors (before selling it to Claris who then became Filemaker.com).
      </p>
      <p>
        Visually edit screens, menus and specify commands and data definitions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Generates range of C/C++ output including (of course) <a href="PowerPlant.html">PowerPlant</a> and via the add-on <a href="AppMakerForWindows.html">AppMakerForWindows</a> will generate MFC code.
      </p>

        There are demos on <a href="CodeWarrior.html">CodeWarrior</a> CD's and downloadable from the home page <a href="http://members.aol.com/bowersdev/.">http://members.aol.com/bowersdev/.</a>

        I (<a href="AndyDent.html">AndyDent</a>) have worked on a number of code generators and used others. <a href="AppMaker.html">AppMaker</a> is impressively flexible, being like Smalltalk IDE's in that the dictionary of generatable objects and their property dialogs are all soft-defined within <a href="AppMaker.html">AppMaker</a>'s metamodel so you can extend them. The full source code of the code generation templates is included - I enhanced the <a href="PowerPlant.html">PowerPlant</a> one to include our OOFILE database engine and then went on to develop the MFC generator with only the publicly available documentation and the original template sources.
      </p>
      <p>
        On bigger projects, I've found the ability to write your own code generators very useful - <a href="AppMaker.html">AppMaker</a> ships with several utility scripts I wrote, eg: cross-referencing all commands so you can tell if someone linked the wrong command to a button, cross-referencing all pictures.
