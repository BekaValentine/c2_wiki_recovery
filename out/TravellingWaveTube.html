        Travelling Wave Tube
      </h1>
      <p>
        A traveling wave tube (TWT) is a high-tech vacuum tube. TWTs are used as high-power microwave amplifiers in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Satellites (DirecTV, DirecPC, pagers, telephones, XMradio, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Military radar systems (missile guidance, aircraft / missile tracking, jamming systems)
        </li>
        <li>
           Civilian radar systems
        </li>
        <li>
           Civilian microwave radios (e.g. British "Marconi" system)
        </li>
      </ul>

        EDD also makes the Xenon Ion Propulsion System (XIPS). NASA used these <a href="IonThruster.html">IonThruster</a>s to propel the Deep Space 1 probe. Boeing uses them to keep its new satellites in orbit.  <a href="http://www.twtas.com/pictures/factorywalk/xips/xipspage.html">http://www.twtas.com/pictures/factorywalk/xips/xipspage.html</a>  [Broken link, but available via the <a href="WaybackMachine.html">WaybackMachine</a>]

        When I worked on Marconi microwave radios (late 60s, early 70s) I had to go to a special tech school (High Wycombe) to learn how that stuff worked as opposed to the Lenkurt klystrons I was used to.  Bloody science fiction.  Very cool stuff.  Helical coil of thin wire running down the inside of a finger-sized glass (vaccuum) tube with a large metal head.  Sleeved in a jacket of silicone grease.  Tuned by rotating the tube along its axis for max gain.

        I'd like to say I fully understood how it worked, but that's more hubris than I can muster just now.  I could keep it alive and keep working levels and do the maintenance and repair on the racks, but actually grasping the electro-math that ran it was something else.  Hats off to whoever figured out how to make a useful RF amplifier/modulator with it.

        We pronounced it "twot" in our organization.
