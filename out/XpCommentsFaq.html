        Anything. Just do it.

        we'd get in trouble. XP either generates documentation for free, as part of
        otherwise required practices (like the stack of finished user story cards),
        or it makes any extra documentation efforts a schedulable <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>.
        The catch is it removes paperwork from the design/code feedback loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Point One: Expect to start any "draw pictures of the code" phase by just looking at the existing artifacts; loci of changes in the code, etc. Point Two: The catch is XP removes paperwork from the design/code feedback loop. Just do it.

        I didn't. Please locate such a word so I can amend the records.

        Replace with "XP can reduce", tap the test button...
      </p>
      <p>
        Assertions pass!

        XP makes good documentation easier because it keeps paperwork out of the class structure upgrade path. If you feel like changing code, it versions that moment. You don't have to fill out a form, no matter how floral, before just fixing something, anywhere.
      </p>
      <p>
        This frees unimaginable time for the enabled to view that code in situ and report on its current state, in correct graphs and such. I would love to just do that for a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you feel like writing a library of books about a single project for many years for no apparent reason, XP sees no reason to try to stop you.

        And all are written in a local English. You can read them. After the fact, they appear to you like notes taken about the endeavor as it happened: All one big forensic log. If you thought you had to...

        <em>And the answer to Randall's question is: </em>
        The running code, the unit tests, the functional tests, and the story cards 
        document the result...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yep. They are all readable. I didn't point that out because it's going in the FAQ real soon.
