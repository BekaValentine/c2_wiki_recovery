        [Refactoring note: it seems obvious that <a href="GeekNight.html">GeekNight</a> is <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>, so far as Topic is well defined.  However "<a href="WikiIsNotYourBlog.html">WikiIsNotYourBlog</a>" suggests that someone should filter the bits of signal from the history and let the rest go out of scope when it is done.  Does this seem fair?  -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>]
