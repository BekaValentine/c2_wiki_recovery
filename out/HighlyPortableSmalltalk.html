        Highly Portable Smalltalk
      </h1>
      <p>
        HPS stood for "Highly Portable Smalltalk". Some people might
        say it stood for
        "High Performance Smalltalk", but they'd be wrong.
        Anyway, HPS was the
        code name for <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a>'s Smalltalk-80 implementation begun in 1986 to replace the inaptly named PS or <a href="PortableSmalltalk.html">PortableSmalltalk</a> that
        <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a> took as its inheritance from PARC.

      <p>
        The first version of HPS was shipped as <a href="ObjectWorks.html">ObjectWorks</a> version 2.5.
        Like PS,it used Deutsch-Schiffman DynamicTranslation (now called
        "<a href="JustInTimeCompilation.html">JustInTimeCompilation</a>"), in-line caching and multiple representations of contexts. Unlike PS, it was written in C (rather
        than MC68000 assembly) and 
        it had a generation scavenging storage manager (rather than using
        deferred reference counting).
      </p>
      <p>
        HPS was developed primarily by <a href="PeterDeutsch.html">PeterDeutsch</a> (code generation), FrankJackson (storage management) and <a href="AllanSchiffman.html">AllanSchiffman</a> (everything else). Many other people worked on it later; deserving special mention are David Liebs, Steve Dahl, Elgin Lee, Russ Pencin, Ron Carter and Jan
        Bottorf.
