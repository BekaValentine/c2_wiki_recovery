        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In what thread should the GUI events be processed?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A MultiThreaded event-based GUI, typically a Swing application or any GUI application needing to perform some background processing using several threads and reporting the progress to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        All events should be dispatched and processed through a clearly-documented <a href="GuiThread.html">GuiThread</a>. In a Windows application, this is typically the MainThread. Ideally, it is also the thread that created all the GUI widgets. If it is not the case, you might have a problem if the GUI library is not thread-safe.
      </p>
      <p>
        Any background thread should report its progress to the GUI by posting messages through the <a href="GuiThread.html">GuiThread</a> event queue. A background thread should never access the GUI immediately, as most GUI libraries are not <a href="ThreadSafe.html">ThreadSafe</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most GUI frameworks allow you to dispatch events through its <a href="EventQueue.html">EventQueue</a>. In Java AWT, you can dispatch a Runnable in the AWT EventThread. On Windows, you can post the WM_USER message.
      </p>
