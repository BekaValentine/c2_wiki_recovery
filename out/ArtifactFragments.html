        In the work I am doing to modify my Nys Artifactories to make them easier to use with minimal malfunctioning, designed to enhance and extend a pattern of <a href="WikiWithMoreThanPages.html">WikiWithMoreThanPages</a>. The work has made it more apparent as it continues that we are working with only a segment of a greater organized whole. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I am thinking along these lines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A Title is a descriptive name, used as a heading for a paragraph, page, chapter, section, book, category (collection of books), library part (wing), library whole, and its institution.
        </li>
        <li>
           A Sentence is a slice of a paragraph ending with a period.
        </li>
        <li>
           A Note can be a paragraph or part of a paragraph
          <ul>
            <li>
               Several notes fused into paragraphs together can make up a page
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A Page can be one or more pages which together deal with a subject or topic in a specific way
          <ul>
            <li>
               Several pages fused together can make up a chapter
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A Chapter is a collection of related pages (topics) which deal with different aspects of a subject or topic
          <ul>
            <li>
               Several chapters fused together can make up a Section
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A Section can treat an overall topic or subject in many of its aspects and its make-up
          <ul>
            <li>
               Several Sections fused together can make up a Book
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           A Book can treat a Category of interest and be placed in a collection of Books in a wing of a Library
          <ul>
            <li>
               Several Wings can be fused together to form an Individual, Corporate, or Institutional Library.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of the InformationScenarios, from the note, to the CompleteLibrary can operate in as Container for or collection of Artifacts and Artifactories at each level of complexity. Artifactories used may include a simple editor which can save and retrieve notes, or a Server which can complete complicated and exhaustive searches for information. Information can be organized, assembled and made reachable for the individual, group, or agency. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="HyperLink.html">HyperLink</a> is an excellent pattern for manipulating structures and operations. They can bring sense and order to fragments and techniques. When employing them to build collections, containers, and compositions one may reach the ultimate goal of Artifacts which are <a href="UsefulUsableUsed.html">UsefulUsableUsed</a>.
