        Four Freedoms
      </h1>
      <p>
        From a speech by Franklin Roosevelt:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>"</em><a href="FreedomOfSpeech.html">FreedomOfSpeech</a> and expression everywhere in the world."<em> </em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>"Freedom Of Worship of every person to worship God in his own way - everywhere in the world."</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>"Freedom from Want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants - everywhere in the world."</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>"Freedom from Fear, which, translated into world terms, means a world-wide reduction of armaments to such a point and in such a thorough fashion that no nation will be in a position to commit an act of physical aggression against any neighbor - anywhere in the world."</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>"That is no vision of a distant millennium. It is a definite basis for a kind of world attainable in our own time and generation. That kind of world is the very antithesis of the so called new order of tyranny which the dictators seek to create with the crash of a bomb. To that new order we oppose the greater conception - the moral order A good society is able to face schemes of world domination and foreign revolutions alike without fear."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"Since the beginning of our American history we have been engaged in change, in a perpetual, peaceful revolution, a revolution which goes on steadily, quietly, adjusting itself to changing conditions without the concentration camp or the quicklime in the ditch. The world order which we seek is the cooperation of free countries, working together in a friendly, civilized society."</em>
      </p>

        <em>Not at all. We have an even more inspiring vision now, </em>GeorgeBushsFourFreedoms.<em></em>

        You forgot the sarcasm tag.

        Don't know what happened to those links, but this is a combined graphic -- and a bonus explaining them.

           Cafepress, aber naturlich. Found via googling: There's a "w2arts" shop there with a line of WWII-themed t-shirts, such as "Ours to fight for: freedom from want". <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/w2arts/132038">http://www.cafeshops.com/w2arts/132038</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Others may prefer "M-1 Does My Talking", <a href="http://www.cafeshops.com/w2arts/139076">http://www.cafeshops.com/w2arts/139076</a> :-)
        </li>
        <li>
           On the left of those pages is a list of quite a few other T-shirts (and coffee cups etc) they offer in WWII themes.

        What about Richard Stallman's four freedoms? That would be more on topic.
