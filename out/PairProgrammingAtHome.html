        Pair Programming At Home
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> at home together with a visiting programmer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Benefits from <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> at home:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          You don't get lonely, which is often the main problem for telecommuters.
        </li>
        <li>
          Other people (wife, kids, visitors ...) are less inclined to disturb you when you are two working together.
        </li>
        <li>
          It feels more like "real work", so you are less inclined to be disturbed by other domestic tasks.
        </li>
        <li>
          It is easier to set and follow a time schedule (to avoid over/underwork)
        </li>
        <li>
          If you find a partner living close to you transportation time/cost will be low/nonexistant.
        </li>
        <li>
          Rotating which home will be used as workplace creates a change of scenery.
        </li>
        <li>
          You may encounter an opportunity to have a dinner with the family of your co-worker.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Could maybe be called ExtremeTelecommuting?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        You could imagine that a small team of programmers, living close to each other, could create a VirtualCompany and have all the benefits of both <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> and <a href="TeleCommuting.html">TeleCommuting</a>.
