        On Software Development:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            I have always been interested in unconventional means of designing and coding software. The common sense ideas I came up with independently (in the 1980s) meshed with my later studies of iterative development - and conversely, clashed with the accepted <em>norm</em> of strict waterfall methodology in the shops where I have worked. More recently, I've become a <a href="SystemArchitect.html">SystemArchitect</a> - and in that role have attempted to make headway on iterative/cyclical/agile development front with meager success... in fear of becoming part of the Borg.  Signatory of the <a href="AgileManifesto.html">AgileManifesto</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            I attempt to <a href="AvoidComplexity.html">AvoidComplexity</a> on a daily basis.  (Life and projects are complicated enough as it is.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Most of my coding now is for my own amusement at home - so software development is something I am enjoying more now than I used to (hard to really enjoy something when someone is breathing down your back to get it done).  Thinking of starting an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> project, or joining someone else's.

        Personal History:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Was a larval programmer in the early '80s - Basic and Fortran were the tools used in this exploration.  Actually used a printer/terminal back in the day (I believe it was attached to a VAX system).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Served in the military for a decade.  At one point I would deliver punch card decks to a facility to feed an ancient mainframe computer - those were the good old days.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            Pursued a Computer Science degree - 30 hours remaining.  On the short list now to return and finish (okay - maybe the long list - as wife balefully glares in my direction).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
            15+ years experience in IT, both in software development (userland applications, metrics analysis/modeling, system management and logging, and systems integration) and in support (Unix/Linux system administrator, technical support for applications, and network engineer (responsible for capacity analysis, ordering new circuits, and design of transport)).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Skills:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Shell scripting, to include sh (prefer bash)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Python. (Python has completely replaced Perl, sed, awk, and  Java in my projects.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Basic, Fortran, C/C++, Lisp, Sun RISC Assembler, 80x86 Assembler, Perl, Java - haven't touched these in many years.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Tool Bigotry:
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes I love Python; my next large personal project will be in python (I'm always tempted to do <a href="PrematureOptimization.html">PrematureOptimization</a> - but resist the temptation).
