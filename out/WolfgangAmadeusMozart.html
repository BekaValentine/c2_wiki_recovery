      </h1>
      <p>
        Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was born in the beautiful town of Salzburg in the Austrian mountains on January 27,1756. Wolfgang's real name was Johannes Chrysostomus Wolfgang Theophilus Amadeus Mozart. Mozart could write notes before he could write words. When he was 5 he wrote a piano solo called A Minuet.

        Someone deleted the above comment (which I did not write). Surely the answer below implies that it's the biography itself that needs to be deleted? (Or rewritten)
