        Purpose Of This Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        An open invitation to everyone to give their opinion of what this wiki should be. {<a href="JuneZeroFive.html">JuneZeroFive</a>}

        This wiki is a repository of ideas, opinions, philosophies, and anecdotes about software development techniques. It is the best place to get multiple opinions and viewpoints about ideas and approaches, even if it takes a little digging around to find it. Even if it doesn't give you (direct) answers, it may <strong>inspire questions</strong> that help you think deeper or that you can research in other places. --top

        <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> should be exactly what it is -- a repository and reflection (in all meanings of the word <strong>"reflection"</strong>) of computing practice and culture.  It is more than just software development ideas, opinions and anecdotes.  This is demonstrated by the existence of categories like <a href="CategoryEasternThought.html">CategoryEasternThought</a>, pages like <a href="TravellingWaveTube.html">TravellingWaveTube</a> and even "controversial" ones like <a href="PinkFloyd.html">PinkFloyd</a>, which have nothing to do with software development but remain because they are generally reflective of the interests and culture of the people who interact with <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.  Clearly, there will be a "leading edge" of <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>-to-some and <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a>-to-others topics that fall on the boundaries of computing culture, but over time these will either be culled or included as the <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> see fit. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

           I like the choice of the word "reflection".

           <quote>This site's primary focus is <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>. However, it is more than just an <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>. It started there, but the theme has created a culture and <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> all its own. All Wiki content is <a href="WorkInProgress.html">WorkInProgress</a>. Most of all, this is a forum where people share ideas! It changes as people come and go. Much of the information here is subjective.</quote> So... at least 51% about "<a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>" and the rest, or balance, is up to the community to decide.
