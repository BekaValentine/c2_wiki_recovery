        I don't consider browsing Wiki while at work to be a bad thing at all.  There is so much here about programming and related ideas that when I'm stuck in a rut and not being productive, I'll come to Wiki, scan the <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> or type in some keywords, and see where I end up.  Often by getting my mind off one problem and thinking about something else for a while, I find it helps me.  And even with it doesn't, I usually learn something interesting or useful. -- <a href="JohnPassaniti.html">JohnPassaniti</a>

        I'm also considering reading Wiki while the compiler crunches away as not such a bad thing. Keeps your mind fresh.... -- <a href="AndreSlabber.html">AndreSlabber</a>
