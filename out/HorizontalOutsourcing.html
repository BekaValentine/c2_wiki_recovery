        Horizontal Outsourcing
      </h1>
      <p>
        Although I am not fond of offshore outsourcing, it seems that those doing it are perhaps going about it wrongly. When working on stuff, there are often issues that are fairly easy to pass on to somebody else without passing on tons of details or domain knowledge, such as figuring out a specific bug or getting something to work. Example, "Can you find a way to get <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> to make this form element disappear when I press this button?"
      </p>
      <p>
        This would allow onshore workers to focus more on domain issues, which they have better access to, and less on the nitty gritty of technology. Instead, the approach seems to be all or nothing.
