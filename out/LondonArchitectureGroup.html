      <p>
        An informal group of developers in <a href="LondonTown.html">LondonTown</a> who meet every month or so to discuss software architecture.  We met and discuss <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a>, <a href="LayeredFrameworks.html">LayeredFrameworks</a>, <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a>, and <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a>.

        A joint meeting with the inaugural get together of the LondonExtremeGroup (LEG), formerly the <a href="LondonXpCommunity.html">LondonXpCommunity</a> is proposed. The Xpers (there may even be some closet Xpers in LAG) are very interested in architecture but only in short bursts.  They'll leave quietly and discuss the future of LEG at another table if anyone asks.  Would help to know which pub to start in though.
      </p>
      <p>
        The LAG have traditionally met in the boardroom of "The City Pipe", a wine bar close to St. Paul's tube station.  <a href="CharlesWeir.html">CharlesWeir</a> will have details...
      </p>

      <p>
        From St Pauls Tube, head North up St. Martins on the Cheapside corner. Almost immediately you reach a wine bar called the City Vaults. Go inside and somewhere in there is a linking corridor to the City Pipe. 6:45 in "The Boardroom".
      </p>

        When is the next meeting of either of these two groups?

        <em>A: August 25th at the City Pipe, 6:45pm</em> (see also: <a href="http://demo.niki.co.uk:9001/servlets/niki?get=LondonExtremeGroup">http://demo.niki.co.uk:9001/servlets/niki?get=LondonExtremeGroup</a> <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>)

        London Architecture Group seems to have disappeared in the early 2000s.
      </p>
      <p>
        From 1999 to 2009 (ongoing) much of its role is played by the <a href="ExtremeTuesdayClub.html">ExtremeTuesdayClub</a> (XtC).  As of 2009, meeting every Tuesday at 6 pm at various pubs in central London, often in the City.  <a href="http://xpday-london.editme.com/eXtremeTuesdayClub">http://xpday-london.editme.com/eXtremeTuesdayClub</a> (archive of the first ten years at <a href="http://www.xpdeveloper.net/xpdwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=XtC">http://www.xpdeveloper.net/xpdwiki/Wiki.jsp?page=XtC</a> )
