        A forum where jr.high math classes can collaborate to solve their problems with exponents.  Go ahead, ask a question and somebody else can help you soon!

        <em>If you like, you can probably easily setup and run your own wiki.  Ask on this wiki if you need help or suggestions.</em>

        That's ok.  Do you think there is a place on wikis that I can set this up? How do I set up my own page in the right place?

        <em></em><a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> ( <a href="http://www.seedwiki.com/">http://www.seedwiki.com/</a> ) looks like a good place where you can setup your own wiki for free.  If that isn't good enough though, let me know.<em></em>

        <em>Why not just show the classes how logarithms reduce such problems to basic arithmetic and algebra? One assumes they don't have to discuss how to add, subtract, multiply and divide, whether using numbers or simple algebraic expressions. Of course, another solution is to offer them a small bribe to pay attention in the first place when you explain how exponents work! Yet another approach would be to set up a wiki locally, assuming you have a local network. If you use any wiki for your original purpose, we'd like to know about it.
