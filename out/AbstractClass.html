        Abstract Class
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="AbstractClass.html">AbstractClass</a> is a class that represents abstract concepts for which objects cannot exist. (paraphrased from <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        All classes are either Abstract or Concrete. Instances of abstract classes cannot be created. Instances of concrete classes can be created.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are generally two uses for abstract classes: <strong>interfaces</strong>, and <strong>building blocks</strong>. (concepts from Stroustrup)
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstract classes with no implementation are useful for defining the <strong>interface</strong> to a set of classes, the "contract" between the user and implementation of some functionality. These interface classes are often found at the top of class hierarchies.
      </p>
      <p>
        Abstract classes with <em>some</em> implementation are useful as <strong>building blocks</strong>, and are often found in the middle of class hierarchies.  They often contain common functionality that has been pushed up from concrete classes, but they are still <em>incomplete</em> - they need to be derived and finished before instances of them can be created.
