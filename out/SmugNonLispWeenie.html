        Smug Non Lisp Weenie
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>I think I've just transcended to become a</em> <strong>smug</strong> <em>non Lisp weenie:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The claims for the superiority of Lisp are pretty much a(n inside) joke, as you can make Lisp do anything (i.e., behave like any other language).  
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore, of course it's superior.  It takes a little bit (!!) of digging to get the joke.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Furthermore, I think a lot of Lisp weenies don't get the joke!

        <em>Anonymous again: I suppose my first post above</em> <strong>is</strong> <em>overly cynical.  I do recognize some good things in Lisp based on the reading I've done (continuations, closures, and the like), and wish that SICP had been available when I was in school.  (Graduated in 1972, I'll have to check the copyright on SICP (</em><a href="StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms.html">StructureAndInterpretationOfComputerPrograms</a>)--although I did take a Lisp course, the text, iirc, was the "Lisp 1.5 Programmer's Manual") (I thought there was another text for the course as well, but can't recall / put my fingers on it.)  Guess I'll end up doing some serious reading in SICP.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        SICP isn't really a lisp (nor scheme) book.  It is one of the best computer science texts written though, so well worth the time.  As for the rest of this page --- well I don't see really how you have addressed the superiority of lisp but that is ok :)

        I feel myself to be a <a href="SmugNonLispWeenie.html">SmugNonLispWeenie</a> too. I spent a lot of time learning lisp (and a fair amount of money on books), and I found the process very exciting. But now that I come full circle, I find myself not needing to use it in everyday work. I'd use Lisp/Scheme for hardcore comp-sci-ish projects, like compilers/interpreters and maybe for exploration in math and algorithms, but when it comes time to build an application I'd much rather use something else.

        This doesn't mean Lisp was a waste of time for me. It was an incredible experience and my code has improved dramatically because of it. Code that I used to find inscrutable now makes sense (the author had a lispy frame of mind too, I suppose). Languages that I once struggled with (Haskell and Prolog, for example) now make sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd say Lisp is more valuable to me as a self improvment tool than as an actual development environment, to me.
