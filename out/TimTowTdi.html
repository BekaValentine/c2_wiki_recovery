        Pronounced as tim-tow-tiddy, for the effect described below.

        Oh. I thought <a href="TimTowTdi.html">TimTowTdi</a> was the sound Pooh keeps saying to himself as he looks through his kitchen or walks through the woods (best spoken with a slight English accent).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OMG, I came here with very much the same thought in mind!</em>

      <p>
        Uh, I thought it was Tim Toady.

        I learned it and inscribed it in my copy of <em></em><a href="ProgrammingPerl.html">ProgrammingPerl</a><em> as Tim Tow 2Di.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since <a href="TimTowTdi.html">TimTowTdi</a>, I say it as tim-tow-dy (with a silent third T). The second syllable rhymes with cow, not toe.

        This seems a bit odd to me. It seems to me that "there should be one - and preferably only one - obvious way to do it (although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch)".
      </p>
      <p>
        Then again, you can probably guess where my sympathies lie. :-)

        Is there more than one sensible way to do it, though? Is one way sensible enough and consistent enough, over all the other ridiculous creative concoctions available?  Is there one better way to do it, that can be communicated easier in the future in a more human way (humans remember and prounounce words, but have a hard time pronouncing @*)@$^&&&&@$^). Rhetorical questions.
