        Encrypting Personal Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        It was suggested, by an anonymous author, that perhaps a personal wiki should have encryption ability to protect personal information from others. The entries and poorly contrived <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> were deleted. There was some confusing talk of using https, but how this relates to a personal wiki exactly I am not sure. However, encryption of a personal wiki is an interesting idea.

        A solution for encryption of a Personal Wiki, may be to use an encrypted container (basically an image of a drive/disk/CD that is mountable as a virtual drive) for your wiki installation. Here are some current freeware on-the-fly-encryption (OTFE) software:
