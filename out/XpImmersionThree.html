        Tom <a href="DeMarco.html">DeMarco</a> was present throughout the day.  He made an amazing comment early on.  He said: "XP isn't just the best game in town -- it's the *only* game in town."

The system clock example struck home with me ( <a href="ErikMeade.html">ErikMeade</a> ) as a concrete example of why programming languages need multiple inheritance.
