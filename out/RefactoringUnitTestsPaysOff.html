        Refactoring Unit Tests Pays Off
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes refactoring <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s is a great way to explore, understand and even solve a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        I recently needed to model a triangular grid of triangles, each of which knew the identity of its neighbors.  Some have one neighbor, some have two and others have three.  I had no idea how the math should work, so I set out to write a brute force test of a grid 3 rows long (<a href="RuleOfThree.html">RuleOfThree</a>).  About half way into the third row a pattern emerged.  I quickly refactored the test to cover every neighbor of every triangle in any triangular grid.  To satisfy the unit test, I copied the test code to the production class and changed the 7 "assertEquals" statements into assignments.
