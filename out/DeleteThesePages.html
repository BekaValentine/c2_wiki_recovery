      <p>
        Wiki isn't a democracy. You don't like some page or other, move it or delete it yourself. It would be nice if you observed the form on <a href="GoodWikiCitizen.html">GoodWikiCitizen</a>, but really why should someone else do your work for you?
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki does have a mission statement - "An <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>". The interpretation of that brief is however - for reasons that relate to <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> - extremely broad, so that Wiki touches on a great variety of topics. Wiki is at its most pleasant when, on its core subjects of creativity and design as they relate to programming, it offers a diversified but densely connected tissue of valuable insights and factual observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Diversity should be valued, and contributors with a background different from the norm encouraged, lest opportunities for expanding the scope of Wiki be lost.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>but</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The value of Wiki is undermined when discussions get stuck, and no interesting insights or consensus emerge from a continuing debate. We call this <a href="StuckNess.html">StuckNess</a>. Some topics and some forms of discussion are more susceptible than others to <a href="StuckNess.html">StuckNess</a> and therefore should be treated with more caution, and discussed with adapted techniques. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Topics susceptible to <a href="StuckNess.html">StuckNess</a> include : religious or political issues, in particular when contributors are proselytizing for their camp. Forms susceptible to <a href="StuckNess.html">StuckNess</a> include : very long pages in <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>, <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> with lots of branching threads, or <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some gentle techniques that can alleviate <a href="StuckNess.html">StuckNess</a> :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           bringing in a "consultant" to get a fresh point of view (<a href="InviteModeration.html">InviteModeration</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           splitting a fertile hair where ambiguity might be lurking
        </li>
        <li>
           popping out of the current dialog to discuss the perceived <a href="StuckNess.html">StuckNess</a> itself (which is in effect self-consulting)
        </li>
        <li>
           taking a long and disciplined vacation from the page... 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Bolder techniques have been applied :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RefactorByCondensingConversation.html">RefactorByCondensingConversation</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RefactorFasterDeleteMore.html">RefactorFasterDeleteMore</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RefactoringDeadline.html">RefactoringDeadline</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           PreSuppositionalApologetics
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some have yet to be tried :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           RefactorFasterCommentMore 
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Some experimental results</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The current considerable improvement to this page resulted from someone taking a <a href="RefactoringDeadline.html">RefactoringDeadline</a> seriously. A <a href="RefactoringDeadline.html">RefactoringDeadline</a> for TheVisitationDiscussion was however ignored for a month or more. Still, the threat may have helped participants accept an eventual, big reduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        An extreme version of <a href="RefactorFasterDeleteMore.html">RefactorFasterDeleteMore</a> was attempted on some pages in April 2000, but turned out to be a poor solution at that time. Paradoxically RFDM resulted in exacerbated <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>, possibly even <a href="IrrevocableThreadMode.html">IrrevocableThreadMode</a>, as contributors infuriated by having some of their text deleted, or distorted as a result of a change of context, restored backups and posted flames in defense of the original versions. Arguably, though, a gentler form of <a href="RefactorFasterDeleteMore.html">RefactorFasterDeleteMore</a> has worked well more recently on pages like <a href="IrrevocableThreadMode.html">IrrevocableThreadMode</a> itself (skillfully refactored by a number of the participants not long after the initial <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>) and ChristianIntellectual (<a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> retained but unnecessary emotional or "meta" interaction removed not long after creation of the page). The refactoring of <em>this</em> page today was a very good example of the DeleteMore aspect of RFDM, a few weeks after the main <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>, with minimal loss of signal. A same day clean up of JesusGodAndMan also seemed to work fine, despite the polarities involved. As this example and others show <a href="RefactorFasterDeleteMore.html">RefactorFasterDeleteMore</a> is often best used with <a href="RefactorByCondensingConversation.html">RefactorByCondensingConversation</a>, keeping signatures but cleaning up ordering and sloppy or conversational text. See <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>'s last comment in <a href="ImproveSignalAndReadability.html">ImproveSignalAndReadability</a>.

      <p>
        <a href="RefactorByCondensingConversation.html">RefactorByCondensingConversation</a> has been used on Wiki for years. One of its most noted exponents is <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>, in pages such as <a href="SoftwareCannotBeModeled.html">SoftwareCannotBeModeled</a> and <a href="MethodOrMethodology.html">MethodOrMethodology</a>. Alistair didn't appear to have suffered flame death as a result of these practices when last seen at dinner in London. As a page, and perhaps as a concept, <a href="RefactorByCondensingConversation.html">RefactorByCondensingConversation</a> seemed to be mothballed by a stray delete and redirect six months ago. More recently TheVisitationDiscussion was reduced to 25% of its former size, a  couple of months after the main threads died down. Signatures were retained and participants seem conciser than before. No complaints have yet been received.

        PreSuppositionalApologetics were proposed as a solution to the "mode of discourse" problem; the idea was to let highly polarized religious or ethical issues be discussed in a gentler manner, initially by agreeing to disagree but state assumptions more precisely, on separate pages. Not much consensus has yet emerged from these pages. The outworking may be a fairly slow moving FiveYearPhenomenon on Wiki, if the community is willing, not dissimilar to the nature of consciousness topics initially touched on in <a href="MistakesOfRogerPenrose.html">MistakesOfRogerPenrose</a> and elsewhere.
