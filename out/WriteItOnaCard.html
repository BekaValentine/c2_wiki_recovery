        <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> extends this life strategy with the usual rococo frills for which XP is famous. Business value, risk assessments, estimates, tasks, all that stuff. Software development needs all that stuff. Often all you need to do is <a href="WriteItOnaCard.html">WriteItOnaCard</a>.

        In particular, experience suggests that all the management and scheduling for a small-population project can be done this way. --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
