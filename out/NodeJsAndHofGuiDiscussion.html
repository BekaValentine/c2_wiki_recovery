        Node Js And Hof Gui Discussion
      </h1>

        Continued from <a href="NodeJsAndHofDiscussion.html">NodeJsAndHofDiscussion</a>, which is growing <a href="TooBigToEdit.html">TooBigToEdit</a>.

      <p>
        The desktop applications mostly used OOP for their GUI eventing, not HOF's. And if you want to sell NodeJS to wider audiences, you better get better examples. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sure, OOP for GUI eventing is fine, though the anonymous classes with a single function that are pervasive in (say) Java would be syntactically cleaner with HOFs and soon will be, given that Java 8 supports lambdas.  By the way, I don't want to sell </em><a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> to anyone.  I'm not a salesman (well, any more -- I have been), I have no interest in sales.  There is no "wider audience" for <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a>, beyond those who need to create event-driven, responsive, highly-concurrent user interfaces.  I'm sure that audience can find their way to <a href="NodeJs.html">NodeJs</a> without my help.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Syntactically cleaner" is often in the eye of the beholder.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That may be true in some general sense, but I think there are few who would argue that a traditional, idiomatic Java event handler like the following...</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        myButton.addActionListener(new <a href="ActionListener.html">ActionListener</a>() {<br/>
        public void actionPerformed(<a href="ActionEvent.html">ActionEvent</a> e) {<br/>
        myLaunch(e.getWhen());<br/>
        }<br/>
        });<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>...is even as clean as -- let alone syntactically cleaner than -- the same code using a Java 8 lambda:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        myButton.addActionListener(e -> myLaunch(e.getWhen()));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        What's wrong with:
      </p>
      <code>
        <button id="buttonX" title="click me" onclick="myLaunch" ... /><br/>
        ...<br/>
        class myLaunch inherits GUIevent {<br/>
        main() {<br/>
        console("Clicked on: " & self.eventTime);<br/>
        console("Mouse coordinates: " & self.pointerX & "," & self.pointerY);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        "myLaunch" would inherit from a GUIEvent class that automatically supplies click time as a class-defined attribute (as well as other commonly needed event attributes such as clicked object ID, mouse coordinates, etc.). No need to dick around with "add listener" bureaucracy. (That stuff may be under the hood, but the app developer rarely has to open the hood that far.) With your approach, you'd have to visit each call to add any new parameters, such as mouse coordinates. Another approach:
      </p>
      <code>
        <button id="buttonX" title="click me" onclick="myLaunch(self.GUIevent)" ... /><br/>
        ...<br/>
        function myLaunch(e) {<br/>
        if (isDefined(e)) {  // "e" is an optional gui-event info object<br/>
        console("Clicked on: " & e.eventTime);<br/>
        console("Mouse coordinates: " & e.pointerX & "," & e.pointerY);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>What's wrong with it is that it's not Java.  It would, at least, require corrections to the syntax so it's Java, and some XML-to-Java compiler to convert the UI specification to Java.  What you call the "'add listener' bureaucracy" is conventional use of the </em><a href="PublishAndSubscribe.html">PublishAndSubscribe</a>-like event handler pattern, which allows multiple, independent handlers to act on a single event without having to be related to each other.  Could you explain how your approach is syntactically cleaner, or superior to either the usual Java convention of using an anonymous class, or the Java 8 approach of using a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>?  By the way, my GUI example was only intended as an easily-recognisable illustration; it's not the only use of lambdas.  Whilst use of Java 8 lambdas will unquestionably simplify GUI coding, they'll simplify any similar use of what would otherwise require (at least) an anonymous class.<em></em>
        <em>One more thing: if myLaunch() needs all the information that parameter 'e' (an </em><a href="ActionEvent.html">ActionEvent</a>, in the above) can contain, you simply pass it as an argument to myLaunch().  The Java 8 lambda example would be:<em></em>
      </p>
      <code>
        myButton.addActionListener(e -> myLaunch(e));  <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>If 'e' isn't needed by myLaunch, it could be:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        myButton.addActionListener(e -> myLaunch());  <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I'm not limiting the discussion to Java; I thought we were talking <em>general</em> GUI approaches, not a specific language; for I don't want to debate about specific languages. For most "click on" events, we don't need to see that stuff. If it uses <a href="PublishAndSubscribe.html">PublishAndSubscribe</a> (or what-not) under the hood or further down the abstraction ladder, that's fine, but don't expose it to the most common case if the most common case doesn't need to show/expose it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The GUI designer is usually thinking, "I just want to run a snippet of code if the button is clicked", and it may optionally need typical GUI-related info such as the time, coordinates, and target id/ref of clicking, for example. (I modified one of my examples to make the event info parameter optional). In the spirit of <a href="WorkBackwardFromPseudoCode.html">WorkBackwardFromPseudoCode</a>, I'm simplifying the common case. I don't want distracting wires from the underlying infrastructure hanging out.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The GUI designer doesn't deal with code.  He or she defines forms or Web pages using code or a forms painter / page designer or a wire framer; the most technical aspect of the job is giving each UI element a unique name.  It's the programmer who pairs element names with runnable code.  Of course, sometimes the programmer is also the GUI designer, but not always, so design and coding should be clearly separable.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Even if it is separated, I don't see how that changes the "score". If you mean the GUI specification by the GUI designer shouldn't even mention code and that the non-GUI app programmer should do the wiring of any GUI objects to event handlers, that may be true, but I don't see how that changes much. The non-GUI programmer could perhaps have an interface like this:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        class buttonFooClick inherits guiEvent;<br/>
        self.objectToWatch = "buttonFoo";  // ID as defined in GUI XML<br/>
        self.addClickWatch();  // tell it to watch for clicks<br/>
        self.addDoubleClickWatch();  // we'll also watch for DC for the hell of it<br/>
        main() {<br/>
        console("Clicked button foo at " & self.eventTime);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        // fancier versions may be able to watch multiple objects via an addIdToWatch() method[1]<br/>
        .<br/>
        // <strong>Variation B</strong><br/>
        class buttonFooEvents inherits guiEvent;<br/>
        self.objectToWatch = "buttonFoo";  // ID as defined in GUI XML<br/>
        method onClick() {   // override stub method<br/>
        console("Clicked button foo at " & self.eventTime);<br/>
        }<br/>
        method onDoubleClick() {<br/>
        console("Double-Clicked button foo at " & self.eventTime);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Java or not, I still don't see how your examples are syntactically cleaner -- remember, that's what started this thread -- than using a </em><a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe that part is subjective. I find it more natural and suspect most developers will agree.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What is it about buttonFoo.addClickListener(e -> console("Clicked button foo at " & e.eventTime)) that is less natural than the above?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For one, it's not clear what "e" is, nor how or where buttonFoo is defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where buttonFoo is defined isn't shown in the anonymous class example, either.  We assume it exists.  The parameter name 'e' was chosen to match the anonymous class example, but it probably should be something more readable.  How about this:  buttonFoo.addClickListener(actionEvent -> console("Clicked button foo at " & actionEvent.eventTime))</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If the button already defined, then there can be an "onClick" method to be added (overridden) and thus you shouldn't count the overhead of defining a class. (An OOP library may include multiple ways to do that same thing to fit different styles or GUI-IDE's).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        class buttonFoo inherits gui::button {  // Example 8462<br/>
        self.location = [etc.];<br/>
        self.title = "Click Me!";<br/>
        method onClick(event) {   // override stub handler method<br/>
        console("Clicked button foo at " & event.eventTime);<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        // See footnote [1] for an instantiation note.<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If you're handling events through overriding methods, then you can only have one handler per UI widget.  That doesn't work.  In many cases, the GUI framework needs to apply its own event handlers to widgets.  By the way, your example above has defined a class of buttonFoo.  What if you only need an instance where the only customisation is the event handler?  Not sure what you mean by "the overhead of defining a class".</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What precludes additional handlers? The "onClick" method may register an event handler or listener behind the scenes but that doesn't prevent further handlers from being registered for the same event and/or object. The "onClick" method is just a <strong>handy short-cut for common usage patterns</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>I thought your onClick override was the only event handler.  Certainly, if it's used in addition to registering listeners, that would work.  I'm not sure what it gains, though, to define every button as a new class -- especially if there are a lot of buttons.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Where else should most or all of the button-related code for a given button go? I expect you agree it should be in <em>some</em> kind of module because we probably wouldn't want to scatter it all about. (One shouldn't have to explicitly "register listeners" most of the time. I don't know where that exposure fad came from. I'm not against having a central "listening" registry (table); it's just the registering steps should be automatic, behind the scenes for most of the common API calls.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Code related to customising a button or a category of buttons certainly belongs in a new class derived from the base button.  However, an event handler isn't a customisation, it's an attribute of a button.  (A button without an event handler isn't a button, it's a decoration.)  The code that's invoked by the button's event handler usually belongs to the form containing the button, because it will typically affect the form and not (just) the button.  Use of listeners is an idiomatic Java pattern, reflective of its philosophy that 1 item shouldn't be handled any differently from 'n' items.  In other words, the Java philosophy is that a single mechanism should be able to define 'n' event handlers, whether 'n' is 1 or 100.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What do you mean by "belongs to" in code terms? Buttons "belong to" a form. And I disagree with that "handled any different" if it conflicts with "make the most common situation the simplest". The second is too useful, and usually outweighs the first in my experience. The vast majority of time we define one and only event handler code snippet for a button, and that's clicking. And it does not preclude further events IF we do want them, it's just that we don't optimize the primary interface for multiple at the expense of one.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>In code terms, I mean the code invoked by a button's event handler is defined by one or more methods of the class that defines the form.  As for simplicity of code, the Java 8 lambda appears to be the simplest, certainly more so than either the traditional anonymous class or your approach of defining each button as a derived class with an overridden 'onClick()' method.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Doesn't look simpler to me. <strong>I don't have to mention listeners</strong>, for one. That's lower-level wiring that shouldn't "stick out" in most cases, and is perhaps swappable with other techniques. I'll <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> whether they like the click handling code in the derived button class or the derived form class. I like it how I like it and you like it how you like it and the reader can decide which they like. (Preferably I'd like it all TOP-based over OOP, so that the grouping is a custom view rather than something hard-wired into code, but that's another topic.) -t

           <em>Several lines doesn't look simpler than one line and fewer tokens?  "Listener" is merely Java vernacular for "event handler".</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It can be in-lined (depending on the language), but cramming too much into a single line is often a poor coding practice in my opinion. Readability and "compact" are not always the same thing. In my experience, blocks and block-like structures are easier to read for a typical developers if they follow a pattern similar to:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        block X (optional stuff) {   // example 4726<br/>
        block body<br/>
        } // end block X<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What's crammed?  In the Java 8 lambda examples, it's just the event handling code -- same as the usual anonymous class based event handler -- with the anonymous class scaffolding removed and replaced with a terse parameter list and a '->'.  It's the same code, essentially, but shorter.  If anything, it's </em>'less<em>' crammed than the usual anonymous class based event handler.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why require <strong>minds to toggle between OOP and HOF's</strong> when they often cover mostly the same territory? That tends to confuse typical programmers and increases the experience requirements of staff.  Keep the conceptual tool box simple by avoiding excessive overlap. Saving a few lines of total code may cost in other ways. If your particular mind and/or team can freely toggle between them without problems, that's great, give yourselves gold stars on your foreheads. But that may not scale to most shops.

YOU are not the world. <a href="ParadigmPotpourriMeansDiminishingReturns.html">ParadigmPotpourriMeansDiminishingReturns</a>.

They can be used generatively, to produce a series of functions under program control, which (where appropriate) can eliminate redundancy and repetition.  They can be used instead of dynamic construction and execution of program source code via 'exec()' mechanisms, thus providing <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a>, better performance (no parsing and interpreting/compiling needed after initial construction), and avoiding risk of code injection.<em></em>

           <em>Yes, you can do without FOR loops (though your example of doing without FOR loops seems to have a FOR loop inside a WHILE loop -- Huh?) and use only WHILE loops.  You don't even need IF statements, if you have WHILE loops and boolean variables or a 'break' statement to exit the loop.  You can write any program with only some I/O primitives, WHILE loops, variables and variable assignment, and some comparison operators.  Of course, you don't need high level languages.  You can write programs using nothing more than cellular automaton primitives, which are lower-level than any assembly language.  However, that would be unreasonable.  Every construct above that level (or, pragmatically, above the assembly language level) exists to make programming easier.  FOR loops make WHILE loops easier.  Are they needed?  No.  WHILE loops are sufficient, but FOR loops make certain code easier.

           The "for" was intended to be a library function, as opposed to a dedicated loop type (3rd optional parameter would be increment amount). FOR came into existence because early languages were math-centric, and matrix and array traversing was very common. And your evangelizing about HOF's is getting repetitious and tedious. <strong>Your GUI demo failed in my book</strong>: a SLIGHT code-size reduction, but at the expense of taxing <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> and training. OOP does the button event perfectly fine, clean, and simple. I'm confident a jury of typical developers would agree me and vote you off the island. Use HOF's to factor your evangelism text if they are such great abstraction tools. Claim they cure world hunger, end racism, prevent rashes, and rescue kittens from trees, while you are at it. I don't want to sit thru yet another failed blowhard demo of yours; I'd rather talk to a used car dealer.

           <em>"For" was called "for" (originating from German "für", appearing in Superplan in 1951) in Algol 58 because it executed the body of the loop once </em>'for<strong> each value of the loop variable.

           I believe Fortran predates Algol, and it had it, but called it "do" instead. Still, Algol probably targeted a similar market, as the military and scientific research were the primary domains back then. And blocks are "better" than GOTO's largely because indentation gives the flow a visual "shape". GOTO is not visual (in most languages). This is similar to why "method" blocks are cleaner than HOF's, per above near example 4726. <strong>HOF's make for syntactically and visually sloppy blocks</strong> because they are often nested in function calls.

           [Probably. What do you mean, exactly? For instance, are you saying OOP syntax can be made cleaner for the same uses we're recommending higher-order functions? This is obviously true, but doing so is literally the same thing as providing clean first-class function syntax -- witness Java 8's lambdas, which are sugar for anonymous inner classes but are primarily a clean anonymous function syntax -- and so isn't really a point against the higher-order function approach. -DavidMcLean]

You can't really fine-tune OOP syntax to make solving higher-order-functiony problems as clean as doing it with actual higher-order functions, because if you try you're just providing syntax for doing it with actual higher-order functions. The fact that functions are also objects in OO languages is irrelevant; you're still using functional design techniques, you still need to comprehend all the implications of first-class functions, and so on. If you have a syntax in mind that'd gear OOP towards these sorts of problems better <em>without</em> literally just becoming first-class functions, feel free to present it. -DavidMcLean]

           The only real "size" difference is that methods require a name. That's a good thing overall. One can perhaps squeeze size pennies out by skipping that, but to complicate the tool set and training requirements to chase pennies like that is not worth it overall. Consistency simplifies longer-run maintenance in my experience, and flipping among paradigms works against that.

           [The anonymous inner class, which itself actually exists primarily as a syntax for approximating anonymous functions <em>anyway</em>, clearly has a lot more bloat relative to the lambda version than merely a method name. As for your comments on "flipping among paradigms"? When you're working in certain fields, it's pretty much impossible to avoid working with certain functional techniques - eventing is a major example of such a field, since without some means of passing code-to-run-on-event as a first-class value it becomes remarkably inconvenient to express handlers. You can't escape this "paradigm-flipping" by using OO-ier syntax, since either way you're still working with the same concept - a higher-order function - and just using different words to refer to it. -DavidMcLean]

           I'm assuming a good OOP framework, not the poorly designed one that typically comes with Java. It's usually possible to make a framework that makes a given technique score poorly. I thought we agreed on the reference example, why are we going back to the old trashy one?  I'm also assuming the button class already exists to represent the button. Thus, you are comparing two apples to one orange. And if the method is doing the "same concept", why complain about it?  If developers prefer the OOP version, then let them be instead of fanboy-sales-nag them.

As for your question, I'd "complain about it" because it's the same concept but expressed in a messier, more verbose way, as shown in the examples I just quoted.

        <li>
           [Sure. It's unclear how and when instances of per-widget classes are instantiated - with classes representing widget types, instances of the class represent instances of the widget and naturally are instantiated to produce the relevant widget, but if classes represent individual widgets, the purpose of instantiating instances isn't clear, and nor is the meaning of instantiating <em>multiple</em> instances of the same customised button class. Do these button classes demand <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>? It's also not meaningful to have a base "button" class that cannot of its own accord act as a button - as event handlers are registered by subclassing the button, apparently, the button class itself <em>isn't a button</em>. Additionally, classes are often statically defined, which is not conducive to generating additional widgets on-the-fly; of course, the more dynamic languages let you create extra custom classes at any time, but rarely frictionlessly. There's a few, off the top of my head. -DavidMcLean]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The GUI framework would typically take care of instantiation, and may use <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a> under the hood. And there likely may be ways to dynamically generate widgets (when needed), and the button class may even use that technique under the hood, but directly doing that in app coding should be a relatively rare need for typical development. Sometimes you don't want to make it too easy to "drive off road" in order to encourage developers to stick to the conventions. It's a psychological "herding" in a sense of making the preferred route the most simple and easy. True, it may make it difficult for "rock star" developers to use tighter custom abstractions, but the flip side is that it can reduce <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> and related mayhem from those who <em>think</em> they are rock-stars or like throwing monkey wrenches into the works.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Side Note: Dynamic languages can blur or eliminate the difference between "class" and "object". In some cases, objects are more or less maps (containing potentially both attributes and function-like pointers or snippets to methods) that automatically traverse up the inheritance hierarchy if a map key (method/attribute) is not found in the current object "node". The "static" nature of classes in static languages is often useful in enforcing or protecting base structures/info/API's, but also can create awkward side-effects in some situations. I've been kicking around the idea of a hybrid dynamic/static language where one can "lock" portions as needed. A "locked" object would resemble a class. But that's another topic. -t

           [Indeed, the distinction between "class" and "object" really isn't that important, and <a href="PrototypeBasedProgramming.html">PrototypeBasedProgramming</a> can be a lot more conceptually elegant, as well as more flexible. However, reducing objects to a kind of dictionary -- with method names as keys and actual methods as values -- is a trick reliant on the presence of first-class functions: It's a dictionary with strings as keys and functions as values, which is something you can only have if you're allowed to have functions as values.

However, reifying anything and everything as values is certainly closer to a functional technique than an object-oriented one; OO tends to seek objects that can wrap up certain kinds of values (functions being a prime example), while functional programming works with the values directly. (In fact, I'd go so far as to suggest the central tenet of functional programming is "<a href="EverythingIsa.html">EverythingIsa</a> value".)

Demanding a class definition for every instance of a widget is both conceptually and syntactically messy, as well as failing to solve of its own accord obvious questions like "what if there are two handlers on a given event?". To anticipate your probable response, I'm fully aware your system allows multiple handlers on one event but have absolutely no inkling of <em>how</em>, because you've never actually gone on to explain how you go about registering a second handler under your approach. I'll agree that classes can certainly be the same thing as objects in a good language, in the sense that there are only objects and no classes, i.e., <a href="PrototypeBasedProgramming.html">PrototypeBasedProgramming</a>. <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and <a href="IoLanguage.html">IoLanguage</a> both attempt this, and both fall a little short in certain aspects, but the idea is extremely sound.

How do you gain the ability to register events on widgets cleanly as a result of unifying objects and classes?

If you have a solid example of method overriding for event handling that's usefully comparable to .addEventListener()-style methods, then bring it up. -DavidMcLean]

Per below (Example 8490), it's possible to allow objects to redefine methods outside of their usual define point (often a "class"). Whether that's "good" is another issue. OOP itself doesn't prevent it. I suspect it's not common because most find it makes for messy code.

I remember arguments against structured programming that claimed GOTOs were "just [the] way typical developer minds work."

        [1] If the event ID's and type combinations become complex or a large volume, then a many-to-many <a href="ControlTable.html">ControlTable</a> may be a better way to manage such. How the table actually calls code depends on many specifics of the architecture, language, etc. That's an interesting question, but for now I'll stick with OOP examples instead of TOP examples. If one is managing boat-loads of associations, tables tend to be superior to code-centric approaches in my opinion.

        I'd think that whether the snippets were functions, methods, or HOF's should be a hidden detail. We won't want to have to expose and/or require repetitious scaffolding code to each snippet. But all that depends on how parameters and scope is handled for a particular DB or language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Likewise, do you think, say, loops should be a hidden detail?  I agree that we shouldn't have to "expose and/or require repetitious scaffolding code", but that's precisely what facilities like HOFs can help with.  Again, see </em><a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/Lambda-QuickStart/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/Lambda-QuickStart/index.html</a> under "Improving Code with Lambda Expressions" which is precisely about eliminating repetitious code.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The devil's in the details. If it requires syntax and keywords that are not relevant to task at hand, they should be removed or made optional. I'd have to study a given proposal. The PDF above gives this example:
      </p>
      <code>
        OPERATOR ( a INTEGER , b INTEGER ) RETURNS INTEGER ; RETURN a - b<br/>
        ; END OPERATOR <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It seems the "Operator" block construct is unnecessary. Instead, this can be in a "cell":
      </p>
      <code>
        ( a INTEGER , b INTEGER ) RETURNS INTEGER ; RETURN a - b;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A row already has a unique identifier such that we don't need a function/method name either. (Although naming as an option would be nice.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In the PDF above, there aren't function/method names.  Yes, the anonymous operator syntax is painfully verbose, but as noted in footnote #6, "Whilst [the syntax is] verbose, it is intentionally in keeping with existing syntax. As Tutorial D is intended primarily for pedagogical purposes, it is appropriate to favour consistency over brevity. However, the author grew weary of endlessly typing OPERATOR during this phase of Rel development and so created a shorthand form of anonymous operator definition, using a pair of digraphs in place of “OPERATOR” and “END OPERATOR” which the author has deemed too aesthetically heinous to mention here.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We don't need (mandatory) digraphs either. Brevity is not the main problem though, it's distraction and confusion from "funny syntax", such as causing unfamiliar error messages if typed wrong. My main point is that if you strip out such irrelevancies, the app developer cannot tell if they are HOF's or functions or methods or gerbils and under the hood, and it could be any of the four as long as it "works".

        <li>
           <em>Something is needed to delimit operator definitions -- anonymous or otherwise -- whether with keywords or something else.

           If a vast majority of the time a "cell" type/context will contain a WHILE loop, then <em>dispensing with</em> the word WHILE and related block constructs is certainly the better way to go, in my opinion. It's similar to the way we don't repeat the column name for each table "cell"; it's already knowable from the column name, and most know where to look if they forget. If the UI doesn't make such clear, then it needs a rework. (If there is a fair amount of variation, then perhaps a block_type column is in order instead of textual syntax to indicate such. It's more "table-y" that way.)

           <em>That's certainly reasonable for an "industrial strength" language.  </em>'Tutorial D<em>' is a language intended for teaching (hence the name) and illustration, so its design philosophy is to favour syntactic consistency -- e.g., all operator definitions share the same syntax -- over being succinct, except where variety (e.g., some operators are infix, some are postfix, some are prefix) is used for illustration.  It does make the language a somewhat verbose syntactic hodgepodge (like Pascal and PL/I) but that's how it was intended.</em>

I am not prepared to make a summary design decision about such at this time. One could perhaps argue the same for "block type" indicators, but it's fairly safe to say that if a given column will usually or always have the same block type in it, then repeating that block information for each "cell" is a violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.

           <em>What I'm getting at is that it doesn't make sense to define a function with a parameter specification that is separate from -- or separable from -- the function body.  It's like separating a decimal point from its floating point number.</em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't see that analogy very fitting. Anyhow, it'll probably take experience in production to really know if it's helpful or hurtful and articulate scenarios and reasons for either case. At this point, it's only speculative. I feel that isolating the parameter signature may turn out to be useful for "interface summary" listings, sort of like an "in a nutshell" chart you see in pocket references or API posters.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>The analogy is fitting because anonymous function definitions and floating point numbers are values.  Removing part of a literal that denotes a value results in a different value.  For example, removing the decimal point from 3.14 no longer denotes the same numeric value.  It would now be 314.  Similarly, removing the parameter specification from an anonymous function no longer denotes the same anonymous function.  For example, if we remove the parameter specification from '(p, q) -> return p + q' so that it's just 'return p + q', the latter implies that 'p' and 'q' are identifiers in its enclosing environment rather than parameters.  However, I can appreciate the use of having (say) an operator's signature without its body and for such purposes, I would provide a function that returns -- perhaps as a string -- the parameter declaration of a given anonymous operator.  Thus, the components of an operator definition can be extracted, but I would not maintain them in some pre-extracted form like separate columns.  That would be as odd as representing floating point numbers by putting the digits in one column and the decimal point position in another.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's not "removing", just hiding portions. One rarely needs to do such with decimal values/literals such that there's no reason to explicitly support it. Let usage be our guide. If doing X is fairly common, then design the system to facilitate X.  And it's generally easier to "glue" parts together than take them apart, because taking them apart requires parsing. Thus, the resource penalty of having to isolate parts that are not cleanly isolated is higher than the penalty of gluing multiple parts together when we want them together.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [It's removing when you project out only the parameter column or only the body column. Taking apart values does not require parsing, excepting when the original literal is parsed, a process which cannot be avoided by destructuring literals into multiple columns; there would be no performance difference between projecting only a parameter column and using a "get the parameters" operator. On the flipside, the cognitive penalty of having to treat what is conceptually a single atomic value as two or more columns can be great, once you start needing to pass it around through various operators, join on it, whatever. Treating values as atomic and providing operators that pull them apart when necessary is much more convenient for the common case -- treating the value as a value -- and no less convenient for rare cases (such as needing to inspect the parameter list of an operator). -DavidMcLean]

        <li>
           How exactly are you measuring this "cognitive penalty"? "Conceptually" it may be two columns in some cases. You word it as if being together (atomic) is a universal true-ism. Anyhow, I'll leave it to experience with a production system before a final judgement is made. Opinions are like assholes: everybody has one. A third possibility is that the parameters are defined in a <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a>-like construct and only the body text is in a single cell.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [The cognitive penalty arises because, simply enough, you have to think about two things whenever you use a "destructured" operator, instead of one. When you pass it from place to place, you've gotta pass both the parameter list and the body. When you join on it, you need to join on both pieces. (Joins and other equality tests are also inhibited in a destructured situation because the two pieces are tested separately, which means that 100%-the-same-even-lexically equality is the only kind that will work. \x -> x and \y -> y denote the same function - under a property called "alpha equivalence" - but if you test "x" and "return x" against "y" and "return y" separately you'd never know.) And so on. It's comparable to C's treatment of arrays as a pointer plus a size_t to track the array's size, which makes passing arrays around a lot less convenient than in languages where arrays carry their sizes directly. Why would an operator or function conceptually exist as two distinct and separate components (parameters and body)? People don't speak of "the parameter list x and the function 'sine of x'" but of "the sine function" or, in more complex cases, something like "the function that maps x to x + 1". Separating the two components can and will change their meaning: A body "return x" on its own would refer to a free variable x and might return anything at all, dependent on its environment, while the function "\x -> return x" always refers to its argument and is an identity function. It can certainly be valuable to access the parameter list sometimes, which is why reflection features often offer that ability, but if you provide operators for doing this rather than hardwire the parameter list into the schema then you both avoid having to pass the pieces separately when you don't care about them individually and you can have <em>multiple</em> operators to access the parameter list in different ways - say, as a string that resembles the literal syntax like "int x, int y", as a list of types [int, int] or of strings ["int x", "int y"], and so on. Providing the parameter list as a separate column does not enable such flexibility. -DavidMcLean]

           Inventing splitter functions as a work-around would make it harder to be language-neutral because one would need to build such parsers for each language.  And it's not comparable to C's array because if we want them together we simply do: $parameters . ' ' . $body so that we can pass just one. C has no direct equivalent. <strong>Make a function to combine</strong> if you think it would be a problem, which I doubt. And we are not talking about what people think about functions in a general sense, but rather how they <em>work with</em> them in code.

I have no idea what "parsers" you speak of; an operator value would necessarily be parsed when it is initially entered into the system as a literal, of course, but operators that access its components would not require any parsing. $parameters . ' ' . $body would only work if we stored both the parameter list and body as strings in the appropriate literal syntax, which is honestly pretty gross. Like I just said, the literal that denotes the operator can be parsed at initial entry - why transform it back to a string at all? Why not leave it as an AST or even as bytecode? You can of course bundle together components in a struct, which is sometimes done with C's arrays but not as often as I'd prefer, but why even offer the option considering how much rarer it is to want the parts of functions separately and how easy it is to access them if needed? -DavidMcLean]

        <strong>An Attempt at a Summary Opinion</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        The scoring of the examples seem to be heavily dependent on GUI library design and possibly the language used. I have not seen any inherent and clear simplification from HOF's for decent libraries (or libraries tuned for the use/audience). Perhaps they are an improvement under poorly designed GUI libraries, but there may be other ways to create screwy libraries that make HOF's score poor. (I cannot think of any at this time, so don't ask.) Time is better spent on designing decent GUI OOP libraries or wrappers than on evangelizing HOF's. --top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Good. That's another one cleared up. He's seen no decent libraries. there are may be other ways to create screwy libraries, so go design some gui libraries. Forget about that HOF stuff. Who needs it?</em> -- <a href="ChaunceyGardiner.html">ChaunceyGardiner</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Indeed.  It also ignores <em>why</em> HOFs are used, even inside GUI libraries.  See, for example, <a href="http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/Lambda-QuickStart/index.html">http://www.oracle.com/webfolder/technetwork/tutorials/obe/java/Lambda-QuickStart/index.html</a> under "Improving Code with Lambda Expressions".} 
      </p>
      <p>
        I consider frequent need for HOF's by typical application developers to be smell (a yellow alert) that the libraries (or wrappers) are poorly designed. This pattern is found in <a href="NodeJsAndHofDiscussionTwo.html">NodeJsAndHofDiscussionTwo</a> also: if the "timer" library is redesigned, we don't need HOFs, and I believe most developers will find the OOP version more "natural" (maps to expectations of block grouping, etc.).  The real fix is better libraries or wrappers. I believe OOP provides better accountability and modularization on both the button and timer example, and I believe most regular developers will agree. (No, I don't have formal studies; it's based on my lifetime <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a>-related observations.) HOF fans will balk, but so be it: let the FP fanboys have their hoots and hollers, but I predict the rest of the world will eventually walk over them and ignore them like they did before in the 80's. I'd be willing to bet most regular developers will look at these two examples and say, "Top is right, with good library design, we don't really need HOF's, and HOF pushers have been exposed as loud zealots." -t

           On the flip side, have you seen anything about it that prevents it from existing? Yes, a runnable implementation would be nice to have, but so would a pony. And the reasons I personally prefer the OOP version are already given at that topic; I see no reason to repeat them here. If you need clarification about it, ask there, not here. I don't claim the OOP version is objectively superior, only that the average developer is more comfortable with OOP interfaces than HOFs.

           Example 8462 demonstrates that. It shows what I believe is a more natural and familiar way to attach a click event to a button object/class.

        Incidentally, here is how multiple different kinds of events, and wild-card event handling, can be interfaced up:
      </p>
      <code>
        class ButtonFoo inherits gui::Button {  // Example 8473<br/>
        self.location = new Point(34, 129);<br/>
        self.title = "Click Me!";<br/>
        method onClick(event) {   // override stub handler method<br/>
        console("Clicked button foo at " & event.eventTime);  // sample usage<br/>
        }<br/>
        method onMouseOver(event) {...}<br/>
        method onMouseOut(event) {...}<br/>
        method onDoubleClick(event) {...}<br/>
        method onFocus(event) {...}  <br/>
        method onBlur(event) {...}  // lost focus<br/>
        method anyEvent(event) {...}   // roll-your-own or micro-manage<br/>
        } // instantiation note at [1]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Do you really expect the user to define a new class for each button?  That seems painfully tedious, even more so than the current Java idiom of defining event handlers ("listeners") as anonymous classes -- the tedium of which is one of the reasons for introducing lambda expressions in Java 8.  Your suggestion is just the sort of thing that makes </em><a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> proponents decry the verbosity of OOP.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What's the alternative? Those attributes and event handler blocks have to go <em>somewhere</em>. And note that an IDE can actually create the classes, it doesn't have to be hand-coded. That technology was available back in the days of early VB classic even. And I personally believe it's better modularization to have all the button-related attributes and methods in a single module rather than scattered about (at least for text-centric coding).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The general alternative is to define one instance of the generic Button class per button, unless you need a new category of </em>ButtonS.  All attributes -- event handlers, titles, text, colours, etc. -- are set on a per-instance basis.  All the button-related attributes are then associated with their appropriate button instances.  Since a button's event handlers typically affect the context in which the button is defined, the event handling code appropriately belongs to that context rather than the button.  One approach to defining event handlers is to use Java 8 lambda expressions.  Another alternative -- one commonly seen today -- is to define event handlers using anonymous inner classes.  Whether code is generated by some external technology, or written by hand, why have more code than you need?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's still not clear to me what your complaint is. "Appropriately" by what standard? It's not more code or more typing, at least not by a substantial margin (+/- about 20%). What is "tedious" exactly and how are you measuring that and comparing to the allegedly non-tedious counter-example(s)? It might cause difficulties in languages that prefer one-file-per-class, but that's a language-specific issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What's tedious is defining a new class for each instance.  By the way, I have added code to your example to create a button instance, set the 'location' attribute to something realistic, and changed the capitalisation slightly to reflect Java/C# conventions.  Without requiring new class definitions, and using Java 8 lambdas, the above could be:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Button buttonFoo = new Button(); <br/>
        buttonFoo.location = new Point(34, 129);<br/>
        buttonFoo.title = "Click Me!";<br/>
        buttonFoo.onClick.add(event -> console("Clicked button foo at " & event.eventTime));<br/>
        buttonFoo.onMouseOver.add( ...etc... );<br/>
        buttonFoo.onMouseOut.add( ...etc... );<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Now it's syntactically simpler than your example, requires no new classes, and can support both single and multiple event handlers per event with the same construct.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I disagree with "syntactically simpler". And whether it's "syntactically simpler" may not override the benefits of being "natural". The class approach is more "natural" in my opinion. It's hard to quantify, I know. Plus, it's non-modular, <strong>de-grouping button-related info</strong>. I prefer the more regimented approach if staff is fungible based on experience with confused newbies. One could end up scattering those all about the code:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        buttonFoo.title = "Click Me!";   // Example 7392<br/>
        // lots of code in between...<br/>
        buttonFoo.onClick.add(event -> console("Clicked button foo at " & event.eventTime));<br/>
        // lots of code in between...<br/>
        buttonFoo.onMouseOver.add( ...etc... );<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Some shops like to scatter those all about the code.  They set all titles in one group, set all event handlers in another group, set all widget positions in yet another group, and so on.  When I first saw it I thought it was awkward.  Then I tried it and it was good.  Now I'd be hard pressed to say which is better, group-by-widget or group-by-action.  I'm inclined to think it's a matter of personal preference.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           That seems a really silly grouping. Why did it turn out "good"? I agree that different shops will have different preferences/conventions, though. The chief architect would ideally rework the shop API's to fit the shop conventions. And really, most GUI's should be handled or specified by TOP or TOP-like techniques in my opinion for this very reason: group, sort, and search by whatever aspect or factor you want. Typically you'd want to see the title adjacent to the factor (such as coordinates) you are studying/editing to help identify it, for example. Internal ID is often not very friendly to read. You agree that an ID name is not always the best way to find a given widget's attribute assignment, don't you? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           GUI's are roughly 90% attributes (or could be 90% attributes if common action idioms are factored into attributes also). Mass attributes with involved relationships are much easier to manage in a <a href="TableBrowser.html">TableBrowser</a> with query-like mechanisms than as code. When the system is attribute-intensive, then (mostly using) code is the wrong tool for the job. But in my observation, grouping by widget is the most common preference if we are stuck with text-code-centrism: all attributes and event handlers for widget X are together.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It turned out "good" because it meets typical </em><a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a><strong><em>s.  For example, you need to change the layout of the widgets so you go to the place where all the widget locations are set, and change them.  For example, you need to re-write the text that appears on the widgets so you go to the place where all the widget text is set and edit it.  And so on.</em></strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Okay, I'll accept that is a fairly common need, but there are often "widget centric" changes that are easiest if grouped by widget. We don't have enough info to accurately say which is the most common. But such grouping fights/conflicts are often a sign that TOP may be a better solution. Note that a powerful IDE could potentially project class/object/etc. parts as filterable and multi-column-sortable tables. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But even if a shop does group by attributes and method name (or equiv), the code size may not be much different, although, again, it does heavily depend on the language.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>As for "appropriately", what I mean is that event handlers typically affect the dialog or window in which they're defined, not just the button that invokes them.  Thus, a realistic example snippet might look like:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        void launchProcessing(<a href="ActionEvent.html">ActionEvent</a> event) {<br/>
        buttonFoo.enabled = false;<br/>
        textboxName.enabled = false;<br/>
        buttonCancel.enabled = true;<br/>
        processingAnimatedGif.start();<br/>
        startProcessing(event.eventTime);<br/>
        }<br/>
        //<br/>
        Button buttonFoo = new Button(); <br/>
        buttonFoo.location = new Point(34, 129);<br/>
        buttonFoo.title = "Click Me!";<br/>
        buttonFoo.onClick.add(event -> launchProcessing(event));<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Note that launchProcessing is an event handler for buttonFoo, but it can also be invoked as an event handler for other widgets.  Because it might need to be invoked by multiple widgets, and because it interacts with other form elements (e.g., textboxName, buttonCancel, processingAnimatedGif) and methods (e.g., startProcessing), it belongs to the form/window/dialog in which buttonFoo is defined rather than being defined as part of a ButtonFoo class.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The class approach does not prevent using a shared routine.
      </p>
      <code>
        method onClick(event) {   <br/>
        formContext.launchProcessing(event);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Sure, but now you're just using awkward syntax to delegate event handling to formContext.launchProcessing, and you still don't have an easy means to have an onClick event launch multiple actions where some actions are defined by the form rather than the author of the button.  Use of onClick.add(...) means onClick.add(...) can be invoked by the author of the button, but also by the form in which the button is used.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not sure what you mean by "awkward syntax". It's pretty much an old-fashioned call to a subroutine. How is that "awkward"? I don't know what you mean by the last sentence. There is a misunderstanding in here I suspect.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By "awkward syntax", I mean you're still using a class definition for essentially nothing more than assigning event handlers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, it also contains attributes, and perhaps other event handlers.
      </p>
      <p>

        Sorry, I don't know what you are getting at.  <strong>Scattering</strong> methods and initializing attributes all over the place is <strong>uncivilized write-only </strong><a href="HackerLanguage.html">HackerLanguage</a> clutter<strong>.

      <p>
        [Nice rant. (I mean that sincerely. It was actually pretty funny.) Did you see your other correspondent's code sample (described as a "realistic example snippet")? It doesn't scatter buttonFoo's customisation -- it's all in one place. Related code is still grouped; however, it's not always necessary for the thing that groups related code to be a class. We have functions and (indeed) modules too, after all. If you're going to insist classes are the only appropriate grouping tool, why only apply that rule to GUI widgets? Why not replace for loops with a For class, which you must subclass and overload the methods init(), condition(), increment(), and block() to use? -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <p>
        You seem to be arguing that since our army pocket knife has 12 blades already, we should go ahead and add 13. I don't know if OOP could replace loops and similar self-rolled blocks. I haven't given it much thought. Humanity settled on certain conventions and those conventions improve communication/code-reading because we all learn a semi-standard: mental <a href="QwertySyndrome.html">QwertySyndrome</a> perhaps. If starting over, like the cockroach may do after we nuke ourselves to extinction, they can consider such.
      </p>
      <p>
        And an OOP language could potentially allow adding or redefining methods away from the original declaration/class, per below. But I suspect it's not common because <strong>the need didn't exist</strong>. If HOF usage exposes gaps in existing OOP languages, then perhaps such languages will make method definition more flexible. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        [Loops can be replaced by an OO class fairly trivially by doing what I just said, but it would be verbose and horrible to work with, as well as conceptually messy since the base class wouldn't ever be directly usefully instantiable. The same applies to GUI widgets. That was my point. Flexible (e.g., external to the class) method definitions are allowed in the more capable of dynamic languages, but I see no way they actually help solve this issue. -DavidMcLean]

        [1] The GUI controller could do the equiv of the following line such that explicit instantiation coding may not be necessary. <strong>Auto-instantiation</strong> (or equiv) would be part of the button master class(es). And a switch or override may be available to deactivate auto-instantiation when desired. Further, languages that blur distinction between objects and classes may not need an instantiation step altogether. -t
      </p>
      <code>
        Button buttonFoo = new ButtonFoo(); // traditional instantiation example<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>How would the "GUI controller" automatically instantiate a Button, and where and when would it do so?  What is a "button master class" and how is "auto-instantiation (or equiv)" part of it?  Please be explicit, and illustrate with code.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It <em>highly</em> depends on the language, where languages that blur the distinction typically don't need ANY instantiation. I am not a Java programmer so won't attempt a Java example. In some languages perhaps auto-instantiation is not possible and the coder would have to explicitly add a line like the above. (Ideally I'd prefer a <a href="DualTypingLanguage.html">DualTypingLanguage</a> where the architect can optionally "lock" objects/classes and multi-instantiation as needed.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Could you give an example of a language that blurs the distinction and so doesn't need any instantiation?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me clarify something. If objects and classes are essentially the same thing, then making a "class" such as Example 8462 is the same as instantiating an object. So, yes, we are "instantiating an object", but we don't need a "double" instantiation to give a class an object-like interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The syntax of Example 8462 implies static classes, which means you're going to have to instantiate an instance of buttonFoo somewhere.  However, I can imagine that the language used in Example 8462 creates a new class via (say) the 'extends' keyword (in place of 'inherits'), but if you use the 'inherits' keyword (as you've done) it creates a new class </em>'and<em>' implicitly creates an instance of that class stored in a constant with the same name as the class.  That would work.  Of course, we can imagine anything we like with imaginary languages.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>By the way, what is a "'double' instantiation"?  Whilst it is entirely reasonable for classes to be implemented using 'class' objects, or to replace static classes and 'class' objects with prototype objects, you still have to ask the static class, or the 'class' object, or the prototype to provide you with each new instance.  Even the implicit instantiation I've described above using the 'inherits' keyword is still an explicit request for instantiation.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I used certain pseudo-code keywords in an attempt to make the examples clearer, but didn't necessarily mean to borrow all concepts for similar-looking languages. For the samples, I'll assume <a href="ObjectsAreDictionaries.html">ObjectsAreDictionaries</a> and classes and objects are same thing and <strong>defining a class creates an object then and there</strong>. "Class" is just a more convenient way of initializing an object, and establishes the parent. "Inherit" means that an internal link is set to a parent object/class, and if a given attribute or method is not found in the current object/class, the interpreter/compiler traverses up the parent branch until it finds that keyword defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could design the language to allow defining or re-defining methods if we really wanted to "scatter them all over" per above. (I'm not necessarily condoning it, but considering it terms of an exploratory option.) It could look something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        // Example 8490 -- Simplifying the re-defining of methods in OOP<br/>
        class myButton inherits gui::Button {<br/>
        myAttribute = 7;<br/>
        onClick(event) {...}  // method (this version skips need for "method" keyword)<br/>
        }<br/>
        ...<br/>
        myButton.onClick(event) {newStuff();}  // redefine method<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The redefined one would still have the same parameter scope as if it were in the class such that "event" is still valid (which is defined in parent class "Button" or higher).
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know if there are any existing languages that do all these things in one, but my point is that language-specific issues seem to be the driving factor, not some <em>inherent</em> weakness of OOP, that keeps them from being competitive with HOF's, or at least doing the "tricks" you show, irregardless of whether those tricks are a good thing in practice, such as (re)defining methods away from the class.
      </p>
      <p>
        [You actually can define methods like that in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> (using normal method definition syntax) and <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> (using first-class functions, as is the only method definition option in JS). But does that <em>help</em>? You're still using a class definition to create an instance, and still you aren't addressing obvious concerns like "two handlers on one event". -DavidMcLean]
