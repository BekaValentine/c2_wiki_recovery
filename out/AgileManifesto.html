        Agile Manifesto
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong><em>The Manifesto for Agile Software Development</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We are uncovering better ways of developing software by doing it and helping others do it. Through this work we have come to value:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
        </li>
        <li>
           Working software over comprehensive documentation
        </li>
        <li>
           Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
        </li>
        <li>
           Responding to change over following a plan
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That is, while there is value in the items on the right, we value the items on the left more.
      </p>

        <strong><em>Principles behind the Agile Manifesto</em></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We follow these principles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.
        </li>
        <li>
           Welcome changing requirements, even late in development. Agile processes harness change for the customer's competitive advantage.
        </li>
        <li>
           Deliver working software frequently, from a couple of weeks to a couple of months, with a preference to the shorter timescale.
        </li>
        <li>
           Business people and developers must work together daily throughout the project.
        </li>
        <li>
           Build projects around motivated individuals. Give them the environment and support they need, and trust them to get the job done.
        </li>
        <li>
           The most efficient and effective method of conveying information to and within a development team is face-to-face conversation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Working software is the primary measure of progress.
        </li>
        <li>
           Agile processes promote sustainable development. The sponsors, developers, and users should be able to maintain a constant pace indefinitely.
        </li>
        <li>
           Continuous attention to technical excellence and good design enhances agility.
        </li>
        <li>
           Simplicity -- the art of maximizing the amount of work not done -- is essential.
        </li>
        <li>
           The best architectures, requirements, and designs emerge from self-organizing teams.
        </li>
        <li>
           At regular intervals, the team reflects on how to become more effective, then tunes and adjusts its behavior accordingly. 
        </li>
      </ul>
