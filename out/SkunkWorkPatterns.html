        Skunk Work Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Pattern language - SkunkWorkEngineering
      </p>
      <p>
        Rarely are <a href="SkunkWorks.html">SkunkWorks</a> projects supported or encouraged by a company. It is a very difficult thing to manage and control from an <em>official company policies</em> point of view. Some corporations have dabbled in supporting <a href="SkunkWorks.html">SkunkWorks</a> (Hewlett-Packard kept an 'open lab and supplies' policy to encourage tinkering...), but it is still rare. 3M had something like this. Do they still?
      </p>
      <p>
        By realizing that you have a need to develop something in the <a href="SkunkWorks.html">SkunkWorks</a> it does not suggest that a corporation is bad or restrictive. Change is hard to promote, and it must sometimes evolve from a <em>grass-roots</em> movement.
      </p>
      <p>
        An example: You are in a corporation of several hundred people. The corporation as a whole will not make a move to Object Oriented Technology. Maybe the group you are in are reluctant to be the first to make such a move (lack of training, inertia, contract or customer constraints, etc). This is where <a href="SkunkWorks.html">SkunkWorks</a> comes into play.

        Everyone is encouraged to modify, annotate and expand upon the following list of possible <a href="SkunkWorks.html">SkunkWorks</a> Patterns: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="DesignTheRightThing.html">DesignTheRightThing</a><strong> - Work toward the right solution, even if a worse one has been <em>suggested</em>.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="SneakInNewTechnologies.html">SneakInNewTechnologies</a><strong> - Introduce new techniques silently.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>TwoDocsForThePriceOfOne<strong> - If your documentation standard is lousy, supplement it with a more robust style (perhaps in Pattern form?)</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="ProofInPudding.html">ProofInPudding</a><strong> - Make sure that you are successful, it is hard to argue against success.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>RevolutionThruEvolution<strong> - Slowly change the way you develop software.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>HitHardAndFast<strong> - Don't wait around for an audit. Take too long and someone will figure out that you are doing something <em>different</em>.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>AlwaysMeetDeadlines<strong> - See </strong><a href="LieToYourManager.html">LieToYourManager</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="LieToYourManager.html">LieToYourManager</a><strong> - As long as you deliver, don't mention the fact that you are trying new and different stuff... This can be dangerous though...</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>RunSilentRunDeep<strong> - </strong><a href="SkunkWorks.html">SkunkWorks</a> should NOT be high, medium or low profile, it should be sub-low profile.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="NoSilverBullet.html">NoSilverBullet</a><strong> (If you meet the Buddha in the middle of the road, kill him) - Don't get trapped in the idea that you have found the <em>perfect</em> technique that will revolutionize the company.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="LordOfTheFlies.html">LordOfTheFlies</a><strong> - Don't soothe management, beat it to death.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="GiveThemWhatTheyNeed.html">GiveThemWhatTheyNeed</a><strong> - If the </strong><a href="ProofInPudding.html">ProofInPudding</a>, and management doesn't know what to do because IcouldDoThisInaWeek , then just <a href="GiveThemWhatTheyNeed.html">GiveThemWhatTheyNeed</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="DontAskPermission.html">DontAskPermission</a><strong> - Sometimes it's a lot easier to just do the right thing than to get the appropriate signatures on a proposal to do the right thing.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <a href="PaulMcKenney.html">PaulMcKenney</a> sent me these additions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>MakeApostlesSuccessful<strong> - if the idea is <em>really</em> radical, you may need to prove that others can adopt it. Find some risk-tolerant colleagues and help them use your idea. Do whatever it takes to make sure that they don't fail.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>AlwaysHaveOneOnTheBackBurner<strong> - Skunkworks projects are risky and prone to failure. The only way you will get a reasonable number of successes is to Try, Try, Again. This is particularly important if you are trying something truly new (as opposed to transferring proven technology from somewhere else).</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong></strong>CultivateSenseOfHumor<strong> -	You will need it. ;-)</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>

        The Lockheed lawyers periodically remind people that Lockheed has a trademark on the phrase "Skunk Works". Such a reminder appears in a recent Doctor Dobbs Journal. -- <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>

      <p>
        <em>Insane. What are they going to do? Release a product with that name someday?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Lockheed's tight claim to this trademark is particularly amusing when you 
        consider that <em>skunkworks</em> translates as <em>our company's management would screw this project up if they knew it existed</em>.]

        Lockheed is jealous of the name. They got SCO to rename their "Skunkware" tools CD with legal pressure.
