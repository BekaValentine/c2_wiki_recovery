      <p>
        <strong>A page is called </strong><a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a> if it is a <a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a> for <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a> to use to play vicious pranks on this community.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        No it's not. A page can be called <a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a> just because that's its title. It doesn't need to have anything to do with <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You fat bloated idiot! Of course it has to do with </em><a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>! It's all about <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>! When the fuck are you going to realize the fucking truth that it's all about fucking <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>!?!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Um, hello? Do I know you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You know nothing! You are a fool! A degraded imbecile without a skerick of an idea about the real </em><a href="DefinitionOfDefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfDefinitionOfLife</a>!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        All I'm saying is that the <a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a> doesn't have to be about RK. It doesn't even have to be a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You don't even have to be alive! It is completely obvious that we have all been over this so many times that everyone agrees with the </em><a href="DefinitionOfDefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfDefinitionOfLife</a>. And if you don't, you are a <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a>!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps we should all calm down and consider the <a href="DefinitionOfDefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfDefinitionOfLife</a> here. Certainly this definition does seem to cover the subject. I for one agree with it.

        <em>You see? You all see? I'm right! I'm right and you're all wrong! Now stop editing this page and let it stand for all time as a testimonial to me! Me! Me, do you hear? Me!</em>

        Um, who?
