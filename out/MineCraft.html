      <p>
        <a href="MineCraft.html">MineCraft</a> is a three-dimensional SandBoxGame created by MarkusPersson to replace InfiniMiner. The absence of this page until recently is major evidence of the fact that <a href="WikiIsDead.html">WikiIsDead</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, it's only evidence of the fact that we think </em><a href="MineCraftIsBoring.html">MineCraftIsBoring</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiIsNotDead.html">WikiIsNotDead</a> And <a href="MinecraftIsNotBoring.html">MinecraftIsNotBoring</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>
          That's it! Because <a href="MineCraft.html">MineCraft</a> is taking a lot of time and Wiki is taking a lot of time and both can be very interesting, so you can not really do both at the same time. Wiki people do Wiki and games people do <a href="MineCraft.html">MineCraft</a>. So wiki people are unlikely to write a lot about <a href="MineCraft.html">MineCraft</a> and games people build their Wikis inside the game and not here. 
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>Games people do </em><a href="MineCraft.html">MineCraft</a> and wiki people do <a href="MindCraft.html">MindCraft</a>? :-)<em></em>
