        Prime Number
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most people are familiar with the concept of a prime number, but often it's defined and used rather loosely.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Here's the usual definition</dt>
        <dd><strong>A prime number is a number divisible only by itself and 1.</strong></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Technically, based on that definition, the only prime number is -1, since every other number is divisible by -1. 2, for example, is not prime by this definition because it is divisible by 2, 1, -1 and -2.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Another try</dt>
        <dd><strong>A prime number is a positive whole number such that the only <em>positive</em> divisors are itself and 1.</strong></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Better, but by this definition is <strong>1</strong> a prime?
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><strong>A prime number is a positive whole number that has exactly two distinct positive divisors.</strong></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        <em>This last definition "works", but in various contexts many theorems about primes remain true when 'prime' is replaced by 'prime or -1'. Unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be a standard term for an integer that is prime or -1.</em>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>Here's another</dt>
        <dd><strong>A prime number is a whole number <em>p</em> that is strictly greater than 1, and such that if <em>p</em> divides a product <em>a*b</em> then <em>p</em> divides at least one of <em>a</em> and <em>b</em>.</strong></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        This definition works even in fields (and other algebraic structures) such as the <a href="ComplexNumbers.html">ComplexNumbers</a> where there's no concept of "positive".
      </p>
      <p>
        You can generate the integer primes using the <a href="SieveOfEratosthenes.html">SieveOfEratosthenes</a>.

        Prime numbers have some amazing properties, and you are invited to put your favorites here.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           There are a lot of them.
        </li>
        <li>
           Every positive number can be written as the product of primes uniquely, up to the order of the primes.
        </li>
        <li>
           The number of primes less than or equal to <strong>n</strong> (defining <strong>pi(n)</strong>, the PrimeCountingFunction) is about <strong>n/ln(n)</strong>.  The value of <strong>pi(n)-n/ln(n)</strong> changes sign infinitely often.
        </li>
        <li>
           This is a long one, but you are invited to try it for yourself.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Define a sequence with q[1]=0, q[2]=2, q[3]=3, and q[n]=q[n-2]+q[n-3].
              <ul>
                <li>
                   The first few terms are q[4]= 2, q[5]= 5, q[6]= 5, q[7]= 7, q[8]= 10, and so on.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               For what values of <strong>i</strong> is q[i]/i an integer?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Other questions include:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           In the fourth example above there are non-prime values with the property mentioned. These are called Perrin pseudoprimes.  Do they have any specific interesting properties?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yes - early ones, with a few exceptions, are the product of two primes, say <strong>p</strong> and <strong>q</strong>, such that <strong>p-1</strong> is an integer multiple of <strong>q-1</strong>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Actually, this becomes less true as the pseudo-prime gets bigger, but it's then true in other interesting ways.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Are there infinitely many <a href="PrimePair.html">PrimePair</a>s?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is a well-known OpenQuestion. The experimental evidence suggests yes.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Are there interesting properties of the various non-prime numbers between <a href="PrimePair.html">PrimePair</a>s?
          <ul>
            <li>
               Yeah -- they're even.  Oh, /interesting/ properties ... no, other than that each of them, miraculously enough, lies between two primes -- in fact, two paired primes!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ol>

        A typical problem to compare programming languages is to compute the first 1000 prime numbers, or the first one million prime numbers, as on <a href="SieveOfEratosthenesInManyProgrammingLanguages.html">SieveOfEratosthenesInManyProgrammingLanguages</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To compare programmers, more likely.  What sort of person would use this as a judgment about programming languages, when it's easy enough to write such a program in even the worst languages: $n=1000000;for($t=3;$t*$t<$n;$t+=2){if(!$c[$t]){for($s=$t*$t;$s<$n;$s+=$t*2){$c[$s]++}}};print "2\n";for($t=3;$t<$n;$t+=2){$c[$t]||print "$t\n"}
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, the <a href="SieveOfEratosthenes.html">SieveOfEratosthenes</a> is not effective for finding the large primes (greater than ~10,000,000,000) that people are looking for these days.  For such things, ProthsTheorem is one of several useful tools (see <a href="http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/).">http://www.utm.edu/research/primes/).</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Actually, <em>primesieve</em>, an "Optimized sieve of Eratosthenes implementation" at <a href="http://code.google.com/p/primesieve/,">http://code.google.com/p/primesieve/,</a> shows all primes below 100 billion counted (4,118,054,813 of them) in under 23 seconds (as of Apr 2011).
