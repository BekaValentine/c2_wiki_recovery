        Do we need to add any legal language to <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a> or elsewhere along the lines of:

        All users retain the copyright on all of their postings. However, by posting to this Wiki, you agree that all submissions may:

        Question is asked because on <a href="SociologyWiki.html">SociologyWiki</a> and similar pages, various authors are demanding that contributions to one such Wiki ran by one person <em>not</em> be forwarded to a new proposed <a href="SociologyWiki.html">SociologyWiki</a> run by others.
      </p>

        <em>Why would we want to agree to clause 2? Especially without attribution (either to the author or this wiki). In the unlikely event I write something here that others think worth anything, I'd like them to refer to this Wiki, not copy it</em>
