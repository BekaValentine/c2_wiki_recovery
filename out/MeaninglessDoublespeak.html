      <p>
        Identical or similar words repeated in slightly different order that give the illusion of content, such as:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Management of this new environment extends past the traditional systems and applications to include administration of services and provide management visibility and control at the service level</dd>
      </dl>

        Nothing will ever be as indecipherable as FedSpeak. I'm really sad Alan Greenspan is gone, I'm sure no one will ever be able to match him in verbal complexity...
