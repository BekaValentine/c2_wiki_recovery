        Plans Vs Recipes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Biologists make the point that our genes are more 
        like a recipe than a plan.  The distinction is that
        one is more easily reversed than the other.  
        A building plan can be
        drawn for an existing building.  But, it's hard to 
        make a cake recipe from a cake.

      <p>
        Is a pattern language more like a recipe than a plan?
        Perhaps that is why patterns pass easily from father to son
        through the shared act of building while it took 
        <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> and colleagues ten years to
        construct his pattern language by examining buildings.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet when a cake is made from a recipe there are chemical 
        transformations that take place, rendering the initial 
        ingredients not readily identifiable.  
        With a building the pieces
        are not changed, making reversal possible to extract the 
        plan.  When the solution to a problem is applied from a 
        pattern language, is it reversable?   Alexander was able
        to construct his pattern language by examining buildings.
        He says
        "But of course, the fact that these rules are simple does 
        not mean that they are easy to observe, or easy to invent."  
        (<a href="TimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TimelessWayOfBuilding</a>, p. 222) When we apply a pattern
        to a computer system context, will it always be reversible?
