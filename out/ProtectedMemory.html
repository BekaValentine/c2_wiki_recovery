        Protected Memory
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Protected memory</em> is a mechanism whereby a machine's operating system and hardware prevent unintentional (or malicious) access to regions of memory by programs that are not supposed to access those regions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Protected memory is considered to be an essential part of a general-purpose multitasking operating system, as it prevents errant processes from reading or writing one another's address spaces or the kernel's address space without following the proper rules.
