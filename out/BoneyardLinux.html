        Boneyard Linux

        A hobby for those with just a little free time, and too much technical savvy:
      </p>
      <p>
        Raid your friendly neighborhood boneyard (e.g. <a href="FreeGeek.html">FreeGeek</a>) for dead hardware. A Pentium III with 512 MB of RAM and a rattling IDE drive will do. We are surfing <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a> in reverse here (unlike the big <a href="MonsterGarage.html">MonsterGarage</a> shops like <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>, Apple, Sun, Adobe, etc, who write slops and then depend on <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a> to catch up with them before shipping time).
      </p>
      <p>
        Now install <a href="LinuxOperatingSystem.html">LinuxOperatingSystem</a> 2.14 on it, connect it to your friendly neighborhood InternetServiceProvider, and put a Web site or three on it. Drive that up to a starting capacity of, say, 64 000 hits a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are now running an internationally-respected (or possibly despised;) <a href="WebSite.html">WebSite</a> on hardware that cannot support <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> or similar iron hogs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cool!
      </p>

        I love the concept!  However, a more useful application might be something like a Seti@Home style ParallelProject.  Anyone interested?

        <em>The problem is that there are very few user-friendly distros that support this paradigm.  The moment a distro decides to have a decent GUI they give up on boneyard support and start cramming every bleeding-edge service onto the box.  So, what's the OSS equivalent of WinNT4 + ISS?  That is, an OS I can run on a Pentium 90 and have a GUI-configured webserver?  I've gotten Xubuntu onto a 400mhz Pentium, but that required maxing out it's RAM first.</em> --<a href="MartinZarate.html">MartinZarate</a>

        Arguably, that's the tradeoff. I don't feel it's a big deal to configure a webserver without using a GUI. Why not just run any mainstream distro without loading up the GUI and optional services? --<a href="MarkSchumann.html">MarkSchumann</a>

        <em>The "user friendly" part.  That was why I mentioned NT4 + ISS - I get a legacy-box GUI-configurable webserver that way.  I'm speaking here as someone who's not too comfortable with Bash, Vi, etc.  I'm trying anyways - the Xubuntu is just an intermediate step for a Linux newb.</em>
