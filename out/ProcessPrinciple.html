        Process Principle
      </h1>
      <p>
        A process/methodology pattern that describes a general approach, not specific techniques.  Specific techniques might be suggested, but they're not necessarily the best ones or the only ones.  As an example, <a href="EliminateDesignDebt.html">EliminateDesignDebt</a> recommends eliminating <a href="DesignDebt.html">DesignDebt</a>, and suggests <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> as a possible technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        What's the difference between a <a href="ProcessPrinciple.html">ProcessPrinciple</a> and a <a href="ProcessPattern.html">ProcessPattern</a>?  Perhaps that a <a href="ProcessPrinciple.html">ProcessPrinciple</a> suggests multiple <a href="ProcessPatterns.html">ProcessPatterns</a> / techniques.  Different ones would be applicable for different projects.  If you can't think of multiple techniques that are good for your <a href="ProcessPrinciple.html">ProcessPrinciple</a>, maybe it's actually a <a href="ProcessPattern.html">ProcessPattern</a> instead.
