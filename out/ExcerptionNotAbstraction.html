        Excerption Not Abstraction
      </h1>
      <p>
        Excerption is one of the functions of consciousness. Excerption means that you let a concrete aspect of a thing (such as a city's skyline) stand in for an abstraction (such as a city).
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem comes in when someone insists on hanging on to an excerption in the face of other aspects of the thing, or even in direct conflict with a <em>formal definition of the abstraction</em>.

        For example, thinking that evolution is the defining characteristic of life, as happened in <a href="DefinitionOfLife.html">DefinitionOfLife</a>. Or thinking that hatred of people with different skin colours is the defining characteristic of racism, as happened in Iain Banks on <a href="BookShelved.html">BookShelved</a>. Or thinking that Roman emperors are the defining characteristic of the Roman empire with all its people, cultures, actions and institutions, as happened on <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>. Or thinking that the history of cars are the defining characteristic of all automobiles, as also happened on <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>.
