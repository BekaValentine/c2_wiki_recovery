        Dark Side Of Composite Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> mentioned this in <a href="RefactoringAddingComplexity.html">RefactoringAddingComplexity</a>. Has anyone experienced this, such that they had to refactor to <em>remove</em> the Composite? -- <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>

        I wrote a series of drawing editors in Smalltalk. The next to last one used composite extensively: everything was a Figure. The last one I wrote in Smalltalk backed off from this because compulsive use of composite didn't buy me anything and it ungrounded me from what I thought things really were. Of course, a GroupFigure was still a Figure, so I didn't get rid of composite entirely (see <a href="HotDraw.html">HotDraw</a>). -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Just to clarify the notion ... sometimes you need to UNDO some <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> for a moment, to put things together another way.

        Relatedly, not all refactorings make the system better. These ones need to be removed when you realize it. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        Sounds like an example of Stan Kelly Bootle's Theory of Kludges:-) -- <a href="DickBotting.html">DickBotting</a>
