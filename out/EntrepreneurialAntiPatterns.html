        Good for George. Doesn't this indicate that the company is changing from a shoesting to a normal company? Or am I missing something?

        <dd>As I was <em>driving</em> to a board meeting right afterwards though, I thought to myself, [...] there's more! [..] There was a cardboard box lying on the passenger seat of my car. I flipped it over to reveal its blank bottom and started scribbling notes relating to other deathtraps all over it. <em>By the time I reached my destination, it was covered up</em>. [my emphasis]</dd>

        Is this really the sort of guy from whom we should be looking for advice? If Frederick J. Beste III thinks that writing extensive notes on the bottom of a card-board box on the passenger seat while driving is acceptable, then he has a very different notion of risk than do I. But then , I'm no entrepeneur. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
