        Finding The Middle Way
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most discussions (on this <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> and otherwhere) seem to be about opposite opinions.
        One says A and another one says not-A, both argue their point. Sometimes a conclusion is reached,
        sometimes a synthesis is found, but often the answer must be: <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>.
        This is especially so, if real human beings are involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example (inspired by discussion on FairnessDoctrine): 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A: Everyone should be awarded/treated equally, otherwise emotional development is impaired.
        </li>
        <li>
           not-A: Competition is a natural human social behaviour. Treating e.g. children independent of their behavior leads to laziness and demotivation (esp. for talents).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I think, that is is often a <a href="BifurcationFallacy.html">BifurcationFallacy</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        My position is <a href="FindingTheMiddleWay.html">FindingTheMiddleWay</a> in this case: Basically you have to treat your children (s/child/human/) equally, but there is no need to suppress your delight when one child does something special, or your anger when it does something nasty. Your child will find its own <a href="MiddleWay.html">MiddleWay</a> between the extremes by learning how others respond to its behaviour.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="FindingTheMiddleWay.html">FindingTheMiddleWay</a> is hard. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The optimum may be difficult to find (be a <a href="GoldilocksSolution.html">GoldilocksSolution</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           A choice between the (different) benefits of the extremes is involved.
        </li>
        <li>
           The middle may not be interesting in its own (extremes by themselves carry some advantages, a <a href="JackOfAllTrades.html">JackOfAllTrades</a> is a MasterOfNone).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Benefits of <a href="FindingTheMiddleWay.html">FindingTheMiddleWay</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           More flexibility, you can move slightly to one or the other extreme, without loosing much.
        </li>
        <li>
           Easier to hit than the extremes. The middle is usually flat around the optimum.
        </li>
        <li>
           Easier to argue about, after all, <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have found this choosing the <a href="MiddleWay.html">MiddleWay</a> a useful LifeStrategy, especially after being married.
        Some things in life are just not BlackOrWhite, TrueOrFalse, but ShadesOfGrey.
