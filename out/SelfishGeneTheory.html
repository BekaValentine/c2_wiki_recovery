        Selfish Gene Theory
      </h1>
      <p>
        The idea that evolution is about the survival of particular genes, and not necessarily that of individual creatures.   See <a href="RichardDawkins.html">RichardDawkins</a> <a href="TheSelfishGene.html">TheSelfishGene</a>

        Note!  At first glance, it appears that evolution is entirely about selfishness - which flies in the face of what many folks have been brought up to believe.  This, however, is not true.  While it's a gene against gene world out there, as it has been shown in many species, co-operation is an awesome way to get to where you want to go.  From the tightly coupled multi-cellular organism, to complex societies of bees, ants, people, what have you.

        <em>Yes - Dawkins talks about how apparently altrustic behaviour at the organism level can be traced back to selfishness at the gene level.</em>

        Please don't raise Dawkin's pseudo-scientific ramblings to the level of "theory".

        <em>Dawkins may seem to be somewhat pseudo-scientific because of his tendency to rant and rail (I'd rather call him an "over-opinionated oversimplifier targeting a naive lay audience"), but the late (and great) Bill Hamilton's work on the evolution of altruism and kin selection -- which is what Dawkins bases much of his </em>SelfishGene work on -- is very elegant and quite widely accepted in the biological community.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>However, as is typical of popular delusions of and the madness of [us] scientists, Dawkins & Hamilton are losing ground in the popularity polls, and David S. Wilson's and others' notions of multi-level selection are gaining ground with some very nice recent experiments. Basically, these indicate that genes are </em>'not<em>' the only level at which evolutionary selection operates, and that communities, ecosystems, or organisms can also be selected.</em>

        <em>Now I will agree that Dawkins's thoughts on on memes are troublesome and foolish, and definitely pseudo-scientific. But let's not confound the good biology with the bad "memetics." For reasons already discussed in </em><a href="MemesShmemes.html">MemesShmemes</a>, <strong>that's</strong> pseudo-science. -- <a href="BillTozier.html">BillTozier</a><em></em>
