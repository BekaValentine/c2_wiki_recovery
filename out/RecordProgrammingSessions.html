        Record Programming Sessions
      </h1>
      <p>
        You can record whatever happens on your screen as a movie file, along with audio outputs and mic inputs. Use <a href="RecordProgrammingSessions.html">RecordProgrammingSessions</a> for self/pair-analysis, article writing(esp. TDD and refactoring articles), and knowledge transition.

        see <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/61092">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/extremeprogramming/message/61092</a> and the following postings in the thread.

      <ul>
        <li>
           self/pair-analysis (what do I/we really do when we program?)
        </li>
        <li>
           article writing (esp. of TDD/refactoring articles)
        </li>
        <li>
           knowledge transition (how to use tools like cvs, eclipse, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
           sharing practices and discussing (other people can watch and comment on your programming habits)

        <strong>Side-Effects of </strong><a href="RecordProgrammingSessions.html">RecordProgrammingSessions</a><strong></strong>

        You perform better when you <a href="RecordProgrammingSessions.html">RecordProgrammingSessions</a>.

        One good side-effect of it is "reflectivity" and some kind of <a href="HawthorneEffect.html">HawthorneEffect</a>. In cognitive psychology, one of the popular research methods has been protocol-analysis, in which the subject does the usual cognitive activity, such as solving a math problem, thinking out aloud, that is, she says everything that she thinks, and explains what she is doing. Then we can observer the process of her thinking not only the final result of her thinking. However, an unexpected side-effect came about: self-reflectivity. As she explains what she's doing as she do the usual cognition, she did somewhat different from what she's been doing in normal time. Actually, the performance was better when she was speaking out her protocol. It's probably because she was thinking about her thinking.
