        Clifford Algebra
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>For the newcomer to </strong><a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a><strong> This is about mathematics which many people find so magical that they want to share it with everyone else. The problem that they have is of explaining clearly just what it is that is so special. People are also inclined to ask, <em>"If it so good why did nobody tell me about it?"</em> and that is a long story. My personal response when I found out about </strong><a href="QuaternionMathematics.html">QuaternionMathematics</a> about 15 years ago, was to ask, <em>"What else have I not been told?"</em> and I had to wait another 10 years or so to find the answer, <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>. I came back from a seminar and typed into a search engine "<a href="WilliamKingdonClifford.html">WilliamKingdonClifford</a>" and entered in through a door from which I have never completely returned.

        <em>It is as though someone had a large mirror on which mathematics was written. It got broken and during the nineteenth century different mathematicians found different pieces of the mirror. They started to put the pieces together, but somehow they couldn't get them to fit and then they argued and threw some of the pieces into a dark cupboard. Only since about 1966 have different people started to find the pieces and fit them together, and we have for a hundred years been taught that the pieces are separate and unrelated. So we go on teaching the fragments, when we could teach the whole.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hestenes, who started the "putting together" has now proposed that physics teaching should be reformed to use the whole pattern. (see <a href="HestenesOerstedMedalLecture.html">HestenesOerstedMedalLecture</a>)

           "In physics, the concept of Clifford algebra, as such or in a disguise, is a necessity in the description of electron spin, because spinors cannot be constructed by tensorial methods, in terms of exterior powers of the vector space."
        </li>
        <li>
           "Clifford algebra might make its curriculum debut in high schools by replacing the cross product, in undergraduate courses by replacing rotation matrices, and in graduate courses by condensing the Maxwell equations in a vacuum into a single equation in terms of Cl3."

        Note: Some authors talk about <strong>Geometric Algebra</strong> and some about <strong>Clifford Algebra</strong>. The usual use of this is that those who say <strong>Geometric Algebra</strong> are emphasising the geometric explanations. Hestenes (see <a href="HestenesOerstedMedalLecture.html">HestenesOerstedMedalLecture</a>) also uses the term <em>Geometric Calculus</em>. The algebra is the same, the difference is in emphasis on the different ways of looking at things. For more information look at this web page by Hestenes which gives a diagram of the evolution of the ideas. There is also a list of recent books. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        The essential core of <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a>, and the main difference from vector algebra as taught, is that multiplying two vector objects <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> can be written as 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>ab</strong> = <strong>a</strong>.<strong>b</strong> + <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif'''b'''" /><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        in a space of any number of dimensions. It is not assumed that 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>ab</strong> = <strong>ba</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and in general it will not be. Here the two parts are defined as
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>a</strong>.<strong>b</strong> = (<strong>ab</strong> + <strong>ba</strong>)/2 = <strong>b</strong>.<strong>a</strong><br/>
        <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif'''b'''" /> = (<strong>ab</strong> - <strong>ba</strong>)/2 = -<strong>b</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif'''a'''" /><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>a.b</strong> is a scalar quantity and is the equivalent of the vector dot product. If <strong>a.b</strong> = 0 for two nonzero vectors, they are orthogonal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif'''b'''" /> is known as the exterior product, defined in the work of Grassmann. It is related to, but <strong>not</strong> the same as, the vector cross product <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/cross.gif'''b'''" /> which is only defined in three dimensions. If <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif'''b'''" /> = 0 for two nonzero vectors, then they are parallel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice that this definition does not depend in any way on a choice of axes for the space.

        <em>The power of </em><a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a> can be illustrated with the following, adapted from <a href="HestenesOerstedMedalLecture.html">HestenesOerstedMedalLecture</a> pages 10-11.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The algebra describes a plane containing two orthogonal unit vectors <strong>e1</strong> and <strong>e2</strong> which each square to +1
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong>^2 = <strong>e2</strong>^2 = 1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A unit bivector <strong>i</strong> for the plane is given by the product
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>i</strong> = <strong>e1 e2</strong> = <strong>e1</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif'''e2'''" /> = -<strong>e2 e1</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        since
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong>.<strong>e2</strong> = 0<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The symbol <strong>i</strong> is chosen because 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>i</strong>^2 = (<strong>e1 e2</strong>)(<strong>e1 e2</strong>) = -(<strong>e1 e2</strong>)(<strong>e2 e1</strong>) = -1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and thus <strong>i</strong> is a number which squares to -1. Also
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1</strong> = <strong>i e2</strong><br/>
        <strong>e2</strong> = <strong>e1 i</strong> = -<strong>i e1</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Multiplication by <strong>i</strong> rotates any vector in the plane by a right angle. If a complex number <strong>z</strong> is written using this <strong>i</strong>, where <em>a</em> and <em>b</em> are scalars,
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>z</strong> = <em>a</em> + <em>b</em> <strong>i</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        then multiplying <strong>z</strong> by <strong>e1</strong> gives the following
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>z e1</strong> = <em>a</em> <strong>e1</strong> + <em>b</em> <strong>e1 i</strong> = <em>a</em> <strong>e1</strong> + <em>b</em> <strong>e2</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        One interpretation of this is that there is a length <em>a</em> along <strong>e1</strong> followed by a length <em>b</em> along <strong>e1</strong> rotated by a right angle, viz <strong>e2</strong>. Another interpretation is that <a href="ComplexNumbersArePoints.html">ComplexNumbersArePoints</a> once a direction is chosen for the real axis.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Clifford Algebra in 3 dimensions</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A basis for the whole algebra in three dimensions can be generated from three orthogonal unit vectors <strong>e1</strong>, <strong>e2</strong> and <strong>e3</strong> which each square to +1.
      </p>
      <p>
        This basis generates a unique <em>trivector</em> which is the <em>pseudoscalar i</em> for the basis. This represents an <em>oriented unit volume</em>.
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>i</em> = <strong>e1 e2 e3</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There are three <em>bivectors</em> in the basis. These represent <em>oriented unit areas</em>. 
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>e1 e2</strong> = <em>i</em> <strong>e3</strong><br/>
        <strong>e2 e3</strong> = <em>i</em> <strong>e1</strong><br/>
        <strong>e3 e1</strong> = <em>i</em> <strong>e2</strong><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In these equations the multiplication by <em>i</em> is called the <em>dual</em> operation. In this case the <em>dual</em> of a vector is a bivector and viceversa. In three dimensions the <em>dual</em> of an area is the vector normal to the plane.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note that all the bivectors and the trivector square to -1.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The outer product and the vector cross product can now be related through a <em>dual</em> operation.
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif'''b'''" /> = <em>i</em> <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/cross.gif'''b'''" /><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is a key result which can be used to unify <a href="CliffordAlgebra.html">CliffordAlgebra</a> and VectorAlgebra in 3 dimensions. What this means is that <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/cross.gif'''b'''" /> is the vector normal to the bivector <strong>a</strong><img src="http://php.jonnay.net/OpenWikiGraphics/math/and.gif'''b'''" /> which defines a plane. When formulating equations in <a href="GeometricAlgebra.html">GeometricAlgebra</a> of 3 dimensions, this is the crucial difference. Bivectors are distinct items from vectors in any object.

It would be useful for this page to start with the definition, an example and a discussion as to why it is an important concept and where it applies.
