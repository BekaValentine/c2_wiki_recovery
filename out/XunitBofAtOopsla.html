        Xunit Bof At Oopsla
      </h1>
      <p>
        This year at OOPSLA, I'd like to organize a <em>birds-of-a-feather</em> session 
        for people who've used, simplified, enhanced or ported the xUnit <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you all interested?
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ErichGamma.html">ErichGamma</a> and <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> really got the ball rolling by writing up <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> in <a href="JavaReport.html">JavaReport</a> magazine.  At last count there were over ten ports of <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>'s framework to languages as diverse as Perl, Java, C++, Visual Basic, and Objective-C.
      </p>
      <p>
        Meeting at OOPSLA, we'd get a chance to compare notes, and talk about what works and what doesn't.
      </p>

        Sounds more like a
        <em>bird-of-a-Feathers</em>
        session... :-)

        <a href="XunitBofAtOopsla.html">XunitBofAtOopsla</a> was well attended.  Here is a list of topics that we discussed along with some proto-solutions:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Fixture Management</strong>
        <em>- what can you do when your fixtures get too large?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Parameterize the fixture via arguments on construction or use state setters
        </li>
        <li>
           Large fixtures are also a good reason to refactor your tests
        </li>
        <li>
           Drifing dates in unit tests were mentioned.  Solution was: wrap your system time call.  Yet another example of how tests lead you to good decoupled code.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Functional/Database Testing</strong>
        <em>- dealing with slow setUp and tearDown</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Make a massive fixture whose state leaks across several tests (not ideal).  Use something like TestSetup in JUnit to achieve this.
        </li>
        <li>
           For databases, make a special tearDown that restores DB state to expected values.
        </li>
        <li>
           Buy a good in-memory database which supports SQL.
        </li>
        <li>
           Revisit your code.  See if you can localize DB access.  May be a problem in EJB-style apps.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Concurrency Testing</strong>
        <em>- for the determinedly non-deterministic</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Observers can be very useful.
        </li>
        <li>
           Inject variable wait times into repeated tests.
        </li>
        <li>
           subclass a simulator so that you can instrument timing dependent code from the inside.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Servlet Testing</strong>
        <em>- Testing from here</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Someone mentioned a servlet based UI.  You can run tests remotely.  Said he was going to email it to <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and <a href="ErichGamma.html">ErichGamma</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We also spoke about all of the different flavors of <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> out there.  There seems to be a port to every major OO language along with some interesting hybrids, like <a href="CppBridge.html">CppBridge</a>.
