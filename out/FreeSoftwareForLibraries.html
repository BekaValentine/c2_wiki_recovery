        Free Software For Libraries
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> and libraries have a large overlap.  Unfortunately neither community seems to know very much about the other, nor how to make use of the other's skills.  Fortunately, this is starting to change. There are several projects producing <a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> geared toward library use. Among them are:
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools for librarians and developers for building better FreeLibrarySystems and tools for library users:

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        FreeLibrarySystems in and of themselves:

           the <a href="KohaProject.html">KohaProject</a>

           the <a href="AvantiProject.html">AvantiProject</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           PhpMyLibrary <a href="http://phpmylibrary.sourceforge.net">http://phpmylibrary.sourceforge.net</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           OpenBiblio
        </li>
        <li>
           OpenBook
        </li>
        <li>
           ThokBook
        </li>

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other (?):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="OpenIsis.html">OpenIsis</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           GreenstoneDigitalLibrary
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the long run it would be good to see all of the sorts of projects joining together as a FreeLibrarySoftwareFoundation.  The different groups can cooperate (and collaborate) on research, infrastructure development, and similar tasks.

        One area that FreeLibrarySystems need to improve in is support and installation.  Many libraries are staffed by overworked people without the skills or training they would need to use most of these systems today.  If the systems are made more approachable, this hurdle will be dramatically lowered.  If consultants and companies begin to offer support and installation services, <a href="FreeSoftwareForLibraries.html">FreeSoftwareForLibraries</a> will be much more successful.  Another space to work in would be RaisingMoneyForProjects through grants or sponsorship.

        A discussion of applying <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s to <a href="MyLibrary.html">MyLibrary</a> was begun on the <a href="MyLibrary.html">MyLibrary</a> mailing list.  It was suggested that this topic might be of interest to the <a href="FreeSoftwareForLibraries.html">FreeSoftwareForLibraries</a> community at large.
