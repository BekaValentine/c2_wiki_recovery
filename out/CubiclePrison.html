        Cubicle Prison
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've heard of working from home, and other remote locations in the new economy, but this is really something.  I think my work place may be slowly and surrealistically taking on the elements of a prison.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those of you who have not seen my work space, it is bordered with a bank of windows.  Past my monitor, I can look out to a three-story atrium, then on to a filtered panel of windows and  vents.  This was great when the atrium was mostly stocked with abstract objects de arte.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, it was once considered exemplary work of Alexandrian design with its n-point natural light sources.  But the most recent tenant of this unique atrium, "Minncor", has implemented a curious twist, the irony of which has not escaped me.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Minncor (minncor.com) is a rehabilitation service for inmates which employs incarcerated individuals in product development and design.  Contrary to popular belief, the office workers are not themselves convicts; the convicts work from their respective secured institutions. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I can, however see the result of their work.  I can look out past the products of my own design, past my own workspace walls and window, onto the products of their design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Recently, Mincorr filled the lobby with a stunning preview of the latest inmate designed and developed prison-issue furniture.  I noticed the minimalist, yet substantial designs were not unlike those employed in my own office furniture.
      </p>
      <p>
        All of this struck me as kind of freaky and ironic, really, and I couldn't help but pass that little tidbit of an observation on to you all.
