        Adaptive Object Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>A system with an Adaptive Object-Model  (AOM) has an explicit object model that it interprets at run-time. If you change the object model, the system changes its behavior. For example, a lot of </em><a href="WorkFlow.html">WorkFlow</a> systems have an Adaptive Object-Model. Objects have states and respond to events by changing state. The Adaptive Object-Model defines the objects, their states, the events, and the conditions under which an object changes state. Suitably privileged people can change this object model "without programming". Or are they programming after all? Business rules can be stored in an <a href="AdaptiveObjectModel.html">AdaptiveObjectModel</a> that makes it easy to evolve the way a company does their business.<em></em>

               Joseph Yoder, host of a OOPSLA 05 tutorial on AOM and host of the above site, cited his collaboration with <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a> on this topic. Ralph had earlier named this architectural style the <a href="DynamicObjectModel.html">DynamicObjectModel</a>, a term not as widely used in the industry.

        <em>Adaptive Object Model</em> appears to be the preferred term. An older synonym is <a href="ActiveObjectModel.html">ActiveObjectModel</a>.
