        In the following class hierarchy:
      </p>
      <p>
        [1]
      </p>
      <p>
        The way that struct for 'Non-leaf Alarm' was shown could be modified as shown below.  The key is to define structs for each class in the hierarchy such that:
      </p>
      <code>
        typedef struct {<br/>
        char abDescription[10],<br/>
        int nChangeCount, <br/>
        int nDescendentChangeCount,<br/>
        BOOL bstate        <br/>
        } ConditionClass;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        typedef struct {<br/>
        ConditionClass parentClass,<br/>
        tsOID sIdentifier, <br/>
        int nParentAlarmHandle,<br/>
        int nNextSiblingAlarmHandle    <br/>
        } AlarmClass;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        typedef struct {<br/>
        AlarmClass parentClass,<br/>
        int nFirstChildAlarmHandle<br/>
        } NonLeafAlarmClass;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        As always in these matters, there are implications of doing this especially when you declare an instance of any of the subclasses of ConditionClass the compiler *may* use indirection to access the nested struct's. An advantage comes later if you adopt this approach when we try to get polymorphic behaviour, such that the methods that we will define for ConditionClass are equally able to operate on ANY instance of NonLeafAlarmClass as well. We'll cover that in <a href="PolymorphicFunctionDiscussion.html">PolymorphicFunctionDiscussion</a> though.

        Memory had seldom been so scarce that we had to sacrifice maintainability. I found from experience that the <a href="FamilyFusion.html">FamilyFusion</a> pattern beats the <a href="FamilySplit.html">FamilySplit</a> pattern every time in maintainability. The reason being that it is much easier to manage memory for just one type of fixed-sized data structure. Heap is not used in our systems because of  various associated problems, and the memory for the instance data is typically managed using a buffer manager. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This pattern has exactly the same problem as the <a href="FamilySplit.html">FamilySplit</a> pattern when the memory is allocated from the heap or a buffer manager. However this pattern is definitely superior to the <a href="FamilySplit.html">FamilySplit</a> patterns when the instance data is allocated from the stack because only one data structure is involved. The <a href="FamilyFusion.html">FamilyFusion</a> pattern still rules if a buffer manager is involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        This pattern is worthwhile to document and add to pattern language as a companion to <a href="FamilySplit.html">FamilySplit</a> and <a href="FamilyFusion.html">FamilyFusion</a> patterns. BTW it is time to find a better name for the <a href="FamilySplit.html">FamilySplit</a> pattern.

        Re: "memory had seldom...". In our case, available memory = 16K ROM and 512bytes RAM. -- <a href="KeithDerrick.html">KeithDerrick</a>
