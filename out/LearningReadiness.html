        <em>Duplication is a design lesson waiting to be learned. If you aren't ready to learn, duplicate away. When you're ready to learn, eliminate the duplication. Different people value learning and immediate progress differently. The more experience I gain, the more I value learning and the more I trust that a smarter me will make more progress.</em>
