        Babylon Five Is Lord Of The Rings
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="BabylonFive.html">BabylonFive</a> has some parallels to <a href="LordOfTheRings.html">LordOfTheRings</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The shadows are the forces of Sauron. Obviously.
        </li>
        <li>
           Khazad-Dum and Z'ha'dum are too close for comfort.
        </li>
        <li>
           The minbari are the elves. They're elegant, their artefacts are voluptuous, they are wise and good, and they live a long time.
        </li>
        <li>
           Kosh the Vorlon is Gandalf the Grey. He's the wise, powerful, ancient advisor who dies and is then resurrected in a subtly different form.
        </li>
        <li>
           The humans are like the hobbits. They are a fairly backward race, but one of their number becomes crucial to the struggle against evil. If we include <a href="TheHobbit.html">TheHobbit</a> as part of the series, then the replacement of Bilbo with Frodo is like the replacement of Sinclair with Sheridan (note that Sinclair/Bilbo decides to hang out with the Minbari/Elves after leaving home).
        </li>
        <li>
           The rangers are, er, the rangers. This doesn't make sense in racial terms, but just look at the beards!
        </li>
        <li>
           It's not clear how B5's narns and centauri map onto LotR.
          <ul>
            <li>
               With Londo, Cartagia, and Vir, It's not just LoTR, it's <em>I, Claudius</em>, with the characters playing Tiberius, Caligula, and Claudius respectively. Throw in G'kar doing the Passion Play for extra color...
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           [<a href="SpoilerWarning.html">SpoilerWarning</a>] The big climactic battle happens halfway through the last bit, leaving quite a lot of story afterwards. This story is occupied by the return home of the humans/hobbits and their struggle against a homegrown tyrant who turns out to be backed by the shadows/Sauron.

        Then what's the ring, genius?
