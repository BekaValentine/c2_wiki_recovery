        Presentation Is Difficult
      </h1>
      <p>
        Presentation and UI design is an inherently difficult issue that is tough to "get right". When developers say, "Pffft, that's merely a presentation issue", an <a href="AlarmBellPhrase.html">AlarmBellPhrase</a> alarm goes off in the back of my neck.

        It's difficult largely because it's the most visible aspect of most software products, and thus <strong>subject to the heaviest scrutiny</strong>. And I've had some pretty picky bosses over the years. Perhaps I should have learned to say "no" more often rather than ramp up the complexity for incremental improvements or subjective preferences. But saying "no" to those who sign your check is often not good for your career. Humans are superficial egotistical creatures for good or bad, and want the feeling that they are "good enough" to have a Rembrandt app.
