        Testers and Agile Engineering: Bridging the Gap
        Extreme Programming provides a great set of agile engineering practices for programmers, but what about testers?  How do they fit in?  In this presentation, James will share lessons learned from several years of helping testers integrate into agile teams.  Learn how to use testers' specialized skills to prevent defects, not just find them.  Topics include requirements collaboration with Fit, customer reviews, exploratory testing, and working with developers who are using test-driven development.
