        Big Blue Room
      </h1>
      <p>
        Virtually all computer facilities have a <a href="BigRoom.html">BigRoom</a> nearby, and it is usually a <a href="BigBlueRoom.html">BigBlueRoom</a>. Depending on location, about one third of the time it is in use as a planetarium.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It usually has very strange carpeting and a </em>'very<em>' high ceiling.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes it has a grey ceiling and problems with the automatic sprinklers. Jeez, someone ought to complain to Building Management about this!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On rare occasions, the lighting system experiences flashes. Maintenance hasn't had any luck tracking down this bug beyond tying it to the automatic sprinkler problem.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the other hand, Maintenance has been hard at work on the rodent infestation problem. Rumour has it that they'll solve it any day now. Congrats, guys!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>However, the location of the light switches and the climate control panel remain elusive.</em>

        Heh heh. When I saw the title of this page, I expected it to be about a server room where only <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> equipment was allowed.

        Commentary:
        Depending on your POV (point of view), it is either ALWAYS or NEVER a planetarium -- i.e. regarded at those times when it manifests as a BigBLUE Room. It depends on one's attitude in regard to the REALITY OF THE INVISIBLE (e.g. small point-like celestial objects which generally cannot be seen when the <a href="BigRoom.html">BigRoom</a> is brightly illuminated by the large yellow celestial object in the ceiling), and the IDENTITY OF DISTINCT APPEARANCES OF THE SAME PHENOMENON (i.e. the ceiling of the <a href="BigRoom.html">BigRoom</a>, which may appear to be sometimes Blue, sometimes Grey, sometimes Black, etc.; but which is nevertheless regarded by philosophical Idealists (or is it Realists?) as "really" one and the same <a href="BigRoom.html">BigRoom</a> at all times, regardless of the variable color of the ceiling...)
      </p>
      <p>
        IME, most of the smaller planetariums spend very little time without the little twinkly lights on.
