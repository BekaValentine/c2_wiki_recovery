        Choosinga Con Lang
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you're just curious about <a href="ConLang.html">ConLang</a>s in general, just about any one will do.
      </p>

        The most useful fictional-world languages are <a href="KlingonLanguage.html">KlingonLanguage</a> and <a href="QuenyaLanguage.html">QuenyaLanguage</a>; they can provide a basis for communing with fellow fans.  Some great works have been translated to <a href="KlingonLanguage.html">KlingonLanguage</a>, and in Star Trek 6, the Klingons claim Hamlet is best when read "in the original Klingon."

        If you'd like to communicate with non-geeks, <a href="EsperantoLanguage.html">EsperantoLanguage</a> is probably your best bet for the widest pool of speakers, compared to any other <a href="ConLang.html">ConLang</a> at least.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LojbanLanguage.html">LojbanLanguage</a> is probably best for language theorists.  It seems quite different from most other human languages, particularly Western ones, and doesn't have as broad a social support base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other conlangs with (a small number of) actual speakers include [TokiPonaLanguage] and <a href="VolapukLanguage.html">VolapukLanguage</a>.
