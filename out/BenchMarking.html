        Bench Marking

      <p>
        Having an <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> to "sit with the team, ... answer questions, resolve disputes, and set small-scale priorities" is expensive.  For very large scale projects (like designing automobiles) with long lead times (like 2 to 8 years), having an <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a> may require many customers, and may require replacing them regularly (as they may start to think like the other members of the team, instead of like "real customers").  <em>See also:  </em><a href="TheMachineThatChangedTheWorld.html">TheMachineThatChangedTheWorld</a>.<em></em>

        Your competitors (or even companies in other industries) may have already solved similar problems or satisfied similar customers.

        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Benchmark easily measured features of other companies' products and processes.  Use these benchmarks as the Design Requirements for your product or process.  See also:  <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>, <a href="TheDeadline.html">TheDeadline</a>.

        <strong>But:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Benchmarks do not capture everything that is important to the customer.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Benchmarks do not set priorities for different features.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Over-reliance on <a href="BenchMarking.html">BenchMarking</a> can lead to designing the wrong product, and delivering it late.  For example:

        <dd>"It feels like a car designed by gifted engineers who researched diligently what benchmark numbers it needed to generate," said Markus.  "It generates those numbers, but the engineers aren't car guys." -- Car and Driver, September 1999, describing the Oldsmobile Alero GL.</dd>

        I'm not sure if this is a <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> or an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>.  It certainly has more than 3 applications, though.  -- <a href="JasperPaulsen.html">JasperPaulsen</a>
