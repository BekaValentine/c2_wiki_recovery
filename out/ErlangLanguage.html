        Erlang Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Erlang is a general-purpose development environment, particularly well-suited to fault-tolerant, concurrent, distributed, soft real-time applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Erlang is a strict, dynamically typed <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> language with a declarative syntax and powerful yet simple support for <a href="ConcurrentProgramming.html">ConcurrentProgramming</a>, using an asynchronous message passing mechanism based on <a href="ActorsModel.html">ActorsModel</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Erlang is compiled to bytecode which runs in a <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>. It comes complete with development tools (compiler, debugger, profiler), libraries and applications including the <a href="MnesiaDatabase.html">MnesiaDatabase</a>, an HTTP server and a CORBA ORB.
      </p>
      <p>
        Erlang is developed and supported by the Ericsson <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> lab, which has distributed it freely under an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> license since 1998. Its principal inventor was <a href="JoeArmstrong.html">JoeArmstrong</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Erlang is not <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> in the usual sense. There are no classes,
        no inheritance, and in keeping with <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> tradition,
        data structures are separate from functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, Erlang offers <em>processes</em>, which are like threads
        except that they are completely isolated from each other and may only
        communicate by sending and receiving asynchronous messages. These
        Erlang processes are ideal to represent physical models, and in many
        ways satisfy the <a href="NygaardClassification.html">NygaardClassification</a> better than most traditional
        <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> languages. These concurrent processes are polymorphic,
        in that any process which responds to a set of messages (an alphabet,
        in CSP parlance), may be transparently substituted for
        another. Processes also have an identity (a unique, unforgeable
        process id). Code, in the form of functions, may easily be reused by
        different processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Erlang also offers <em>behaviors</em>, which are similar to Java
        interfaces: a module conforms to a behavior if it offers a set of
        functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Erlang in fact offers considerable support for modeling the code
        as objects. However, Erlang developers tend to model as processes only
        objects that have behavior (and possibly state), unlike
        <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> or <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> developers who must model everything
        as one. In particular, Erlang data types are not objects.

        I recently used Erlang for a small statistical project, and while I've played with it before, using it in a real application is even better.  It's like a wonderful mix of Haskell and Python, with a big chunk of Prolog thrown in just for fun.  It DOES have certain parts that make you say "hunh, that's weird", but they are far outnumbered by the bits that make you stop for a second and go "...oooooo.  Shiny."  -- <a href="SimonHeath.html">SimonHeath</a>
