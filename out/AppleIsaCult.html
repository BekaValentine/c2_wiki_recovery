      </h1>
      <p>
        Have you ever gotten the impression that Apple is some kind of cult? It seems to me that a lot of Mac users are ravenously defensive of their <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> and are constantly trying to convert people. Not to mention all of the fluffy self-help-esque pep-talking, such as in <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>...

      <ul>
        <li>
           Cult members: slavishly follow the teachings of their glorious leader/Messiah, hanging on his every word
        </li>
        <li>
           Mac users: slavishly follow the teachings of <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a>, hanging on his every word
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cult members: the leader has a <a href="RealityDistortionField.html">RealityDistortionField</a>

           Mac users: <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a> has a <a href="RealityDistortionField.html">RealityDistortionField</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cult members: gladly pay large sums to the cult as a condition of salvation
        </li>
        <li>
           Mac users: gladly pay large sums to Apple as a condition of getting hardware
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cult members: dress all in white (it was orange before The Leader changed his mind)
        </li>
        <li>
           Mac users: have all their devices in white (it was translucent blue before <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a> changed his mind)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cult members: worship in temple-like facilities being created rapidly around the world

           Mac users: worship in temple-like Apple Stores being created rapidly around the world
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>If Apple is a cult, Microsoft is a religion - the only difference between the two being market share. (Linux, of course, is the radical extremist sect of the other major religion.)</em>
