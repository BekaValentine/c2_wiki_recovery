        Formal Model Checking
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="FormalModelChecking.html">FormalModelChecking</a> is commonly called ModelChecking by its proponents.
        It is a new SPIN-off from the idea of <a href="ProofOfCorrectness.html">ProofOfCorrectness</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why not just call it ModelChecking?  Is there some InformalModelChecking that is used in practice?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike most <a href="FormalMethods.html">FormalMethods</a> it makes computer programs do the heavy lifting.  One of these tools is called SPIN and has been used on NASA and Lucent software as an experiment.
      </p>
      <p>
        It targets nasty real time race hazards and bugs that happen when very rare sequence of events occur.  Rather than testing to see if a particular scenario causes a problem (like a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> for example) a model check is given some requirement and then goes to hunt for a scenario that breaks it.  They are capable of predicting that 
        no scenario can possibly break a requirement.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both reported tests of model checking some bad things were uncovered that nobody knew were there.
      </p>
      <p>
        The model in <em>model checking</em> is a finite state abstraction of the software.  The requirements are expressed in some kind of logic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Expenses:  deriving the model demands some understanding of state machines as well as code.  Expressing the requirements in logic is also a specialized skill -- even if some specification patterns have been documented plus the kinds of well formed formulae needed to express them.
      </p>
      <p>
        Catch:  The code may not implement the model.   The formula that expresses the requirements will almost certainly be incomplete and need tuning.
