        Life Long Learning
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="LifeLongLearning.html">LifeLongLearning</a> started out as a term where governments in the FirstWorld (see <a href="TheThreeWorlds.html">TheThreeWorlds</a>) want unemployed and dispossessed people to <a href="JustGetAnyJob.html">JustGetAnyJob</a>.
      </p>

        The politicans reckon by sending people to learning institutions, these people do not count as unemployed (while engaged in education programs).

        Some people are called professional students, as they are found wandering amongst the ranks of students at various university campuses year after year.

        Education institutions are more <strong>institutionalized</strong> and education is the means to substain the industry. I was shocked when I saw, 15 years ago (around 1990), <strong>dubious </strong><a href="ItManager.html">ItManager</a>s <strong> were sent to MIT Sloan school for short courses. The amazement was that MIT would open its doors to fee paying "students" with unknown background, putting its own reputation at risk. One such person was subsequently charged with misconduct years later.</strong>

        I see <a href="LifeLongLearning.html">LifeLongLearning</a>, and for that matter LifeLongAnything as a description of what most learned people are doing in their lives. To view learning as a CompletedThing is an error of the greatest magnitude. There is so much to know and learn, and so little time to do it. (OneLifetime).
        Anyone with open eyes can see that the one thing that is constant and to be counted on, is change. This is why we must continue our learning experience as one which has but one ending, that we can learn no more, either through incapacities or our own expiration. To view learning as complete, as if we were purchasing a ticket to somewhere, or have become members of "those who know" and to viewed as such is unrealistic. It is more like we have arrived at a new "take-off" point, and a new journey has begun as we reach each new destination. The biggest problem we have is deciding "where do I go from here?"  What should I seek to know more about?  There are no sure roadmaps into the unknown, only the knowledge that when we arrive there, we shall be faced with applying all we have learned thus far, plus an added facet called curiosity to move on.  -- <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a>.<a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>.20110508
