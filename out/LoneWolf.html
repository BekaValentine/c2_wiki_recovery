      <p>
        A Lone Wolf programmer is one who is doing <a href="SoloProgramming.html">SoloProgramming</a> and, in the absence of anyone to say otherwise, thinks there's no reason to try to work with any other way.  This person believes he/she knows everything important there is to know about software development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Such a person often learns new tools and technologies when they become popular or cutting edge, but doesn't know that process could ever be important, and so doesn't read any of the books that would tell them that it is or why, and so remains somewhat less than blissfully ignorant.
