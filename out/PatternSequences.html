        Pattern Sequences
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>At </em>EuroPLoP 2001 we had a session on pattern sequences.<em></em>
        <em>It started with a small exposition of ideas from Alexander,</em>
        <em>but quickly segued into stories from experience.</em>
        <em>There were particularly powerful contributions from</em>
        <em></em>AlanOCallaghan and RebeccaRikner.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="NeilHarrison.html">NeilHarrison</a> and <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> decided to get something<em></em>
        <em>started here that recalls and captures that experience.</em>
        <em>If you have something positive to add, please add it.</em>
        <em>If you have a criticism, add it, too, and we'll let</em>
        <em>the page re-factor itself to convergence over time.</em>
        <em>Our wish is that the page be a practical starting</em>
        <em>point for people who want to add sequences to their</em>
        <em>pattern languages.  Maybe we can have philosophical</em>
        <em>discussions on another page.</em>

        We pattern folks have gathered patterns, but have not gathered
        sequences. Nevertheless, the sequences were there all the time,
        we just didn't notice.  And we were registering them unawares.
      </p>
      <p>
        After we got a critical mass of patterns (in an area), we could
        arrange them in a language (static), and we could trace sequences
        through the language.  The sequences we trace may well have come
        from the sequences that lodged themselves in our brains earlier.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Comparison to Patterns</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that patterns happen in much the same way.  We didn't notice
        patterns, either.  After the fact, the patterns began to emerge.
        But sequences are a level beyond patterns; they are even harder
        to immediately perceive.  You may be able to get at them only through
        patterns -- like moving leaves make wind visible to us, patterns
        make the sequences visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, think about the master builder -- he doesn't use patterns
        consciously, nor does he use sequences consciously.  The patterns
        just flow from one to another.  See comment below under Architecture.

        <strong>Comparison to Piecemeal Growth and Iterative Refinement</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea is that you build beautiful
        systems using the fundamental process:  order comes
        from the process that creates the order. Process is
        key to making life in things -- a point we structural people
        often miss in patterns.  So we go through a process trying
        to preserve structure while creating structure.
        Systems grow by a process
        of unfolding:  step-by-step adaptation with feedback.
        And unpredictability, in an awareness of the Whole.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the fundamental process cannot work on a
        human scale without some kind of cognitive guide that
        is built on experience and which can kind of foresee
        some of the centers that must be built.  That's what
        patterns are.  Alexander says: that a pattern is a generic center,
        and that the very building of a pattern is itself an
        unfolding process.
      </p>
      <p>
        If unfolding is important, how do you know what order to
        unfold things?  The sequence is crucial (slide 9).  You want a
        smooth, structure-preserving unfolding, without the
        torture of design.  He gives several examples including
        the Japanese tea house.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what a sequence does is:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Preserves structure;
        </li>
        <li>
           Keeps you doing one thing at a time;
        </li>
        <li>
           Takes the Whole into account at each step;
        </li>
        <li>
           May be repeated tens of thousands of times.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A sequence is dynamic:  it adds dynamics to pattern languages.
        Sequences are where generativity comes from.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Comparison to Learning Natural Languages</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        So sequences give the pattern language life.  This is the same
        as the way babies learn to speak and understand. They learn
        sequences.  They start with standard sequences, then move to
        creating their own sequences.  And the sequences create the
        grammar.  And they do it without thinking about it.
      </p>

        <strong>Application to Software Development</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We're still working on this (help us out),
        but we think there
        are some far-reaching things to be said.
        It could be a different way of looking at software development.
        A couple of possible sub-points below.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Architecture: "Systems Thinking"</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        So what makes a good (software) architect?  Someone who can visualize
        the entire system; the entire whole.  A good architect must have
        good command of the sequences the go into the system, and must have
        them internally (you can't think about the sequences and think about
        the whole at the same time -- so the sequences must be part of you.)
        This has ramifications about how people become architects.
