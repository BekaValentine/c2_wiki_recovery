      <p>
        I'm a software development Director (who still manages to program).
      </p>
      <p>
        My past projects have included a vehicle configuration and order management system for General Motors, a power billing system for the U.S. Department of Energy, and a financial data app used by Wall Street brokerage houses. I currently work for a financial services firm specializing in hedge funds in <a href="NewYorkCity.html">NewYorkCity</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I'm not working, I'm into music... composing it, playing it and listening to it. 20th- and 21st- century orchestral and chamber music are my main areas of interest.
