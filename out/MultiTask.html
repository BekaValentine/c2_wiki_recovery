        Maybe I just haven't seen it as a <a href="QuickChangesJunkie.html">QuickChangesJunkie</a> -- but try this:

        I can do the laundry and the dishes at the same time, I just load the machines and press start.  Then I can watch <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> till those tasks are done.

        Vacuuming and LawnMowing require my presence and control.  I have to stay with the device HelpingMe till we finish the task.

        What are the different names for these forms of <a href="MultiTasking.html">MultiTasking</a>?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Foreground task.  Something you need to interact with on a terminal or via the GUI, for example to enter commands and read their output.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Background task.  You kick it off (perhaps even via a timer) and it does some job without you supervision.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>There's a whole grey area in between.  Something which is apparently a foreground task that you're not attending to because nothing is happening (e.g. no new mail) becomes a background task, 'til the mail arrives and the thing beeps at you.  Thinking can be like this (</em><a href="UngarMethod.html">UngarMethod</a>).  Conversely, if your background task hits a problem and the cron daemon sends you an email, you may need to interact with the thing to get it working correctly.<em></em>
      </p>

        <em></em><a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> can become a background task too, if you use your video recorder and then don't bother to watch the tape. (<a href="GaveUpOnTelevision.html">GaveUpOnTelevision</a>)<em></em>
