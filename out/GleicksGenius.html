        Gleicks Genius
      </h1>
      <p>
        For those of you who haven't read it yet, I heartily
        recommend James Gleick's biography of <a href="RichardFeynman.html">RichardFeynman</a>,
        <em>Genius</em>.
        I'm sure that at least some of you used Feynman's physics
        text at school. It is a fascinating view
        of a truly amazing individual.

        Additionally, <em>Thinking Allowed</em> recently aired a one 
        hour interview with Murray Gell-Mann, which was proved
        a very entertaining. Insights from one of the preeminent
        physicists of the 20th century. Their number is 1-800-999-4415.
        the tape is $3x.xx, and, I think, worth it.
