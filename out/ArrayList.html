        Array List

      <p>
        <em>Each </em><a href="ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a> instance has a capacity. The capacity is the size of the array used to store the elements in the list. It is always at least as large as the list size. As elements are added to an <a href="ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>, its capacity grows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not specified beyond the fact that adding an element has constant amortized time cost.<em></em>
