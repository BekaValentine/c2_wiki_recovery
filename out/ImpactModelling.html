        Impact Modelling
      </h1>
      <p>
        Could someone fill in a simple cookbook for impact modelling here?
      </p>
      <p>
        One way I explain it is that it involves going from the
        simplistic customer statement "I want X" (static model of requirements) into the following questions (the first two straight from <a href="TomGilb.html">TomGilb</a> in the early 80s): 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Is X a <strong>function or quality</strong> (atomic requirement or measurable one) ? 
        </li>
        <li>
           If X is a quality, <strong>how much</strong> of X do you want (target and worst acceptable) ? 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>When</strong> do you want (that much of) X ? 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Who</strong> exactly wants X at that time ? 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>How successful</strong> would they judge the system to be if X is achieved then (100 = successful) ? 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In the very early days of a project, when the shape of even a first <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> isn't yet clear (for example the software tools or hardware it's going to use aren't) the answers lead to a set of <a href="SuccessStatement.html">SuccessStatement</a>'s of the form: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          S(Head Accountant, Jun99) |= AgedDebtors(5%) [the head accountant would consider the system 60%
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        successful if it reduced the number of debtors not paying within 30 days to 5% or less by June 1999] 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there's discussion (involving customers) of high-level technical solutions that would 'solve' the statements at some point in the future (earlier the better in line with <a href="BusinessValueFirst.html">BusinessValueFirst</a>).  This then coalesces into one or more milestones (agreed delivery points) in a <a href="CommitmentSchedule.html">CommitmentSchedule</a>.  [Sorry I can't link to all relevant XP terms and corresponding <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> here]
      </p>
      <p>
        We call the early days situation <em>high potential</em> and the whole aim of <a href="ImpactModelling.html">ImpactModelling</a> is to progress as soon as possible from that
        dangerous but exciting consultancy state, where programmers assigned to the project probably don't have enough definition about what to do, to <em>steady state</em>.  Steady state is where
        impact modelling simply becomes the regular updating, with the customer, of a list on a single piece of paper of one line <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>'s or simple <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> updatable as often as weekly.
      </p>
      <p>
        We've recently tried using a Wiki clone for updating the list, linked to separate pages for each task or story (as I think <a href="KenAuer.html">KenAuer</a> does). We're wondering if we need to think again about <a href="IndexCard.html">IndexCard</a>s for any descriptions to back up one line task definitions, as I explain a little in <a href="KnowingWhenToStop.html">KnowingWhenToStop</a>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ImpactModelling.html">ImpactModelling</a> certainly aims to <a href="SimplifyTheRequirements.html">SimplifyTheRequirements</a> with the customer wherever possible.  This is one part of the challenge of doing <em>just enough</em> <a href="ExternalAndInternalDesign.html">ExternalAndInternalDesign</a> for the next set of <a href="SuccessStatement.html">SuccessStatement</a>'s to be met. We believe strongly that it's a benefit for experienced IT and <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a> people to work closely with customers on external design issues, using prototyping or paper.  In some areas, in other words, it's not wrong for developers to influence <a href="SuccessStatement.html">SuccessStatement</a>'s, it's essential.  But it must be highly visible (and thus agreed).
      </p>
      <p>
        Steady state is intended to be kind of boring and predictable for customers - except for those exciting <strong>scoops</strong> that the evolutionary process and well factored code allow, as described in <a href="SuccessStatement.html">SuccessStatement</a>.  Another way of saying this is NoNegativeSurprises. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As I've read Wiki pages concerned with XP the impression that I'm given by most of them is that they assume steady state is achievable in all projects from day one.  Although this is much better than presuming the need for conventional <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> I believe that it is over-simplistic if applied to all project situations. --<a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>
