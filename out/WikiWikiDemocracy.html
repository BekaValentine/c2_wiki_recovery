        A Rant that triggered this page:

           All right, all right, let's get this straight. <a href="GeorgeBush.html">GeorgeBush</a> is not the problem. There are a lot of ... in the world, and he's just one of them. The problem is we all just sat around and let this particular ... all over America. I mean we amplified his ... through loudspeakers, we poured it in our eyeballs through the TV, and we cranked it through the Internet like it was hamburgers on Sunday.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="GeorgeBush.html">GeorgeBush</a> will go - you can see him going now. We are waking from the dream of fascist America and we must all give .. him .. a little push - just a little one - so that he can feel 300 million little pushes all at once. Which will amount to a mighty shove.
        </li>
        <li>
           And that means you - yes, you gentle reader. You must take a few moments out of your life and think about how you - yes, you personally - can help America get rid of this evil smell once and for all. It is not enough to blame <a href="GeorgeBush.html">GeorgeBush</a> for everything that's happened and think, well, good riddance to bad rubbish. <a href="GeorgeBush.html">GeorgeBush</a> is just like a Lantana flower - there's a whole huge vine of the stuff and it's spread all through everything. If we're gonna get rid of the shrub we gotta poison it at the root.
        </li>
        <li>
           Now where is the root of <a href="GeorgeBush.html">GeorgeBush</a>? Well, it's in this so-called democracy we got right here. It's not worthy of the name. You know it, and I know it. We're sitting here in the 21st century stuck with a 12th century show of hands once every 4 years with 3/4 of the hands tied behind peoples' backs. And that won't work - it will just saddle us with another <a href="GeorgeBush.html">GeorgeBush</a>, new face, new line of crap, same stupidity-in-power.
        </li>
        <li>
           It is time, ladies and germs, for a <a href="WikiWikiDemocracy.html">WikiWikiDemocracy</a>. Time to do it over. Put your thinking caps on - we have a mess of brush to cut and some sustainable horiculture to invent. Let's get busy.

        <em></em><a href="WikiWikiDemocracy.html">WikiWikiDemocracy</a>. That is an interesting concept. A democratic process via a medium called Wiki. Could this work? If so, How?<em></em>

           Mature Democracy
          <ul>
            <li>
               Democracy is created and supported by its citizens, and nurtured and developed by its leaders. 
            </li>
            <li>
               It cannot be imposed "top-down" by authority, nor will it emerge "bottom-up" from chaos. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Instead, it is a product both of form (the right structures) and function (the right purposes). 
            </li>
            <li>
               Democracy works not only because it pragmatically allows citizens to carry on their lives in an orderly fashion, but because 
            </li>
            <li>
              it allows people the opportunity to create the meaning that gives those orderly lives their purpose.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           It also will:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Favor enlightened self-interest and the common good.
            </li>
            <li>
               Respect individuals and rights; value relationships and responsibilities.
            </li>
            <li>
               Focus on process.
            </li>
            <li>
               Allow virtually unfettered opportunity for innovation and growth in all dimensions (political, moral, social, etc.-not just economic).
            </li>
            <li>
               Promote continuous dialogue.
            </li>
            <li>
               Foster multiple dimensions of, and access to, power.
            </li>
            <li>
               Create units large enough to allow diversity; small enough to encourage community; 
              <ul>
                <li>
                      flexible enough to promote innovation; and 
                </li>
                <li>
                      strong enough to counterbalance tribalism, globalism, corporatism, and entropy.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Encourage constant interaction between the process, practices, and products of democracy.
