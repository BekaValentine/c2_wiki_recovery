        A much healthier unit of complexity than "IdealDays" or "GummiBearsOfComplexity" to estimate <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> and generate a <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a>.

        <a href="RobertCecilMartin.html">RobertCecilMartin</a> often tells this story to executives. It gets them drooling...

        "You walk into the project war room any time you like. On the wall is a chart showing the project velocity for the last three months. This charts tells you how many story-points have been added to the system every <a href="TwoWeeks.html">TwoWeeks</a>. Next to it is a list of the stories for the current release, with a total of the story-points on the bottom. You can divide that total by the average velocity and get a very good idea of when the release will be done."

        TODO: Someone please stitch this into the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>, <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, and <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a> pages, huh?

        Perhaps somewhat pessimistic view, but I suspect soon the users will start "negotiating" how many story-point each story really "worth", thinking that by reducing the story-point of the stories will somehow make the project finish earlier.

        <em>They don't need to negotiate the worth of the story. The estimate is just a price tag. In America, where XP originated, you don't negotiate the price of each item in your </em>GroceryCart. If it's too expensive, you buy something cheaper or you just don't buy any coffee at all this week.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The valuable discussion to have around estimates is "Why is this so expensive?" These discussions often uncover unspoken assumptions that lead to a simpler (to implement) story that still solves the business problem.</em>

        My colleagues and I have been using <a href="StoryPoints.html">StoryPoints</a> for years now.  We even came to call them NUTs - <a href="NebulousUnitOfTime.html">NebulousUnitOfTime</a>.   <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> wrote about using real time in the 2nd edition of his XP book.   I was encouraged by a client of ours to give real time a try, instead of using <a href="StoryPoints.html">StoryPoints</a>.  So Industrial Logic went about <a href="UsingHoursInsteadOfStoryPoints.html">UsingHoursInsteadOfStoryPoints</a> on a real project.  --<a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a>
