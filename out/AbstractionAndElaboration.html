        Abstraction And Elaboration
      </h1>
      <p>
        Abstraction can be defined as the extraction of the essential features of a complex object or matter, primarily by disregarding one or more properties considered less important.
      </p>
      <p>
        Elaboration can be defined as the process of combining abstract principles with raw materials, thus creating useful objects with all necessary features and detail filled in.

      <p>
        A valuable minority of programmers are abstractors. They enjoy some of the strangest languages, such as C++.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most teams need lots of elaborators and a few abstractors, which is a fortunate coincidence. -- <a href="DavidBennett.html">DavidBennett</a> (an incorrigible abstractor)
