        Schroedingers Koan
      </h1>
      <p>
        One day, a novice programmer came to a master programmer called Schroedinger  and showed him a program he had just written. He asked Schroedinger, "How can I make sure no bug ever turns up in my program?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Without a word, Schroedinger took the notebook with the program from the novice's hands and threw it out of the office window.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this moment the novice programmer became enlightened.
