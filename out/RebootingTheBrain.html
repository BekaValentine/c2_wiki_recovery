        Rebooting The Brain
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="RebootingTheBrain.html">RebootingTheBrain</a><strong> is the deliberate act of overcoming the fear center, the amygdala's, interrupt priority over </strong>
        rational (and post-rational) thought.  This should only be undertaken with a DeepMythos inplace and the direct advice of <a href="EnlightenedMen.html">EnlightenedMen</a>.

        Else one can easily fall into a feedback loop (or other form of insanity). My proof is roaming the halls of mental wards in every state, people who
        have activated <em>too much life-energy in their brains.</em> In the West the diagnosis is often manic-depression.  In the East, <em>Arhat's disease.</em>
        Without a workable mythology to carry one through, activating Kundalini is plain dangerous.  They struggle in Archtypal Realms with
        <strong>demons, cosmic rays, mars men, strange doctors</strong> and <strong>vast conspiracys</strong> that no one else can see. Read <a href="CarlJung.html">CarlJung</a>, <a href="KenWilber.html">KenWilber</a>, <a href="ChogyamTrungpaRinpoche.html">ChogyamTrungpaRinpoche</a>.

        One method, employed in many cultures, is chanting the names of deities (see <a href="QwanYin.html">QwanYin</a>) or something more elaborate,
        according to your constitution.  For example,
      </p>
      <code>
        Believing in existence is eternalism.<br/>
        Believing in nonexistence is nihilism.<br/>
        Both are stupid.  <em>Ee Ma Ho!</em><br/>

        Q: Oh deep one, can this be done without a reboot?  The microcode clearly already contains instructions for delaying fear, so is it possible to gradually increase the timeouts on those opcodes without breaking the existing firmware?
