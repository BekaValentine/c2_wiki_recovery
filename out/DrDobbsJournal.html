        A very good trade journal devoted mostly to the "nuts and bolts" (how-to) in writing programs for public consumption. It has a noticeable slant towards Intel/Windows platforms, although a fair amount of Unix-y stuff appears from time to time.  Most code examples (in articles other than language introductions) are given in either C or C++, although a growing number of Java articles are being published.

        See article on Lua in December 1996.  I found this a strange article as I couldn't quite visualize how to use the software but was nevertheless intrigued enough to download the software and make use of it.  See references on my own page.

        Used to read a dorm-mates copies all the time long before I had any pretensions of becoming a software guy.  It was <em>way</em> more funky back then...--<a href="TimVoght.html">TimVoght</a>
