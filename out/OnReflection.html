        On Reflection
      </h1>
      <p>
        Someone else may come up with a better definition, but I think of reflection as the ability to reason about the structures and processes of a programming system within the programming system itself.  Examples include the API's to Class objects in <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> and the <a href="CommonLispObjectSystem.html">CommonLispObjectSystem</a>.

        <em>I mostly agree with this. I like to distinguish between a </em>ReflectiveSystem (that contains a description of itself) and a CausallyReflectiveSystem. Changing the <a href="MetaInformation.html">MetaInformation</a> in a ReflectiveSystem typically merely breaks the system. Changing the <a href="MetaInformation.html">MetaInformation</a> in a CausallyReflectiveSystem causes a corresponding change in the behavior of the system. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

        The ObjectOrientationFaq defines ReflectiveSystems as <em>"systems with </em><a href="MetaObjectProtocol.html">MetaObjectProtocol</a>s (not to be confused with reflexive systems, which often refer to systems implemented in terms of themselves, or bootstrapped)",<em> and explains: </em>"In CLOS terminology, an IntrospectiveProtocol provides a read only capability (e.g. what is this object's class, give info on this class, etc.) and an IntercessoryProtocol provides a write capability which allows system modification (e.g. add the following method or instance to this class, perform inheritance this way, etc.)."<em></em>

        Some issues possibly appropriate to this topic include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Do reflective capabilities overall help or hurt software development productivity?
        </li>
        <li>
           Is reflection for mere mortals, or should it be tightly limited?
        </li>
        <li>
           In what practical ways does reflection help in problems of design and/or refactoring?
        </li>
        <li>
           In what ways does reflection help support one or more <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s?
        </li>
        <li>
           What are various flavors/variations on reflection, and what are their pros and cons (e.g. read-only vs. updateable information)
        </li>
      </ul>

        One paper on CLOS (Bobrow, Gabriel, White 1993) mentions the following three aspects of reflection :
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Reification - the presentation of language concepts as "things" accessible to programs written in the language
        </li>
        <li>
           Introspection - the ability of a running program to "find out" about its own structure
        </li>
        <li>
           Intercession - the ability of a running program to alter its own (static) structure
        </li>
      </ul>
