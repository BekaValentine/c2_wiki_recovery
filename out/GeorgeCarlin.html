        Ok. Does this cause the browser to crash? <a href="http://www.georgecarlin.com/georgecarlin/home/home.html">http://www.georgecarlin.com/georgecarlin/home/home.html</a> <em>No - it's okay.</em>

        It would be nice or dangerous to tell him that this page exists.

        I think that he'd at least approve of the concept, though if he visited this page he might be turned off by all the geekery we're engaging in.  I know he's very interested in language and its evolution and usage, but I'm not sure if that would translate into an interest in the evolution of hypertext.  Comedians and other orators often have a keen sense of observation, and can find exciting new ways to look at things; one wonders WhatWouldTheyThinkOfWiki? -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>

        Ok.  I think he would say this is @$#!@ great and then move on in life.   I forgot the <strong>great</strong> part. -- <a href="MichaelFinney.html">MichaelFinney</a>
