        Game Of Poker

        Not really one game but a set of related games.

        <a href="GameTheory.html">GameTheory</a> can be used to give a good strategy for playing poker assuming your opponents are competent. There are various online casinos that host poker games, and there are reputed to be a lot of bots playing in these casinos, but this is hard to verify as often casinos have a policy of not allowing bots. Given that, and the fact that anyone with a decent poker bot is presumably quietly running it on as many games as possible, it is hard to know whether <a href="GameTheory.html">GameTheory</a> is actually used for poker bots, or if something else is.
