        Remember The Future
      </h1>
      <p>
        In programming, the cost of maintaining a project is higher than the cost of developing the project.  Within a few months, you can forget the details of what you've done.  Therefore, as you work, remember that someone will be looking at your work in the future.  Do everything you can to make their job easier.  That person may even be you.
