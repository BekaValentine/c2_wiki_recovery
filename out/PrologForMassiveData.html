        Prolog For Massive Data

      <p>
        I think a <a href="PrologForMassiveData.html">PrologForMassiveData</a> as described below would be the language of choice for <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>
        (collected together from <a href="RelationalAlgebra.html">RelationalAlgebra</a>, <a href="RelationalProgrammingLanguage.html">RelationalProgrammingLanguage</a> and <a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>).

        '<a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> is an in-memory database of "facts".'
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "In memory" That should be considered an implementation detail. Ideally, the distinction between RAM and disk should not be something a developer has to worry much about. -- top

           Sorry, this page was written too fast and late. It was a copy from somewhere else. It meant: Prolog is considered by some as an in-memory database of "facts". But if you extend it in the way proposed below to handle persistent data, then the distinction you mentioned should in fact become an implementation detail. --.gz

        <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> has tuples, but you examine them using pattern matching instead of using labels. Prolog is based on predicate logic rather than relational calculus. <a href="RelationalCalculus.html">RelationalCalculus</a> is, I think, a restricted form of predicate logic. The truth statements of prologs are similar to the rows of a relational table:
      </p>
      <code>
        employee ('Joe Doe', 1979, 'Department of Defense').<br/>
        employee_managed_by ('Joe Doe', 'Mister X'). <br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Why does this remind me so much of <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> ActiveSupport?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The thing that <a href="RelationalCalculus.html">RelationalCalculus</a> is missing are the rules of Prolog. It is straightforward to have a "directReports" relationship in a relational table - associating each employee with his/her boss - but deriving the "indirectReports" relationship (the transitive closure of the directReports relationship) is trickier. You can do it with RelationalJoins, but that's ugly. Or with actual SQL you might use views or 'cursors'. A rule in <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> expresses this relationship much more succinctly.
      </p>
      <p>
        In any case, can an SqlQuery be mapped to a PrologRule?
      </p>

        A <a href="PrologForMassiveData.html">PrologForMassiveData</a> could extend <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> with the following features:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           annotations for facts (the truth statements for rows above) and rules, that give hints to the compiler about size and atomicity or the 'relation'.
        </li>
        <li>
           special forms (predicates) for setting up the PrologDb.
        </li>
        <li>
           variants of assert() and retract, that work persistently on the PrologDb.
        </li>

        A variant of this approach has been taken for <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>. See <a href="HaskellDb.html">HaskellDb</a>.
