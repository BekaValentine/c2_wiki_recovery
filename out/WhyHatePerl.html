        Why Hate Perl

        Some believe that a reason to hate Perl is that there are always one or more modules missing. However, <a href="TheCpan.html">TheCpan</a> along with the CPAN module (and its putative replacement, CPANPLUS, which does everything CPAN.pm does and more besides) make that a non-issue. One of the best bits about Perl is the simplistic ease of maintaining the packages: 
      </p>
      <code>
        perl -MCPAN -e shell<br/>
        install Some::Module<br/>
      </code>

        <a href="LessIsMore.html">LessIsMore</a> !! use cpanminus (<a href="http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::cpanminus)">http://search.cpan.org/perldoc?App::cpanminus)</a> !!
      </p>
      <code>
        cpanm Some::Module<br/>

        Wrote my first Perl program today. And I can see why the kind of people that find tinkering around with network configurations all day would enjoy it. Using prefixes like <em>$</em>, <em>@</em> and <em>%</em> on identifiers isn't a good way to express your type system. But it is <em>cute</em>, it is <em>cool</em>, in that down-in-the-bowels-of the system way that some people in the industry like.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And it is also because parser variable interpolation is cleaner than adding strings:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        my $world="Earth"; print "hello $world\n";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>versus:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        String world = "Earth"; System.out.println("Hello " + world + "\n");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>However, this particular malady has been addressed in Java 1.5, so you can now do things like:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        String world = "Earth"; System.out.format("Hello %s\n", world);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Uh ... the malady has not been addressed with that particular archaism ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are people who thrive on learning random facts by brute force, and for them <em>$_</em> and <em><></em>' are perfectly clear, even intuitive.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>There are also people who are prepared to read manuals, but why ruin a good rant. Please, carry on.</em>

      <p>
        These people are very useful to have around, sometimes.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Yes, these people are like mathematicians, with all of their silly and inefficient signs for integrals, sums, whatever - why not spell it all out in plain English! That would be more Rational, would it not?</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But I no more want to use the tools that those folks get off on to write my software than I would want to make up my own wet collodion plates to do photography. It's not masochism that makes people think that this kind of thing is good, and it's not lack of thought, either, though it kind of looks like it. Maybe there isn't even a word for it. But this way of thinking about software, what it's for, and how to write it, that Perl seems to represent is not something I even want to know exists, never mind get involved in. It's creepy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider this: how could one think <a href="ContextSensitivity.html">ContextSensitivity</a> a big win unless one also thought that it's better for the programmer to keep a bunch of state about the program in your head, including a rules about the interpreter's default behaviour, than to type a few <em>$_</em>s. Do you think this way? Then Perl is for you. Want to devote most of your mental effort to your problem, rather then your technology? Then Perl is not for you.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Comment: That's silly. Using prefixes is trivial and irrelevant to the point you're making. I suppose you put down Python because you have to manually include various modules - like regular expressions - which are built into Perl? Also, you can always use English;</em>

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Clearly, the elegant iconography of code, a practice that extends far back in the history of mathematics, and championed by the likes of Leibniz, is completely lost on folks who make such arguments. The iconography of perl takes advantage of the signifying capability of the ASCII character set, by assigning simple mnemonics to each prefix - e.g. $ = value (as in "show me the money"), @ = array (as in there is a little a in there), % = hash (as in a pair of little round thingies), etc. It takes a second to learn and simplifies things immensely, where other languages force a roll-your-own Hungarian syntax that is both ugly and unscannable, since you actually have to read a variable's name to determine what the heck it is. Languages such as Java and Python remake the mistake of BASIC, which falsely assumes that spelling things out makes things simpler. Not! The simplicity of language lies in its morphology, syntax, and pragmatic structure. Larry, a linguist, knows this.</em>  (It is also <a href="HungarianNotation.html">HungarianNotation</a>, which is just a smidgen shy of being universally rejected by any programmer with even 3 days of coding experience.  --SamuelFalvo)

        <li>
           Stop trying to make a script language like perl sound so noble.  A linguist should know better then to design a programming language after natural language.  A natural language, as long as it is still used, is a moving target.  If you write a book, the time will come when people can't understand it because the natural language has shifted away from when you wrote it.  Also, by the nature of language, it is hard to remember.  If you don't visit a portion of it for a time you will loose it.  The exact opposite of riding a bicycle.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is a ludicrous argument. Natural language is understandable for hundreds of years past most noticeable changes. Go and make your arguments about perl's deficiencies when /any/ computer language comes /anywhere/ close to the lifespan of natural languages. -bjc

           There is nothing "natural" about using symbols such as # $ % @ ->{} () [] in all conceivable combinations all over the place. When I look at somebody's Perl code I get indigestion.

      <p>
        I use Perl. Mostly, I like Perl. But there are some things that Perl does that I cannot stand.
      </p>
      <p>
        The syntax. I can live with $, @ and even %. But please, not the references. Not the anonymous references to an array of hashes which make less sense than the <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a>s on h4X0red crack.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>$, @ and % aren't just syntax, they're semantics as well. Every time you access a variable, you're doing a cast.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The type safety. Call me crazy, but I'd like to define a variable as a specific type without having to assign it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You are crazy. The very existence of references and their ubiquity is a pretty clear indication that your type safety is only virtual. Why do all the work casting things back and forth? The computer is faster and better at keeping track of type anyway.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The functions calls. I realized they've improved and now you don't need & any more. But perl has no clear means for exception handling, no good returns, the parameter handling sucks (try passing two or more arrays in!), and even when you use a prototype, it's done in the eclectic Perl fashion ($$%@) is four parameters, all of which are without names. Whee.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>passing two or more arrays - I just as much or more often want to pass a flattened array to a function that expects multiple arguments. I like how easy that is in </em><a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>. A backslash to pass by reference when I want to do that is no big deal. You can't have it both ways (default behavior, that is). I know <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> prefixes a "*" when you want to flatten a list. I don't care which way it is. It's going to be inconvenient whenever you want to do the thing your language doesn't do by default.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Actually, no. Ruby's "*" doesn't "flatten," it "splats" (or unsplats, as the case may be). Flattening and splatting are different.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I admit I only played with Ruby and Rails for a few days (some time ago)...and was baffled when I needed to pass an array as separate arguments to a function. I found "splat", and it did what I wanted it to do.</em>

        The imports. I realize that Perl has a wide library of utilities. But have you tried packaging these things? Can you figure out from context what these things do, without looking at the docs? Are they self-documenting? Do the parameter names make sense? No, no, no and no. The whole thing is hacked up from the bottom and held together with CPAN and perldoc.

      <p>
        <em>Have I tried packaging them? Yes. It's a snap. 20 seconds with H2XS and you have a blank package, populate it with code, type 'make dist', job done. How easy can it be? </em>

        <em>And as for the 'can you figure out what they do without looking at the docs' - Jeez, I know that reading documentation is alien to some people, but it is there for a purpose you know!...

           Pretty ignorant example.  Interesting that you picked a module that is so spelled out to illistrate your point.  Could you tell me, without looking, what Gantry does?  When I was forced to use perl and had to look for modules on CPAN I can tell you there were plenty of modules that it is not easy to figure out what they do.

      <p>
        I concur with the above criticisms, <em>especially</em> the lack of real exception handling (and suggesting die is a bad joke made all the worse by the fact that it's a serious suggestion and even a widely-used practice) and <em>really especially</em> the crippling difficulty of passing multiple arrays to a subroutine. This latter fault is, i think, actually a symptom of a general failure to make arrays work sensibly - rather than treating them as first-class objects, it's almost like the interpreter just rewrites them as a sequence of scalars and pretends they never existed. Consequently, passing two arrays to a subroutine is a hopeless case, and passing in or returning an array (or even moving it from one variable to another) actually makes a copy (if I wanted a copy, I'd <em>ask for a bloody copy</em>; now tell me how I'm going to get this data out of my subroutine without using the return value or a global!). Of course, all these problems can be overcome by using references, but in more considered languages, like Java and Python, this is simply the normal behaviour of variables, and things work without half a dozen extra characters. And while we're at it, why do <a href="LarryWall.html">LarryWall</a> and company think that every problem can be solved just by throwing syntax at it? I hate perl. -- <a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>

        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Can you clarify why you think the die/eval exception handling model in Perl is so bad? It does everything that I need exceptions for.</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Because it doesn't have exceptions?  It has a way to run a string in a different interpreter and check a string to see if it died.  Of course if you "throw" exceptions, take care to reset the __DIE__ handle or you might get caught by code that naively thought die meant die.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Begging your pardon, but you're mixing up two uses of eval. There is eval EXPR, which does as you say, it runs EXPR in a different interpreter, and there is eval BLOCK, which just catches die statements and assigns the die output to $@. Sure, it's a very basic way of handling exceptions, but it is still not quite what you say it is.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>JUST PASS BY REFERENCE! </em><a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>s have always passed by reference anyway, it's only when I read this I even realized that passing multiple arrays would be a problem without references. Since I naturally create arrays and hashes as references in the first place - eg my ($foo) = {}; - then I never even worry about the problem. Just use references and quit whining.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, JUST USE A LANGUAGE WHICH GETS IT RIGHT! Real <em>languages</em> have always passed by reference anyway. You are, of course, absolutely right that references are the right solution. So why is there a non-reference option? Why am I forced to ignore the 'normal' mode of variable use, forget that I ever so much as saw an @, and go around writing $foo->[0] to get at the contents of my arrays? Idiotic! Just use python and quit crying. <em>I don't understand this last bit. The Perl critic seems to be the one who is crying and needs a different language. Idiotic indeed.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and while we're at it, let's not forget that you're not allowed:
      </p>
      <code>
        if ($foo) doSomething() ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Because you <em>have</em> to have a block there! And before you get all "doSomething() if $foo" on me - shouldn't there be more than one way to do it? Ideally, including at least one way that's consistent with the multi-line version?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's</em> better? Rather than having a slight variation between one-item and N-item cases, now when you want to add doSomethingElse() you now need to...
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Pull the "if $foo" out from between the actual statement and the ";".
        </li>
        <li>
           Put parentheses around the expression after the "if".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All this in addition to adding the "{" and "}" that you would have to do anyway. Just brilliant. <em>Id like to add that Awk does it best:</em>

      <code>

        For the curious, do {local(*FH)} creates a local typeglob named FH and immediately takes it out of scope (its scope is just the do block) and returns the now anonymous typeglob. Assign that to a variable and you can now open a file on it, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of Perl 5.6 you can open a file on a variable without assigning a typeglob to it first, so this hack is no longer needed. And, of course, Perl 6 will get rid of typeglobs entirely.

        More or less? I try <em>not</em> to think about it. I had managed to figure out what it was, sort of, but that didn't lessen my incredulity. It's just a magic incantation to placate the interpreter. Perl is full of magic incantations. The more magic in a language, the harder is is to learn and remember. It took until version 5.6 for this to go away?

        I find Perl good for simple things; even simple web forms. Once the project gets sufficently large (enough where there are more than two developers), using perl can be a major development risk, in my opinion, just due to the non-structured, nearly unreadable code....

Perl gets a bad rap because a lot of people hack together CGI scripts in ways that aren't clean and won't scale.

        First a perfectly absurd example. The following line is not a no-op, and knowing what it does can be very important when writing parsing logic in Perl:
      </p>
      <code>
        pos($foo) = pos($foo);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This resets a flag on $foo. That it does this is documented. To the best of my knowledge, it is mentioned exactly once in the documentation, but it is accurately described there. To learn that it sets a flag and what this flag does you have to read <a href="http://www.ayni.com/perldoc/perl5.8.0/pod/perlre.html#Repeated-patterns-matching-zero-length-substring">http://www.ayni.com/perldoc/perl5.8.0/pod/perlre.html#Repeated-patterns-matching-zero-length-substring</a> and not miss the implications of the last paragraph. Of course, the few people who got that far in perlre without their eyes glazing over completely are unlikely to get past the first sentence of that section. (Follow the link to see why not!)

      <p>
        Now for a bigger problem. Perl's scoping rules are so baroque that one of the most widely quoted tutorials on the language is named Coping with Scoping (and is found at <a href="http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Namespaces.html).">http://perl.plover.com/FAQs/Namespaces.html).</a> The underlying problem is that originally the language was dynamically scoped. Sometimes the dynamic scoping was explicit, sometimes not. Perl 5 introduced a lexical scoping system which only some things worked with. Over releases of Perl, what will work with lexical scoping has increased. See the do{local(*FH)} example for something which didn't work but now does. So Perl has 2 scoping systems which do not cooperate, and things that you would want to be lexically scoped (like $_ - which is implicitly used a lot <em>and</em> is always in package main) almost invariably are dynamically scoped instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        This tutorial was, of course, written before the "our" operator was added. That operator provides lexically scoped access to a global variable. I have commented on why I think badly of this at <a href="http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=48379.">http://www.perlmonks.org/index.pl?node_id=48379.</a> But anyone who remembers, for instance, Fortran's common blocks shouldn't need it explained...

        I could go on at great length about the bizarre and ugly syntax of perl, the myriad boobytraps that penalize clarity and reward obfuscation, the general frustration and head-banging that the language causes... but rather than reiterate other people's points, let me point out two articles of perl dogma that seem to form the basis of the whole perl mindset:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The terser the source code, the better. <em>This is pure FUD.</em> (Actually, it's a good rule of thumb. The problem is that Perl often thinks that "terse" = fewer characters as opposed to fewer concepts. Perl encourages you to pack so many concepts on a line (especially if you use regexps) that a line of Perl can sometimes be roughly equivalent to, say, four lines of Pascal. Not that PascalSucks not.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The more ways there are to do something, the better.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These are simply asserted as articles of faith that you may not question without invoking the wrath of the perl gods... but common sense and everyday experience tell you they are just plain wrong. Proceeding from a wrong premise, it's no wonder that the language has developed into a Byzantine monstrosity and is beyond hope IMHO.

        I'm learning Perl from the O'Reilly book "<a href="ProgrammingPerl.html">ProgrammingPerl</a>". In the first section on <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s, there's sample code for finding all the "http"'s in a file and printing them:
      </p>
      <code>
        while ($line = <FILE>) {<br/>
        if ($line =~ /http:/) {<br/>
        print $line;<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That seems reasonable. Below this is another example that does the same thing, prefaced by "so a veteran Perl programmer would likely write the last example as:"
      </p>
      <code>
        while (<FILE>) {<br/>
        print if /http:/;<br/>
        }<br/>

      <p>
        I thought to myself, "These authors really don't understand how veteran programmers think. Veteran programmers avoid tricks so they don't have to repeatedly explain them to junior programmers." Then I looked on the cover and saw that Larry Wall was one of the authors. Suddenly, it all made sense: Perl is the perfect language for writing code that only one person will ever look at.

           Why doesn't Perl have named argument lists? I can think of no good reason for passing all arguments in @_ by default. All the dynamic languages allow the programmer to fetch all the arguments in an array, but Perl 5 is the only one I know of which permits <em>only</em> that mode.

        Perl is quite arguably a bad language from a learning/readability standpoint. It is easy to write incomprensible Perl code. It is merely argumentative, however, to say that it can't be comprensible to someone other than its author on first reading. Unless you are talking about a complete perl novice, which I would argue is a very difficult test for ANY language. I certainly can't read Lisp or Smalltalk code, no matter how well written. I might be able to get the gist, and I could certainly learn the language, but no computer language currently exists that is both powerfully expressive and trivial to comprehend without training.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, you can definitely argue that the entire culture of Perl reinforces the notion that it is okay to write unreadable code. Certainly a large subset of it does.

        On the other hand, my XP team had generated quite a large code-base, and the majority of it was *quite* readable to someone knowledgeable enough in Perl to understand OO Perl coding and with a relatively firm grasp on argument passing and references.

        Well written Perl is perhaps more legible than well written code in many other languages. It has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A high degree of inbuilt abstraction
        </li>
        <li>
           The ability to say the same thing in many different ways. This lets you choose the most readable version in context (on the other hand, it is precisely because of this flexibility that badly written Perl is perhaps more unreadable that most other languages. Few people take the time to work out which idiom would be more readable in a given context.)
        </li>
      </ul>

        <li>
           "Looking good" is highly subjective.  I've had the misfortune of maintaining some Perl code which was mostly well factored and otherwise "looked good."  There were a ton of idiomatic programming left in the otherwise apparently clean Perl code.

        I read this page with mixed feelings. I love Perl, but it can be hard to respect yourself in the morning.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have done some Perl work, some of it very non-trivial.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was given a data warehouse (actually more of an offline ODS) and a set of large (13.5 GB) log files and told to find more than 3 million dollars in discrepancies between the logs and the offline data, and discover not only where they occurred, but also why.
      </p>
      <p>
        After examining the offline tables and the text logs, I decided to have a whack at it in Perl (I needed the practice). It was Friday, so if all I got done was problem analysis, no one would complain. I drafted some attempts at reading the table dumps and comparing the values to the log values. By mid-afternoon, I had a two-page script that scanned and parsed 13+GB of table dumps and 13+GB of text logs, producing a profile, detail, summary, and conclusion (which proved to be correct) - and which executed in 35 seconds.
      </p>
      <p>
        My results were validated (woohoo!) and I was asked to show how I had solved the problem in less than a day. I produced the two pages of Perl - and very nearly couldn't interpret what I'd written.
      </p>
      <code>
        Hey look - I did magic!<br/>
        <em>What did you do?</em><br/>
        Well, I'm not really sure ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        On the other hand, I was given a project about a year later to review and validate a complete e-commerce system written in Perl 5.x to replace a wonderfully elegant, well written, well commented, perfectly modular system in Java - which didn't work and could not be maintained.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Perl code was written by one guy. He had reverse engineered the Java system and and reimplemented it in Perl. My job was to confirm that the Perl code was correct, robust, maintainable; in other words, not like the existing Java system. I never saw the Java code.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Perl code was as clean and lucid as anything I've read in any other language. Thousands and thousands of lines of modular, well-organized Perl. I hadn't even realized you could do that, since my own Perl style was "hack until it works" and I reserved the more formal disciplines for C/C++ and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will say that Perl has its own "state of flow" and while you're in the groove, everything makes sense. After a couple of "can't read what I wrote" incidents though, you'll want to reserve part of your mind to leave yourself clues that you'll need once you've "left the flow" because (if you're mortal) you'll need them.

        <em>You can write maintainable or unmaintainable code in any language. I have seen unmaintainable code in Perl, VB, COBOL, C++, SQL, C# and Java. What it takes is discipline which a distressing number of people lack. I wrote a large (~10K LOC) application in Perl and have no problem returning to it since I commented anything obscure, followed a fairly standard set of conventions and avoided tricky stuff. Basically in any programming language when I get to a point where I think "I can be clever in this part" my next thought is usually "should I be clever on this part?" and most of the time the answer is "no". Anyway, one nice thing about Perl is that it is very easy to build classes on the fly and create objects from them. And the horrible parameter passing? I think they stole that from LISP. I do not use it for everything, but when I need it it sure is handy.</em>

      <p>
        Perl's status as a <a href="WriteOnlyLanguage.html">WriteOnlyLanguage</a> is incidental (though surely not coincidental), and as several people have pointed out, code can be written badly in any language, and Perl code can be clean and readable. But the problem is not code written in Perl. The problem is Perl. It's a baroque, badly-designed language that tries to solve its problems by adding features to the language. Good languages start with a small core of well-designed fundamental features, and build up from there. Perl has so many features in the language itself that they can hardly be called fundamental, and most are designed badly, some terribly.

        Because almost anytime you mention it, someone starts complaining how hard and bizarre it is, often overshadowing (or halting) a useful conversation. This includes in perl-specific IRC channels. We need something like a Godwin's Law applied to the complexities of perl so that, at least, more useful criticisms of perl can enter the mainstream.

           Reasonable concern? carp: 1. verb. to say or tell 2. verb To find fault with. (1913 webster). perldoc Carp is also helpful and answers all your questions except the last in the first section. Your not liking the name choices is rather irrelevant. I'm not going to argue their meaning is intuitive, but given some knowledge of the English language and the skills involved in reading and understanding a dictionary, I think anyone can live with those function names.

        Some love Perl, others hate it. It's obvious when you read these rants. However, you can't argue with CPAN ... obviously enough people find it useful that they churn out lots of wonderful high-level libraries. Need to write a quick SOAP client? A few lines of SOAP::Simple will do it. Need to muck around finding the optimum value of something? Use Math::Amoeba. Or need to do some clever classifications? AI::NaiveBayes1. How about including some native non-perl? Use Inline; 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, other languages have big libraries too. But since there is so much free Perl out there, obviously there are lots of programmers who find it a good language to write in. Let's face it, every language sucks: they all suck in different ways.

        There's the problem right there.  Perl offers you too much creativity and freedom.   You can do things as quick and dirty as you want.  VERY dirty.  Now whose fault is it that your Perl code is unmaintainable?  Mine?  Larry's?  The person who started this thread?  Your own?  AH-HA!!
