        Stewards Kill Cee Two

        The fact is the stupid code-word editing restriction is either off, which invites abuse, or on, which silences community. It doesn't work.

        It was really one steward in particular, that killed Wiki.  No amount of warnings, or explaining of the wrongness of his approach, or attempts to waken him could stop his vendetta against Wiki.  Then, only when Wiki was nearly dead did he back off, but it was much too late.  <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> did not help the matter, but was not the main cause.  As soon as you stop current events, and other interesting discussions, you end up with nothing but a boring tomb, and all innovation and exchange of new and innovative ideas comes to a halt.  This was the warning given then, over and over, but the masses did not listen, and the dictator did rule.  Now there is but a pile of ruins, and even Google has once again turned its back.  Wisdom, is never realized by the foolish, even in hindsight.

        From these ruins we can rebuild. From the ashes a fire shall be woken. I stand ready.
