        <em>You can use any  </em><a href="JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition.html">JavaTwoEnterpriseEdition</a> app server.  I am comfortable on my couch.<em></em>

        Are there examples of <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> customers switching off (or on the verge of doing so) <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> in favor of <a href="WebsphereApplicationServer.html">WebsphereApplicationServer</a> or other alternatives?
      </p>
      <p>
        I have been hearing stories about CFOs considering downsizing mainframes but have not seen any written articles?

        <em>I doubt you'll find anything like that, considering that we (IBM) heavily promote running </em><a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> application Server on zOS (e.g. the mainframe operating system).  The hardware is immaterial. If you need 5 9's availability, then zSeries hardware is good.  If you want cheaper hardware costs, then go to Intel or Power-PC based hardware... --<a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a><em></em>

        OK, how about from <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> to <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> or <a href="LampEnterpriseSolutions.html">LampEnterpriseSolutions</a>? Reason for this question is our organisation has had a policy to retire <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a>, now started into <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>. New substantial applications are being architected in <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>, and also there is intention for ERP solution to go use midrange servers (now still DB2) at some time in future.
      </p>
      <p>
        Can not imagine we are the only organisation doing these experiments, just interested to know whether some companies have actually gone through the halfway point to ridding itself of mainframe.

        Will move this discussion to <a href="BigIron.html">BigIron</a> once more views / information has been collected. Again, any links? -- dl
