        Who Shot Jfk
      </h1>
      <p>
        Pete has conclusively proved it was an accident: <a href="http://petermerel.newsvine.com/_news/2007/08/26/921098-jfk-shooting-accidental">http://petermerel.newsvine.com/_news/2007/08/26/921098-jfk-shooting-accidental</a>

        <a href="WhoShotJfk.html">WhoShotJfk</a>? Isn't it obvious? J. Edgar Hoover. Oh, he didn't have his finger on the trigger, but he ordered it and covered it up. Jack and Bobby had several well documented confrontations with Hoover and his plant inside the CIA, Bill Campbell. It's on the public record that the "dynamic duo" were about to forcibly retire Hoover, who wasn't known for taking threats to his position lightly. Note that the very first act of LBJ after Jack's death was to make Hoover director-for-life.

        <em>Okay, maybe, plausible, but so are a dozen other crackpot ideas.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Only Hoover had the power to cover it up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, </em>GeraldFord covered it up by altering the findings of the WarrenCommission, of which he was a member. As for who actually ordered it ... <a href="http://crimemagazine.com/03/richardnixon,1014.htm">http://crimemagazine.com/03/richardnixon,1014.htm</a> makes a pretty good circumstantial case against RichardNixon. Who was, naturally enough, a protege of PrescottBush who was Bush 41's father. And Bush 41 and Nixon were both in Dallas that day ...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Along with maybe a couple million other co-conspirators! See, the problem with this guff is it's all circumstantial. Okay, so Nixon knew who did it for sure - he's on the record, courtesy of his tapes released in 2002, as saying the WarrenCommission was the "biggest hoax ever perpetuated [sic]". But that doesn't make him the guy or guys who ordered it. If you really want to know what evil lurks in the hearts of men, you ghoul, look in a mirror.

        Jackie did it with a concealed handgun, having become fed up with Jack's philandering. It was all explained in <em>The National Lampoon</em> back in the 1970s. Sheesh! -- <a href="DonOlson.html">DonOlson</a>

        What would it matter if we knew? We know who murdered Caesar, but it doesn't help one very much in daily life. Or was Brutus just a peon in a chess game of the Roman CIA? -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

        I'm with Stephen. I don't know if the CIA actually did kill JFK, but I firmly believe that they would do so if they felt like it was worth the trouble. There are plenty of well-document incidences that prove that the agency is beyond the pale. If it were revealed that they were responsible for the deaths of JFK, Martin Luther King, and Mother Theresa, my opinion of them would not diminish in the slightest. [<em>If they did manage all three, they deserve a bonus life.</em>]

           They've admitted to malcolm x, and say they were planning MLK but someone beat them to it.

        Timothy Leary said it was the Mafia. Seemed plausible. A <em>crime passionelle</em>. It has recently been <em>proven</em> using sound processing software that there were multiple shots from separate locations. For what its worth.
      </p>

        It couldn't have been the mafia; they couldn't have covered it up as well as it was.

        If you use the same source of information to track the direction of the bullet that struck JFK in the head as the bullet that struck him in the back you come up with two different directions. Also why did the killing bullet burst into scraps of lead when it hit JFK and  the other bullet recovered was bairly misshapened after going through two bodies some bones?

        Under JFK it was becoming clear that the USA would not only be a world power, but would spread democracy throughout the entire world.  Eventually there would be a single world government, and all peoples would unite to eradicate poverty and injustice.  People would no longer scrabble to survive, with a dominant few suppressing the majority.  Equality would be the norm.
      </p>
      <p>
        People's attention would naturally turn outwards to space, and the now plentiful resources would be used to finally break the bonds of our cradle planet.  Humanity would spread to the planets, and eventually to the stars.  Our future would be assured, and we would take our proper place as rulers of the Universe.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Greys foresaw this and found the pivotal man, the pivotal moment.  It was they who arranged the assassination of JFK, thus preventing the unity that would have been his legacy.  The bullets were fired into a teleporter from one of their space-ships, materialising only yards from the man himself.  They came from different directions because the ship was in orbit.  One disintegrated more because it had to be teleported further.
