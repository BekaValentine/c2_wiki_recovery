        <a href="MiddleMan.html">MiddleMan</a> is a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>.

      <p>
        A <a href="MiddleMan.html">MiddleMan</a> is a class that delegates most of its work to other classes. 
        A <a href="MiddleMan.html">MiddleMan</a> is a class that is doing too much simple delegation instead of really contributing to the application. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MiddleMan.html">MiddleMan</a> can often be removed and their functionality placed in the classes that they were mediating.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hmm. How does this relate to </em><a href="MediatorPattern.html">MediatorPattern</a> and <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MiddleMan.html">MiddleMan</a> is not a code smell with the <a href="MediatorPattern.html">MediatorPattern</a> and <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a> when one of these patterns is used to provide a choke point for a particular aspect. One might call this poor man's <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>. If the mediator or facade does not do anything much then it probably is a smell. The reason I mention this particular case is that Aspects often are invisible to the functionality of the program and merely cover sort of a side aspect, so the program behaves like one of these patterns is merely a <a href="MiddleMan.html">MiddleMan</a>, but in reality it is not. The code stops smelling once you use the <a href="MiddleMan.html">MiddleMan</a> to implement an aspect.
