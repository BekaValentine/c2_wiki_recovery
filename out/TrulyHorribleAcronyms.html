        Truly Horrible Acronyms
      </h1>
      <p>
        Computer scientists, computer marketing professionals, and other geeks are fond of coming up with acronyms for products/technologies. Some of the acronyms used are clever, some are boring. And some are truly horrible - either being difficult to pronounce, utterly contrived, or both.
      </p>
      <p>
        No fair putting <a href="BackroNym.html">BackroNym</a>s on the list - or if you do, identify them as such.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the worst: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           PCMCIA (Personal Computer Manufacturers Cannot Invent Acronyms, er, Personal Computer Memory Card International Association). When it was just a trade association, it was less of a problem. When it became the name for those slots on your laptop, big problem. Unpronounceable (other than to recite the letters), and doesn't stand for anything <em>useful</em> (other than the name or the organization that promoted it). <em>Also known as People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms, or for an added bit of quirkiness and irony, People Can't Remember Computer Industry Acronyms.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               I pronounce it as "pick-mick-ee-uh" on occasion, just because I'm weird like that. ::grin:: -- <a href="CodyBoisclair.html">CodyBoisclair</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               Before digging out the proper meaning, the best I came up with was Pulse Code Modulated Central Intelligence Agency.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Captcha. <a href="http://www.captcha.net/">http://www.captcha.net/</a> <strong>C</strong>ompletely <strong>A</strong>utomated <strong>P</strong>rogrammable <strong>T</strong>uring-test to tell <strong>C</strong>omputers and <strong>H</strong>umans <strong>A</strong>part. Refers to those UI widgets (<a href="CaptchaTest.html">CaptchaTest</a>s) designed to detect and foil bots, where a picture of a word is displayed, along with various image-processing tricks to fool OCR algorithms, and the user has to type the word into the box. The idea is useful; the acronym is truly terrible. Not easily pronounced, and what it stands for is unbelievably contrived.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Huh? take 'gotcha' and replace 'go' with 'cap' and you have it! Pretty easily pronounceable to me. You can also think of 'capture', I believe it's fairly obvious how to pronounce capture as captcha. As to being an "unbelievably contrived" acronym - that's probably to make it easily pronounceable!</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  I subscribe to that, being a German I was associating Caps and gotcha and "that's how we gotcha you BOT!" But, if that is really an acronym, what does it mean spelled out? --<a href="ManorainjanHolzapfel.html">ManorainjanHolzapfel</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>As stated above, it means </em>'C<strong>ompletely </strong>A<strong>utomated </strong>P<strong>rogrammable </strong>T<strong>uring-test to tell </strong>C<strong>omputers and </strong>H<strong>umans </strong>A<em>'part.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="InterCal.html">InterCal</a>. An acronym for "Computer Language With No Pronounceable Acronym". Don't ask. :)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          GNU.  It stands for "GNU's Not Unix!"  It is extremely annoying to pronounce, and it shares a name with the wildebeest.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>A good portion of common open-source tools sound like slang or terms for </em>'puke, snot, or medical conditions<strong>. I'm just the messenger: Grep, GIMP, </strong><a href="PostgreSql.html">PostgreSql</a>, Vuze, Ogg Vorbis, Troff (gesundheit) etc. I wonder if such names give tools "geek cred" by making them clearly "un-suit-like". <a href="FutureOpenSourceToolNames.html">FutureOpenSourceToolNames</a>.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               {Toad and SAP don't sound particularly "suit-like" either, and they're quintessentially commercial.} Ditto MUMPS.

            <li>
               <em>Some think toads are cute. (How many, I don't know.) And SAP came from mostly the German market and may have a different feel in German. Same with Siemens perhaps.</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  SAP in Germany is simply spoken S A P. Nobody says 'sap'. It has a very similar impression in Germany as IBM may have had in USA. SAP is what 'happens' to any given organisation to end any wikiness of any sorts there ;-) And Siemens is simply a half way common family name, not an acronym at all and the sound of reliability rather than innovation. --<a href="ManorainjanHolzapfel.html">ManorainjanHolzapfel</a> (My father worked at Siemens railway signalling department)

               That one's not actually an acronym, according to the people that developed the protocol; rather, it was derived from Kipling's "...never the twain shall meet". Though the backronym <em>is</em> a rather amusing one, I must admit! -- <a href="CodyBoisclair.html">CodyBoisclair</a>

               <em>"Technology Without An Interesting Name", if I remember correctly. I saw it when setting up my scanner a few years back. Now, they all have interesting names like HP </em>SuperDuperScan 1.5 version Hilda.<em></em>

               I've heard "dub-dub-dub" on a few occasions. And one Internet radio station I listened to a while back pronounced it "double-U's", assuming the listener would know that there should be three of them. Then there's the rather facetious suggestion, "sextuple-U"... -- <a href="CodyBoisclair.html">CodyBoisclair</a>
            </li>
            <li>
               I've often heard it as "triple-double-U".
            </li>
            <li>
               In Dutch, German and Swedish WWW is pronounced ve ve ve, which is quite quick...
            </li>
            <li>
               I tend to pronounce it "wuh," but this has yet to catch on.
            </li>
            <li>
               Also heard it as "wawawiwa", which is horrible in its own right.

               Is this finally a legitimate use for "wibble"?

               the infernal problem here is no standard or recommendation backs "WWW". <a href="WebMaster.html">WebMaster</a>s could break this bad habit by aliasing their next server to "web.foo.org". Also see <a href="http://no-www.org/">http://no-www.org/</a>

               you can tell <em>that</em> was an acronym invented by a committee of white males, huh?
            </li>
            <li>
               it made discussing furnace controllers with members of the opposite SECS very uncomfortable!

           TCP/IP. Transmission Control Protocol over Internet Protocol. Any acronym which contains punctuation (not counting optional periods between letters) is dubious. This one is terrible. Plus, it is frequently ambiguous/incorrect, as other applications of IP (such as UDP or raw sockets) which don't involve TCP are frequently brought under the TCP/IP umbrella.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Plus, IP is overloaded - Internet Protocol or Intellectual Property?
            </li>
            <li>
               And while not the fault of the acronym; how often does one hear "ethernet" being used as a synonym for IP networks in general (regardless of the underlying medium)?

        I'm guilty of some bad ones with my current company's intranet system, which has gone through many interpretations of the system's acronym. The most polite (generally reserved for demos of the system to clients, new employees, etc.) is "Business Functionality Portal." As of this writing, it's the "Blatantly Frivolous Portal." The original code-name for the project when I started it was the Big Fricken Portal, a tribute to the BFG weapon from Doom. -- MikeLewis

        How about some good acronyms? I built some ATE for testing modems back in the 80's. Called the design Modem Automated Test Table, so that I could use MATT as a simple, one-syllable name for a rather complex collection of IEEE-488 gear and software.
