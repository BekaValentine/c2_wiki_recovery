        Designing Vs Modeling
      </h1>
      <p>
        These days (1999) I distinguish between Modeling and Designing.  I say
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "Modeling" is describing something you know. A good model makes correct assertions.
        </li>
        <li>
           "Designing" is manipulating space for things you don't know. A good design e.g., lets you change things easily (there are many dimensions of 'goodness').
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You take a drawing of the Model into the room full of business and database and other experts.  They critique it to see whether it contains any <a href="FalseAssertionsAndUnattractiveRestrictions.html">FalseAssertionsAndUnattractiveRestrictions</a> regarding their business.

        "Designing" for me is manipulating space for things you know for sure (i.e. you have running automated tests for). --<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        Just as a good design lets you change things easily, so does a good modeling language.  From <em></em><a href="InformationModelingAndRelationalDatabases.html">InformationModelingAndRelationalDatabases</a><em> by </em><a href="TerryHalpin.html">TerryHalpin</a>, the following criteria provide a basis for evaluating conceptual modeling languages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Expressibility
        </li>
        <li>
           Clarity
        </li>
        <li>
           Simplicity and orthogonality
        </li>
        <li>
           Semantic stability
        </li>
        <li>
           Semantic relevance
        </li>
        <li>
           Validation mechanisms
        </li>
        <li>
           Abstraction mechanisms
        </li>
        <li>
           Formal foundation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A design is a model without any implementation-specific or technology-specific details. A model is a design with those details.
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers are prone to seeing a spectrum of detail between designs and models, but this is false. There is a very sharp distinction between the two determined by the fact that users of a system only ever see its design whereas implementors are most interested in the model details. The <a href="ExplicitUserModel.html">ExplicitUserModel</a> of a system is its design.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em>'Hmm.<em>' An </em>architecture<em> is a description (with visuals, perhaps) of a system containing modeling information, but lacking implementation or (sometimes) technology-specific details. A </em>design<em> is one solution to an architecture that fits technology to the system. The </em>code<em> is one particular implementation of the design that expresses a particular technology with specific details. This is the normal descent of granularity in designing. Eh?</em>
