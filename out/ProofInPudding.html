        Just a story from the trenches, but it
        probably demonstrates the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        I had to design a real-time
        financial market data-feed
        upgrade, but we were running
        into serious platform constraints.
        So I picked up a Berkeley Unix 4.2
        manual, found out about sockets,
        and quietly (also see <a href="SneakInNewTechnologies.html">SneakInNewTechnologies</a> and RunSilentRunDeep)
        implemented the system in full client/server
        style. My boss had told me to
        'not bother' when I had suggested
        it, but using rsh across machines
        and stdin and stdout was <em>not</em>
        going to cut it.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I had it done, I inquired when
        we could cut over to the new system.
        The reaction was: 'What new system?'
      </p>
      <p>
        'Oh, the one I just finished and tested.'
        Shortly afterward, the new system became
        not only the backbone of the real-time
        quote system, but served to template a
        number of other very successful client/server
        applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sneaky at the time, but my
        boss could not argue with a system that
        worked, especially when it solved problems
        he was just putting off.
