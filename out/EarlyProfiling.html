        Early Profiling
      </h1>
      <p>
        Despite <a href="LazyOptimization.html">LazyOptimization</a> being a very good strategy, I like to do <a href="EarlyProfiling.html">EarlyProfiling</a>. -- <a href="DierkKoenig.html">DierkKoenig</a>

        Profiling your code early when it is still small and simple gives you the feedback on whether the code does what you think it does. I usually start the profiler on my AllTests.
      </p>
      <p>
        To get around the most common misconception first: <a href="EarlyProfiling.html">EarlyProfiling</a> does not mean that you do any perfomance optimization to the code. (You may though, if the profiling shows that you really have to do it, or if you find a way to do it via "usual" XP refactoring, thus catching two flies at once.)

      <ul>
        <li>
           gives you a kind of feedback that you do not get from a <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> (maybe missing Perfomance Tests)
        </li>
        <li>
           makes you comfortable with your ProfilingTools while your code is still easy to profile
        </li>
        <li>
           gets you "in shape" for the hard work of profiling for the bigger system later, when you may need to do <a href="LazyOptimization.html">LazyOptimization</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           gives you the confidence that your refactorings really had no performance hit
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        When should I profile?
      </p>
      <p>
        I would suggest early and regularly, e.g. every Friday afternoon.

        My preferred Profiler is <a href="AlphaworksJinsight.html">AlphaworksJinsight</a>.

        Mine isn't. ;)  But there's a list of <a href="JavaProfilers.html">JavaProfilers</a>.

      <p>
        In a desktop application, <a href="EarlyProfiling.html">EarlyProfiling</a> can help you make good low-level design decisions (like, does this behavior need to be run in a background thread) by keeping your familiar with the performance characteristics of your code - especially in the presence of 3rd party API's you may know very little about.
