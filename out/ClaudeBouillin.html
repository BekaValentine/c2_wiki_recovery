        I have been a programmer at <a href="NokiaNetworks.html">NokiaNetworks</a> (later Nokia Siemens Networks) in Helsinki, Finland for about 20 years. I learned real programming in the 80s, on Sinclair/Basic, UCD Pascal, PL/M, C, then C++, Java, sh and lately rediscovering the amazingly matured Perl.

        I have had <a href="MarcGirod.html">MarcGirod</a> and <a href="DavidPrice.html">DavidPrice</a> as work mates. Think of that...

        I am a technical person by affinity, and a SW designer by education and inclination. And an active musician (<a href="http://www.geocities.com/boolabus/).">http://www.geocities.com/boolabus/).</a> Irish traditional: banjo, mandolin, mandola, shaker. Lot of fun!
