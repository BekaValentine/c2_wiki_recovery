        The <a href="FrankensteinPoint.html">FrankensteinPoint</a> is the threshold past which a person regards a medical procedure as "unnatural". Heart transplants were, just a generation ago, regarded as past the <a href="FrankensteinPoint.html">FrankensteinPoint</a>. These days, it's human cloning. A touchy one for many people is cryonics.

        A book on robotics I once read had a graph depicting peoples' squeamishness factor as a function of 'realism' of a robot's appearance - there was an interesting peak as the robot appearance approached human, but not real close - people were much less bothered by a metallic robot then by one with skin-tone plastic skin.

        FrankenCode is the result of indiscriminate and wanton use of <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a> and lack of application of <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>.  See also <a href="DesignDebt.html">DesignDebt</a> for a more PhbFriendly term.

        I once helped to maintain a system that was developed in <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>, <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a> and <a href="AlgolLanguage.html">AlgolLanguage</a>. A typical <a href="FrankenStein.html">FrankenStein</a>.
