        Long Term Greedy Algorithm
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes being self-serving is not
        a short-term goal. Certain skills have
        a broader focus, like <em>learning</em>.
        A long term (but yet relatively 'greedy')
        approach is to greedily take advantage
        of 'Meta-Benefits' like an <em>opportunity</em>
        to learn or try something new.
      </p>
      <p>
        So the immediate benefits are not
        apparent because the greediness is
        not about immediate, tangible results.
        It is about the <em>process</em> of
        creating future tangible benefit.

        One of my favorite quotes is from one of my favorite books: <a href="CatsCradle.html">CatsCradle</a> by <a href="KurtVonnegut.html">KurtVonnegut</a>.  In it, he describes a religion named Bokonon which has as one of its tenets:  "Short trips are dancing lessons from god."

        In other words, opportunity presents itself and you never know where it will lead.  Taking these diversions can be a <a href="LongTermGreedyAlgorithm.html">LongTermGreedyAlgorithm</a>. --
