        Windows Longhorn

        see <a href="WindowsVista.html">WindowsVista</a>. Please change the source pages that use the old name as and when required. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, Vista server will be called Longhorn. (source: "a friend of mine who works at Dell" doesn't sound very reliable as a source)

        <em>Wasn't this formerly called </em><a href="MicrosoftPalladium.html">MicrosoftPalladium</a>? Didn't they rename it because of the flak they were receiving about the integration of TCPA features, and the TCPA wanting to install FritzChips on everyone's motherboards?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, WindowsLonghorn will optionally include Palladium (<a href="http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp).">http://www.winsupersite.com/faq/longhorn.asp).</a>

        <em>A moving target, originally set for 2004</em>

           The 2004 date was made outside MS, in 2002 when plans for <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a> was unveiled. See <a href="http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/toolkit/hardware/server/0,39023873,39159143,00.htm">http://www.zdnet.com.au/insight/toolkit/hardware/server/0,39023873,39159143,00.htm</a>

        In early 2004 there are on and off speculation about <em>Shorthorn</em>, which is a bridging release between <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> and <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Planned mid 2004 release of <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> SP2 with new features has not put to rest the speculation on the resurrection of <em>Oasis</em> (Microsoft codename) release, as <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a> schedule is now being pushed to 2007.
