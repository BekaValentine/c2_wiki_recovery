        I work for a company that builds commercial web sites, and today we lost some business to a group that does XP, which prompted me to do some research on the subject.  I wound up here, going round and round the Wiki all the day long.

        Taking a guess here based on your name:  are you in Quebec ?

        -- Nope, but my ancestors go way back there.  People in Quebec always pronounce my name so much better than I do that it's embarrassing.

        AMT (that is, <a href="AnneMichelleTessier.html">AnneMichelleTessier</a> ) has indeed found this page (today - April 4, 2004) ... She just found this place for the first time, and frankly she's a little overwhelmed, plus what she usually does isn't this computational, because she's a UmassLinguist so - see you around, Dad.
