        Frank Zappa
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="FrankZappa.html">FrankZappa</a> was an influential performance artist who specialized in blistering general parodies of RockMusic style and culture. His musical talents stretched as far as composing (serious) symphonies, and his performance skills stretched as far as playing on a bicycle with drumsticks on an early <a href="TeeVee.html">TeeVee</a> show.

        He appeared on the <a href="TeeVee.html">TeeVee</a> show <em>The Monkees</em>, where he pretended to interview Mike Nesmith. His memorable hits included "Suzie Creamcheese", "Dancing Fool", "Cocaine Decisions", and "Valley Girl" (with his daughter Moon Unit on spoken word). I believe there was also a song about not eating yellow snow...

        Let us not forget that Zappa also launched the careers of an army of studio musicians and session players. Names like Adrian Belew (King Crimson, etc), Terry Bozzio (Missing Persons, etc), Alice Cooper, Eddy Jobson (UK, etc) [arguably, though he had also worked with Brian Ferry], and many others.
