        <a href="AnsiCee.html">AnsiCee</a> refers to two major dialects of the <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> (the third dialect, which should be considered deprecated for most applications, is KayAndArCee--the original form of the language described in the first edition of <a href="KernighanAndRitchie.html">KernighanAndRitchie</a>).

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="AnsiCee.html">AnsiCee</a> 89 (ANSI X3.159-1989; ISO/IEC 9899:1990 is essentially the same language).  Added such features as void, const, and function prototypes to the language.  Influenced quite a bit by the (early) design of <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, the AnsiCeePlusPlus standard is based on this version of <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>.  Largely a subset of <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> (the few valid C89 programs that aren't valid C++ programs can be made so with mechanical transformations--i.e. renaming variables so as not to clash with C++ keywords, adding prototypes and casts in support of C++'s stricter typechecking, etc.)  Described in the second edition of <a href="KernighanAndRitchie.html">KernighanAndRitchie</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="AnsiCee.html">AnsiCee</a> 99 (ISO/IEC 9899:1999).  Added vararg macros, variable-sized arrays, restricted pointers (which the user guarantees not to be aliased; allowing Fortran-style optimizations), intrinsic complex type, and a bunch of other goodies.  Currently has many incompatibilities with <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>.

        <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>:  ANSI is, of course, AmericanNationalStandardsInstitute--a better name for these dialects might be IsoCee.
