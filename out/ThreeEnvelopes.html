        Three Envelopes
      </h1>
      <p>
        The manager handed his successor three envelopes along with the advice:  "each time you get into a bind you cannot break, open one envelope."

        Some time later, the successor was indeed in a bind.  The project was riddled with problems and failing badly.  Opening the first envelope revealed the message: "Blame me."  The successor blamed the predecessor and the great council agreed.
