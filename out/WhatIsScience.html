        Is <a href="BubbleSort.html">BubbleSort</a> a property of the universe that a scientist can discover, or an invention that could have been patented if a mechanism was in place for patenting software early on? -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Computer progress would be [bleeped] if such patents were allowed in the 50's through 70's. Battles over airplane patents almost ruined that industry. The military had for force a compromise.

        <strong>Is Programming Science?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not sure I would call programming a "science". <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the definition given in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.journaloftheoretics.com/Editorials/Vol-1/e1-3.htm">http://www.journaloftheoretics.com/Editorials/Vol-1/e1-3.htm</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Science is theory.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'd never thought of it like that. I had thought that Science was explanation, and that the explanation was tentative, incomplete, and in development, yielding somewhat predictable results.
      </p>
      <p>
        That fits programming, or at least "some programming".

        <strong>What are the boundaries for Science?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Are scientists limited to discovering aspects of the universe? There's sort of a naive description of physics, which goes like this: there's a universe out there and our physicists, gloriously large-brained beings, are observing, describing, and predicting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem? We, being small-brained bipeds, can't quite comprehend something as big as the universe. So we make models of the observable phenomena and then ponder on them (in the word's of Frye, cited above, "You don't learn Nature. You learn Physics"). Eventually, we come to things like quarks and so on and it is no longer quite so obvious (if it ever was) that we are observing and describing properties of the universe (instead of properties of the way we interact with and model the universe).
      </p>
      <p>
        But the notion of 'Science' is much wider than the above would indicate. We also call things like Psychology and Biology sciences. Both of which have the core scientific pattern of "observe, deduce, experiment to verify". But neither of which smell very much like Physics at all. They're interesting because they both deal with abstraction a lot more.
      </p>
      <p>
        Biology, in particular, has many levels of properties. There's biochemistry, at the molecular level, there's cell biology which, by and large, builds on the biochem [and ignores a lot of the biochem details] to talk about structural organization and function of the cell, there's ecology, which completely ignores cell biology to talk about much higher level things, .... All these things are observable, true, but there's a very explicit modeling step and a very explicit ignoring of relevant information and, in many cases, a notable lack of experimentation. Experiments are partially replaced with "study and statistically analyze" and causal mechanisms are replaced with correlations.
      </p>
      <p>
        And once we've seen this layering explicitly, in biology, it becomes clearer that it's present in physics too. And, maybe, necessarily present. You can't talk about Geophysics if you're going to worry about turbulence and its effect on the stability of stream beds (is there an effect? Probably not). So not only does physics abstract and construct models, it makes many models, all of which are useful in some area and most of which are slightly inconsistent.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then it gets even worse as we consider things like Paleontology. There's darn few experiments in Paleontology. Or maybe it's that all the experiments are "thought experiments" (imagine this creature running...). Sure, there are digs going on all the time. And there are lots of brilliant people engaged in reconstructing our saurian heritage. But it's a science that fundamentally relies on serendipity ("A new type of ankle-bone! And one suited to swimming. Wow! What a great <em>scientific</em> discovery.").
      </p>
      <p>
        Why am I babbling about this? Because I think "the universe" in <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>' formulation is completely wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Try this for a better notion of Traditional Science: The study of observable repeated phenomena, geared towards prediction and employing a reasoning cycle consisting of an observation stage, a deductions and hypothesizing stage, and a verification stage.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's still a horribly naive definition. But it opens the doors to all sorts of things that I consider scientific (or that I think could be done scientifically), while preserving the traditional approach (which is, I would claim, the really important thing).
      </p>
      <p>
        Why have I made such a big deal about this? I work in Artificial Intelligence and I would claim to be a scientist. So would Paul Cohen, who wrote an absolutely wonderful book called <em></em><a href="EmpiricalMethodsForArtificialIntelligence.html">EmpiricalMethodsForArtificialIntelligence</a><em> (ISBN 0262032252), which, while it has a slightly different notion of science from the above, nonetheless talks a lot about how we can be more scientific in our work.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And I would claim that each science,as it has emerged, has used a different method of investigation (related, to be sure). And that claims that CS is not a science because the way it proceeds doesn't correspond to a traditional view of the way physics proceeds, is just plain wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having said all that ....
      </p>
      <p>
        Now on to Sorting Algorithms. That's a very neat question. The question is, basically, account for a new sorting algorithm. Is the beastie a scientific discovery? Or simply engineering? I'm ignoring the patent issue because, by and large, patents are <strong>evil</strong>. (See <a href="PatentsAreEvil.html">PatentsAreEvil</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        (caveat: The boundary between science and engineering is incredibly fuzzy and positing a binary choice between them is also a false dichotomy. But, perhaps, a useful one).
        The answer: It depends. Either one. For example, tweaking an algorithm. There's a (very obvious) rule of thumb that says <em>When merge-sorting a file, minimize disk i/o because disks are going to be the performance bottleneck.</em> Use that rule and you may wind up inventing a new variant of merge-sort. but we'll all recognize it for merge sort and, unless you did something very clever, nobody will even notice it.
      </p>
      <p>
        A slightly harder example: Merge-sort a singly-linked list in place. There's an example of how to do this in Sedgewick's book on algorithms that does the trick but involves (roughly) twice as much list traversal as the merge-sort used by LISP hackers. The LISP hacker algorithm is a simple tweak on the Sedgewick approach, but it's a clever tweak and clever enough that, many times, when it is used the inventors are credited. But still, this is engineering. Though engineering that required detailed observation and some hard thought (closer to science).
      </p>
      <p>
        Hard example: Getting to merge-sort from bubble-sort. Does the above notion of "Science" cover it then? Maybe not. One reading of my version of the traditional notion of Science requires us to have an observable bubble-sort before we can talk about bubble-sorts (once we have a bubble-sort, we can analyze variants of it, but we do want it to be observable). But, like I said above, each new science invents its own variant of the scientific method.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is simply science of the CS sort.

        Last night, I posted something here and then trashed it in favor of the <a href="BubbleSort.html">BubbleSort</a> question. I figured that it cut to the crux. Anyway, naive or not, my notion of science does seem to match yours to a degree. If you are attempting to discover something to increase knowledge, it is science. If you are trying to make something for people, it is engineering. Software makes things interesting because the material is information. That said, I tend to think that there are aspects of science in engineering. Requirements analysis is a micro-science in IMHO (see <a href="GuerrillaDomainAnalysis.html">GuerrillaDomainAnalysis</a>). -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        I would first change the description of the scientific pattern form "observe, deduce, experiment to verify" to "observe, invent, experiment to verify". The "deduce" angle on describing science got tossed out decades ago (before Kuhn, even). Then there is an aspect of science involving computers. I would put automata theory in math, and compiler writing in engineering, and methods of development and <a href="HumanComputerInteraction.html">HumanComputerInteraction</a> in sociology or psychology. Then when designing an undergraduate curriculum, we can select what aspects of math, engineering and sociology are appropriate for what future lives of undergraduates. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

      <p>
        Good point. Changing that one word makes everything much simpler.
        I'd also like to add <a href="HerbertSimon.html">HerbertSimon</a>'s <em></em>SciencesOfTheArtificial<em></em>
        [ISBN 0262691914] as relevant to <a href="TwoIrreparableMistakesOfTheSoftwareField.html">TwoIrreparableMistakesOfTheSoftwareField</a>'s claim 1 (and a great book by a Nobel Laureate in Economics).

        I think "Invent" is really the wrong word to use in the "Observe, <word>, experiment to verify" phrase when talking about science. I'd like to suggest that a better phrase to describe science is: "observe, hypothesize, experiment to verify". Further, Alistair's "observe, invent, experiment to verify" is probably closer to a description of engineering, rather than science. The important distinction here is that the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> is about creating (aka "discovering") higher-level abstractions (i.e "Laws") about the world. I'm not sure "invent" is a good substitute for "discover" (<em>although I find that Merriam-Webster disagrees: </em><a href="http://m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=invent'').">http://m-w.com/cgi-bin/dictionary?book=Dictionary&va=invent'').</a> I guess if we agree to use the "to devise by thinking" definition of "invent", I would have to concede that "inventing" a hypothesis makes sense. However, I'm think that the common use of "invent" connotes a more physical operation (ex. "Thomas Edison <em>invented</em> the light bulb" more so than "Einstein <em>invented</em> the special theory of relativity").

      </p>
      <p>
        How about "Observe, synthesize, experiment to verify" - except that this kind of rolls "hypothesize" into "synthesize" - I think it's seductive, though not necessarily correct, to encapsulate this into a neat three-word quip. A longer form might be "observe, describe, hypothesize, synthesize, experiment to verify" though I'm sure the tendency will be to roll "describe" into "observe" and one of hypothesize & synthesize into the other. Clearly, you start with observe and you wind up with experiment, and what you do in between determines the quality of your science. -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        I'd put it something like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Mathematics deals with the provably correct and with properties that can be known with certainty and deduced by logical analysis alone without experimentation on the observable universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          Science is the process by which models of the universe are constructed and refined to predict more and more closely the observable properties of that universe.
        </li>
        <li>
          Engineering is the new construction of anything functionally useful.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So, I'd call the invention of the <a href="BubbleSort.html">BubbleSort</a> engineering, but the characterization of the properties of the <a href="BubbleSort.html">BubbleSort</a> mathematics. I wouldn't call it science though. Even the best scientific theory can be overturned by new evidence later, but this is not true for the properties of the <a href="BubbleSort.html">BubbleSort</a>. I'm not entirely sure what the utility of defining "mathematics", "science" and "engineering" is though. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Things like the algorithmic properties of <a href="BubbleSort.html">BubbleSort</a> are essentially mathematics, as is most "hard" CS. Mathematics is <em>not</em> science. It is a tool used by scientists, but mathematicians are not scientists. Who says so? Every scientist and every mathematician I've ever met. -- <a href="AlainPicard.html">AlainPicard</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps Mr Picard should get out more and meet some more scientists and mathematicians.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmm. There is a strong correlation and much cross-over. Science, at its heart, is trying to understand things. The way it does this is, in principle, as follows. You gather data, collate it, and try to find patterns. Having found patterns you use them to make predictions. Predictions in hand, you then perform experiments to test them, confirming or refuting your hypothesized pattern. Then, if necessary, revise your ideas about what the patterns are and repeat.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a science when you make predictions <strong>and test them.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In mathematics we do exactly the same thing, except that having tested our predictions a few times we then set out to prove that the pattern is what it seems to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's true that mathematics is not science, and most scientists and mathematicians will agree. It's false to characterize mathematics simply as a tool that scientists use. That's the view of a scientist, not a mathematician.
      </p>

      <p>
        The literal definition of "Science" (from Latin, I think) is simply "Knowledge". So I regard "science" and "scientific" as any process that provides the ability to increase knowledge in <em>any</em> area (though note I said "increase knowledge", not "increase your knowledge"); merely being able to learn what others have previously learned is not science, but education. Science is being able to take your own learned concepts, couple them with external observations, and produce new knowledge. -- <a href="GavinLambert.html">GavinLambert</a>

        I am concerned with discussing two extreme kinds of science. I believe environmental geochemistry, a combination of environmental science with geochemistry, fits both requirements, since it seems to be at a turning point.

      </ul>
      <p>
        doesn't quite cut it for science these days because all the stuff you can easily observe has already been observed. Try extending the process to something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Guess, invent, observe, <word>, experiment to verify
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Example: We <em>guess</em> there will be interesting astronomical observations we can't make from the ground. We <em>invent</em> the space telescope. We <em>observe</em> that: hey yeah, look at all that cool stuff we didn't see before! We <em><word></em> about all that cool stuff. We <em>experiment to verify</em> that we were right (or wrong) about what we <word>ed.
      </p>
      <p>
        With time and training the initial guesses become (hopefully) more educated and more likely to be correct, but it still frequently happens that the process is derailed, either because <em>invent</em> isn't yet technologically possible (<a href="YouCantGetThereFromHere.html">YouCantGetThereFromHere</a>), or because after a successful <em>invent</em> we fail to <em>observe</em> anything useful (the guess that the newly possible observations would be interesting was wrong). This is also called a "FishingExpedition" and granting agencies in general <strong>hate</strong> this kind of proposal. That's why you have to write the grant according to the standard "observe, hypothesize (the word the granting agencies use), experiment to verify" model and then do the guessing and inventing on the sly.

        <strong>Science is Testing Models of Reality</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Science is the process of gathering, comparing, and evaluating proposed models against reality:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           1. Observe, collect information
        </li>
        <li>
           2. Propose a model(s) of the real world subject, usually with math or algorithms.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Could be also done with "conceptual" models, although these offer less rigor.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           3. Test that model against the real world
        </li>
        <li>
           4. If it doesn't match, study the non-matches (back to step 1)
        </li>
        <li>
           5. If there are multiple fitting competing theories, then the simplest is preferred as the "reigning" theory. New tests should be developed to help separate them (back to step 1). The ranking of candidate models/theories can be approximately computed by:
        </li>

        theoryRank = fit x simplicity<br/>

        Math is "playing with" axioms and science is the testing of axioms against reality.

Even agreeing on an appropriate definition of "better" or "best" is likely to prove highly contentious, and the objects under study are all moving targets.  Which version of Java?  Which version of C#?  That makes research difficult, and the results of that research currently appear to be of little interest to the industry.  As long as there are other questions that are easier to answer, with results that are considered more important (e.g., does network routing algorithm X exhibit higher performance than Y?, etc.), they will get funded and "is tool X better than tool Y?" questions will largely be ignored.}

        On the other hand, math and science have testing/falsification in common, it's just that in pure math (in its rigorous formal form), the test is in regards to logic and consistency first and foremost, whereas in science, the test is in regards to physical reality, first and foremost, and math (including logic) are used towards that end.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It could be said that math tests for internal consistency and science for external consistency. - t</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And both are somewhat similar to engineering, including programming, in which the testing/falsification is in regards to "what works" for some set of goals.
      </p>
      <p>
        The less math that backs up a field of study, the less rigorous it is, ...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not necessarily. Perhaps the field simply has a lot of axioms and the evidence is based on testing these axioms against reality rather than what the axioms imply.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No, I meant what I said. Empirical evidence is important, but is not the same thing as rigor. In music (and other arts, for that matter), everything began as a matter of taste and opinion, and over time, theory began to be developed (see the scales used by the ancient greeks, and their mathematical theory thereof, for example) that explained the original empirical evidence to some extent.
        </li>

           <em>But I don't know of a single hit that was "culculated" in the lab to optimize human enjoyment. The researchers sometimes get carried away with concepts. When it was discovered that most musical harmonies are based on simple ratios (1/2, 3/4, etc.) a researcher might try to make a song that uses all of the fractional combinations up to 6, and then is disappointed when it is not a hit. The reasoning that "if humans like simple ratio harmonies, then a song with all common simple ratios should maximize human enjoyment" is a perfectly logical hypothesis to make from that original observation, but turns out wrong. -- top</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Over time, we learned more about the mathematics of music, the physiology of hearing, etc., and we now know quite a lot more that is rigorous on the subject - and if one hasn't studied the history of music, one might think this wasn't important, but actually that development of rigor had a <strong>huge</strong> impact.
          <ul>
            <li>
               This may need an extra note: human physiology came first, and enabled <strong>perception</strong> of e.g. harmony and rhythm. Skill/cultural development to <strong>produce</strong> harmony and rhythm came next, with prehistoric origins. Early civilizations, such as the ancient greeks (and to some extent predecessors) began to develop <strong>theory</strong> to explain this perception and production, in terms of geometric rational number relationships.
            </li>
            <li>
               Much later, musical theory incorporated irrational number relationships, and the irrational number "the 12th root of 2" became exceedingly important, and state of the art musicians increasingly incorporated the results of such theory into their compositions.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>I'm not convinced the "12 note (geometric)" system is somehow magic or unique. It involves known harmonic compromises and may be in part related to the fact that most humans have difficulty identifying tone differences smaller than the 12-scale's increment, and other cultures have adopted other slicings. (Dogs have an even wider imprecision, and that may explain why they usually ignore human music.)</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   [Since no ones here is claiming that it's magic or unique, what's your point?]
                </li>
                <li>
                   "Exceedingly important...[pushing] state of the art...". It's a "catchy" standard that worked well in practice (for post-baroque music), not too unlike C.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Later yet, we begin to understand that empirical results showing the cross-cultural importance of the perception in harmony of things like the major third and major fifth lead to mathematical consequences showing that preservation of good approximations of such things is probably what lead to the (various and different!) tonal scales used by multiple cultures world-wide, and that there is a cross-cultural universal that most such scales turn out to be well-represented by convergents of continued-fraction approximations of relationships based on the major third and fifth.
            </li>
            <li>
               The fact that the vast majority of musicians today are unaware of any of this illustrates my point: rigorous theory is developed to explain non-rigorous empirical observation. Once rigor is introduced into a subject, then that part of the subject becomes potentially falsifiable, and therefore no longer purely a matter of opinion.
            </li>
            <li>
               Again, I am not claiming that music has been reduced to math, only that certain aspects of it have been so reduced, whether artists are aware of that or not. -- Doug

           Obviously music is still, to this day, an art, not a science, but it has become much more informed by math and science - for those who care to learn what is now known. Others don't care. Personal preferences don't change the fact that it is more rigorous than before, but still not completely rigorous, either, by any means, and that the degree of rigor vs empirical results and taste has varied over the millennia. -- Doug
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I would point out that most music, as measured by sales, comes from non-theorists or at least partial theorists. Attempts to build a "composing machine", a reasonable empirical test of such theories (</em><a href="RaceTheDamnedCar.html">RaceTheDamnedCar</a>), have been lackluster so far. (However, they have found success in recreating target artists' styles, but not comparable to their better works.) -- top<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Also, it may be a moving target. The Greeks' theory of harmony was used until about the end of the Baroque period, when it appeared people grew tired of predictable rhythm and geometric harmonies. It became "in" to "violate" those rules, but still sound appealing to most for at least short-term listening. The simple ratios are the "safe choice" but won't please critics. Intentional dissonance and rhythm jumps are also used to project the unpredictability, capriciousness, and intensity of human emotion, such as those found in movie soundtracks. Music in general became more organic over time, but still tends to swing back and forth in style cycles between traditional versus "oddball" chords and rhythms. -- top</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ...and the more of an art it becomes, and the more that one tends to have unfalsifiable heuristic methods (and indeed, methods based simply in taste and opinion) rather than provable algorithms.

      <p>
        The field of software is backed by theoretical CS, but not all programmers approach it from that angle nor are trained in that background, so we have some programmers who think software is a mathematical field and others who disagree and think it's an art. It's both, it's neither, it depends on what the individual person does.
      </p>
      <p>
        People who spend their careers doing business apps usually seem relatively more likely to have the most outright disdain for theoretical CS and math, compared with programmers in other areas, as far as I can tell, and don't seem to notice that other areas of programming outright require theory and math background. Some areas do, some areas don't - it's the blind men and the elephant. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Example? Most of our education seems geared toward the physical world. However, most of business is about human-made rules and preferences. There does not seem to be a lot of "science" in this.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think you may have misunderstood me. I'm not saying that theoretical math and CS is necessarily applicable to the writing of business apps (it may be in some cases, but that would seem to be rare for the common real-world cases). I'm saying that, precisely because the need for such theory is far more rare in areas of software such as business apps, people who do mostly the latter tend to under-appreciate that such theory is nonetheless very important in other areas of software, possibly even in <strong>most</strong> other areas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus I observe arguments here (and elsewhere) between people who do one kind of software, and people who do another kind, and thus I claim "blind men and the elephant" parable applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        BTW I believe that many business "human-made rules and preferences" actually should be informed by theory more often than they actually are in small and medium-size companies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Theory does not always pan out in the real world. Many ideas are tried, but only a few seem to be usable in the end. Small businesses don't have the resources to experiment via trial-and-error.</em>

        The international conglomerates do so, although they don't talk about it all that often. Competitive advantage.

        Note for instance WalMart staying on top of (from what I hear) relatively state of the art data mining, which to do well, involves plenty of hairy theory; one cannot do state of the art data mining by sheer artisanship and native intelligence, it requires heavy duty mathematical machinery as well (non-state of the art can of course get by without the math, and still get sometimes-valuable results; I'm not trying to draw a line in the sand here).

        <em>Most companies will let the marketplace test ideas before handing over big bucks.

Thus, they'll let others try them, keep their ear to the ground, and then copy successful projects from other companies.<em></em>

        I believe that similar observations apply to some (but certainly not all) business rules applied in database schema and query design. -- Doug

        The fact that bubble sort works is a mathematical characteristic of the universe; the specifics of building a machine to perform it is an invention and covered by patents (which are evil). If your machine is a universal computation machine (patentable in its own right) then the program to transform it into a bubble-sort machine is protected by copyright and does not need a patent, nor should it be as that leads to effectively patenting the discovery.
