        I'm building a data store. I want it to have these properties:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No <a href="SinglePointOfFailure.html">SinglePointOfFailure</a>. If any single hard drive or other thing fails, users never even notice -- can still read and write files as always.
        </li>
        <li>
           "hot repair" -- a technician can fix any single failure without taking the system offline.
        </li>
        <li>
           "hot testing" -- I can confirm all the data is properly backed up, without risking overwriting the current "live" data with old "backup" data, and users can still read and write files as always during the test.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Surely I'm not the only person in the world that wants something like this.
        A few of the people I mention this to claim "All businesses big enough to have an IT department already have something like this".
        But when I ask "If such a system already really exists, where can I buy one (<a href="BuyDontBuild.html">BuyDontBuild</a>)?", no one seems to know.
      </p>
      <p>
        If such a system doesn't yet exist, perhaps I'll not only build one for me, but start selling it to other people ...

        One thing you scientists can help solve one of my queries. Years ago I saw lots of "solar powered" calculators, and decades ago we have watches that were "human motion powered". Do we not have enough energy to harness through these and other sources to keep a <a href="SmartPhone.html">SmartPhone</a> running? Or is it the economics (energy still too cheap) that have prevented resurgence of such "alternate energy" solutions?

        My name is Marcus and I noticed that you were looking for a Hackerspace in Tulsa. I started an electronics club last year, but now we need a place to meet. So the time is nigh, that we pool together some resources and start a hackerspace!

        The only internet safe way to give you my contact information (that I can think of at the moment) is facebook. You can find me there under my full name Marcus Gaskamp.
