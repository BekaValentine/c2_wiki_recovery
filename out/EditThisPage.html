        <<a href="http://www.EditThisPage.com">http://www.EditThisPage.com</a>> one of the domain names acquired by <a href="UserLand.html">UserLand</a> for their free web hosting services that showcases ( and stress tests ) the ManilaInterface web sites from their Scriptable <a href="ObjectDatabase.html">ObjectDatabase</a> product <a href="UserlandFrontier.html">UserlandFrontier</a>.

        Each web created supports the Authentication concepts of Public, Member, Contributing Editors and Managing Editors ( creator ) with preferences set by the Managing Editors on the Authorities for the site. Any page you are allowed to edit sprouts an <a href="EditThisPage.html">EditThisPage</a> button [ hence the domain name ] and allows the body text of the web document message to be edited in the clients web browser or in their local copy of Frontier or Radio.
