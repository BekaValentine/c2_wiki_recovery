        Real Programming Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>NOT a language for a </em><a href="RealProgrammer.html">RealProgrammer</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A programming language that meets some minimum standard of practical usability for writing 'real-world' software. Examples: <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>, <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, <a href="RpgLanguage.html">RpgLanguage</a>, <a href="CobolLanguage.html">CobolLanguage</a>, <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Languages that aren't considered 'real' typically fall into one of these categories:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="EsotericProgrammingLanguage.html">EsotericProgrammingLanguage</a>s -- <a href="InterCal.html">InterCal</a>, <a href="BrainfuckLanguage.html">BrainfuckLanguage</a>, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Non-<a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> languages -- there are some things these languages just can't do.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TuringTarpit.html">TuringTarpit</a>s -- A Turing complete language, so it can do everything. It's just very hard to get it to do anything useful.
        </li>
        <li>
           TeachingLanguages that are only really useful for teaching, e.g. <a href="QuickBasic.html">QuickBasic</a>, <a href="LogoLanguage.html">LogoLanguage</a>, <a href="MmixMachine.html">MmixMachine</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           'Academic' languages intended only to explore a concept, prove a theorem, form part of a thesis, etc, like some of the early pure <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a>s. However, there are examples of such languages that eventually became 'real' -- e.g. <a href="MlLanguage.html">MlLanguage</a> -> <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Once-popular but now 'dead' languages. A language might be dead if the only people who use it are grizzled old hackers and shell-shocked-looking maintenance programmers. Sometimes these grizzled hackers realize that their "dead" language is technically superior to popular new languages -- see <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=smug">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=smug</a> .
        </li>
        <li>
           Special-purpose languages, e.g. word processor scripting languages or shell-scripting languages, that aren't realistically usable for writing significant software. <em>Though that hasn't stopped many from doing so!</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Very <a href="LowLevelLanguage.html">LowLevelLanguage</a>s -- (plain) Assembler, Machine code, (any other examples?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Another common meaning of the term "real programming language" is "the language I use", with the implied put-down that "only an idiot would fail to see its inherent superiority to that lame language that you use".

      </p>
      <p>
        More mature programmers realize no one <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> currently in existence is the best for every one of <a href="TheManyTypesOfPrograms.html">TheManyTypesOfPrograms</a>.
        But that doesn't stop the more idealistic of them from hoping that such a language might someday arrive.
        Some programmers even develop new, improved languages on their <a href="QuestForThePerfectLanguage.html">QuestForThePerfectLanguage</a>.
        If that language ever does arive, one hopes that it will become the <a href="FirstTimeLanguage.html">FirstTimeLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Smart programmers go on to develop a language that isn't perfect,  since <a href="EverythingSucks.html">EverythingSucks</a>. Trying to develop something perfect leads to an infinitely incomplete project that never gets completed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Mature programmers realize "the" best language to develop a particular application
        is often some combinations of languages:
        <a href="AlternateHardAndSoftLayers.html">AlternateHardAndSoftLayers</a>, <a href="SymbioticLanguages.html">SymbioticLanguages</a>.
