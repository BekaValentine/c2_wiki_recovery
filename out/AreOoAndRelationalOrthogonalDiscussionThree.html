        Most of the claims on this page would melt away under the scrutinty of more realistic examples (at least for some domains). --top

        I agree that OO does not effectively handle many-to-many relationships, multiple dispatch, fine-grained specialization, 'open' specialization, or complex queries. OTOH, neither does procedural, which was OO's main competitor at the time these claims were made. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please clarify. OO's competitor is both procedural and relational. They compete with different aspects of OO. I agree that if by gun-point I was not allowed to use relational or databases, I'd probably prefer some OOP over just procedural. Limiting the discussion from powerful combo's would not be very useful, unless we want to pretend we're in the disco era. Procedural and relational compliment each other well without having similar territory to fight over. OOP half invents a database, but leaves out too much. --top</em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           Hmmm... I can see how my statements would be confusing. There are OO databases (OODBMS), which compete with relational, and then there is <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> (OOP), which does not compete with relational. The two don't coincide or compete except when programmers start <a href="ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication.html">ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication</a> (which does happen, but is not a practice I recommend). In general, these applications of 'OO' should be evaluated separately. My statements above were made in reference to OOP, not OODBMS.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Again, I disagree about OO not competing with relational. The </em><a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> is a prime example of something that relational would do differently. When you make a choice to use visitor, you are un-choosing a relational solution. As far as OODBMS, some say there is no such thing because OODBMS do not have any real encapsulation. They only share OO's navigational structuring (that is, a mass wad of pointers with a dab of tree-ness), which almost nobody would promote if OO didn't do it. --top<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           How does use of <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> "un-choose" a relational solution? Explain this to me in logical terms. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>A given solution cannot be both at the same time (at least not without making a mess). Therefore, it must either be an OO solution or a relational solution.</em>

            <li>
               Agreed. I feel <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> is assuming the consequent here.

               <em>I don't understand why this isn't more obvious. There's some kind of translation/communication block going on.

            </li>
            <li>
               In <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a>, your 'relational weenie' example implements OOP techniques and stores (or references) the scripts/functions for each 'printer object' within the RDBMS. Refer back to page anchor OOP_tehniques_impl. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>You mean code or references to code in data structures? OO has no monopoly on that. Lisp was doing it about 7 years before the first OOP language. I'm not sure what paradigm we should give that credit to. Perhaps none owns it. It was easy to do in machine language. Later languages made the technique more difficult, subtracting that ability, perhaps fearing it made programs less predictable. See </em><a href="HistoryOfCodeInStructures.html">HistoryOfCodeInStructures</a>.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               (page anchor not-just-code-in-structures) I mean dispatch based on associating 'objects' (printers) with 'code' (scripts) to process certain 'commands' (printing shapes) into which you'll need to feed both other data about that object (so that the script can print the shape to the right printer) and other data about that command (so that the script can print the shape with the correct size and position). And hand-implementation is the early stage in the life cycle for nearly all programming language methodologies and techniques - that doesn't make them any less OOP <strong>techniques</strong>, it only makes them less OOP <strong>languages</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Records = objects is too much word-play in my opinion.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Funny. I never suggested 'records = objects'. It is <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a>, and the ability to associate attributes with such an identity, that makes an object.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>But anyhow, both approaches "put code in data structures" (or code references). In that aspect, they both use a similar technique, and I don't give OO credit for inventing that technique as described in </em><a href="HistoryOfCodeInStructures.html">HistoryOfCodeInStructures</a>. Merely using a common technique does not break my overlap claim any more than both using <a href="QuickSort.html">QuickSort</a> makes them non-overlapping. In one, the structure is objects tied together via references, in the other the structe is a RDBMS table.<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               History is irrelevant. Credit for the technique is irrelevant. That one has "put code in data structures" is, guess what? That's irrelevant too. OOP is not about 'code in data structures' (and many implementations do not put the dispatch code into the data structures). OOP is about dispatching messages and commands to things associated with object identity. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Regardless, your <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a> is a poor example if your goal is to demonstrate relational and OO not working together, even though I don't believe it a good example of them working together. Relational and OO are readily integrated by using OO to, according to database provided configurations, construct programs on the fly for processing 'inputs'... which may also come from the database. As noted elsewhere, the only thing RDBMS is missing to make this complementary union nearly perfect is the ability to 'subscribe' to queries with <a href="DeltaIsolation.html">DeltaIsolation</a> (e.g. via dynamic insert/update/delete events on the 'view' so subscribed).
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>The last 2 paragraphs are not clear. One is putting the code references in tables *or* they are putting them in objects/classes. It's a pretty strong dichotomy. They *are* fighting over territory. It's hard to be much clearer. You either put "the stuff" in tables, or you put "the stuff" in objects. --top</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Your assertions are clear, Top. They're just wrong. OOP can be implemented using tables, at which point putting code references into objects/classes and putting them into tables will happily coincide.  And <em>that</em> (hand-implementing OOP techniques using tables) is exactly what your <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a> does. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>They are not wrong. If so, please re-word as formal logic. code-in-structures is NOT unique to OOP as already described. That is a fact. It's like saying that inheritance provide defaults by having the default behavior in the parent class; therefore, anything with defaults is "OO".</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   As formal logic: (A) OOP may be implemented using tables by associating object identity with properties (attributes, behavior descriptions). (B) If OOP can be implemented using tables, one will necessarily be putting the code references in tables *and* putting them in objects/classes. (C) Following from A & B, one can put code references into objects/classes and tables at the same time. (D) Therefore, your assertion to the contrary (that this "is a pretty strong dichotomy", exclusive "either/or") is in error.

                   <em>You seem to be assuming that emulation is equivalence.

           Regarding your "code-in-structures" statement: I agree, 'code-in-structures' is not OO. But your <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a>, as I <em>have already explained</em> (at page anchor not-just-code-in-structures), is much more than 'code-in-structures'. Your <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a> also has the following traits: <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a> (foreign keys to printers), and dispatch to determine behavior based on recipient of request/command message (printer reference and shape identifier determines shape script... same as printer.drawCircle(), printer.drawRectangle()). <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a> and virtual message dispatch are among the strongest defining traits of OO, being about the only features common to all OO languages (many of which lack classes and referential inheritance). Your <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a> is a very clear implementation of OOP techniques, but using tables because you're a <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a> and wanted to find a way to include tables.

        <li>
           <em>This seems to get into </em><a href="DefinitionsForOo.html">DefinitionsForOo</a>. I disagree with your definition, but I will not take that up here. Further, "message passing" is rather open-ended. A function call is message passing. So is HTTP.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Indeed. But OO is not <em>just</em> message passing, either. It is message passing with certain properties: message passing to things with '<a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a>' such that how the message is processed is determined by the callee. Given that I just got past telling you that OO is 'not-just-code-in-structure', I'm starting to feel that you're repeatedly sticking your eye up right against the bark and saying that you can't see the tree. 
          <ul>

               <em>To settle this, we'd probably have to settle on a definition of OO, which is difficult (</em><a href="NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs.html">NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs</a>).<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Even though when it comes to small details, <a href="NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs.html">NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs</a>, there is a great deal of agreement. It's a bit like attempting to measure the length of a coastline when dealing with outcrops and tides when there are bets riding on the answer and the people making the bets are also deciding on how to measure the coastline. Despite all the minor politicking, everyone agrees that the coastline is at the edge of land and water and that it is at least longer than the shortest distance between two points on the coastline. Anyhow, the point of this analogy is: you're using '<a href="NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs.html">NobodyAgreesOnWhatOoIs</a>' in a manner to imply a level of disagreement that doesn't exist on that page. People agree on at least a few critical elements, and your <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a> has them.

               It only seems that way until you've worked with <a href="ProgrammingLanguageTheory.html">ProgrammingLanguageTheory</a> enough to know how much the different OOPLs have in common, and how little design space they cover, relative to the wide variety of other language designs.

                   I mostly comment in the domain of custom biz apps, not systems software. In theory one could use an RDBMS to implement another RDBMS, but for performance reasons its usually not an option. RDBMS are by plan not designed to implement systems software, whereas, C++ is. (Maybe it's possible, but it hasn't been done to my knowledge.)

                <li>
                   For one, CPU performance is usually less of an issue. The number of total users per line of code is generally much smaller such that there is less economic pressure to worry about performance and resources. If you sell a product to tens of thousands, then optimization makes a bigger difference. The bottleneck for custom apps tends to be the network, not CPU. Further, the different ways the software will be used is smaller with custom apps. If you make an interpreter, for example, you have no idea what kind of programs people are going to write for it, and thus cannot assume that say lists are used more than arrays or vise verse. But with custom apps you generally know the usage profiles, and thus can skip detailed optimization of many parts. If they have 500 customers today, its a safe bet that they are not going to suddenly have 20k. You wait until it looks like there will be mass growth before optimizing it for mass customers. --top

Your <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a> isn't evidence against OOP+Relational; it's simply your attempt to avoid OOP by using Procedural+Relational instead, and it was a failure even to avoid OOP in about the same sense as would be using C structures full of function pointers and void* data.

                   You'd be disappointed if you think putting code into an RDBMS makes it less static, easier to read, or easier to search. But I share your discomfort with OOP's limitations when it comes to predicate dispatch, <a href="CrossCuttingConcern.html">CrossCuttingConcern</a>s like concurrency and logging, etc. Of course, your <a href="DoubleDispatchExample.html">DoubleDispatchExample</a> would share those particular limitations.

                   Hmmm? OO does poorly when dealing with <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s, which might need a many-to-many classification system. OTOH, you won't have any <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s if you put external data into Relational and use OO only for computation objects (and occasional value-objects to represent commands/messages)... which, if you were paying attention, is what I already described.

               "Less OO" - I'll agree. Putting domain data into relational tables instead of <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s is "less OO". But, then, the question isn't whether we're moving away from "pure OO", but whether OOP is compatible with relational in the same sense that procedural is compatible with relational.

          <ul>
            <li>
               By analogy, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, you could say that Procedural competes with Relational in that same sense because one <strong>can</strong> "Put domain data into tables <strong>instead of</strong> procedures." Is this not blatantly clear? Unless you also assert that procedural fights over territory with relational, the reasoning for your complaint about OOP fighting over territory with relational will be logically inconsistent.

Lists and indexed arrays tend to have a high overlap, but not arrays and reg-ex's, for example.

               I've no disagreement that 'Table' with automated multi-indexing and support for joins and queries would be a useful standard-library object, but this is (to me) only further evidence that Relational and OOP are complementary and mutually beneficial, especially given the degree of effort OOPers go through when a table would be the best option. Hardly seems like fighting over territory to me. Pointing out how many places OOP would be readily enhanced by Relational seems, rather, the exact opposite of a fight over territory.

Further, for languages that don't allow multiple inheritance, sub-classing used for making a class relational reduces the ability to use it for other OO purposes since inheritance is a single slot.

Nor does it break encapsulation, any more than any other container does, i.e., not at all.  Inheritance doesn't create confusion, but may certainly be inappropriate in cases where it is...  Inappropriate.  However, OO is most appropriately used to create computational objects rather than domain objects (unless, of course, you're creating a simulation).  As such, inheritance hierarchies are typically invariant and conceptually clear.  Please do not confuse OO programming with general-purpose OO databases.  They are very, very different beasts.]

           Too big a title? From someone who just wrote "<a href="AreOoAndRelationalOrthogonalDiscussionThree.html">AreOoAndRelationalOrthogonalDiscussionThree</a>"? Heh. ;) I agree that one 'can' shove "computational space" objects into an RDBMS. But the 'global' nature of RDBMS tends to handle "computational space" objects (which encapsulate subprogram behavior) just as poorly as OOP handles <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s (which describe 'global' real-world data). The reason is a fundamental duality, described in <a href="ObjectVsModel.html">ObjectVsModel</a>. One generally cannot support even the class of <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s in RDBMS without considerable effort: one option is reinventing OOP and heavily using scripts (which pretty much renders useless the query and data manipulation benefits of RDBMS: scripts, like other large strings and binary data, are generally opaque to such efforts). Another option is exposing the full runtime engine in the RDBMS (which is doable, and offers better queries and manipulation than scripts, but now must reinvent an entire programming language). <a href="PickTheRightToolForTheJob.html">PickTheRightToolForTheJob</a>, and the tools we readily have available, demands we combine approaches if we wish to support both halves of the problem - both domain data and runtime <a href="ConfigurableModularity.html">ConfigurableModularity</a> of the application. Still, given growing support for things like LanguageIntegratedQuery and <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a>, I suspect that the <a href="FutureOfProgrammingLanguages.html">FutureOfProgrammingLanguages</a> will support relations and relational operations within 'application' languages (though I hope to achieve <a href="NoApplication.html">NoApplication</a> at some point in that future, too).  And, similarly, the relations within said language will support the full 'application' language type system and functions for queries, making complex values readily accessible to queries and manipulations.

               Regarding 'choice': Among the Python philosophies is "there should be one, and preferably only one, obvious way to do it." Unwise choices are okay, so long as they are not obvious or are obviously unwise. It's when the unwise choices look 'just as good' as the wise choices that programmers will choose paths that will run them into problems down the line.
