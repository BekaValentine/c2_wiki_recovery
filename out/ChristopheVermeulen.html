        Hello Wikiers.
      </p>
      <p>
        I came here through the JOS (JavaOS) site, that seems to work a bit like this 
        one. Then I got interested in Twiki from <a href="PeterThoeny.html">PeterThoeny</a>, and I kept refactoring
        my own <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> with many of his additions in Twiki. Main reason was that
        I modified my version for augmented automatic linking. For example RFCxxx 
        would link to faqs.org RFC archive, a bit like the ISBN links here.
        Also the edit page would allow to enter an Acronym and generate two pages
        at the same time, e.g ATM and AsynchronousTransferMode. Other improvements 
        include HandlingPlurals.
      </p>
      <p>
        I finally dropped this because of lack of time, change of department, etc.
        and migrated to Twiki for my new department. Only to be seen on our Intranet,
        so no link here. You would be bored anyway ;-)
      </p>
      <p>
        My primary interest now is IPTV, using actually all of the interests I typed
        here back in 1998 : Java, Security, XML and lots of others. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Cheers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Christophe.
