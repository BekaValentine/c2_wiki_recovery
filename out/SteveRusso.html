        Hello, I'm Steve, and I'm new to this Wiki thing. I am still a bit of a skeptic, but I am always one to give new things a try.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an IT Specialist, and enjoy programming as a hobby as well. In my employment, I am involved in writing workflow/financial reports in ASP, SQL Server, VB, Crystal Reports, PHP and Perl. I'm also responsible for everything else technologically-oriented within my company. I'm also an avid Linux user and enjoy programming in many other languages in my spare time, especially C/C++ and Java.

        Are you a programmer?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, why?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Make a page with your name, tell us more about you and welcome! You have to be a programmer or to be involved in programming somehow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do you mean that you have to be a programmer to post here?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, the subjects are related to programming. (Of course, no-one insists you are a programmer, but it does help a lot.)

        <em>This Wiki concept is quite bizarre. I happened to stumble upon it a few months ago while playing around with Mambo, and decided to take a closer look tonight while I was bored. This Wiki stuff is really fascinating for those of us with short attention spans. With all of the links to different subjects embedded into each page, I find myself skipping from subject to subject while I'm reading... Maybe this is just the initial "shock" of the whole Wiki thing, though.</em>

        <em>I first heard of Wiki through the documentation at </em><a href="http://www.mamboserver.com">http://www.mamboserver.com</a> a few months ago. Their documentation system <em>was</em> wiki-based (I don't know if it still is.) At the time, I really didn't understand the concept, and didn't spend much time trying to. Since then, I've accidentally wound up browsing to a few Wiki sites while searching for other things. Finally, I just decided to find out what it was all about, and I typed "Wiki" into Google and wound up here.<em></em>

        <em>I'm playing around with </em><a href="CaseyWest.html">CaseyWest</a>'s short Perl Wiki - <a href="SigWik.html">SigWik</a> (I love those obfuscated programs!) right now. I can't get it to save my text, though... I think it is just a permissions problem.<em></em>

        <em>Ahh.. just got it to work. Fascinating that such a tiny program could have so much functionality!!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, I'm off to bed. I've gotta stop myself or I'll never get any sleep tonight. Take care! Steve</em>
