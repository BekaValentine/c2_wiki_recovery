        Informal History Of Operating System Ideas
      </h1>
      <p>
        Well, we've got an <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>; what about the OS? Let's focus on new developments, paradigms, techniques, algorithms, etc. in OS design, and perhaps on major new versions of operating systems. Minutiae such as "Microsoft released Windows NT 4 Service Pack 5..." or "Linux kernel version 2.2.x which fixed bug yyy" do not belong on the list; though major revisions of Linux or Windows might...
      </p>
      <p>
        The list doesn't have to include just major production <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>s; research <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>s are encouraged. Published papers, even describing features not yet implemented, are okay too.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The IBM OS/360 [</em><a href="IbmSystemThreeSixty.html">IbmSystemThreeSixty</a>](1965) was allegedly a system that pioneered a lot of multi-user/multi-tasking concepts.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One key OS idea was "TimeSharing": one computer, multiple users, as opposed to the earlier "batch" model of just one user and just one application running from start to completion before another user/application could use the system; related to, but not identical to, <a href="MultiTasking.html">MultiTasking</a> - although terminology has varied over the years and with different systems, groups, geography, etc. "<a href="MultiTasking.html">MultiTasking</a>" and "TimeSharing" are not single ideas, but rather complex ideas, with complicated areas of overlap.
      </p>
      <p>
        One key figure in the history of that OS idea was <a href="JohnMcCarthy.html">JohnMcCarthy</a> (most famous as the inventor of Lisp). He wrote "REMINISCENCES ON THE HISTORY OF TIME SHARING" in 1983, published in CACM 1992 (see <a href="http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html).">http://www-formal.stanford.edu/jmc/history/timesharing/timesharing.html).</a>
