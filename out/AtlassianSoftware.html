        Atlassian Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        We're an Australian-based software company providing innovative enterprise software solutions to the world's leading organisations. Our mission is to build a different kind of software company - one that listens to client needs, values innovation in development and solves customer problems with brilliant simplicity.

        <em>Great. In other words, you're the same kind of software company as all the rest. What software company has a mission to ignore client needs, deprecate innovation, and cause customer problems with idiotic complexity?</em>

        <em>Remaining blatant marketese deleted...</em>

        Ah, throwing down the gauntlet :). What's different about Atlassian and our software? Hard to say without using some "marketese" but I'll do my best: for starters, we strive to be a "transparent" company - our pricing and licensing information and documentation are all publicly available on our website, as are the bugs and issues with our software. Customers post bugs and issues for everyone to see. We allow anyone to suggest new features and the community can vote on them. We have a rapid development cycle - 6 to 8 weeks per release - so we can get to all those features and work through any bugs faster. Though we sell commercial products, we give our clients the source code so they can modify the application to their heart's desire. As a commercial product, we have a dedicated support staff - phone, chat, email. I believe the "brilliant simplicity" referred to in our boiler refers to the ease of use of our software that is used by technical and non-technical people alike. We've gotten feedback from customers that adoption of our software within their organisation was "epidemic"... and that's pretty cool. And we have an active developer community making great plugins for our software. Nuf' said.
