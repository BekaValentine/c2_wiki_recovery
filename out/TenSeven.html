        Ten Seven
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TenSeven.html">TenSeven</a> is a proposed <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> to use to end pointless and repetitive discussion where <a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a> is deemed to be inapplicable for the reasons cited on that page. <a href="TenSeven.html">TenSeven</a> will indicate only the end of the debate not that the issue is settled. In fact it will imply exactly the opposite.
      </p>
      <p>
        For years I have been using the radio 10 code '10-7' ( out of service ) to end pointless online dialogs without implying agreement. It is never clear to me if others understand the meaning or even the reference ( by way of full disclosure I am not a ham-- never have been-- but as a geek some of this information was absorbed anyway) which also served me well as the other party could not take offense. Of course if they did I had already made the decision that I did not care at that point. So it's stronger than goodbye, weaker than __ you. 10-7 is not a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> so I propose <a href="TenSeven.html">TenSeven</a>.

        <em>[Note that this ten-code was in very popular usage in Citizen's Band (CB) radio all throughout the 1960s and 1970s. This and a few other ten-codes have crept into the vernacular without notice. "What's your 20?" is a reference to 10-20, current location report.]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        {Note that use of a few (well, two -- "ten four" and to a much lesser degree, "ten twenty") ten-codes have only crept into mainly U.S. regional usage.  Outside of that, they're either unknown or regarded as peculiarly "nerdy" -- the verbal equivalent to going to the mall with a 10 meter Ham radio rig strapped to your belt.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Indeed? Google ["ten four" vernacular] and get 1,580 hits. Search for ["ten twenty" location vernacular] and get 7,780 hits. Hardly unknown, not exactly nerdy, and not very regional.</em>

        {Oops, sorry -- I didn't realise you were one of the people who <em>likes</em> going to the mall with a 10 meter Ham rig strapped to his belt.}

        <em>When was the last time anybody googled anything and only got 1580 hits?</em>

        Sorry, I should have left off the <a href="TwentyFiveDollarWord.html">TwentyFiveDollarWord</a> "vernacular." The quoted phrase "ten four" by itself produced 502,000 hits. Better? What, you couldn't have done this search yourself?
