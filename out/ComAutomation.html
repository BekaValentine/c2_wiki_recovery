        Com Automation
      </h1>
      <p>
        A set of rules governing how certain <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a><em>s</em> should behave in order to interact with other <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a><em>s</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically when you support <a href="ComAutomation.html">ComAutomation</a>, you follow a few basic guidelines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Your component's default interface must derive from IDispatch
        </li>
        <li>
          You must use only Automation compatible types (anything that can be stored in a <a href="ComVariant.html">ComVariant</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="ToDo.html">ToDo</a>: add more details
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To be useful to the clients, you must "make your application's object model available as COM objects (with IDispatch interfaces)."
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="ComAutomation.html">ComAutomation</a> is a VERY heavily argued element of COM. It was created solely to facilitate the <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> language in its early incarnations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people believe that <a href="ComAutomation.html">ComAutomation</a>, the IDispatch interface mostly, should really be done away with because there are plenty of other ways to achieve the same results without requiring the author of such <a href="ComComponent.html">ComComponent</a><em>s</em> to incorporate functionality into each individual component. Essentially, IDispatch is a step backwards in COM, which is based on <a href="InterfaceBasedProgramming.html">InterfaceBasedProgramming</a> principles, because it limits environments that <strong>depend</strong> on it's presence to a single interface. There are several hacks around this, but in the end, it ruins the entire concept.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>COM needs a generic run-time data-driven client interface that can call functions on normal (non-IDispatch) COM interfaces.  Like CORBA's </em>DynamicInvocationInterface.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Exactly... and given the <a href="ObjectModel.html">ObjectModel</a> that exists for working with a TypeLibrary, the client, say a <a href="ScriptingEngine.html">ScriptingEngine</a>, could actually perform all the work itself. However, an argument for IDispatch is that the server can control what named elements it supports at run-time and perform it's own, non-standard, mapping of names. Of course today we have IDispatchEx, which is actually better modeled for supporting such functionality... the catch is it extends IDispatch. =(

        Legacy... ain't it fun? ;)
