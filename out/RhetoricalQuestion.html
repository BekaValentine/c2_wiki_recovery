        Rhetorical Question
      </h1>
      <p>
        A rhetorical question is a question asked in order to guide an argument, sway a listener, or otherwise have a rhetorical effect. The person who asks a rhetorical question does not expect, nor even desire, a verbal response from the receiver of the rhetorical question. One merely wants the listener/reader's brain to react in a way that disposes him toward the speaker, sets up a logical chain for her to follow, or the like.

        For example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why does the word "rhetoric" nowadays seem to have a negative connotation?</em> (Trying to grab attention, perhaps subtly suggest that people don't know what "rhetoric" means, which will rile those that don't, and will make those that do think I'm brilliant.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So what is, rhetoric, anyway?</em> (bring audience back to issue) <em>It's the art of speaking, making arguments, changing the audience's minds, etc.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A rhetorical question is a question asked in order to guide an argument, sway a listener, or otherwise have a rhetorical effect. Does the speaker/writer want the reader/listener to answer the question?</em> (guiding argument)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No! S/he merely wants the listener/reader's  brain to react in a way that disposes him toward the speaker, sets up a logical chain for her to follow, or the like.</em>

        A <a href="RhetoricalQuestion.html">RhetoricalQuestion</a> is not to be confused with a LeadingQuestion like "Do you still beat your wife?"

        Where would we be without rhetorical questions?
