        Pattern Language For Writing Fiction
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've been interested in Patterns for a while now and have wondered about
        combining them with my main hobby - fiction writing. There are many
        patterns at different levels that assist in the craft of fiction; Pattern form
        would seem a useful way to encapsulate these.

        Having recently attended an <em>excellent</em> two-day Patterns course given
        by <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> et al I'm convinced that a <a href="PatternLanguageForWritingFiction.html">PatternLanguageForWritingFiction</a>
        is not only plausible but desirable. AFAIK no-one is working on this, so I've started on my Web site at <a href="http://www.fnapf.demon.co.uk/muse/index.htm.">http://www.fnapf.demon.co.uk/muse/index.htm.</a> Currently there's only one pattern there - I'm working on others. <em></em><a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> as of 2003-04-09<em></em>

        A work worth reading on writing is <em>Writing For Story</em> by Jon Franklin.
        ISBN: 0452272955
        (c) 1986 by Mentor
        Library of Congress Catalog Card # 86-063378.
        It is sub-titled "Craft Secrets of Dramatic Nonfiction by a Two-Time Pulitzer Prizer-Winner" -- despite the "non-fiction" claim the methods described are as applicable to fiction as to non-fiction. This is a good read and practical advice on writing as a craft. Embedded in the text, not quite in pattern format, are prescriptive methods for writing "story" -- and that's what all writing is about. -- <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        Hey, I've been working on one of these privately for a while, off and on. It's neat to see there's some interest in this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WarAndPeace.html">WarAndPeace</a> is my source text, but I have looked at TheTaleOfGenji with similar eyes. A lot of it ends up looking like LISP or APL -- but ThatComparisonIsPurelySuperficial.
      </p>

        Some descriptions:
        hebrew/greek/cyrillic or other letter before command specifies character/place/motif/etc-specificity... 
      </p>
      <p>
        I do this when I transcribe recipes : it saves tons of writing to map bijectively, say, the set of all ingredients, and then simply use whatever letter or series of letters to refer to them in the steps...
      </p>
      <p>
        The general command for introducing a main character is simply CD (which stands for character development) which you nest outside of New. So to introduce us to Pierre:
      </p>
      <p>
        beyt(CD(New))
      </p>
      <p>
        or perhaps Pierre has been introduced with an unattractive description:
      </p>
      <p>
        beyt(CD(New(Desc:Unatt)))
      </p>
      <p>
        or perhaps Pierre has been introduced from the perspective of A. Scherer, for whom Pierre causes tension:
      </p>
      <p>
        aleph(TEN:beyt(CD(New(Desc:Unatt))))
      </p>
      <p>
        or to introduce us to the cargo hold of a vogon ship, use a different alphabet and define it as the one used for all settings, say greek, then:
      </p>
      <p>
        beta(SD(New))
      </p>
      <p>
        or to specify it as being introduced from the perspective of ArthurAndFord:
      </p>
      <p>
        alephbeyt(Persp:beta(SD(New)))
      </p>
      <p>
        The whole point of it right now is not so much to write fiction but to see how it is written... Like creating a periodic table of the different atoms which make up the story. I realize that any attempt to ecumenically describe the structure of fiction would be foolish : this is more just my way of enjoying the books I read, being able to see deep patterns in them, regardless of the fact that their existence may not spread far beyond my own emotional responses...
      </p>
      <p>
        Some patterns I think I have found in fiction ... it seems sometimes that a good story is at its root merely good use of counterpoint ... for this reason I define all functions to have an opposite or a moral opposite. For CD this would be ACD, since I have noticed that often the best character introductions seem to work like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        gimel(TEN:aleph(ACD(Desc:Att)));aleph(gimel(CD(Dial)));r-gimel(aleph(ACD));r-aleph(gimel(CD))
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step will be to develop a shorthand for processes. I.e., the process above gets mapped onto, say, a letter of the Devanagari alphabet, or is perhaps a given Chinese character. This shorthand-for-shorthand stuff continues until thousands of pages have been captured by a few looming symbols and parentheses... -- AlecSinger

        Or, perhaps you should go back a step and use MeaningfulNames.
