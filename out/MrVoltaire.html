        Attributed to <a href="MrVoltaire.html">MrVoltaire</a>:  "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it."  This appears in <em>The Friends of Voltaire</em> (1906) by Evelyn Beatrice Hall.  She does not attibute it to him as a quotation, but as an attitude.  The nearest Voltaire is known to have come to saying this is in a letter to M. Le Riche (Feb 6th, 1770), where he says:  "...je déteste ce que vous écrivez, mais je donnerai ma vie pour que vous puissiez continuer à écrire." (I detest what you write, but I shall give my life so that you may continue to write.")
