        Shared Memory
      </h1>
      <p>
        Two processes, threads, or objects can communicate via <a href="SharedMemory.html">SharedMemory</a>.  Using shared memory requires all participants to be located on the same <a href="PhysicalMachine.html">PhysicalMachine</a> or <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>.  Shared memory is one of the fastest communication mechanisms compared, say, to Sockets, HTTP, IIOP, or DCOM.  However, <a href="SharedMemory.html">SharedMemory</a> is a brittle <a href="LowLevelSolution.html">LowLevelSolution</a> that requires <a href="CarefulCoding.html">CarefulCoding</a> with SynchronizationObjects.

        In particular, use of shared memory can lead to problems when passing around class objects as in C++: your object data goes into the shared memory while the class's virtual function tables stay in process memory, and aren't accessible from the process you're sharing with. See <a href="VirtualFunctionsAndSharedMemory.html">VirtualFunctionsAndSharedMemory</a>.
