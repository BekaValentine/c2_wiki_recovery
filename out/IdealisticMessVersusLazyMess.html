        Idealistic Mess Versus Lazy Mess
      </h1>
      <p>
        In pondering "systems that went wrong", I've noticed certain patterns in how they go wrong and patterns in the symptoms. I'll propose a <a href="UsefulLie.html">UsefulLie</a> dichotomy between idealistic messes and "lazy" messes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Idealistic, <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a>, and <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> messes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Difficult to figure out what any piece of code does
        </li>
        <li>
           Difficult to trace the impact of a change due to too many layers of indirection
        </li>
        <li>
           Wrong abstraction used, resulting in big <a href="DiscontinuitySpike.html">DiscontinuitySpike</a>s. Some changes that fit the abstractions are quite easy, others are nearly impossible.
        </li>
        <li>
           Unlike lazy messes, you spend more time studying code than typing code to fix it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Inconsistent use of different paradigms or techniques.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lots of wasted code for dead-end or unfinished concepts.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Lazy messes:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Lot's of violation of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, so prepare to type a lot to change or fix.
        </li>
        <li>
           Generally a consistent pattern
        </li>
        <li>
           Lots of code to do relatively little
        </li>
        <li>
           Lots of similar-looking IF statements or viney, repetitious sub-classing for endless exceptions to the rule.
        </li>
      </ul>
