        Archimedes Of Syracuse
      </h1>
      <p>
        Archimedes of Syracuse is one of the <a href="WorldGeniuses.html">WorldGeniuses</a> by anyone's definition. His work on the area and volumes of surfaces and solids is a hair's breadth away from being TheCalculus, which makes him, oh, about 2000 years ahead of his time.  Definitely a strong contender for the smartest human that ever lived.

        Actually, to give credit where it is due: the method of exhaustion originated with EudoxusOfCnidus, not Archimedes. In fact, Eudoxus is also responsible for the theory of proportions and <a href="EuclidOfAlexandria.html">EuclidOfAlexandria</a> drew heavily off of him.  But he is rarely mentioned since none of his writings survived. <em>- Addendum: some sources I've read say Eudoxus wasn't the originator either.</em>

        In short - great people are usually on the <a href="ShouldersOfGiants.html">ShouldersOfGiants</a>. Others tend to stand on each others' toes. (or in each others' footprints.)
