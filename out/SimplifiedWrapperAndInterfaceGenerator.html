        Simplified Wrapper And Interface Generator

        A kit to generate bindings from the objects in a range of languages to <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. It comes with ready-made bindings for Tcl/C, Tcl/C++, Perl/C, Perl/C++, Python/C. Python/C++, and many other combinations. It takes a file which describes the interface to C or C++ and generates wrapper code.

        <dd>SWIG is a software development tool that connects programs written in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> with a variety of high-level programming languages. SWIG is used with different types of target languages including common scripting languages such as <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>, <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a> and <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. The list of supported languages  also includes non-scripting languages such as <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>, <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> (CLISP, Allegro CL, CFFI, UFFI), <a href="GoLanguage.html">GoLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="LuaLanguage.html">LuaLanguage</a>, <a href="ModulaThree.html">ModulaThree</a>, <a href="OcamlLanguage.html">OcamlLanguage</a>, Octave and R (<a href="ArrLanguage.html">ArrLanguage</a>). Also several interpreted and compiled Scheme implementations (<a href="GuileScheme.html">GuileScheme</a>, <a href="MzScheme.html">MzScheme</a>, <a href="ChickenScheme.html">ChickenScheme</a>) are supported. SWIG is most commonly used to create high-level interpreted or compiled programming environments, user interfaces, and as a tool for testing and prototyping C/C++ software. SWIG is typically used to parse C/C++ interfaces and generate the 'glue code' required for the above target languages to call into the C/C++ code. SWIG can also export its parse tree in the form of XML and Lisp s-expressions. SWIG is free software and the code that SWIG generates is compatible with both commercial and non-commercial projects. </dd>

        To use it a program is written in an interface language which defines the interface. In the case of C++, classes can be interfaced and extended to provide functions not in the C++ code. The interface is processed by SWIG to create a C or C++ code file which is compiled to provide the extension functions for the target language. The compiled code is then linked to form a dynamic library which can be loaded by the scripting language when needed.

        I have used SWIG extensively to interface <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> code to <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a> and <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>. SWIG will now directly interface C++ template objects. Something which takes this one step further is <a href="RubyEmbed.html">RubyEmbed</a>. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        SWIG can also be used to test/debug/explore C or C++ code using one of the
        supported HLL. This is described in details at

        I just used this to interface Java to two sizeable C libraries (SDL and SDL_image) and was amazed by how easy it was.  From beginning to download SWIG to running a Java program that drew graphics on screen using SDL took about four hours (and I used a 56k modem to download SWIG!). I think the fact that SDL is a very well engineered C library with a simple function-based API helped a lot. --<a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>

        I've used SWIG fairly extensively in the past - and for importing C libraries into your favourite scripting language (in my case Python) it is hard to beat.  HighlyRecommended. Sadly, it doesn't work as well for "real" C++ libraries, but then again that is a much much harder problem to solve.	There are some <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> ( <a href="http://www.boost.org/">http://www.boost.org/</a> ) that promise to make that easier, although I haven't had occasion to try them yet. -- <a href="BurkhardKloss.html">BurkhardKloss</a>
