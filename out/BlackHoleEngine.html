        Black Hole Engine
      </h1>
      <p>
        The only way I can conceive of this to work would be a device that uses the radiation of the accretion disk of the blackhole as a powersource.
      </p>
      <p>
        To some extent you can use gravitational slingshots, too.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Not with a black hole that is stationary relative to you.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Can't you use the intense hawking radiation of a micro black hole? Feed it matter in a continuous stream, harness the radiant output?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Essentially the same thing as the accretion disk radiation mentioned above
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Except for:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           miniscule vs massive
        </li>
        <li>
           unstable vs stable
        </li>
        <li>
           have to force-feed it vs let it feed
        </li>
        <li>
           blow up your solar system vs suck down your solar system
        </li>
        <li>
           100% conversion vs 90% conversion
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'm not even sure what size a black hole would have to be to generate useful energy through Hawking radiation. And what lifespan it would have left if its matter stream were interrupted. For all I know, it might be too small to suck down a proton and blow up within a microsecond.

        Sounds like fun!

        Assuming the placement of various devices around this object isn't a problem, which it shouldn't be --you just keep them far enough away, or orbiting around it fast enough, yadda yadda... there are a few obvious problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           you and all your equipment will be subject to bombardment from objects pulled in by the hole
        </li>
        <li>
           you and all your equipment will be subject to bombardment from the radiation and more especially, the EM field produced by the hole
        </li>
        <li>
           you and all your equipment will be subject to any number of other effects we don't currently know about
        </li>
        <li>
           if the black hole is big enough you'll either be forced to follow <em>it</em> where it wants to go or you'll be using a good portion of the energy it generates for you to move it anywhere
        </li>
        <li>
           all the other automotive companies are going to be pissy about it
        </li>
        <li>
           one or more people (or AIs at this point) will claim you're infringing upon one or more <a href="SubmarinePatent.html">SubmarinePatent</a>s from several hundred years ago
        </li>
        <li>
           god help you if that hole plays its race card ("I will NOT be oppressed!")
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Also, I'm thinking this page needs a related page called <a href="OneHundredAndOneUsesForBlackHoles.html">OneHundredAndOneUsesForBlackHoles</a>.
