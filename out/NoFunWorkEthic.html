        No Fun Work Ethic
      </h1>
      <p>
        The argument seems to go like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           all valuable work is hard work
        </li>
        <li>
           all hard work is unpleasant
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>therefore:</em> anyone in the workplace not visibly miserable is not adding value
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Where does this idea come from? The <a href="ProtestantWorkEthic.html">ProtestantWorkEthic</a> probably has something to do with it, but multiplied by some neo-Victorian morbidity and the terrible modern notion that a stereotyped accountant is the acme of "professionalism".
