        Microsoft have gone to ECMA for standardisation of the C# language and the Common Language Infrastructure (which includes some of the base classes in the standard library aka .NET framework).

        ECMA Standardization
      </p>
      <p>
        On October 31, 2000, Hewlett-Packard, Intel Corporation, and Microsoft jointly submitted proposed draft standards to ECMA, an international standards organization, for use in defining the C# Programming Language (ECMA TC39/TG2) and the Common Language Infrastructure (ECMA TC39/TG3). The official submissions are available from the ECMA web site at <a href="http://www.ecma.ch">http://www.ecma.ch</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hewlett-Packard, Intel Corporation, and Microsoft are providing mirror sites for these specifications. In addition, these sites provide a class library browser which will be hosted at ECMA later this year. The URLs for the mirror sites are:

        On December 13, 2001, the ECMA General Assembly ratified the C# and common language infrastructure (CLI) specifications into international standards. The ECMA standards will be known as ECMA-334 (C#) and ECMA-335 (the CLI). There is also a technical report on the CLI which will be known as ECMA TR84. In addition, ECMA approved the fast-track motion of these specifications to ISO. This is a huge step toward the Microsoft .NET Framework being widely accepted by the industry.
