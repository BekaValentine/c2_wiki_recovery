        Home of the worst-engineered buildings of any university. Robarts library is sinking, and the building where they <em>teach</em> engineering has drinking fountains and fire hoses approximately 1/2.54 the height they should be... (why 1/2.54 is left as an exercise to the reader). <em>Um... that would be accessibility for the disabled. A noble if not aesthetically pleasing accomplishment.</em> (I vote for metric/English mixup.) Possibly, but I have doubts. It's not a new building, and you <strong>really</strong> have to bend over and stick your head in the little cubby-hole to get at it. It's not even really accessible to wheelchairs because of its awkward positioning. <em>Clearly, it is a matter of inches... or, maybe not</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Did the engineering faculty <em>design</em> the buildings in question?
      </p>
      <p>
        I think some snooty architecture prof. designed a bunch of the buildings. Robarts is supposed to look like a peacock, but really it looks like a giant mecha-turkey. And there's this new residence being built on Spadina and Harbord that is so ugly it looks like a prison. I would <em>hate</em> to live there.

        <em>Supposedly, the </em><a href="UniversityOfWaterloo.html">UniversityOfWaterloo</a> library is sinking, too, and the UniversityOfCalgary one as well; I can't speak for any others. In each case, the supposed cause is neglect of the weight of the books. How could they forget every time? I can't say for sure, but it sounds a lot like an <a href="UrbanLegend.html">UrbanLegend</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The seventh floor of RobartsLibrary is said to be evacuated, in an effort to lighten up the building. None of the elevators allow access to this floor; the signs all indicate "No access to this floor" full stop. But who knows what's *really* there...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's the control room for the mecha-turkey.</em>

        Yes, the west end of campus, where the engineering, physics, chemistry, and generally "scientific" subjects are taught is hideous. The eastern half (home to "artsy" programs) is gorgeous, especially in the fall. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Guess which half the campus tours focus on? You could have a whole bus full of chemical engineering wannabes, and they'd still spend most of their time at the Department of Medieval Studies.

        <em>A friend of mine recently took a course in management of information systems at the </em>UniversityOfCalgary. In the engineering buildings, we had lecture theatres with these strange desks that had puny, little tables. In the management buildings, they have plush chairs and Ethernet connections at every desk. -- <a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Meanwhile, back at the <a href="UniversityOfToronto.html">UniversityOfToronto</a>, the new Bahen Information Technology building is a horrible waste of capital. It was $20 million short of completion, and while it has very nice mahogany insets everywhere, and $800 000 granite pillars, the ethernet and power jacks have yet to be installed, let alone the entire sixth floor, defeating the building's use as an engineering and computer science lecture space. And just to make life difficult, <em>every single room</em> was designed in precisely the wrong way to suit its function. Lecture halls have opaque doorways that force students to interrupt the previous class to see if they can wander in, if the doors open in the right direction anyway. The conference rooms have refracting glass walls that diffuse blinding sunlight into our eyes during sunset, which only complements the horrid acoustic design of the rooms. And there's this high pitched buzzing on the seventh floor that drives all of us crazy. To Bahen I say <em>Bah!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While we're on the subject of those mahogany insets, let's not forget the positively </em>'obscene<em>' amount of glass panelling all over the place in random places in the building - mostly under handrails - where it is simply useless.</em>

        UofT, where you're not just a number, you're less than a number. The UofT administroids ripped me off $10 while I was a starving student there. Now I have to laugh whenever they send me, a "loyal alumnus", letters asking for cash. What kind of "higher education" idiots rip-off an undergrad $10 and instantly obliterate hundreds or thousands of dollars worth of future goodwill? By contrast, the <a href="UniversityOfNorthCarolina.html">UniversityOfNorthCarolina</a> was a great place for graduate school and both I and my wife are lifetime members of their alumni association and regular if not large contributors. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a> (still pissed off after all these years)
