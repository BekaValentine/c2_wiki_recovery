        Tired Of Debating

      <p>
        <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> is a <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a> inspired by discussions in <a href="DeclineOfCivility.html">DeclineOfCivility</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>Usage example</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a seemingly endless debate one side adds a <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> (possibly add a date immediately) tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a signal to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           acknowledge receipt of the points made by the other side
        </li>
        <li>
           notify the other side that there is already a counterpoint prepared, but not issued
        </li>
        <li>
           acknowledge that the other side may have another response to my counterpoint, and then mine...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Person issuing the <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> tag is requesting a truce to allow uninvolved members of <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> a breather from <a href="WikiNoisePollution.html">WikiNoisePollution</a>. The person probably does not want to respond for at least a fortnight (14 days).
      </p>
      <p>
        If later the debates are resumed, then the person who raised the <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> flag will remove it, and post a (hopefully) more considered opinion without getting all emotionally fired up.

        I can understand no response in Jan05 as lots of people here were (then) engaged in one of several <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s. Recent "furor" about MS technology (or lack of) and /or content (or lack of) led me to revisit this forgotten page. It does seem C2 people who are vocal here do not seem (sic?) the MS pages do them any good, and are extremely forgiving towards MarkOfCostin type behavior. -- dl note Sep05

        <em>What I think is that with the implementation of </em><a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> as a place to take <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> material, this issue is, and ought to remain, history.  With respect to the tag, it seems redundant with simply stopping editing, and has an whiff of impatience and incivility itself. I recommend it be deleted.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Agreed.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I would suggest a more aggressive approach than above.  If one is in a discussion that shows no sign of converging, instead of just not adding new text, roll back (i.e. delete) the existing debate.  I feel it is a best practice to roll back to the last key point one's opponent made and let him have the last word.  Instead of waiting for some kind soul to come in and clean up the mess, take charge and do it before disappearing into the ether.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've taken this approach before and had it backfire.  Your opponent may not understand that you are backing off and letting him have the last word -- he may think you are trying to improve your appearance to spectators by removing failed arguments.  I agree that the useless back and forth rhetoric should be deleted, but consider leaving a comment explaining the edit.  You could refer to this page and add a </em><a href="DeleteWhenRead.html">DeleteWhenRead</a> tag.<em></em>

        <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> can be used as a SaveFace maneuver to run away from responsibility. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As a practical example, <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>, uses it currently to avoid any reasonable explanation after several people called him to task about the "content" he created. Nevermind the dishonesty of declaring himself as <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> and then mounting an attack against me on <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> (aka talking behind one's back). See MarkOfCostin, that now he uses here quasi-anonymously. So while he's tired when he's asked to pick up some responsibility for the quality of the content being honestly questioned by now 5 different persons, he is full of energy when it comes to dishonest attacks, also he's quite energic in sprawling more anonymous <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a> (another wiki <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> he does not want to give acccount for ) that are supposed to be used later to justify his actions.
      </p>
      <p>
        An honest <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> can be called after a reasonable effort has been made to engage in a "debate" or if the term "debate" sounds wrong with you, in dialectic mode. Some people went <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> 10 or more rounds to present the arguments and counter arguments, but certainly when not the least effort has been put to defend a position or idea being questioned, <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> is just oprdinary trolling. Many wiki trolls at one point or another in the history pretended to be <a href="TiredOfDebating.html">TiredOfDebating</a> and decided on their own they were right to go about the way they saw fit. It's the perfect excuse to run away from any responsibility and accountability, especially combined with going anonymous. --<a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>
