        In the mid 80s, <a href="InternationalBusinessMachines.html">InternationalBusinessMachines</a> developed their own operating system for their PS/2 line of <a href="PersonalComputer.html">PersonalComputer</a>s. OS/2 was developed as a better-designed alternative to <a href="MsDos.html">MsDos</a> and the early <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> operating systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        OS/2 was later rebranded as <strong>OS/2 Warp</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        OS/2 didn't meet with much commercial success. Microsoft competed with their Windows products on the consumer front and <a href="LinuxOs.html">LinuxOs</a> flourished on the technical front. IBM discontinued support for OS/2 at the end of 2006.
