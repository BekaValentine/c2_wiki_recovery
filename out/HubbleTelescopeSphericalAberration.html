        Hubble Telescope Spherical Aberration
      </h1>
      <p>
        As we all know, the <a href="HubbleTelescope.html">HubbleTelescope</a> has a built-in vision problem: The primary mirror has a "spherical aberration" -- its shape isn't quite right.

        <dd>"The military units were optically tested after assembly. The HST was not tested in this way, a "saving" that permitted Perkin-Elmer to submit the low bid for the mirror contract. Such a test would have unambiguously revealed a spherical aberration of the magnitude present in the HST." -- from "Mega-Projects & -Problems; The Hubble in Trouble" at <a href="http://www.npl.washington.edu/AV/altvw44.html">http://www.npl.washington.edu/AV/altvw44.html</a></dd>

        It appears that of the three types of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s that were applied to the main mirror, one showed OK, but the two others indicated a spherical aberration.  The passing test was trusted, and the failing tests ignored.

        <dd>"Eastman Kodak, another bidder for the mirror contract, lost in the competition but was subcontracted by Perkin-Elmer to construct a backup mirror. Astronomers, if they had been in charge of the HST project, would certainly have compared the two mirrors and selected the one of best optical quality for the telescope (and in the process, discovered the aberration problem).
