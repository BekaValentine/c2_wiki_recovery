        Collaborative Web Based Story Telling
      </h1>
      <p>
        A really fun application of Wiki is to allow a group of people or students, to collaboratively write a web-based, non-linear story. By web-based non-linear story, I mean a story where at each page, the reader chooses the hero's actions from a list of links. For example, see these stories (sorry, they are all in French):

      <code>
        <a href="http://lizzy.iit.nrc.ca/CyberClub/public/wiki.cgi?Jeux_d_Aventure">http://lizzy.iit.nrc.ca/CyberClub/public/wiki.cgi?Jeux_d_Aventure</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        These stories were all created by teams of Grade 4 students (2-3 students per team) over the course of 5 1-hour sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The stories were created using the <a href="YetAnotherWikiClone.html">YetAnotherWikiClone</a> system.

        I wish there was an English translation.

        Not wiki based, but a similar thing is done with the "Story Engine" <a href="http://www.qwantz.com/storyengine/index.asp">http://www.qwantz.com/storyengine/index.asp</a>
