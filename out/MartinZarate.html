        Martin Zarate
      </h1>
      <p>
        Martin Zarate is a young software developer and has been an occaisional visitor of <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> since he was in highschool... and never bothered to fill this page until now, when someone else did.
      </p>
      <p>
        Martin studied Systems and Computing Engineering at the University of Guelph in Guelph, ON.  He is currently developing inventory management software in the steel industry using a mishmash of Microsoft's various enterprise tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        He developed a fascination with programming linguistics through hacking away/extending the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> interpreter, reading Bruce Eckel's <a href="ThinkingInCeePlusPlus.html">ThinkingInCeePlusPlus</a>, and reading <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>... and has quickly decided that any language without the macro-power of <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> will eventually be frustratingly weak to solve a given problem.  He will eventually endeavor to learn one of these magical, super-high-level languages as soon as someone tells him which <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> variant to try, whether Squeak is pointless or not, and generally get over his mental allergy to languages that look absolutely nothing like C.  Suffers from a debilitatingly severe case of <a href="HelpfulCriticalGuySyndrome.html">HelpfulCriticalGuySyndrome</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He has, as of yet, produced nothing of note to the programming community at large.

        I have taken to, instead of signing contributions (including <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> ones), simply signing pages with a "contributors" box at the bottom, in an attempt to encourage the <a href="EgolessWiki.html">EgolessWiki</a>, while maintaining good <a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a>.  Since my comments are no longer directly attributed to me, feel free to refactor or correct as you see fit.
