        Good Books For Troubled Teens
      </h1>
      <p>
        Of course, not every teen is going to spend time reading. But there are books that can take a kid a lot further than a boatload of sage advice. Kids need seeds for thoughts outside the stuff the media machine shovels in their eyes. The idea here is to list books that did something marvellous for you when you were younger - stuff that transported you to places you'd never have dreamed of on your own. Stuff that astounded you. Stuff they can't put down.
