        In the vein of the BBC Radio 4 quiz:
      </p>
      <p>
        A delightful but extraordinarily difficult multi-user panel game in which contestants are asked to make continuous edits to a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> for sixty seconds without a single:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           hesitation
        </li>
        <li>
           repetition
        </li>
        <li>
           deviation <em>from the subject given</em> .. though it has to be said that recently the good Mr. Parsons has let this be interpreted far too generously and contestants get challenged on mere deviation from good sense or grammar.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It hasn't happened yet ... but it might still catch on.
      </p>
      <p>
        And where's NicholasParsons to blow the whistle at the end of the sixty seconds?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Nicholas Parsons, once dear and well-known, quietly retreated from the game to view it from afar high on a peak. Once he climbed high enough to see everything, he forgot his purpose, and choked to death on the whistle.</em>
