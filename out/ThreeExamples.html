        Three Examples
      </h1>
      <p>
        Aren't you Supposed to provide <a href="ThreeExamples.html">ThreeExamples</a> to ProveApattern ?
      </p>

        <em>Which is fine provided those three aren't all thinking about same speculative article/</em>PhD thesis/idea someone had down the pub. Ideally, they'd be thinking of three (possibly commercial) separate uses.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or rather, isn't a pattern supposed to <em>emerge from</em> three or more observed repeating solutions?
      </p>

        This page was linked/created from <a href="CommunityLifeCycle.html">CommunityLifeCycle</a>, which does refer to three separate projects. Though not necessarily commercial, after all there's MoreToLifeThanShopping.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="CommunityLifeCycle.html">CommunityLifeCycle</a> looks like a good start on a pattern language to me.<em></em>

        As similar, though much more nearly trivial schema applies to the creation of Wiki pages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          the first person provides the ProposedWikiWord?  
        </li>
        <li>
          Someone seconds it by creating the page by click on the link and asking for clarification ( SecondAsksForClarification )
        </li>
        <li>
          the third person tries to explain if it smells familiar ( ThirdPersonExplains ). 
        </li>
        <li>
          and the FirstPersonVerifies?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This may be a expression of an <a href="UnwrittenRule.html">UnwrittenRule</a>, <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> does have them you know.
        Of course <a href="UnwrittenRule.html">UnwrittenRule</a>s have value, they are usually useful heuristics. For instance this page seems to have an <a href="UnwrittenRule.html">UnwrittenRule</a> that contributions should be unsigned and that NonLinearEditing is OK.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Which is cool. The protocol described above is (as given) far, far too trivial for general use in finding patterns, however.</em>
