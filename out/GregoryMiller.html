        I'm interested in patterns and in my spare time, am immersed in the Addison-Wesley book called "Design Patterns" (<a href="http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/patterns/DPBook/DPBook.html),">http://st-www.cs.uiuc.edu/users/patterns/DPBook/DPBook.html),</a> a text on reusability by a host of authors (Gamma, Helm et al); obviously well known to this community.

        <a href="ThankYou.html">ThankYou</a> <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> for putting PortlandPatterns together.  Ward is a well known and respected "objectist" :-) in the Silicon Forest, and I'm sure well known to the Object community at large.  I am pleased to have discovered this community here.  Thanks Ward.

        I find Patterns to have some interesting and intriguing application in jurisprudence.
