        Agile Gantt
      </h1>
      <p>
        Agile afficianadoes in general, and <a href="ScrumMethodology.html">ScrumMethodology</a> fans in particular, despise the <a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Most <a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a>s are lies from the get-go
        </li>
        <li>
           Most <a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a>s' lies get bigger as time goes on
        </li>
        <li>
           Maintaining these horrible lying charts is an expensive waste of time for an Agile tracker
        </li>
        <li>
           Most managers use <a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a>s to force developers into heroics, stress, burnout and, dare I say it, disgruntlement.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        On the other hand, most Project Managers adore the <a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           PMs are expected to communicate via <a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a>. Saying you won't use them is like saying you've decided to use the coughing code.
        </li>
        <li>
           The popular Prince2 and Pmbok methodologies will keep Gantts alive no matter what Joel, Bob, Ron, and all the whipper-snapper <a href="BaseCamp.html">BaseCamp</a> agilists have to say. 
        </li>
        <li>
           When it comes to costing, calendars, external dependencies and resourcing the <a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a> actually useful. No, I am not kidding.
        </li>
        <li>
           Non-technical managers, especially high level managers, see no reason why <a href="GanttChart.html">GanttChart</a>s which are perfectly adequate in all other realms of human endeavour should not apply to software development.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Up till now this has left agilists at a PM impass. Can't live with 'em, can't live without 'em. Isn't there some way we can turn these compelling graphs to our advantage? I believe there is. You can represent an honest XP <a href="CommitmentSchedule.html">CommitmentSchedule</a> with an <a href="AgileGantt.html">AgileGantt</a>. Here's the grift:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> are represented by Gantt tasks. Use start-start dependencies to represent relative priorities so they'll fold up the right way. Burn anyone who says there's internal finish-start dependencies. Never put <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s on the Gantt.
        </li>
        <li>
           Assign <strong>all</strong> developers to every <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> Gantt task. This isn't telling any lies - developers pair on <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s, not <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>. Account traditionally for developer vacation schedules, illnesses, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Estimate in StoryPoints. To map to Gantt "effort" days, multiply by a big fat <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a>, say 4, then measure Project Velocity as you normally would for <a href="IdealDay.html">IdealDay</a>s and track per iteration. This is so the efficiency game you play in the next step makes you look pretty. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Use <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a> to generate <a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a> as a percentage, then adjust the Gantt efficiency of <strong>all</strong> developers by this percentage.
        </li>
        <li>
           Level every time you adjust the schedule after a <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>. Let PMs ignorant enough to want to check you against a baseline figure it out ... if they can.
        </li>
        <li>
           Rig your <a href="FitTest.html">FitTest</a> server to fill in the completions for the <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> tasks automatically. That way you only edit the Gantt manually after a <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        That's easy peasy. Whack your <a href="AgileGantt.html">AgileGantt</a> up on the wall next to your <a href="BurnUpChart.html">BurnUpChart</a> and <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a> histogram and those old waterfall buzzards can Pmbok on you all they like, you're teflon. Or at least that's my present thinking - I'd appreciate critical comment. ~ <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        Hi, Peter!  You're only about 5 years behind on this one. [<a href="WallGantt.html">WallGantt</a>]
      </p>

        <em>Thanks Alistair. It's reassuring to find oneself becoming a conservative. This is the way we've always done it. Harumph. :-)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I do like the </em><a href="WallGantt.html">WallGantt</a>. It seems like a neat way for a large team to share ownership of <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>s. But I don't think it's quite the same idea as this one.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The </em><a href="WallGantt.html">WallGantt</a> doesn't represent a <a href="CommitmentSchedule.html">CommitmentSchedule</a> in <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> and customer priority order. Also because it's (admirably) paper based it's not amenable to the purpose of the <a href="AgileGantt.html">AgileGantt</a> - corporate communication with non-copacetic customers. And I don't see how you could do a FIT integration with it ...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Basically the </em><a href="AgileGantt.html">AgileGantt</a> is an attempt to represent a customer-oriented <a href="CommitmentSchedule.html">CommitmentSchedule</a> directly in the traditional PM form. The notion is that day to day <a href="EngineeringTask.html">EngineeringTask</a>ing is managed using stand-ups and pairing - obviating the burden of maintaining a detailed task schedule past a weekly horizon.<em></em>

        Ah, I see ... which is my way of saying I don't understand at all. Something is too complicated here for me to grasp. Is there a picture that shows it, or a simpler way of describing it so my mind doesn't blow up or go to sleep half-way through?
      </p>
      <p>
        ... those of us with little minds, you see, need to be given simpler ideas to suck on ...
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry for misunderstanding. When we get this cleared up, refactor at will to remove my dribbling. -- <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

      <p>
        <em>Pshaw, the obvious problem is I've given no examples. I'm constructing the first of these today so will file off the serial numbers then put up a jpeg some place. But in the meanwhile some terminology clarifications might help:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>A start-start dependency means one task can't start until another has started. So given resource availability they can proceed in parallel.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Gantt efficiency is a quality of a Gantt resource - generally of a person. It's something like availability; if you're only working half days you have an efficiency of 50%. I imagine really damnfoolish managers might use it to describe the relative quality of their staff. Tying it up in a knot as above makes it correspond directly with </em><a href="LoadFactor.html">LoadFactor</a>, which you'll recall described <a href="ProjectVelocity.html">ProjectVelocity</a> in Kent's original conception.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>A baseline is the BDUF Gantt a waterfall starts with; PMBOK regards reality as a variance upon the baseline, and your waterfall PM spends most of his life tracking that for purposes of blame distribution. At least, I think that's the purposes, I've never been certain.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Leveling is the process of automagically reassigning your resources so that, given task dependencies, you can minimize the </em><a href="CriticalPath.html">CriticalPath</a>. Waterfall PMs believe doing this is important, presumably for purposes of OperantConditioning. Though who they're conditioning I've also never been certain.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>That all I understand. What I don't see is what is the difference between your thing and the paper wall-gantt. I know you've provided words for me to consume --- right now I'm needing to wait to see what the thing</em> looks like <em>to savvy how it is different from the things I know. (then we can delete much of this back-and-forth). Cheers - Alistair</em>
