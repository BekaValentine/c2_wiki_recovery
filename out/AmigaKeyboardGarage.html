        Amiga Keyboard Garage
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the nicest features of the original Amiga 1000 model (<a href="AmigaComputer.html">AmigaComputer</a>) was the keyboard garage. By making the keyboard small enough to fit under the CPU box, and providing a place for it, the rather sizable (almost twice the footprint of the Apple Macintosh - see <a href="AppleMacintoshDesign.html">AppleMacintoshDesign</a>) keyboard garage let it fit on a small work area without taking up any more room.  Unfortunately, the keyboard garage was discarded in the 2000 and subsequent desktop and tower models, and irrelevant for the 500 series, in which the computer was built into the large keyboard.
