        A PileFilingSystem is introduced on the page <a href="OnePileFilingSystem.html">OnePileFilingSystem</a>. This page is meant to extend the concept beyond that of a singular, individual system to one made up of several PileFilingSystems which would typically be utilized by a team or group of collaborators and where the team has n members, would have a minimum of n+2 piles, with a team pile, an archive pile, plus a pile for each member. When agreed upon by members in the team, additional purposed piles might also need to be created and maintained. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Each Member would manage its own pile, including which pages are copied to the team pile and thus also stored semi-permanently. When copied to the team pile, a page would also receive a member-generated tag to be used in indexing it when and if it is copied to the archive pile. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The Team pile should contain pages deemed vital to the teams operation and to documentation of progress and finalization of target items. A member added early, mid, or late in a project should be able to come up to speed quickly and be able to participate fully in the team as a result of reading at least the top third of the team pile. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Depending upon the kind of team generated, the team might also create a governing, or managing pile. This would serve the functions of assignment, control, direction, scheduling, and progress reporting. It and the archive pile would be the only pile which would be maintained on a chronological basis, and have a record page which would be created, periodically (monthly, semi-monthly, weekly, daily, or on demand with date-time-stamped identification) with a copy of it placed on the top of each member's pile, and stay there until confirmed or acknowledged. The disposition thereafter being at the individual member's discretion.
      </p>
      <p>
        A member might also make all, or only part of their pile available for other team members to read by tagging them as public, Or make individual pages as distributed to interested or involved parties, by tagging them as Send-To-NameofPile.
