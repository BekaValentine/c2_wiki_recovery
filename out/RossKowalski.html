        'Pattern thoughts'
      </p>
      <p>
        For the longest time my friend Bob and I were talking about patterns without even knowing it.  We had been using the terminology "powerful ideas" that I think we got from reading SeymorePapert.

        'Good and bad things'
      </p>
      <p>
        BAD: Javax.comm is a real POS.  I must have spent three hours trying to get that junker working.  It seems to have been abandoned by the java folks.

        Good: Pmwiki wikifarms are the way to live for a multiple wiki site.  It is painless and efficient.
