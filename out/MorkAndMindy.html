        Mork And Mindy
      </h1>
      <p>
        An early 1980's sitcom dealing with the plight of a space alien (MorkFromOrk) who lands in Boulder, CO in order to study mankind.
      </p>
      <p>
        The show starred <a href="RobinWilliamsTheActor.html">RobinWilliamsTheActor</a> as MorkFromOrk and PamDawber as Mindy.  Mork was an alien sent to earth from the planet Ork in order to study mankind and report back to Orson, his <a href="FearlessLeader.html">FearlessLeader</a>.  Each show would end with a dialogue between Mork and Orson in which they whacked the moral of the episode against the viewer's head repeatedly.

        The episode in which Mork's jumpsuit - actually a creature made of billions of tiny living cells - almost jumped Mindy has been revisited here: <a href="RatAndTuyen.html">RatAndTuyen</a>.

        Got <a href="RobinWilliamsTheActor.html">RobinWilliamsTheActor</a> started, but really it's just a show about shacking up.

        <em>Is this a joke? I probably watched the show twice, but I never saw any references. I thought that a late 1970s show about shacking up would whack you repeatedly against the head about it. --</em><a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a><em></em>

        A late 80's show yes, but you still had to talk around things a decade previous, shazbat.
