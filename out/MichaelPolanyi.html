        Michael Polanyi
      </h1>
      <p>
        Michael Polanyi was born in 1891 and died in 1976.
      </p>
      <p>
        He earned an M.D. and served as a doctor in WWI.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the war, he wrote an article on the adsorption of gases that became his thesis for his Ph.D. in physical chemistry.
      </p>
      <p>
        After doing respectable work in adsorption, X-ray crystallography, and reaction kinetics, he moved into economics, social analysis, philosophy, theology and aesthetics.
      </p>
      <p>
        He developed the concept of "<a href="TacitKnowledge.html">TacitKnowledge</a>" in Personal Knowledge (1958) and The Tacit Dimension (1966).  His slogan was, "All knowledge is tacit or rooted in <a href="TacitKnowledge.html">TacitKnowledge</a>."
