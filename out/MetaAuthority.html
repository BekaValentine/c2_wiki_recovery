        An example could be a retired Craftsman.  One who has mastered the skills of a trade to the extent that their execution of that trade approaches art.  They can produce a product of the highest quality.
        One who is able to judge work in that trade.  Since that person is now retired, they are no longer involved in that trade, thus are no longer influenced by the members of that trade.
      </p>
      <p>
        A Critic - one who cannot do art, therefore criticizes it.

        Them as can, do.  Them as can't boss.  Them as can't boss, teach.  Them as can't teach, criticize.
