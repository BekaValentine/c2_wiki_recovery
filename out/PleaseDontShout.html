        Please Dont Shout
      </h1>
      <p>
        "PLEASE DONT SHOUT", that is, please don't write in all uppercase letters on Wiki.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's much harder to read than mixed case.
        </li>
        <li>
           To some people (OK, at least to the original author of this page here) it comes across as ranging somewhere between unprofessional and offensive. Unprofessional, because it's usually not used in professional communications; offensive, because it's used to express offensive feelings by some, the equivalence of shouting.
        </li>
        <li>
           All uppercase doesn't mix well with <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           If some comments on the page are in all uppercase, and some are not, this makes refactoring difficult.
        </li>
        <li>
           It's not necessary, as you can use <em>double</em> or <strong>triple</strong> quotes to highlight text on Wiki.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Please use mixed case instead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thank you.
