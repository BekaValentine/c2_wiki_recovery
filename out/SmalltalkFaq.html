      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> What's the deal with all these different versions, and how do I pick the best one?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> This section of the FAQ is covered in <a href="SmalltalkEnvironmentComparisons.html">SmalltalkEnvironmentComparisons</a> since it is quite broad.

        <strong>Q:</strong> I'd really like to try a good <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> in Smalltalk. What are my options?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> (2012)OmniBrowser built into <a href="PharoSmalltalk.html">PharoSmalltalk</a> 4.x.  On the <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> side, OmniBrowser does not load after 3.9, so I had to give up on <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> for now - <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> is a necessity.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Is there a <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a> available for <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a>, or <a href="DolphinSmalltalk.html">DolphinSmalltalk</a> (<em>especially</em> <a href="DolphinSmalltalk.html">DolphinSmalltalk</a>)?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> The refactoring browser is built into the most recent versions of Dolphin Smalltalk (XP) as well as <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> 7 (See <a href="http://www.object-arts.com">http://www.object-arts.com</a> and <a href="http://www.cincom.com/smalltalk)">http://www.cincom.com/smalltalk)</a> as well as Smalltalk/X (<a href="SmalltalkEcks.html">SmalltalkEcks</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> I went searching for something like this the other day. Apparently, a group of people at <a href="CampSmalltalk.html">CampSmalltalk</a> started work on a Squeak port of the <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>, and put up a temporary home page at <a href="http://www.bobjectsinc.com/squeakrbalpha/.">http://www.bobjectsinc.com/squeakrbalpha/.</a> I believe the port is incomplete, but I haven't tried it out yet, as I'm only just starting to learn Smalltalk. The page also links to two other porting efforts, though one of the links seems to be dead.

        <strong>Q:</strong> What is ENVY, and why would I need it or want it?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> I've only used ENVY briefly, but it is a shared source repository system for Smalltalk. 
        In short, it's the equivalent of CVS - just a lot more transparent to use. ENVY is not, to my knowledge, free - nor is it cheap. In addition, I think it's not really supported any longer. This may not be true. I know that Cincom is pushing Store for use with <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> 5i.3 and up. Store is nice and it works well. -- <a href="JeffPanici.html">JeffPanici</a>

        Um, ENVY is perhaps dying, but not dead, as it is still the source code control system for <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>/Smalltalk. For more than you ever wanted to know about ENVY, see the book "Mastering ENVY/Developer" (disclaimer: I'm one of the people who wrote it). -- Alan Knight

           Ibm is terminating support of <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>/Smalltalk. Envy is dead, unless it is somehow revived within Eclipse (there have been occasional rumors of this).

        <strong>Q:</strong> What is <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>, and why would I need it or want it? Why not just use a regular database?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> is an <a href="ObjectOrientedDatabase.html">ObjectOrientedDatabase</a>. And, to answer your second question:
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, this is a <em>huge</em> question. It gets right into the whole <em>OODBMS vs. RDBMS</em> battle. First, let me say that <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a> is a fine product, but a little aged in the OODBMS space. While I'm not certain, and someone correct me if I'm wrong, I believe that <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>/S isn't actively supported any longer and <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>/J is all but dead. However, you can get <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>/S for Linux as a limited development download.
      </p>
      <p>
        You'll have to make a personal determination on whether an OODBMS or RDBMS is best for your particular situation. -- <a href="JeffPanici.html">JeffPanici</a>

        <strong>Q:</strong> <a href="SmalltalkUnit.html">SmalltalkUnit</a> (at least the one that comes with Squeak) doesn't give very informative failure messages when using "self should: [...]". Observe:
      </p>
      <code>
        ==== SUnit ======== Start ====<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           FAIL ***
          <ol>
            <li>
               run, 0 failed, 1 errors (50 ms)
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        ---- SUnit ------- Errors ----<br/>
        FooTest>>testFoo<br/>
        ==== SUnit ========== End ====<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Did it fail because I passed it a faulty Bar? Was the Quuxume out of whack? How will I know?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> The idea with SUnit (and xUnit in general), as I understand it, is not to put in lots of informative error messages. If a test fails, run it in debug mode, you'll get a debugger, and you can see immediately why it fails. It's the simplest thing that could possibly work. 
        And having done it both ways, I find this much less time-consuming than trying to write tests that generate informative error messages. -- <a href="AlanKnight.html">AlanKnight</a>
