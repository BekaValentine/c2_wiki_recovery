        Is this page meant to be <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> or a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>?  This page seems to be a project status checklist.  Does it really belong on this wiki?  While much of this material could be edited to be in <a href="PatternForm.html">PatternForm</a> or generally useful, it currently does not seem to invite content changes by most wiki users.  -- a gnome

        <em>It was part of a </em><a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>, and I merged it into an <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>.  I probably would have deleted it had it not had <a href="VincentMassol.html">VincentMassol</a>'s name on it.  Perhaps the best thing would be to email Vincent.<em></em>
