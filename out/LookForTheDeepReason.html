        A lot of the time, what seems to be a problem is in fact only a <em>symptom</em> of a deeper problem. When you fix a problem, look for the factors that caused it, and try to fix them too.

        When someone (especially someone "technical") asks for a change to some software, I often suspect that there is some unvoiced "root" problem that they haven't shared with me. I <a href="LookForTheDeepReason.html">LookForTheDeepReason</a> for their request to find that they have cobbled together some barely adequate way to solve the root problem, if I can make the change they asked for.

        The "technical" person is usually trying to save me some work by asking for a "little" change to something existing. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many times, it is easier for me (and better for them) to simply solve their root problem directly.
