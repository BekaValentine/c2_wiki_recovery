      <p>
        I'm Lars Berg, a Swedish artist, web designer and Gestalt therapist, living in the little town Gnesta.

        I'm very interested in the world of programming, but have to admit I don't understand how to get close to it. I'm a visual thinker and need metaphors to find out and learn. I've read books and tried making PHP scripts since 1999, but still run into mistakes I don't understand.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I ever expand my knowledge enough to be able to really program, I'll write a book giving an artistic outlook on the subject.

        I learned HTML coding from David Siegel, just because he explained it in a visual way. If anyone reading this knows of similar books on programming, I'd love to be told about it.
