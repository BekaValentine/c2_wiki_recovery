        Threaded Command Object
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        GUI code needs to responsive to input while work is being done. We want to encapsulate the information needed to perform a job. We're in C++ Windows/Mac where certain issue constrain what gui threads and non-gui threads can do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Use threaded command object (<em>which is WHAT, exactly?</em>) to do the work. See also <a href="CommandPattern.html">CommandPattern</a>, <a href="CommandObject.html">CommandObject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To keep application thread-safe, avoid calling functions in the model while the threaded command object is running.
      </p>
      <p>
        An issue in <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> is that a GUI thread cannot safely call mutex, semaphores, etc. that could force the thread to wait, unless you use <a href="MsgWaitForMultipleObjects.html">MsgWaitForMultipleObjects</a>, which includes the thread's window message queue as one of the objects to wait on, otherwise there could be deadlock if the GUI thread has to wait on a mutex while the operating system tries to send an event to its window.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> 9 preemptive threads cannot call GUI functions at all (they used to not be able to do much at all except image processing - that changed several years ago). They can make network calls, and maybe file system and other non-GUI calls. On MacOS 9, it is safe for the main (GUI) thread to wait on a semaphore, because the OS integrated theGUI-event-polling mechanism with the semaphore system.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           before threaded command objects are created, gui calls model objects safely, without needing synchronization
        </li>
        <li>
           when user initiates an action, gui creates threaded command object
        </li>
        <li>
           while threaded command object is running, that 'action' part of the gui is disabled, (or maybe entire gui is disabled except for the cancel button - depending on how fine-grained your command objects and synchronization are).
        </li>
        <li>
           while threaded command object is running, gui does not make calls to the parts of the model associated with that command object
        </li>
        <li>
           command object makes calls to model as necessary to do its work
        </li>
        <li>
           command object notifies gui of completion / progress using window-events on Microsoft windows. On MacOS, main thread polls a thread-safe message queue
        </li>
        <li>
           immediately after signalling the main gui thread, command-thread deletes the command object
        </li>
        <li>
           gui can now query model safely again, and zeroes out the pointer to the dead command-object.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        In java, use WhatItsName method to asynchronously update gui from a non-main thread...
      </p>

      <p>
        SwingUtilities.invokeLater()?
      </p>

      <p>
        <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> GUIs (Carbon and Cocoa) are also not thread-safe: only the main thread should do anything in the GUI.
