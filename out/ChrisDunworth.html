        Hmm. I've been reading this Wiki for many months, and then I finally contributed something, and left my name, which means I have to write something here, I guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        I write software, like most of you (I presume). And I want to know how to do it the right way. I am not an expert, and stand in awe of those who make the task seem effortless. The discussions here are fascinating, and the sense of community impressive. I hope to contribute more in the future.

        Here are some book recommendations, since you should at least get <em>something</em> for reading this page (admittedly a pittance):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Crossing The Chasm</em>, by Geoffrey Moore - Fascinating marketing text (seriously). If you are trying to sell software or other technology, you owe it to yourself to read this. ISBN: 0060517123
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Object Oriented Analysis And Design With Applications</em>, by Grady Booch - As good a place to start learning OOD as I can think of. Strong academic prose. ISBN: 0805353402
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Extreme Programming Explained: Embrace Change</em>, by <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> -- Changed my view of software development.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Effective C++</em> (ISBN: 0201924889) and <em>More Effective C++</em> (ISBN: 020163371X), both by Scott Meyers - Tips from a guru. If you don't have the privilege of working alongside a guru, these books are the next best thing. For C++, anyway.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Manufacturing Consent: The Political Economy Of The Mass Media</em> (ISBN: 0375714499), by Edward Herman and Noam Chomsky - Herman and Chomsky gore a sacred cow with their propaganda model. Chomsky scares many people, mostly because he tries to refute preconceptions, a tack which always meets strong resistance (consider the "earth is round" supporters of 1000 years ago). Read with an open mind.
        </li>
      </ul>
