        A <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> works behind the scenes to tie up little loose ends, adding ISBNs of books that people mention, tracking down the authorship of "someone once said" quotes, correcting <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>s, fixing <a href="BrokenWhitespace.html">BrokenWhitespace</a>, answering <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>s, tirelessly replacing <a href="ChatMode.html">ChatMode</a> with content, fixing misspellings, and, when appropriate, making ordinary words into <a href="WordsSmashedTogetherLikeSo.html">WordsSmashedTogetherLikeSo</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A very diligent <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> regularly searches for <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a>s (<a href="http:wiki?search=EditHint)">http:wiki?search=EditHint)</a> left behind by <a href="MetaWikiGnome.html">MetaWikiGnome</a>s and cleans them up or even takes on major projects, such as breaking down the barriers around <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s love to work in the shadows making what some would call <a href="StupidLittleEdits.html">StupidLittleEdits</a>. Look at <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and you may even spot one!
      </p>
      <p>
        They are the wiki version of the mythical "menuhunes" of hawai'i - little people who go around and fix things when no-one's looking. (wikihune's?)

        <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s are basically good, along with <a href="WikiFaeries.html">WikiFaeries</a> and <a href="HousekeepingZombie.html">HousekeepingZombie</a>s, unlike <a href="WikiGremlin.html">WikiGremlin</a>s.

        <strong>Q:</strong> Are gnomes designated or they are just users who correct things here and there in the background?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Anyone who is doing these things is a wiki gnome.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> A gnome deleted something of mine. Should they give me some warning so I can back it up first?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> That was not a gnome. <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s only delete what everybody wants deleted. But we can help you: <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> and <a href="HistoryPages.html">HistoryPages</a> can be used to retrieve recent deletions. But please also see <a href="DeleteOnceRestoreOnce.html">DeleteOnceRestoreOnce</a> - differences of opinion need not become battles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Given that Wiki lives in the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>, it is also wise to make a copy of anything you don't want erased as you create it. Having said that, it is courteous for gnomes to make some sort of archive when they make non-trivial changes - if a comment is signed, rather than deleting it, a gnome often moves it to the homepage of the author. Of course, some <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s are new in the business and may make mistakes, so don't ever depend on that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Should I set my <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> to <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> while gnoming, or sign my edit?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> <em>No</em>, please don't. <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> is not a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>. If you want to be anonymous, simply act anonymously, with no <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> at all, and no signature. Your refactorings must stand on their own, and the <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> signature cannot lend them special legitimacy or authority.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> I like to think I am a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> but am worried I may just be a nit-picking pedant... how can I be sure? -- <a href="AndrewCates.html">AndrewCates</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> If your changes improve Wiki, that's all that matters. If you're still worried, please arrange a session with <a href="DrWiki.html">DrWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> What motivates the <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> ObSouthPark:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Clean up zillions of <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           ???
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>PROFIT!!!</strong>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Do gnomes ever disagree? That is to say, does someone become a gnome by doing gnomish things, like "changing things everybody wants changed" and/or "only delete what everybody wants deleted"? If they are wrong and someone restores or changes what they have done, are they obliged to leave the change alone, since at least one of the everybodies (perhaps even another gnome) does not want the change or deletion? What happens then if they do decide to change the changes back - do they lose ther gnome status or is status merely assumed? I guess what I'm asking is this: are there <strong>good</strong> and <strong>bad</strong> gnomes? Or is it a matter of <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> By definition there are only good <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s, so there cannot be disagreement. That's also because a good refactoring is orthogonal to any other refactoring. Opinionated edits are not the domain of gnomes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> How can I collect the above-mentioned gnome fees for doing gnome work? Do I send a WikiGnomeBill, and if so, to whom?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> No. Giving the <a href="GnomeFee.html">GnomeFee</a> is a voluntary task. It cannot be claimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q:</strong> Is WikiHune a better name than <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>?  Cf. menahune.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Define "better".
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It needs to be reiterated, apparently, that <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> <strong>is not</strong> a legitimate signature. We have lots of wiki gnomes who are either anonymous or they sign minor edits with their real name (special thanks to those folks who work relentlessly to improve existing pages). This is exceedingly important as they take on a delicate task, and by signing they take responsibility for the quality of their editing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> is a humble position. To paraphrase a famous person, "It is not those who think they have done enough to deserve the title, but those who think they haven't done enough that are really the <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s."
