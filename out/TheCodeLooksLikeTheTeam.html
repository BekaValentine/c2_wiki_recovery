        The Code Looks Like The Team
      </h1>
      <p>
        Reading the first few books in the XP Series clarified
        so many thoughts in my head that I started keeping a
        journal of XP-related ideas (Justin's Extreme
        Journal). Here is an early entry:

        <strong>The Code Looks Like the Team</strong> 7/27/01
      </p>
      <p>
        Considering the responsibilities of our teams, we have
        tried to promote an impermeable opaque interface layer
        between the work of [my team] and that of [another
        team]. Concerns have been raised that this is an
        arbitrary division, and that design decisions
        shouldn't be forced according to "who's supposed to
        work on what code." Indeed, XP tends to favor free
        roam of all programmers over all code in their
        product. <a href="EricRaymond.html">EricRaymond</a> noted that there is a truism
        that the organization of a system tends to reflect the
        organization of the people who design it. He brought
        that up in order to make a positive comment about <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>
        development -- developers working independently
        communicating through the network tend to produce
        systems with independent modules communicating in
        similar patterns. For another perspective, consider
        that <a href="FredBrooks.html">FredBrooks</a> initially advocated a completely open
        development environment [in "The Mythical Man-Month"],
        but later decided that an "information-hiding"
        approach is more effective [in the revised edition of
        the same book].
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's consider turning around the "code reflects team"
        idea. The connotation is generally that the code
        organization <em>follows</em> the team organization, but what
        if instead the team organization follows the code
        organization? In the former case, a concern comes to
        mind that the code may be artificially constrained
        according to an arbitrary team organization. In the
        latter case, however, an intriguing possibility for
        team organization comes to light. If the team is
        organized according to naturally occurring stable
        interfaces in the code, then future development is not
        unduly constrained. Indeed, splitting teams with
        well-defined interfaces may be essential for
        development of very large systems. XP teams are
        supposed to be 3-10 people for best effect. This
        suggests that, while any product should <em>start</em> with a
        single team, if that team grows large it should split
        into multiple teams -- with some teams as "customers"
        of others. This requires stable, impermeable
        interfaces between the teams to prevent interference.
        Team splits will be suggested by refactoring trends.
      </p>
      <p>
        This seems to be precisely the genesis of [my team].
        Trends in refactoring have long been pushing
        functionality into [one particular component]. This
        suggested a natural split along this feature-oriented
        layer, with [another team] as the customer of [my
        team's] product.

        When I posted this to the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> Yahoo!
        eGroup, <a href="MikeBeedle.html">MikeBeedle</a> pointed out that this is <a href="ConwaysLaw.html">ConwaysLaw</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I must have read this law in <a href="EricRaymond.html">EricRaymond</a>'s "<a href="TheCathedralAndTheBazaar.html">TheCathedralAndTheBazaar</a>" but for some reason I didn't
        remember the attribution. I just looked again and
        Raymond does call it Conway's Law in an end-note.

        He also gives another version: "If you have four
        groups working on a compiler, you'll get a 4-pass
        compiler."

        The question I was trying to answer at the time was
        this: Should everyone in the company have collective
        ownership over all the code in the company?
      </p>

        We weren't doing XP anyway; we were just started to be
        influenced by XP ideas. Now I expect if we had
        been really doing XP we would have been able to handle the whole system
        without breaking down the teams. As it was I was getting
        frustrated with others coming in and making changes to the
        code my team was responsible for without following our
        coding conventions or pairing with us.

        <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a> commented in another message on the XP
        mailing list that he'd seen an XP team that worked fine with
        dozens of people, and even tried to split into multiple
        teams and didn't like it. And he said he's seen other teams
        that just couldn't handle being larger. So it's all about
        the people, as XP always stresses...
