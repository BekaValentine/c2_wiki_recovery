        Model Loading
      </h1>
      <p>
        Model Loading is a problem mainly of file loading, and should be a simple problem to solve, and it is.  The hard part is getting the specs FOR the various file formats.  OBJ is a good example.  It is a very simple file format, but every application that exports it, does it differently, and each in their own way.  Here is the basic format:
      </p>
      <p>
        OBJ files are textual, and are line based.  Each line can have one of several commands:
      </p>
      <p>
        v - vertex command
        vn - normal command
        vt - texture command
        f - face command
      </p>
      <p>
        These are the basic ones, and the rest are really not that important for loading.  Some of these others are:
      </p>
      <p>
        usemtl - use a material defined in an external file (MAYA is the only app I know of that does this properly, as it's Wavefront's file format)
        g - Group command
        # - Comment command
      </p>
      <p>
        Vertex commands are the 'v' followed by a whitespace delimited list of coordinates
        Normal commands are the 'vn' followed by three whitespace delimited coordinates
        Textures are 'vt' and followed by two.
      </p>
      <p>
        Face structure commands have two types, with '/'-es and without.  With, it looks something like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        f 1/2/3 4/5/6 ... for as many vertices that the polygon has.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, since this is a textual format, any number can be skipped, resulting in a form more like:
      </p>
      <p>
        f 1//3 or f 5/4/
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes it will even skip the '/'-es all together and just have vertices:
      </p>
      <p>
        f 1 4 7
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Since <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a> is fastest with triangles, it is a good idea to outline a simple way of turning a convex polygon (where any line will only pass through the sides at most twice, so, a square, rectangle, or regular polygon, but not a heart, ocean outline, or some such thing with protrusions) into triangles.  This is fairly simple, pick a vertex, and draw lines to all other vertices of the polygon.  This divides it into the minimum number of triangles possible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note: Since OBJ only allows convex polygons, this method should be fine.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        If someone wishes to write a method of NonConvexPolygonTesselation, then that would be helpful.
