        Back Ticks
      </h1>
      <p>
        Commands wrapped within <a href="BackTicks.html">BackTicks</a> have their output turned into a scalar and returned.  This allows programmers to capture the output of a command for later use.  This construct is found in many <a href="UnixShell.html">UnixShell</a>s and in some programming languages such as <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>, and <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:  Putting the current year in a variable (for /bin/sh compatible shells)
      </p>
      <code>
        year=`date +%Y`<br/>
        echo $year<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If the current year were 2004, this would output (surprise) "2004".
      </p>

        Also a good reason to practice PairTickInspection. Back ticks are often difficult to identify and remove when inspecting alone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Backticks can represent a serious security hazard if unvalidated text is executed (such as from a web page). Someone nasty could then get your CGI script to execute <strong>rm -r </strong> or worse.

      <p>
        In <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, <a href="BackTicks.html">BackTicks</a> are used as a quick and dirty way to inspect an object. Compare
      </p>
      <code>
        print thing<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which calls thing's __str__ method (it prints the result of str(thing)), with
      </p>
      <code>
        print `thing`<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which calls thing's __repr__ method (it prints the result of repr(thing)). (These are equivalent to comparing the outputs from an object's to_s and inspect methods in <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>, or the outputs from Ruby's puts and p.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that backticks are deprecated and have been removed in Python 3. They should be replaced with a direct call to the repr() function instead.

        I used to use <a href="BackTicks.html">BackTicks</a>. When i started my most recent job, i was mocked for not writing
      </p>
      <code>
        $(expr)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        instead. Now i am all about the $(). Dollar for the win. Comply.

        In <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a>, you can use a regular function as an infix operator by surrounding the function name with <a href="BackTicks.html">BackTicks</a>.
