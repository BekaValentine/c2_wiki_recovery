        Well, if you're playing Helsinki Rules...
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Mornington Crescent station (Northern Line, Charing Cross branch) is now reopened. Rejoice, rejoice! 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="MorningtonCrescent.html">MorningtonCrescent</a> ("a lifetime to learn, a minute to master") is a strategy game played on "I'm Sorry I Haven't A Clue", a quiz program on BBC Radio 4, in the <a href="UnitedKingdom.html">UnitedKingdom</a>. (The well aspirated ImSorryIhHaventAhClue links to the relevant <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The basic premise is that players take turns to move around the London underground map, moving from one station to another each turn. The winner is the first to reach Mornington Crescent (a station on the Northern Line).  Moves are constrained by a large number of arcane rules, and there are many different sets of rules and addenda.

        Information about the game and its history is available in the <em></em>EncyclopaediaMorningtonia<em> at </em><a href="http://www.dunx.org/white-rose/mc_em.html.">http://www.dunx.org/white-rose/mc_em.html.</a>

        I found what looks to be a few useful links for information.

        Having never played I can't say much about the value of these links.

           That's a pretty daring move, but not a winning one. Has a lot of potential, though. Since you've opened play below the diagonal I'll go with Pudding Mill Lane. -- <a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>

      <p>
        Tegwar, an acronym for The Exciting Game Without Any Rules, is a card game played in the book <em>Bang the Drum Slowly</em> by Mark Harris (also a movie). It's played primarily for the purpose of parting fools from their money, operating on the principle that the mark will be too ashamed to admit that he doesn't know the rules of the game or ask questions.

        Has anyone been known to have ever played the game live.  Like start at different underground stations and see who could make it to Mornington Crescent first?  I think that might be interesting...  or perhaps give a set of checkpoints that teams have to reach and see who can reach them first.  Of course this could happen in any major city's subway system and I think it's quite a funny idea.  -- <a href="ChuckSmith.html">ChuckSmith</a>

        I can recommend the MorningtonCrescentDrinkingGame, involving a map of the London Underground, a pin, and the nearest pubs to each station.

        Related game: I once heard that people with a very strong constitution played the following game on in the buffet car on fast trains from London to Portsmouth.  The game is to have a round of drinks as the train passed each station with a name starting with a W (Waterloo, Wimbledon, Walton-on-Thames, Weybridge, West Byfleet, Woking and Worplesdon). 5 of those all come close together. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
