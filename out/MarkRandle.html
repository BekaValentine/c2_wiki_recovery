        Describe <a href="MarkRandle.html">MarkRandle</a> here. Happy to be on the planet for the moment soaking all in the stew of information misinformation and knowing that a shift has already occurred that the way we communicate has changed at least until the clock resets by a big rock rolling over us and tipping the ship wondering what this paradigm (used to be a good word)fnord engenders if anything other than a temporary push toward godness followed by a long lazy spiral through the cosmos blissful omniscience desires nothing has no need to interact or control sits on zafu of trillion stars.
