        I added this <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a> to a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> that I earlier considered a <a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a> because it seemed to lack content. It looked like noise and <a href="MakeSignalNotNoise.html">MakeSignalNotNoise</a>. I didn't delete it, but flagged it for deletion consideration. The author of that page pledged for reconsideration, but I still didn't understand that page, so I said so. That may have been OK, but it may still have discouraged other <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>s from contributing to it simply by this distracting MetaDiscussion.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this reason, I will tentatively use <a href="StrangePage.html">StrangePage</a> as a marker for potential signal. It may or may not be replaced with <a href="DeletionCandidate.html">DeletionCandidate</a> (or the page be deleted outright) later as needed (see <a href="DeleteWhenCooked.html">DeleteWhenCooked</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        This tag is not intended for pages that are clearly tests or noise or funny in general.
