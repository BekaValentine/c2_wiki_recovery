        Men Downa Hole

      <p>
        A saying currently favoured by my boss is "How many men can we fit down this hole?".
        He's not referring to us as <a href="SoftwareLabourers.html">SoftwareLabourers</a> (um, I don't think) but instead the number of people who can work on a subsystem without getting in each other's way ("digging under each other's feet").
      </p>
      <p>
        For sure this idea will be elsewhere on the wiki .. DividingTheWork, SharingTasks ...? There is <a href="ProgrammingTeamSize.html">ProgrammingTeamSize</a>. The XP way seems to be for programmer to agree among themselves (I need to read all that again).
      </p>
      <p>
        Compare <a href="BusTest.html">BusTest</a> or <a href="TruckNumber.html">TruckNumber</a> (for when one man has by himself dug a hole so deep nobody else will go near it). Compare also <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, I suppose - but this is only to regard the "man" as a fermion with spin half, therefore two fit in one space.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The book, </em><a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a>, says that tasks must be "partitionable" for more people to help.  "Producing a baby." is a nine month project, and it's not partitionable.<em>   Is it partuitionable?</em>
      </p>

        How should I organise this? It's not a pattern, just a saying that illuminates a way of thinking. I'll be back for some gnoming if there's interest. -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>
