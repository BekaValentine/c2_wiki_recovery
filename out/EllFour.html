        <em>"Kernels based on the L4 </em><a href="ApplicationProgrammingInterface.html">ApplicationProgrammingInterface</a> are second-generation microkernels. They are very lean and feature fast, message-based, synchronous <a href="InterProcessCommunication.html">InterProcessCommunication</a>, simple-to-use external paging mechanisms, and a security mechanism based on secure domains (tasks, clans and chiefs). The kernels try to implement only a minimal set of abstractions on which <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>s can be built flexibly."<em></em>

        The L4 API consists of only seven system calls.

        The best example I've seen of a <em>true</em> <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a> is the L4 microkernel (whose main author has unfortunately passed away). They ported Linux to run on top of this kernel (L4/Linux) and there is a rewrite-in-C++ project going on, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        L4 has only three abstractions (or two, depending on how you count). It has only 7 API functions! A far cry from Windows with its HAL, or the <a href="MachMicrokernel.html">MachMicrokernel</a>, or even normal Linux. :)

        <em>I actually think the 'big idea' of microkernels is that the system's kernel should contain only the concepts, and the functionality, which *absolutely must* be in the kernel in order to build a secure, high-performance system. Many first-generation microkernels like Mach include a lot of stuff in the microkernel which doesn't strictly need to be there. Microkernels like L4 are much closer to this ideal, and perform much better as a result. L4 includes almost nothing besides threads, address-space construction and IPC. Everything else can be built efficiently out of these in user-mode servers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Here are some research papers from 1997 about L4 and the design of efficient microkernels:</em>

        <em>Smallness (and fastness) have been achieved in some modern microkernels like L4. The failure of Mach and other first-generation microkernels is not due to a fundamental flaw in the microkernel idea. The flaws were implementation-specific. They were large and complicated and that's why they were slow.</em>

        <em>Why do microkernels matter? Because a properly-designed microkernel system can be as fast as a monolithic kernel, and yet provide significantly more safety and flexibility. -- </em><a href="WylieGarvin.html">WylieGarvin</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Fallacy! See <a href="WellDesignedFooCanBeBetterThanBar.html">WellDesignedFooCanBeBetterThanBar</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is true that the reason given (a properly-designed microkernel system can be as fast as a monolithic kernel, and yet provide significantly more safety and flexibility) does not support the case (microkernels matter), but it is still true that </em><a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a>s matter.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would suggest that </em><a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a>s matter because they can be smaller, more targeted, more flexible, easier to verify, and allow modules to be interchanged more readily, possibly even while the system is live.<em></em>

        [This discussion should probably be moved to the <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a> page.] <em>Move specific discussion about L4 to a general page on </em><a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a>? Makes as much sense as moving C++ or Lisp or Smalltalk discussions to a <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> page.<em> -- </em><a href="AnonymousOnPurpose.html">AnonymousOnPurpose</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        [The last part of this page seems to be discussing <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a>s in general, not L4 specifically. Parts of the page should be back there. -- <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>, considering doing the move if no one else does.]
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is that the topic is not relevant to <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a>s, but to SecondGenerationMicroKernels.  If a refactoring should be done, it should go there, since it's conceptually possible that L4 isn't the only 2nd-generation kernel.  --SamuelFalvo
