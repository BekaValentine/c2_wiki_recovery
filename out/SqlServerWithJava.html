        Sql Server With Java
      </h1>
      <p>
        The only way to connect to <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> 6.5 with Java is to pay for a commercial driver, or suffer through the idiosyncracies of the <a href="JdbcOdbcBridge.html">JdbcOdbcBridge</a> with the <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> ODBC driver.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some tips:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A field must be explicitly set to null using the <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a>.setNull() method - <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a>.setObject(null) fails
        </li>
        <li>
          The TEXT datatype is not handled under JDK 1.3.0, but it is under JDK 1.3.1
        </li>
      </ul>

        There is BETA JDBC driver for MSSQL Server
        <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/779/msdncompositedoc.xml&frame=true">http://msdn.microsoft.com/downloads/sample.asp?url=/msdn-files/027/001/779/msdncompositedoc.xml&frame=true</a>
      </p>

        <em>Sadly only SQL Server 2000 is supported by the JDBC driver. Not much use if you are forced to remain on 6.5 thanks to a product that supports no higher version since the company who makes it went belly-up</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Microsoft has free software that's only useful if you upgrade to the latest and "greatest" version of their for-pay product?  After the competing company has gone out of business?  Wow, who would have seen that coming? What a stunner. Wow.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And if they hadn't produced a JDBC driver for their main database product, I bet someone would have said  that was typical MS behaviour in preventing people from using Java on MS systems. They can't win, can they?</em>

        <a href="http://jtds.sourceforge.net">http://jtds.sourceforge.net</a> has a free TDS driver, supporting both Sybase and <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a>.

        We use inet's opta drivers for <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> 7: <a href="http://www.inetsoftware.de/English/Produkte/OPTA/,">http://www.inetsoftware.de/English/Produkte/OPTA/,</a> and have had no problems. It's not free, but it's actively supported and they release bug fixes at least monthly. We've also used BEA's jDriver: <a href="http://www.bea.com/products/weblogic/drivers.shtml,">http://www.bea.com/products/weblogic/drivers.shtml,</a> but it didn't play nice with ATG's Portal product: <a href="http://www.atg.com/en/products/portalsuite/.">http://www.atg.com/en/products/portalsuite/.</a> Can't remember what the exact issue was.

        I have used <a href="NewAtlanta.html">NewAtlanta</a>'s JTurbo driver, but have later migrated to the now released Microsoft driver.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had minor problems with the JTurbo driver regarding it's misreporting of null wide character columns.
      </p>
      <p>
        And the beta version of the MS driver borked at wide character columns greater than about 250 characters long.
      </p>
      <p>
        The main advantage of the MS driver if you are using 2000 is the fact that it is free (well, you did just pay for the database after all!)
