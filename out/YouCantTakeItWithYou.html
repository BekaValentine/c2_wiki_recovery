        A play in 2 acts, written by Moss Hart and first performed in 1936.
      </p>
      <p>
        The play takes many swings at an established notion of that era (which we have, of course, long outgrown), that the path to righteousness is labor, and is doing that which you don't want to do.

        In the middle of the Great Depression, an impromptu commune arises in an upper-middle class house. The commune writes bad plays, goofs off with a printing press, assembles fireworks as a hobby, and generally pisses off the local goodie-goodies.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the goodie-goodies inevitably storm the house (discovering "bombs" and "red literature" and such), they give the standard speech "What if everyone just goofed off all the time?"

        The answer is to think locally and act locally. There will always be people who want to administrate interstate commerce, grow mushrooms, wait on tables. If you are not having fun, you are not doing anyone any good.
