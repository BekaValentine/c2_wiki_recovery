        I can't easily handle all of the additional candidate jobs that people send me.  Most of these are outside my area of expertise (I don't know a whole lot about replacing keyboards and, quite honestly, I don't want to).  While I could dismiss the help, that comes across as ungrateful and I certainly am grateful for their help.  I simply prioritize those suggestions lower than the more appropriate jobs that I come up with myself.

        In many ways, this <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> is the opposite of <a href="TooManyFilters.html">TooManyFilters</a>.
