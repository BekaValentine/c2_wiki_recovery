        Nokia Series Sixty
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Nokia Series-60 platform is a specialized form of <a href="SymbianOs.html">SymbianOs</a>, with a user interface suitable for <a href="SmartPhone.html">SmartPhone</a>s. The first phone using it, the Nokia 7650 camera-phone, is now on the market (June 2002).
      </p>
      <p>
        Series-60 phones have a (typically colour) screen resolution of 176x208, and are one-hand-operated (i.e. they have a phone-style keypad and no pen input).
      </p>
      <p>
        The Java supported for Series-60 is MIDP (<a href="MobileInformationDeviceProfile.html">MobileInformationDeviceProfile</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Matsushita (i.e. Panasonic), another <a href="SymbianOs.html">SymbianOs</a> partner, have announced that they are trialling the Series-60 platform. Siemens have also announced (May 2002) that they will use Series-60 and work with Nokia to develop it further.

        [Please note that Symbian is now a dead OS line. Nokia have entered into an agreement with Microsoft, and Windows Phone will eventually replace Symbian completely. Oh, well. Scratch one.]
