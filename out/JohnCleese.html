        John Cleese
      </h1>
      <p>
        Writer and actor, best known for his involvement with <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a>, <a href="FawltyTowers.html">FawltyTowers</a>, and A Fish Called Wanda.

        His father changed the family name from Cheese to Cleese before joining the Army in 1915. He could deal with the bullets of the enemy, but not the jibes from his fellows. So John's name actually is CLEESE, not CHEESE.

        <em>He's just been in the Florentine Room and smeared tomato ketchup all over Raphael's Baby Jesus.</em>
        And from this point, things can only get better.
