        Inbred Fields
      </h1>
      <p>
        When a field becomes detached from reality, society, the sciences, other arts, it becomes entirely self-referential.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="PoMo.html">PoMo</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Modern Art
        </li>
        <li>
           Postmodern architecture
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And software isn't immute to this effect either,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           XML
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any more?
      </p>
      <p>
        What causes inbreeding anyways? What can be done to prevent it? Stop it? Reverse it?
      </p>

        <em>I think the key is 'entirely self-referential'. Because every sufficiently advanced field becomes more or less self-referential earlier or later. This is due to the lifting of external references to self-standing definitions (in math, we have the extreme: axioms). In math, at least other fields refer to it and so establish a flow of 'use'. But if a field is neither used nor uses other field, it is really inbred. But I wouldn't claim that necessarily for the above fields in this extreme form. A better example might be pseudo-science.</em>
