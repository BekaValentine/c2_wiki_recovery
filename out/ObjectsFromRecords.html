        Objects From Records
      </h1>
      <p>
        In PLoPD'94 Proceedings (ed. Schmidt & Coplien),  
        <a href="ChamondLiu.html">ChamondLiu</a> and <a href="KirkWolf.html">KirkWolf</a> 
        cite a pattern called Objects from Records where data access
        responsibility is transferred from the Domain (business) object to a
        Record Class. We're an insurance company with a large amount of
        relational (DB2 and Sybase) data we need to access and update. Does
        anyone have any thoughts, experience, feedback on using this approach
        or examples?  Among the general questions that come to mind are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How do you sync Object attributes to Record attributes to RDBMS column content?
        </li>
        <li>
           Can your RDBMS structure be totally distinct from the Object model structure?
        </li>
        <li>
           Where should business logic be stored? (Domain Object, Record Object RDBMS row?
        </li>
        <li>
           Should the wrapper or RDBMS methods be in Record Class(es) or separate?
        </li>
        <li>
           Is interclass messaging an issue?
        </li>
        <li>
           Are there are other patterns or combinations that would address this "impedance" mismatch between Objects and Relational Modes?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Any  help/comments greatly appreciated.

        You may not want to reinvent this wheel.
        There is a commercial product that helps to connect C++ and relational DBs.
        The company is Persistence, San Mateo, CA, (415) 341 7733 & 341 1280, ask
        for Paul.
        No, I am not a stock holder or the like.

      </p>
      <p>
        In the work I've done, the domain objects had a status field that tracked 
        their state vis-a-vis the RDBMS, eg:
      </p>
      <code>
        created	 -- new object<br/>
        clean		-- matches database<br/>
        dirty		-- existing object that has been changed<br/>
        condemned	-- object slated for deletion<br/>
        deleted	 -- object that has been deleted from the database<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        We also used a special "key only" status that handled objects that were 
        known by reference but not yet read in.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can your RDBMS structure be totally distinct from the Object model structure?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No.  They are different ways of expressing the same concepts.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where should business logic be stored? (Domain Object, Record Object RDBMS row?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had the best luck with keeping it in the domain objects--database 
        triggers are also useful but they have shortcomings, since you need to keep 
        the model in memory consistent with the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Should the wrapper or RDBMS methods be in Record Class(es) or separate?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always put them in record classes, but we also had an in-between layer 
        that was responsible for mapping the domain objects into the record classes 
        and vice versa.  The domain objects defined a minimal abstract interface for 
        this layer and connected to it via a static class reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is interclass messaging an issue?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Never had problem with it.
        Persistence is quite good.  The only headache with it is that it the code 
        inserted into the domain objects to support the interface to their database 
        layer is quite complex and deeply embedded into the objects it generates.  
        As long as you are planning on staying with platforms it supports (quite a 
        few, but no DB2 the last time I checked), this isn't a problem.  
      </p>

        It is *definitely* a big productivity enhancer.

        There are 2 aspects to this problem: technical and business model. I agree
        with the several thoughts about products which map a table to an object.
        Those may be used to manage the technical. Some of your questions (below)
        are business model and methodology issues. I'll address a few of these from
        the perspective of Object-Oriented Business Engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can your RDBMS structure be totally distinct from the Object model structure?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. The mapping can be [business object:table] 1:1, 1:n, n:1 or n:n... this
        is a function of the respective business model and legacy data structures.
        On the other hand, there's the tech capability issue... does the "lense"
        product selected to link the object and relation allow this... some do, some
        don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where should business logic be stored? (Domain Object, Record Object RDBMS row?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Business object, most likely in the Operational model level specializations
        (as opposed to the Enterprise model generalizations).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Should the wrapper or RDBMS methods be in Record Class(es) or separate?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The term wrapper could be applied at several levels. In general, the
        products which provide SQL access are wrapping the DBMS. There's another
        issue of wrapping those classes to make a record object look like a screen
        scraped object... i.e. it's all storage at that level, and the business
        object just knows to talk with a general storage capability.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Is interclass messaging an issue?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        At what level... technical or business object? Business object... yes,
        because they interact in the course of performing business processes.
        Technical, perhaps... but I need to better understand the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Are there are other patterns or combinations that would address this "impedance" mismatch between Objects and Relational Modes?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is not really an impedance mismatch between objects and relations in a
        business application environment. If you think of the RDBMS as an instance
        storage mechanism, and the record/wrapper class as a mechanism to provide an
        object/messaging interface, the RDBMS is just one more store. The record
        class sends a particular variety of message to the RDBMS interface, which
        lacks some of the usual OOP character but still...

        I have a different perspective on this than many of the other 
        responders.  As I have written in chapter 4 of my book (citing below)
        it is sometimes beneficial to separate the object model from the
        mechanisms that are used to store the data.  The object model
        encapsulates *business policies*.  The database provides *storage
        mechanisms*.  These two concerns are extremely different, and often
        ought to be separated.
      </p>
      <p>
        To accomplish this I often use the 'proxy' pattern.  I provide a long
        example in Chapter 4 of my book.  The main idea is to create an
        abstract class for each object that needs to be stored in the
        database.  One derivative of this class implements the business
        policies (call this class the 'object model').  Another derivative
        operates the DBMS, creates the business object, and delegates method
        invocations to it (I call this class the 'surrogate').

        <em>I am compelled to disagree here. </em><a href="DatabasesAreMoreThanJustStorage.html">DatabasesAreMoreThanJustStorage</a>. Sure, you can use them or perceive them as being merely "for storage", but then you'd be ignoring a powerful tool and probably reinventing the wheel. The issue seems to be that object proponents want to stay with an OOP view of the world and thus want the RDBMS to be merely a dumb filing system that serves objects. Doing so has a cost. -top.<em></em>

        These two issues are really the same thing: the management of
        concurrent 
        update.  
      </p>
      <p>
        My understanding is that transaction management is not directly 
        related to concurrent access, though concurrent access makes transaction 
        management more difficult.  
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a need for transaction management in 
        every application.  Transactions (or work units) must be completely carried 
        out or not at all.  That said, my question remains: How should model 
        transactions be mapped to RDB transactions?
      </p>
      <p>
        In my opinion, it is a 
        responsibility of the object model to
        understand that it can be updated 
        concurrently, and that transactions
        need to be managed.  However, the object 
        model should not know about
        the transaction mechanisms employed by the DBMS; 
        instead, the
        surrogates should perform the necessary translations.
      </p>
      <p>
        I 
        certainly agree with your point of view. It is a statement of policy.  
        Nevertheless I'm searching for specific answers to the above questions.  Not 
        the "what", but the "how".  I can see the importance of managing concurrent 
        access from inside the mapping layer in a transparent way, but it seems 
        difficult.  Both a "lock on load" and a IPC scheme have serious drawbacks.

        While not expressed in pattern terms, there is an interesting intersection
        between Sr. Aqez (Anez?) recent posting in this group relative to transaction
        responsibility and a discussion I have been involved with elsewhere about
        general strategies of program system architecture for developing applications
        with an eye to distributed, N-tier deployment.  The context there is an OO4GL,
        but it seems that the principles should remain invariant.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In that discussion, some principles have emerged (I wish I could report
        consensus, but I suppose that is asking too much) which are based more on
        wrestling with the empirical necessities of the situation, but which serve
        as reminders of essential principles which we have all read before, but which
        sometimes get lost in haggling over detail and form.  In particular, one of
        these relates to keeping clear that the "transaction" as a property of the
        business rules is a property of the object which governs business logic and
        must be clearly distinquished from the operation of the data objects which it
        supervises and their interface to the databases with their physical transaction
        properties.  Since the design goal in this case includes having data objects
        which articulate with databases from multiple manufacturers, the details of
        the physical transaction controls will vary from object to object, but this
        matters not at all to the controlling business logic object as long as it 
        has the ability to commit or undo a controlled set of work.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a similar vein, there is an agreement between the user interface and logic
        objects as to what constitutes the contents of an exchange, but the unit 
        content of this exchange need have no fixed relationship to the units of
        exchange between the logic object and the data objects.  I.e., the UI object
        operates in terms of a user view which needs to map onto a data structure, 
        but the UI object need have no awareness of that structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        In that exchange, the key element to me whenever it became unclear how
        two components should interact has been to step back and ask what it is 
        that constitutes the actual exchange or work.  Often, in thinking about 
        simple cases, it is tempting to muddy this essential interface because it
        seems like it is easier to get the job done if one is less "pure" about the
        connection, but looking at more complex cases makes it clear that living 
        the pure life is clearly the better approach.

        Agreed. As an extension of that concept, our policy managers (the term I use
        for what you call a business logic object - because it is a "manager" object
        that encapsulates business policy) can invoke the services of "sub policy
        managers" for complex transactions that actually involve more than one
        business policy. An axample is for entering an order, determining the tax
        might be done by a taxation policy manager, and calculating the discount
        might be done by the discount policy manager. The attempt here is to
        encapsulate a specific business policy. The intent (of course) is to limit
        the impact of changes to that policy.
