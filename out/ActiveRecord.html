        Often one uses a database browser, such as Toad, to create and test queries. It may even be a DBA. If one then has to take these and convert them into an OOP notation, one is both wasting time on translation, risking translating it wrong, and making it harder to do the reverse: put the query back into the DB browser to change and analyze it or convert it into a Stored Procedure. It's the Double Shuffle.
      </p>
      <p>
        For new, clean databases, it may not make much difference, but for databases that have been around a while and have built up historical oddities, it can be important to work with them in a DB browser.
