        Q: 2005-11-14: There are currently just 10 pages turned up in a search for this category (<a href="CategoryCard.html">CategoryCard</a>), including this page. Is it worth having? Or is it categories gone mad? Answers on a postcard ...  Why bother with the category when they are all <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a> to each other? Delete away.
      </p>
      <p>
        A: 2008-05-20: <em>There apparently are more people who value the category system and who do not see the addition of just a dozen or so characters at the bottom of a page as useless.  Since some people use this system, as well as other classification systems devised by the appropriate use of </em>WikiWords, One should not destroy their <strong>option</strong> of using it.<em></em>

        <a href="DeleteThisPageSomeTime.html">DeleteThisPageSomeTime</a> - content free and no meaningful backlinks 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Since we have morped to a wiki where people rarely use their </em><a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>s via the User Cookie or by signing their posts, there will be few backlinks to <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>s.<em></em>
