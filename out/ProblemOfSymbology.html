        Problem Of Symbology

        Symbology: "The art of expression by symbols" 
      </p>
      <p>
        Art? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, there is no "one right way" to express something, so we (try to) pick one that is aesthetically pleasing.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Start with notation.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Algebraic or <a href="InfixNotation.html">InfixNotation</a>: (12 + 6) * 5
        </li>
        <li>
           Prefix or <a href="PolishNotation.html">PolishNotation</a>: * 5 + 6 12
        </li>
        <li>
           RPN (<a href="ReversePolishNotation.html">ReversePolishNotation</a>): 12 6 + 5 *
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Polish notation and RPN are mirror images of each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        The symbols "(", ")", "+", "*", "12", " ", "6", "5" tell us what to do in what order.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Only because the order is ambiguous in algebraic notation.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Then there's (a + b) * c or +*abc (no spaces needed) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then +*vectorAvectorBspeed 
      </p>
      <p>
        All the detail necessary, not a wasted symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        But it doesn't look good to me - it's not esthetic, not .. artistic. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I prefer (VectorA + VectorB) * Speed
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Are you sure that isn't because you learned algebraic notation in high school? If you'd learned polish notation from the start, I bet it would look more artistic to you. Talk to some long time Lispers and old HP calculator users.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>[In the first example, of "(12 + 6) * 5", I prefer "12 <enter> 6 + 5 *". I learned algebraic notation in high school, am a long-time Smalltalker, and </em>'always<em>' preferred HP calculators (from my very first HP-35 in 1972).]</em>
      </p>

        I agree that a notation one is not familiar with will seem "weird", no matter how superior it is to the one you are familiar with. -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>

        <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>, <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>, <a href="HewlettPackard.html">HewlettPackard</a> calculators, 8087 assembly, etc., all use <a href="ReversePolishNotation.html">ReversePolishNotation</a> (RPN), named in honor of the brilliant Polish philosopher and mathematician Jan Lucasiewicz (<a href="ObscureGreatFoobars.html">ObscureGreatFoobars</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Lisp uses prefix <a href="PolishNotation.html">PolishNotation</a>, with the operator preceding the operands, e.g. (* 3 (+ 4 7)).

      <p>
        Inside a compiler, an algebraic expression is often represented in a tree structure.
        Printing that tree with suffix traversal gives you <a href="PostfixNotation.html">PostfixNotation</a> (RPN).
        Printing that tree with prefix traversal gives you <a href="PolishNotation.html">PolishNotation</a>.
        Printing that tree with infix traversal gives you traditional arithmetic notation.
