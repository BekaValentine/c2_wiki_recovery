        Embedded Document
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <em>embedded document</em> is when one document (often a structured text file, or a binary, or anything else) is embedded within another.  (This discussion assumes that the result is a linear sequence of bytes/characters--use of more advanced filing systems is beyond the scope of this discussion).  A common instance of this found in programming occurs when mixing programming languages--embedding a Perl script or sed script inside a shell script; embedding HTML inside a C program; etc.  For purposes of this discussion, we limit ourselves to the case where the enclosing document is a text-based programming language or <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> which will be hand-edited; binary embedding is a different topic altogether.
      </p>
      <p>
        The general problems are as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Determining the span of the embedded text.  For machine-generated files, the obvious solution is to store the <em>length</em> of the embedded text; this is what programs such as the Unix archive utility (ar) do.  For human-edited files; this is impractical.  Other solutions must be derived.
        </li>
        <li>
           The embedded text may not obey the formatting requirements of the host language; the obvious example is embedding C or Java code in HTML or XML.  Both <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> are replate with the characters < and &, which are special to both HTML (<a href="HyperTextMarkupLanguage.html">HyperTextMarkupLanguage</a>) and XML (<a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a>) or any other SGML (<a href="StandardGeneralizedMarkupLanguage.html">StandardGeneralizedMarkupLanguage</a>) derivative.  Either processing of < and & must be disabled (which is so in an XML CDATA section), or the special characters or character sequences must be quoted--in this case one uses &lt and &amp.  (Which, if you're editing the enclosed file, looks real <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a>).
        </li>
        <li>
           Often, it may be desirable to "unquote" portions of the document (and embed snippets of the host language within the quoted document).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Several ways to do this are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Length encoding, mentioned above.  Not appropriate for human edited documents, for obvious reasons. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HereDocument.html">HereDocument</a>s.  Commonly used, seem to work well in practice.  Occasionally, you run into a "gotcha" where the enclosed document contains an unquoted terminating sequence and all heck breaks loose.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of separate files -- XML (<a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a>) requires this for embedding binary files (anything that might contain null characters or other XML-verboten stuff).  The enclosing document specifies a filename or UniversalResourceIndicator, the tool processing the file is expected to go find it and read in in if needed.  Can be a major problem if the pointed-to document wasn't copied along with the enclosing document, or some search path isn't configured correctly, or if you don't have a filesystem available, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of a CommonSubstrate.  Documents in one XML application have no problems embedding other XML documents (even in a different XML application); as XML is designed to mix and match formats in this way.  This doesn't help, of course, if you are trying to embed a legacy format that doesn't use the common substrate.  <a href="EssExpression.html">EssExpression</a>s are another popular CommonSubstrate.  Use of a CommonSubstrate isn't always appropriate when the substrate defies the textual conventions of a particular application area.
        </li>
      </ul>
