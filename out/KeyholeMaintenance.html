      <p>
        The systematic practice of <a href="MakeTheSmallestChangeThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">MakeTheSmallestChangeThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> to achieve one's objectives with a code base, without stopping to so much as <a href="RefactorLowHangingFruit.html">RefactorLowHangingFruit</a>, let alone <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>.

        This phenomenon has several common causes, but they are all usually rooted in the culture and process TheManagement choose to promote.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Constant pressure to JustMakeItWork and then ForgetIt: essentially untempered <a href="FutureDiscounting.html">FutureDiscounting</a>.

           <a href="InternalQuality.html">InternalQuality</a> doesn't sell the product, therefore it has net negative <a href="BusinessValue.html">BusinessValue</a> because people spend time improving it.

           A shortage of people with both <a href="DomainKnowledge.html">DomainKnowledge</a> and familiarity with enough of the system.  This can be due to too many people that <a href="JustLeave.html">JustLeave</a>, hiring too many junior people because they're cheap headcount, or someone playing <a href="FungibleTeams.html">FungibleTeams</a> or <a href="PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers.html">PlugCompatibleInterchangeableEngineers</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Insufficient resources devoted to testing, whether <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s or even plain old <a href="TestingByPokingAround.html">TestingByPokingAround</a>.  Typically there are only enough resources allocated for a single round of <a href="BigBangTesting.html">BigBangTesting</a> and frenetic <a href="CodeAndFix.html">CodeAndFix</a> just before the software ships.

      </ul>
      <p>
        One of the most damaging types of <a href="KeyholeMaintenance.html">KeyholeMaintenance</a> is expedient coupling of different parts of the system -- enough of this and eventually the modularization succumbs to the <a href="PlayDohPrinciple.html">PlayDohPrinciple</a> and you're left with a <a href="BigBallOfMud.html">BigBallOfMud</a>.
