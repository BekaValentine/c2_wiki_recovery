        Software Component

      <p>
        An executable file which exposes an interface. By using this interface,
        another executable can use its services without seeing its source code.

        Why does it have to be a file?  Why can't you think of a web server that
        provides a SOAP interface as being a software component?  What if it is
        something stored in a database, one file that contains many components?
        What about downloading a Java component over the internet, which might
        be a file on the other machine but you don't really know for sure?

        <em>There is a web server which provides a SOAP service. When a SOAP request arrives, it</em>
        sends me an email. Then, I type a reply in SOAP protocol, the web server gets
        my reply and sends it to the requester. So, am I a <a href="SoftwareComponent.html">SoftwareComponent</a>?<em></em>

      <p>
        And how is this different from a Program? Based on your definition I can't
        find any sentence in which "Software Component" cannot be interchanged
        with "Program".

        <em>A program is a software component which has an interface that provides an entry-point (like main() in </em><a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>)<em></em>
