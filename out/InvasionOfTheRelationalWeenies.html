        Invasion Of The Relational Weenies
      </h1>
      <p>
        This wiki is becoming infested with comments from <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s. I can't stand it any more! Their convoluted logic is just too wacky to fight. I don't know what to do. Should we declare wiki an OO-only-zone and boot them and their content out of the place? I wish <a href="DrCodd.html">DrCodd</a> was never born. He created an evil cult.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's starting to remind me of comp.object, where every posting about objects(!) triggers a flood of posts about tables and relations.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think it's great to finally get the relational perspective well-represented in Wiki. As long as the edits are not destructive (<a href="DisagreeByDeleting.html">DisagreeByDeleting</a>, trolling, <a href="IntellectualDishonesty.html">IntellectualDishonesty</a>, <a href="AdHominem.html">AdHominem</a>, etc.), then they are <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> and good. Of course, in the short term, it may look like an invasion, but in the long term, Wiki will have much more balanced content. That's the difference between Wiki and a newsgroup. Keep refactoring, keep the <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> polite, keep the exploration going, and Wiki will keep being Wiki. Sure it's not easy, but how many worthwhile things really are? -- an <a href="ObjectWeenie.html">ObjectWeenie</a>

      <p>
        <em>I don't think anybody's objecting to the relational perspective being represented here, but there is a question of appropriateness. More than once I've come upon a relation-centric comment and asked myself "What exactly does that have to do with this page?" It leaves you with the feeling that the people involved are interested in only tubthumping for their own agendas, regardless of whether or not those issues actually belong to the page in question. I'm half expecting somebody to post on </em><a href="QualityWithoutaName.html">QualityWithoutaName</a> about whether or not QWAN is biased towards OO or not. -- francis<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps cajole the author to reveal in more detail <strong>why</strong> they think there is a connection. Just because you may not see a topic connection does not mean that there is none. Both parties might learn something if the topic connection is explored deeper. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That is a matter of the relational perspective being mostly newcomers to Wiki, and stomping loudly without realizing that they don't need to (and that it's not much appreciated). Blame <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> culture, and try to open up a dialogue about contributing to Wiki. It would be nice if the <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s revealed their names so we could discuss this with them on their <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>s, but in the absence of home pages, we could leave comments on the <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a> page. Or heck, this is a good page to hold such discussion. Are there any relational proponents who would like to comment?

        What is their motivation?  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Second-guessing motivations is playing with </em><a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a> dynamite in my opinion. Focus on herding content, not motivations.<em></em>
      </p>
      <dl>

        <dd>I have no interest in herding content.  I do not understand their motivations so I'm curious.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Do they think there are a large number of <a href="ObjectWeenie.html">ObjectWeenie</a>s who don't know about RDBMSs and query languages waiting to be enlightened?  Do they imagine we can use SQL as a programming language?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As a </em><a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>, I find it strange that people would rather reinvent stuff in OO code that the DB could readily take care of for them, simplifying the code and saving work. (<a href="ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication.html">ReinventingTheDatabaseInApplication</a>) Plus, <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> has agreed that many OO'ers avoid databases because either they don't understand them, or SQL confuses them. I agree that SQL is confusing, but SQL is not the best relational can get. See <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a> and <a href="DomainLogicAndSqlArticle.html">DomainLogicAndSqlArticle</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't reinvent databases.  I use a database when I need one.  Don't change the subject.  What is your motivation for inserting pro-relational arguments throughout a wiki devoted to programming patterns?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Programming patterns/methodologies are not just OO. Any given topic often has an OO viewpoint and a functional/LISP viewpoint at least. Why not a relational viewpoint also?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        "Also" is fine.  You argue for "instead of", which is impossible.  Relational query languages are not a viable alternative to OO programming languages for the work I do.

        Why do you <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s always feel that if you could only inspect someone's stuff you could show them the errors of their ways?

        [A <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a> once stated that they did not want to reveal their real name because criticizing OOP was possibly harmful to one's career. A long debate ensued about whether a pseudonym was appropriate. In the end the pseudonym was outvoted and it was suggested that this person stay anonymous instead. Remember, this is the age of buzzword-sensitive HR departments.]
      </p>
      <p>
        And you're right - patterns can describe solutions involving relational databases just as well as they can describe solutions involving object technologies.  So if you want to take a meaningful step towards advancing your arguments, why don't you submit some patterns to <a href="http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2003/focus-enterprise.html.">http://jerry.cs.uiuc.edu/~plop/plop2003/focus-enterprise.html.</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        There is no battle. We're not saying our experience is better than yours. We use relational technologies and OO technologies. We talk about patterns that can be applied to OO code. I'm sure we'd talk about patterns that can be applied to relational queries and/or tables if you suggested some.

        Surely there are some relational patterns that aren't proprietary, even if they are used in proprietary systems.  What good is a pattern if no one can apply it?

        This above thread is just sparking more debate without actually solving anything. Forget about trying to find the faults in the other side's ideas. Focus instead on what we really want, which is a happy, healthy, constructive Wiki. Forget the argument, it is irrelevant. What is it about the relational contributions that is stirring your emotions, and why are your emotions stirred? Is it simply that you don't agree with/understand their point of view? Do you feel like they are tresspassing on your territory? Is it the style of the contributions, or maybe where and how they are placed in existing pages?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is the style of the contributions.  One of the </em><a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s mentioned above has a demonstrated history of being caustic towards other contributors on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, and denigrating towards OO thought leaders and/or their work, without provocation.<em></em>

        {Should wiki care if a given person has a heated history on <strong>other</strong> discussion forums?}
      </p>
      <p>
        Notice, that these issues have nothing to do with whether or not relational/OO is a good thing. This is irrelevant. The debate is on topic as far as <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a> is concerned. Therefore, the right thing to do is to figure out how we can have this debate without turning Wiki into <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>.

        I personally wish that these new proponents of relational technology could restrain themselves rather than fighting the same battle of attrition on every page. I also wish they would learn not to keep inventing new terms and creating new pages as it causes a walled garden effect. I'd also be happy if they could state the case for their ideas without denigrating other ideas, that way they might persuade rather than infuriate others. It might also help if <em>everyone</em> started using <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>. -- <a href="AdewaleOshineye.html">AdewaleOshineye</a>

        That's a gross misrepresentation of my contributions to wiki and it is, I believe, incorrect. Actually my position is that if OO weenies get to know their OO better (a very toll order to meet, given that the popularity of OO has literally littered the field with pseudo-scientific and pseudo-engineering amateurism ), and if they also get to a better understanding of mathematics and computing in general (by studying complementary discipline ) they will finally come to realize that among other things <a href="ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatchDoesNotExist.html">ObjectRelationalImpedanceMismatchDoesNotExist</a>.

        For further exploration of common ground, I propose that most developers would accept both of the following statements as being true:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           The relational database model is a simple, elegant, and powerful way to organize and manipulate data.
        </li>
        <li>
           Existing off-the-shelf relational database products, development tools, and the predominant query language (SQL) leave a lot to be desired in terms of realizing the benefits of the theoretical relational model.  Powerful they may be, but simplicity and elegance are missing.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It seems that the <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s focus on the first point, dismissing the second as "implementation details", whereas the relational-haters focus on the second and dismiss the first as impractical idealism.  But can each side see the other's point? -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree with those 2 points, and would add a third:</em>
      </p>
      <ol>

           <em>The behaviors provided by the theoretical relational model are only a subset of the behaviors needed by software in general.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Nobody has suggested that RDBMS carry the entire load. It is a matter of partitioning properly to get the best of <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a>.

        <em>Are there really relational haters out there?  I've met people who hate </em><a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s, and people who aren't suitably impressed by relational theory, but never anyone who actually hated the theory itself.<em></em>

      <p>
        Many OODBMS fans seem to prefer <a href="NavigationalDatabase.html">NavigationalDatabase</a>s over relational for a wider range of aplications. There is a continuum here. Some people try to let the database and data drive as much as possible, and some prefer a more code-heavy approach, with many in between. For example, some would prefer the GUI model be defined in code, others in meta-data such as XML (a navigational structure), and others would like to see it in a relational database.
