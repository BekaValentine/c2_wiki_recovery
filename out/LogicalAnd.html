        Logical And
      </h1>
      <p>
        Logical <strong>AND</strong> is a logical operation which has the following truth table:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           False AND False = False
        </li>
        <li>
           False AND True  = False
        </li>
        <li>
           True  AND False = False
        </li>
        <li>
           True  AND True  = True
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        More generally:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           AND is true only when all of its arguments are true 
        </li>
        <li>
           AND is false if any of its arguments are false.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This applies for any number of arguments to AND.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Stated another way (for C and C++ programmers, AND = &&)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           non-zero && non-zero = true
        </li>
        <li>
           zero && anything = false
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of course, in C, && is not <a href="LogicalAnd.html">LogicalAnd</a> but rather ShortCircuitAnd (the second argument is not evaluated unless the first argument is True).
      </p>

      <p>
        Logical AND is not to be confused with the BitwiseAnd operator.  BitwiseAnd operations are often used as a bit mask to clear certain bits without affecting others. For example, 00001111 AND 10101010 results in 00001010.  (This was confusing when used in Commodore BASIC, because non-programmers think "and" means "plus":  POKE 1,PEEK(1) AND 251 would clear bit 2, not add four.)

        For those of us who need to use <a href="ThreeValuedLogic.html">ThreeValuedLogic</a>, Logical <em>and</em> has the following <em>additional</em> truth values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           False and Unknown = False
        </li>
        <li>
           True and Unknown  = Unknown
        </li>
        <li>
           Unknown and Unknown = Unknown
        </li>
      </ul>
