        Vi Editor
      </h1>
      <p>
        vi is an interactive text editor included with traditional UNIX systems. It is the <em>de facto</em> (and <em>de jure</em>, by POSIX) standard editor for such systems.

        Some people love it, and some people hate it. <em>and some people </em>like<em> being stuck in a mode...</em>

        For various reasons (e.g. <a href="AsimovAndTheCritic.html">AsimovAndTheCritic</a>) there might not be any one "correct" pronunciation of <strong>vi</strong>.
        The "Vy" pronunciation gets reinvented constantly by folks outside the oral tradition. Some might comment that this is a salient point about what you name your software.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>original</strong> pronunciation, for what it's worth, as pronounced by <a href="ViEditor.html">ViEditor</a> creator <a href="BillJoy.html">BillJoy</a>, and everyone else at Berkeley, was "VEE EYE". I can personally attest to this, as I peered over his shoulder, kibitzed, and beta-tested his editors from the beginning (when he was fiddling with variants of <strong>ed</strong>) until he gave up on <a href="ViEditor.html">ViEditor</a> development circa 1979. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Having started using vi at Bell Labs in 1980, I can assure you that it was always pronounced "vee eye".</em> -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I double-checked, and actually the really old BSD documentation explicitly gives VEE EYE as the official pronunciation, it's not just oral tradition (although doubtless certain later documentation dropped that tidbit). -- Doug

        Outside the oral tradition, one hears other stories:
      </p>
      <p>
        In nearly ten years in the industry, working in the UK and US, I don't recall anyone ever pronouncing it "vee-eye". It's always been "vy" (to rhyme with "pie").
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>My experience is the opposite: I usually hear "vee-eye" and I rarely hear "vy". (I do occasionally hear "vile".)</em> (vile is a vi clone.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        From the unofficial "Pronunciation Guide for Unix" at e.g. <a href="http://www.ss64.com/bashsyntax/pronounce.html">http://www.ss64.com/bashsyntax/pronounce.html</a> : <em>Some people say "vy", some say "vee-eye" (the vi manual suggests this) and some Roman numerologists say "six".</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Isn't "six" correct only if it was "VI"?
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Actually, the Romans didn't distinguish between uppercase and lowercase.  I prefer translating it as the ablative (from/caused-by etc) of vis (force/strength/power) which would usually be translated "with force"</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           More specifically, lowercase was not invented at all until the middle ages, so "vi" is essentially identical to "VI" in Latin.  Could similarly be translated "with strength".
        </li>

        Many vi clones exist, many of which are briefly documented at <a href="http://www.saki.com.au/mirror/vi/clones.php3.">http://www.saki.com.au/mirror/vi/clones.php3.</a> Here are a few:

           vim -- <a href="VimTextEditor.html">VimTextEditor</a> is arguably more popular than vi. [given that "vi" is unavailable in source form, still, that statement is a little silly. What's probably true is that vim is the most popular of the vi-clones.]

            <li>
               Untrue (although true long ago); original <strong>vi</strong> source code has been available for years, and even has a maintainer of modern ports.

        Mmmmm... One of my fondest memories is after hacking into an old dec at the univ. for the first time. I'm sitting there with a Vi quick-reference card trying to learn Vi fast enough to edit myself out of the super-user log and not get noticed by the administrator. I'm holding down x to delete each character in the line until I suddenly see the "dd" command - <a href="AhHa.html">AhHa</a>! I gave up hacking, but never Vi. I tried the same using emacs but without the same motivation it just wasn't meant to be...
