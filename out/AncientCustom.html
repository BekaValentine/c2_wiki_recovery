        Ancient Custom
      </h1>
      <p>
        List a few <a href="AncientCustom.html">AncientCustom</a>(s) here:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Shaking hands
        </li>
        <li>
           Bowing or nodding the head - Out of curiosity, which way do you do it?  My chin goes down then up.
        </li>
        <li>
           Winking one eye
        </li>
        <li>
           Raising an eyebrow or two
        </li>
        <li>
           Smiling
        </li>
        <li>
           Trashing the place upon finding its occupant away
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Nodding directions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [3] Down then up
        </li>
        <li>
           [1] A slow, up then once sharply down nod communicates thoughtful finality, sometimes used sarcastically.
        </li>
        <li>
           An example of WesternCulturalImperialism. I have seen Indians use a totally different head movement (more like a no-shake, but not quite).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Nothing to do with WesternCulturalImperialism. It seems that southern Italians do not nod to show agreement. Can some Italian give us the straight dope here?
      </p>
      <p>
        Bulgarians shake their head for yes and nod for no. But to confuse the situation, they sometimes (but not always) reverse the situation when talking to foreigners.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through business contacts I'm told that we Americans often confuse Asian nodding, which means "I heard you" (but may completely disagree) with American/western nodding, which means "I agree with you."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I heard (I forget where) that Indians use shake=no, nod=yes but also a sort of head-wobble that's somewhere in-between, which means something like "I would like to oblige but unfortunately I can't, sorry.". Is this true? Maybe a regional thing?</em>

        Rising when someone older and wiser enters the room.

      <p>
        There's evidence that smiling is biological, not cultural:
        Dogs understand one's smile or frown.
        <em>(Don't try this with a very big dog!)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Old story is that shaking hands (in western tradition) is a demonstration that you have no weapon in that hand.

        <em>OK if the other guy is not left-handed</em>! [One reason why Latin 'sinister' = left became English 'sinister'!]
