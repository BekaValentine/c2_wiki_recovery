        Where To Implement Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        When a pattern (repeating concept) of some kind is discovered, the question is raised: where should it be implemented? To begin to answer this, the following questions, at least, need to be asked:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           How often does it occur
        </li>
        <li>
           In what domains does it occur often or rarely
        </li>
        <li>
           Is it best to address the pattern in:
          <ul>
            <li>
               App language
            </li>
            <li>
               A general-purpose library/API (sold as a package or posted on OSS sites)
            </li>
            <li>
               A per-application or per-shop library/API (specific app language)
            </li>
            <li>
               An app-language-independent service (such as a DBMS, file system, web service, etc.) 
              <ul>
                <li>
                   Should such a service be mostly imperative or declarative (such as a markup language/interface)?
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A language generally has limits on which patterns it can 'abstract', so the library route may require a great deal of <a href="BoilerPlateCode.html">BoilerPlateCode</a> for each use of the pattern. Indeed, <a href="SoftwareDesignPatterns.html">SoftwareDesignPatterns</a> are exactly the class of patterns that cannot be abstracted, and the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> focus on what cannot be abstracted in typical OOP languages.
