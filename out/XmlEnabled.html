        What on earth is "XML-enabled" actually supposed to mean? Does it mean the
        ability to parse or generate XML files? In that case, every Turing machine is XML-enabled.

        I thought that would be obvious. It means that the buzzword compliance of the infrastructure is undergoing ongoing upgradability testing.

        OK, so I'm stupid, but I still don't get it. SQL Server is a database, isn't it? So what does it mean that is "uses" XML? It probably doesn't mean that the data is stored in an XML file (at least I hope it doesn't). Are the configuration files stored as XML? Please enlighten me.

        Translation: It means it can communicate with other XML aware applications. Since XML is a pretty darn good packet structure, communication is simplified. It's like implementing interprocess drag and drop: you need some commonly accepted flexible communication standard so applications can gracefully deal with data it has never seen before. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        Q:What will this do as far as performance is concerned?  Returning things as XML seems nice but having to parse large volumes of XML could be a very expensive operation. -- <a href="GlenStampoultzis.html">GlenStampoultzis</a>
