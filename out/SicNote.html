        Sic Note

      <p>
        For some of you who have an itching to fix grammar, spelling, etc.; rather than change other authors' text, how about insert a <a href="SicNote.html">SicNote</a> next to the alleged problem, along with square brackets? That way you can mark problems without having to change actual text. It's a <strong>decent compromise</strong> in my opinion and won't trigger the nasty <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s often associated with such edits.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The rain in Spain stays mainly on the plane [</em><a href="SicNote.html">SicNote</a>: "plain"] according to Dr. Zammo. --FredSample<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought this page was going to propose the marking of every post with an all-encompassing "[sic]", in order to make the post incorregible in principle, as a desperate measure against <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>!
