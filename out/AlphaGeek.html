        Alpha Geek
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>From </em><a href="AlphaMale.html">AlphaMale</a>:<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Designation for the male at the top of the male dominance hierarchy in a group of social animals. In some groups this is the only male that gets a chance to reproduce. In some groups this is the male that eats first. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Determined by displays or contests of strength, endurance, loudness, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>...number of gadgets attached to belt, etc.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Alpha male defines the leader of the pack.  Geeks travel in their own packs, hence the gadget-factor definition.  Also, when PDAs and cellphones first arrived, the cost was such that having one was a status symbol.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Truly, a geek wouldn't call himself an Alpha male, or even a Beta male. A true geek would be a "release version" <em>non </em>PointOhVersion, please<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Alpha geek is an old term.]
