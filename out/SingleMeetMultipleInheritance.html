        Single Meet Multiple Inheritance
      </h1>
      <p>
        A version of <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a> with the restriction that any two types <strong>T1</strong> and <strong>T2</strong> may only have at most single <em>meet</em>.  See <a href="MeetsAndJoins.html">MeetsAndJoins</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In such systems, only one class is allowed to multiply inherit from the same pair of base classes.  In particular, the following hierarchy is not:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Base1 {};<br/>
        class Base2 {};<br/>
        class Derived1 : public Base1, public Base2 {};<br/>
        class Derived2 : public Base1, public Base2 {}; <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Derived1 and Derived2 are both meets of Base1 and Base2; as neither is a subtype of the other.
