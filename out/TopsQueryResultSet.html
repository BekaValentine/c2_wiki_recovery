        Tops Query Result Set
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>In a discussion on </em><a href="RelationalOoImpedanceMismatchIsCausedByClasses.html">RelationalOoImpedanceMismatchIsCausedByClasses</a>, <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a> advocated an OO approach to developing client-side mechanisms to handle database ResultSets, including optional support for local persistence. Top responded with OO scepticism, including:<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"As far as "types of persistence", I don't think a tree taxonomy is appropriate. I don't want my code to worry much about whether it goes to disk or RAM during processing. dBASE dialects would use RAM if available, for example. Perhaps have some efficiency "hint" settings, but one does not need types for that. Composition or its equiv would be more appropriate IMO. Example:"</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        resultSet = query(theSql, diskable=true, compressable=false);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Or</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        rs = new QueryResultSet(theSql).beToDisk().execute();<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>We can assume that compressable is already false, features should be enabled when necessary</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        The interface is not unpleasing. Where it gets interesting is how query(...) or execute(...) are implemented. Let's compare a non-OO approach with an OO approach. But first, just to make it a bit more challenging, let's add some functionality. Let's say we might additionally wish to encrypt, or not, the <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a>. E.g.:
      </p>
      <code>
        resultSet = query(theSql, diskable=true, compressable=false, encrypted=true)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        For the sake of illustration, I'm going to leave out most of the real-world details and pseudocode it.
      </p>
      <p>
        First, let's look at the operations involved. I've deliberately used a procedural syntax, so as not to cloud the issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>We'll assume we have some pre-existing mechanism for obtaining a resultset from our external SQL database, which is used like this:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        sqlResultSet = executeSQL(globalDBConnection, theSQL)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Assume sqlResultSet is a collection of rows that we can use like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        for each row in sqlResultSet<br/>
        print row.ClientID, row.Name, row.Description, row.Address, row.SomeColumnValue<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I will assume, for the sake of argument, that sqlResultSet is transient (perhaps bound to the most recent query execution) and therefore cannot be retained in memory or written to storage.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I don't know why we have to assume this. The ideal would be to buffer it to disk if it got too large to fit in RAM, without the API user having to worry about that. Keep in mind that my table-oriented views were shaped mostly via <a href="ExBase.html">ExBase</a>, which generally used RAM cache if a table fit in RAM (at least in later versions). (dBASE introduced virtual tables in later versions, which automatically cleaned themselves from disk.) You could index the result set if need be, cross-reference (join) it, etc. But the short of it is that one did not have to worry about a disk-RAM dichotomy for the most part. I got so used to this feature that you really miss it when it goes away, and often have to fiddle with associative arrays, disk buffers, bulking up the server-side SQL, etc. It feels like traveling back 2 decades. <a href="YearningForUnfashionableTech.html">YearningForUnfashionableTech</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           I've assumed it purely for the sake of illustration. This page is more about comparing OO and procedural approaches than it is about a practical implementation of a <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a>. To be honest, it is a slightly-altered version of OO-vs-Procedural material I already use with my students, though I could easily alter it to meet the above requirements. My example hides the RAM-disk dichotomy, requiring only that the user specify one or the other (either implicitly or explicitly) in the creation of the <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a>. -- DV
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Out of curiosity, how hard would it be to make it automatic, or at least have an "auto" option? If the table grows bigger than some threashold, then buffer it to disk.</em> -- top
        </li>
        <li>
           Easy. Toward the goal of self-optimising containers in general, I once built a "universal container" whose internal representation is based on an initial hint, and which dynamically changes based on statistical analysis of its usage pattern. I haven't yet found a use for it, though, and it needs more work. In my OO ResultSet example below, the <em>storage</em> member can reference any subclass of Storage (i.e., Disk or Ram, it doesn't matter), so at run-time we can change from Ram to Disk, without any other code changes, by doing something like this at the appropriate point:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        ...<br/>
        if (storage.isInRam() && storage.count() > RAM_STORAGE_LIMIT) {<br/>
        newStorage = new Disk(getTemporaryFileName())<br/>
        while (storage.hasNext())<br/>
        newStorage.write(storage.next())<br/>
        storage = newStorage<br/>
        }<br/>
        ... -- DV<br/>
      </code>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Note that the tools I used, used a combination at the same time based on size and RAM availability <strong>automatically</strong>; essentially caching. It's not something the app developer should normally have to worry about. An either-or view when designing is limiting. That is why <strong>polymorphic philosophy can give you blinders</strong> at times. It may automatically bring a portion of a table into memory and if the next request is within that portion it knows it does not have to go to disk. Maybe general-purpose cashing has reduced the usefulness of table-specific implementations, though. Complicating things is adding indexes. I've used a tool once that lacked indexes (Forest & Trees), and it was a royal pain. A join that would normally be 20 seconds with indexing took 4 hours. Local joins are a fairly common need in my experience, partly because data from diverse databases cannot normally/easily be joined at the server level. For example, if you send a list of customers off to a marketing company, they may cull the list and give it back and then you have to join it back to the original to get reports about the new list. The DBA may not be happy about creating server-side tables for something that may be a short-lived or constantly-changing project. -- top

        <strong>Let's assume we can write rows to disk:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        f = openFile("myfile.dat")<br/>
        for each row in sqlResultSet<br/>
        write(f, row)<br/>

      <p>
        <strong>We can read rows from disk:</strong>

        row = read(f)<br/>
        print row.ClientID, row.Name, row.Description, row.Address, row.SomeColumnValue<br/>
        }   <br/>
        close(f)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>We can write rows to an in-memory collection:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        c = createCollection()<br/>
        for each row in sqlResultSet<br/>
        insert(c, row)<br/>

        <strong>We can read rows from an in-memory collection:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        for each row in c<br/>
        print row.ClientID, row.Name, row.Description, row.Address, row.SomeColumnValue   <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>We can compress data:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        compressor = openLZWCompressor()<br/>
        rowCompressed = compress(compressor, row)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>We can uncompress data:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>

        print row.ClientID, row.Name, row.Description, row.Address, row.SomeColumnValue   <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>We can encrypt data:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        crypto = openSimpleCrypto("password")<br/>
        rowEncrypted = encrypt(crypto, row)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>We can decrypt data:</strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        row = decrypt(crypto, rowEncrypted)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now we have everything we need to implement our client-side <a href="ResultSet.html">ResultSet</a> storage gizmo.
      </p>
      <p>
        We'll assume two procedures -- one called query() that accesses the database, creates, and stores our ResultSet; the second called getRows() to retrieve the rows housed in our ResultSet. Here's a rude, crude, procedural implementation:
      </p>
      <code>
        query(theSql, diskable, compressable, encrypted) {<br/>
        ResultSet = struct {<br/>
        diskable<br/>
        compressable<br/>
        encrypted<br/>
        fileName<br/>
        c<br/>
        }<br/>
        ResultSet.diskable = diskable<br/>
        ResultSet.compressable = compressable<br/>
        ResultSet.encrypted = encrypted<br/>
        sqlResultSet = executeSQL(globalDBConnection, theSQL)<br/>
        if (diskable) {<br/>
        ResultSet.fileName = "myfile.dat"<br/>
        f = openFile(ResultSet.fileName)<br/>
        } else<br/>
        ResultSet.c = createCollection()<br/>
        if (compressable)<br/>
        compressor = openLZWCompressor()<br/>
        if (encrypted)<br/>
        crypto = openSimpleCrypto("password")<br/>
        for each row in sqlResultSet {<br/>
        data = row<br/>
        if (compressable)<br/>
        data = compress(compressor, data)<br/>
        if (encrypted)<br/>
        data = encrypt(crypto, data)<br/>
        if (diskable)<br/>
        write(f, data)<br/>
        else<br/>
        insert(ResultSet.c, data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        if (diskable)<br/>
        close(f)<br/>
        return ResultSet<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        getRows(resultSet) {<br/>
        sqlResultSet = createCollection()<br/>
        if (resultSet.compressable)<br/>
        compressor = openLZWCompressor()<br/>
        if (resultSet.encrypted)<br/>
        crypto = openSimpleCrypto("password")<br/>
        if (resultSet.diskable) {<br/>
        f = openFile(resultSet.fileName)<br/>
        while (not endOfFile(f)) {<br/>
        datum = read(f)<br/>
        if (resultSet.encrypted)<br/>
        datum = decrypt(crypto, datum)<br/>
        if (resultSet.compressable)<br/>
        datum = decompress(compressor, datum)<br/>
        insert(sqlResultSet, datum)<br/>
        }<br/>
        close(f)<br/>
        } else {<br/>
        for each datum in resultSet.c {<br/>
        if (resultSet.encrypted)<br/>
        datum = decrypt(crypto, datum)<br/>
        if (resultSet.compressable)<br/>
        datum = decompress(compressor, datum)<br/>
        insert(sqlResultSet, datum)      <br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
        return sqlResultSet<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        There we have it, procedural style. You'd use it like this, under the assumption that a missing un-named parameter (<em>encrypted</em>, in this case) generates a 'false' argument to that parameter:
      </p>
      <code>
        resultSet = query(theSql, diskable=true, compressable=false)<br/>
        ...<br/>
        rows = getRows(resultSet)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Obviously, it is highly sub-optimal (conditionals inside of loops, no control over the filename or the password, could use some serious refactoring, etc.), but it's a conceptual illustration rather than an example of best practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's re-implement it in an OO style. We'll use the same pre-existing procedural mechanisms for encryption, storage, etc., but wrap them in some vaguely Java-influenced classes. This is more verbose than strictly necessary, but typical of popular OO-like languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's how we handle Storage, i.e., whether it is diskable or not:
      </p>
      <code>
        class abstract Storage {<br/>
        write(data)<br/>
        open()<br/>
        close()<br/>
        hasNext()<br/>
        next()<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Disk extends Storage {<br/>
        Disk(fileName) {<br/>
        fname = fileName<br/>
        }<br/>
        write(data) {<br/>
        write(f, data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        open() {<br/>
        f = openFile(fname)<br/>
        }<br/>
        close() {<br/>
        close(f)<br/>
        }<br/>
        hasNext() {<br/>
        return (not endOfFile(f))<br/>
        }<br/>
        next() {<br/>
        return read(f)<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Ram extends Storage {<br/>
        Storage() {<br/>
        c = createCollection()<br/>
        }<br/>
        write(data) {<br/>
        insert(c, data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        // I'm assuming reset(), hasNext() and next() are typical iteration functions for a Collection.<br/>
        // The notion of only one iterator per Collection is obviously bogus, but I'm striving for simplicity.<br/>
        open() {<br/>
        reset(c)<br/>
        }<br/>
        close() {<br/>
        }<br/>

        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here's how we handle compression:
      </p>
      <code>
        class abstract Compressor {<br/>
        compress(data)<br/>
        decompress(data)<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>

        CompressedLZW() {<br/>
        compressor = openLZWCompressor()<br/>

        compress(data) {<br/>
        return compress(compressor, data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        decompress(data) {<br/>
        return decompress(compressor, data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class Uncompressed extends Compressor {<br/>
        compress(data) {<br/>
        return data<br/>
        }<br/>
        decompress(data) {<br/>
        return data<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here's how we handle encryption:
      </p>
      <code>
        class abstract Crypto {<br/>
        encrypt(data)<br/>
        decrypt(data)<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class SimpleCrypto extends Crypto {<br/>
        SimpleCrypto(password) {<br/>
        crypto = openSimpleCrypto(password)<br/>
        }<br/>
        encrypt(data) {<br/>
        return encrypt(crypto, data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        decrypt(data) {<br/>
        return decrypt(crypto, data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class NoCrypto extends Crypto {<br/>

        decrypt(data) {<br/>
        return data<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here's where it all comes together:
      </p>
      <code>
        class ResultSet {<br/>
        ResultSet(theSQL, diskable, compressable, encrypted) {<br/>
        storage = diskable<br/>
        compression = compressable<br/>
        encryption = encrypted<br/>
        sqlResultSet = executeSQL(globalDBConnection, theSQL)<br/>
        storage.open()<br/>
        for each row in sqlResultSet {<br/>
        data = row<br/>
        data = compression.compress(data)<br/>
        data = encryption.encrypt(data)<br/>
        storage.write(data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        storage.close()<br/>
        }<br/>
        // For common defaults, if our OO language doesn't support default values<br/>
        // for parameters, we might provide alternate constructors like this:<br/>
        ResultSet(theSQL) {<br/>
        return this(theSQL, new Ram(), new Uncompressed(), new NoCrypto())<br/>
        }<br/>
        getRows() {<br/>
        c = createCollection()<br/>
        storage.open()<br/>
        while (storage.hasNext()) {<br/>
        data = storage.next()<br/>
        data = encryption.decrypt(data)<br/>
        data = compression.decompress(data)<br/>
        insert(c, data)<br/>
        }<br/>
        storage.close()<br/>
        return c<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The astute reader will recognise that refactoring and creation of classes might be extended to the point that the ResultSet constructor and getRows() can be combined to <em>use the same code</em>, i.e., a mechanism representing a transformation from one abstract container to another, differing only in the object arguments used at invocation-time. This is, however, beyond the scope of this illustration. It is left as an exercise for the reader, as is finding and fixing the bugs. I've already seen several.
      </p>
      <p>
        To implement our original example... 
      </p>
      <code>
        resultSet = query(theSql, diskable=true, compressable=false, encrypted=true)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ...we would do it like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        resultSet = new ResultSet(theSql, new Disk("myfile.dat"), new Uncompressed(), new SimpleCrypto("password"))<br/>
        ...<br/>
        for each row in resultSet.getRows()<br/>
        print row.ClientID, row.Name, row.Description, row.Address, row.SomeColumnValue<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If the defaults are acceptable, we can just use the appropriate constructor:
      </p>
      <code>
        resultSet = query(theSQL)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Where this approach is really of benefit is when we add, say, a new type of compression. Let's say we want to be able to choose Huffman encoding as an alternative to LZW. We create a new class:
      </p>
      <code>
        class CompressedHuffman extends Compressor {<br/>
        CompressedHuffman() {<br/>
        compressor = openHuffmanCompressor()<br/>
        }<br/>
        compress(data) {<br/>
        return squeeze(data, compressor)<br/>
        }<br/>
        decompress(data) {<br/>
        return expand(data, compressor)<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now we can test it independently, and simply use it without changing a line of ResultSet:  
      </p>
      <code>
        resultSet = new ResultSet(theSql, new Disk("myfile.dat"), new CompressedHuffman(), new SimpleCrypto("password"))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Using the procedural approach, we would have to go back to query(...) and getRows() and implement more conditionals, or start refactoring these into additional procedures with internal conditionals. As the number of different storage mechanisms, encryption mechanisms, compression approaches and so on increase, the mechanisms internal to, or used by, query(...) and getRows() would become more complex. Using the OO approach, each of these can be developed and tested independently of the others, without an increase in complexity at any one point, and with a strong assurance that they will simply work in ResultSet. That's where the OO approach is of value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, it is possible in procedural code to factor out areas of selectable functionality into procedures, so you wind up with things like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        doCompress(data, method) {<br/>
        case (method) {<br/>
        LZW:<br/>
        compressor = openLZWCompressor() <br/>
        return compress(compressor, data)<br/>
        HUFFMAN:<br/>
        compressor = openHuffmanCompressor()<br/>
        return squeeze(data, compressor)<br/>
        UNCOMPRESSED:<br/>
        return data<br/>
        default:<br/>
        fatal("OH MY GOD!!!")<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, such an approach is essentially implementing polymorphism by hand. It's awkward, often slow, forces the developer to change code in low-level modules, causes a single point of complexity, and especially falls down in cases where an inheritance hierarchy and polymorphism can automate the selection of the correct underlying functions.

        This raises issues generally already addressed in <a href="SwitchStatementsSmell.html">SwitchStatementsSmell</a>. OOP may indeed be better for implementating lower-level operations, as I have already agreed in statements about too many OO examples about "systems software" and "device drivers". However, you are <strong>focusing on the implementation rather than on the <em>user</em> of the API's</strong>. In some languages, OOP is more verbose than procedural to use such API's. Thus, you may be penalizing the user to make the implementor's job easier. If I am issuing 100's of queries in a program, I want the API's to be brief. If this makes the implementor have to deal with ugly case-statements, I don't give a bleep. That is <em>their</em> problem. Make the customer happy.

        <em>See my examples of usage.

        Okay, it wasn't clear to me what "it" referred to when you said "doesn't support it". But if it's merely a comment on Java's lack of named parameters, then you have nothing against having an interface that uses such on the user's side, even if OOP is used underneath? Again, I don't do systems software and thus will not make claims about OO's appropriateness for such. I just don't see the befinits of OO in my domain as an app developer and would prefer named parameters for such an interface for the user's side. Modeling things as device drivers doesn't work well for biz modeling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I have nothing against named parameters; their presence or lack thereof has nothing to do with OO.  I'm not sure what "device drivers" has to do with this, unless you're claiming that polymorphism is only appropriate for implementing device drivers.  It's appropriate any time more than one concrete implementation can be accessed via a single abstraction such as an interface or base class.  I have developed applications (including significant components of business applications, in particular scheduling and payroll systems) that operate almost entirely on abstractions, but whose actual behaviour is defined by a varying collection of polymorphic concrete implementations of the abstractions.  It is a powerful and maintainable way to develop flexible applications.  Certainly, there are times when changes to requirements means functionality needs to be moved up or down the inheritence hierarchy or split into multiple methods, but this is almost always easier than redefining a festoonment of ugly switch statements and generally equivalent in ease or easier than redefining some data-driven mechanism such as a dispatch table.</em> -- DV
      </p>
      <p>
        When I see case/if statements and tables crashing and burning compared to OO by studying production code or something close to it for biz apps, I may change my mind. Until then, the downsides of poly seem to outweigh the downsides of case/if and tables. The type of downsides they give in the OO textbooks don't fit what I actually see. The real world does not divide the way textbooks pretend it does. Their change patterns just plain don't match those that I actually see. Their chunks of polymorphism are larger than future change or variation granularities are likely to be, and they make changing from mutually-exclusive options to "both" more code rework. IF statements are far more condusive to fine granularity changes and change in mut.ex. between two or more options, as described on my webpages and referenced wiki topics. <strong>Poly requires rather narrow change patterns to come out ahead</strong> and IF's better fit the set-oriented "bag of features" approach to variation management that I find superior. Perhaps "C" is your problem. C is has an ugly procedural face. --top
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I tend to first design the interface, and then <strong>work backward</strong> toward the implementation. This is how most design should be; otherwise implementation dictates the interface/results. Sometimes it makes sense to complicate the interface in order to simplify the implementation, sometimes not. But right now I am taking the perspective of the interface. A named-parameter interface is preferred from the API user's perspective. Whether the implementation uses polymorphism or gerbils isn't my (API user's) concern as long as it works. It has the added benefit of allowing one to change the implementation to something besides polymorphism if that is the way to go in the future. If you design the API up-front around the assumption that polymorphism will be used to dispatch the differences, then you've pretty much locked yourself into polymorphism (or at least create a confusing mess to escape from). --top

        This goes into the direction of <a href="ProgrammingWithoutRamDiskDichotomy.html">ProgrammingWithoutRamDiskDichotomy</a>. I would prefer APIs that allow to specify the amount of persistence, security and reliability too. But I would rather not choose such implementation dependent aspects as "diskable" or "compressable", but rather an API like this:

      <code>

        rs.performance = [ ... ]<br/>
      </code>

Simple polymorphism seems no longer sufficient such that one either has to move up the GOF pattern scale, or use case/if statements. "Few drivers" implies simple sub-typing.

        Related to my "polymorphic blinders" comment above, perhaps an implementation-neutral interface would merely give hints or suggestions, not orders. For example, it could have a "cachness" percentage setting (perhaps this is <a href="BargainFutureProofing.html">BargainFutureProofing</a>). Zero would mean it always uses disk, and 100% would mean it always uses RAM, never disk. In between would be various caching levels, or perhaps size threashold controls. If one implements the interface with something that must choose between disk or ram up front (sort of like the one introduced above), then it could split the decision at the 50% level (<50 use disk, >50 use the ram version). Or perhaps wait longer under a high value before switching to disk as stuff grows. If somebody later replaced the engine with a cache-able engine, then all the polymorphism that is exposed to the user is obsolete.

        Even the classic OO "shapes" example has this flaw. One can define an oval as a 100% "smoothed" rectangle, and a circle as a 100% smoothed square. And we can get all kinds of nice shapes in-between by using values like 37%. The classification of rectangles versus ellipses is thus limiting, and perhaps blinds the designer's view of possible other options. It can be viewed as a tunable attribute, not a sub-type of "shape". This idea is more powerful, flexible, and better reflect the real-world in my opinion.

        <em>Indeed, the usual purpose of the example is to illustrate a polymorphic "paint()" or "draw()" method, rather than illustrate polymorphism in terms of some characteristic of the shapes.  Anyway, polymorphism would still be appropriate for handling "paint()", assuming that we have a variety of drawable entities such as icons, images, sprites, external documents, lines, etc., including your unified curvable shape class.  Surely you can't be advocating a position that polymorphism is </em>never<em> appropriate?</em>

        The issue is that I don't know the scope of your claim. As far as when its appropriate, it is hard to tell because the real world often changes in <strong>non-anticipatable</strong> ways. Poly is a often a hard "is-a" and is harder to undo than softer set-based methods. If the future is hard to predict, then softer variation-management techniques are usually more appropriate. (And things like strategy pattern assume unrealistic chunkage. That is, variation-on-a-theme differences granularity-level patterning is often smaller than the strategy chunks.)

      <p>
        <em>Anyway, in real-world OO development, I rarely create class heirarchies that mirror real-world entities except when developing simulators.  In business applications, the database is for modelling the real world, or more accurately, modelling facts about it.  My class hierarchies and application of polymorphism tend to be used for software entities, like widgets, forms, windows, menus & menu items, database connections, reports, ad-hoc query generators, report components, scheduling engines, pricing engines, payroll calculators, and so on, where the need to model some continuous or non-heirarchical real-world fuzziness simply doesn't exist.</em> -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        But if they are small and isolated (special-purpose), then the difference between paradigms is not going to matter much. OOP may just be more setup overhead and verbosity than strait functions. Many OO'ers claim that its benefits only show up on large-scale stuff. But you seem to be admitting that you don't use it for large-scale stuff, but rather isolated little pockets. (BTW, I think GUI frameworks should be largely declarative, and area where OO does not shine.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Where did I "admit" I "don't use it for large-scale stuff, but rather isolated little pockets"?  The above is not "isolated little pockets"; it's how I develop applications.  Perhaps I wasn't clear:  When I develop business applications, I'm typically not creating domain classes (though these do sometimes exist as needed); I'm mainly creating tools to facilitate the presentation and entering of facts.  The database is used to manage the facts themselves.  That means the majority of my work consists of creating software entities -- i.e., forms, reports, etc. -- rather than domain classes like "client", "employee" etc.  This is quite different from what is advocated in most OO texts, but it is, IMHO, a more effective and flexible way of building usable and maintainable applications.  That is because data modelling and object modelling are </em>'not<em>' the same thing; the former is about defining long term representation of durable information, the latter is about defining presentation and recording.  But, that's a discussion for another day.</em>

        <em>As for using declarative techniques for GUI definitions, that's fine, but the declarative language has to be developed using something, doesn't it?  For developing that framework and/or language, OO is well suited.  It's also well-suited to extending the GUI framework, which is considerably more difficult (if it can be done at all) using a declarative form-builder.</em> -- DV

        Again, I won't challenge OO being better for systems software, such as GUI engines. As far as OO being better for extending a GUI engine, I guess I'd have to see specifics. The devil's in the details. I evaluate OO from a custom app developer's perspective, and don't see a lot of objective merit.

        <em>Then I recommend you precede all further criticism of OO, functional programming, thin-tables, typeful programming, type safety, or whatever, with "When working on end-user oriented business applications, I believe ..."

        For the most part, I do. But I should point out that most of the claims made by OO proponents do not provide similar disclaimers. They imply OO and poly is good everywhere all the time.

        <em>I've only seen you add such disclaimers when pressed against a wall, otherwise, your criticisms appear to be generic.

I've not seen claims that OO and polymorphism are good </em>'all<strong> the time; generally such claims are of the form, "when you encounter problem <x>, OO and polymorphism can solve it using <y>."

        Usually such debates are with people who are familiar with the scope of prior debates (or at least act like them). The fact that you admitted you've seen such disclimers multiple times <em>before</em> demonstrates that the "word is out". The pudding pooped out its proof. Thus, no conspiracy on my part. Your bias against me has a way of twisting all my actions in your mind into an evil conspiracy, such as "when pressed against the wall". Your bias has been caught red-handed again. Further, I am usually defending against a univerasally-implied OO claim. Thus I'm only obligated to show one domain example to show its not universal.--top

        <em>I claim no "evil conspiracy" on your part, only that there's a pattern I've observed over time.

        Somebody changed the text above to make it sound more diplomatic than it was. It used to say something like, "You only limit it to systems software when pressed against the wall". The wall comment was edited out since. As it originally stood, it sounded like an accusation of manipulation to me. Now I have *two* reasons to be paranoid. As far as OO, I do believe the industry is indeed indirectly forcing it upon us using hyped and overly global claims. --top

        <em>I can assure you, no one changed the text.

I don't believe your behaviour is intended to be manipulative, or that it </em>'is<strong> manipulative.  I merely state what I've observed -- you often start with a sweeping statement, a debate ensues, and it ends (mostly) when you make statements like "[I] won't challenge OO for being better for systems software, such as GUI engines."  The industry did not "force" OO upon you or anyone else, any more than breathless journalists, textbook authors, and management pundits normally do when expressing enthusiasm for something new -- as they have always done.

        Other's have made a similar observation about OO and business modeling. The term "impedance mismatch" was even coined for it without me even around. Biz modeling with DB's has a very different philosophy from OO, and <strong>they clash</strong>. One is about math-like predicates and set theory, and the other is about state machines that can reinvent their own operators without central rules. --top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As I've argued elsewhere, the so-called "impedance mismatch" occurs when OO is naively misused to create business simulators instead of fact processors.  If your business application has database tables named Client, Employee, Invoice, Order, Product, and there are classes on the client-side named Client, Employee, Invoice, Order, and Product, and the two tables/classes are analogues of each other, then you've probably gone horribly wrong -- impedance mismatch will almost definitely result.  When the database is used to model information requirements, i.e., process facts, and the OO client is used to create computational artifacts that present and gather facts, then impedance mismatch is reduced or eliminated.  Thus, OO and the </em><a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> are complementary, not contradictory.<em> </em>

        Another issue that "reality-tizes" your design is that all those may not be avialable as independant services. For example, if you choose a driver from company X, then its compression or caching options may be not avialable or have very different parameters than the drivers from company B. Thus, they may not be independent in the reality: vendors force a kind of bundling on you. You can't just polymorphically swap them and have the interface work the same without major rework.  (Some OO designers will say, "oh, well refactoring goes with the territory". But putting "rework" under a emphemism of "refactoring", they've think they got away with it. Not.)  --top

      <p>
        <em>Sorry, you've lost me here.  What's this "choose a driver from company X"?  Can you give me a concrete example?</em> -- DV
      </p>
      <p>
        Put another way, unless there is heavy pressure to standardize the interface, the <strong>interfaces themselves will be different</strong> between vendors of non-trivial components/services. Thus plug-and-swap implimentation (polymorphism) won't work without a fair amount of code rework. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree.  While it may be possible to wrapperize the vendors' APIs and still benefit from a polymorphic interface, in some cases this may be more work than it's worth.  If so, it merely results in a fairly conventional procedural approach for handling the vendor APIs.  That does not, however, deprecate the value of using OO approaches in other parts of the application.  In this case, one bad apple does not spoil the barrel.</em>
