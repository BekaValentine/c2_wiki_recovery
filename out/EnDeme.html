      <p>
        An Endeme is a list of (nominally) 22 characters, each of which stands for something. Its <a href="EndemeSet.html">EndemeSet</a> defines what each letter stands for (as an EndemeCharacteristic). Endemes do not always have to be associated with an <a href="EndemeSet.html">EndemeSet</a>, but they usually are in practice. An example endeme is:
      </p>
      <code>
        CRDGBMLQVHFJNOAEPUSTKI<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is my cognitive Endeme based on the <a href="BusinessTalentEndemeSet.html">BusinessTalentEndemeSet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For easier reading it can be displayed like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        CRD-GBML-QVHFJNOA-EPUS-TKI<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Its 'full designation' would be:
      </p>
      <code>
        businesstalent:CRD-GBML-QVHFJNOA-EPUS-TKI<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <code>
        BusinessTalent:CRD-GBML-QVHFJNOA-EPUS-TKI<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <code>
        business talent:CRD-GBML-QVHFJNOA-EPUS-TKI<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Each letter has a weighting within the endeme. The first letter has the strongest weight and is therefore the most important, each successive letter is less important in sequence. <a href="EndemeSet.html">EndemeSet</a><em>s also contains all of these letters but since they letters have not yet been ordered into an endeme, they are called 'sets'. Because sets have no order. endemes have order and they are usually instances of sets.</em>

        Endemes store qualitative information.
