        Time.  I don't have enough.  But I promise to come back and describe myself
        more fully when I have some.  Anyone else have some available I can use?
        (Without losing my job ...)

        Meanwhile, I[1] am an architect and developer with
        SM&A[2] in Colorado Springs.
        My interest in patterns waxes and wanes as I have, um, time.
        Certainly I use them in my daily work but learning about new ones, always
        important, sometimes suffers from schedule concerns.
        (Hmm, seems there are quite
        a few (anti?) patterns herein suggesting deep thoughts about this!)
        This set of pages is extraordinarily interesting, I intend to visit more.

        External interests include competitive swimming and officiating for same.
        (I have children in the sport as well, hence the officiating as a volunteer
        effort.)  Also, I'm a flying and <a href="SoaringFanatic.html">SoaringFanatic</a>.
        I fly with a local club, High Flights Soaring, and tow gliders for them as
        well.
        These activities have many aspects on which Don's organizational patterns
        have comment, something I'd like to explore further.
        (The flying in particular.)

        I see that this page was edited in the year 2000 to add <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a> to it, but how can I see when Jim changed the content of this last? -- <a href="MichaelFinney.html">MichaelFinney</a>
