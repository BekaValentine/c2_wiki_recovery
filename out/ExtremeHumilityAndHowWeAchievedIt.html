        Extreme Humility And How We Achieved It
      </h1>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        Joking apart, it is surely possible to be very ambitious to achieve great things, to be full of confidence as a team and as individuals, to be aggressive and courageous in the face of great obstacles, yet to have the sense to realise that without humility the best will never come to be.

        I think the correct term for this is <em>meekness</em>.  But I guess example is more powerful than words anyhow ...
