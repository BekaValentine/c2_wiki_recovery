      <p>
        I've considered myself a computer guy since I got my first job, with IBM, back in 1957. I do Java, VB, APL, J, Perl, AWK, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        My current interest is reducing the cost and effort of developing typical Information System applications and improving the value of the IS expenses to an enterprise.
      </p>
      <p>
        My (vaporware) <em>Killer App</em> is 
        an <em>App Killer</em>; an Information Systems framework (I call DOIT, for Document Oriented Information Technology) which I believe could substantially reduce the risks and costs of information system development as we know it. My thesis is that the <a href="DoItFramework.html">DoItFramework</a> would provide a new and powerful answer to the IS problems faced by business today.
