        Some people, including myself, like to keep computers they have used far beyond their most useful and efficient lifetimes. They retain <a href="OperatingSystems.html">OperatingSystems</a>, Programs and Data which have been made a legacy.
      </p>
      <p>
        These are Computers which are still fully operational and function as they did 5, 10, 20, and even over 30 years ago.

      <p>
        I guess among other names, you might call those who have them Computer Collectors, or Historic Computer Preservationists.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a MarginalValue in the present time for keeping such computers in addition to their Historic Interest.
