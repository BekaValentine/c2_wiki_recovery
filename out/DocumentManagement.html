        Document Management
      </h1>
      <p>
        Document Management is often considered a subset of ContentManagement. In a Document Management system, the number of features is usually reduced compared to a Content Management system, providing less flexibility but less complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can distinguish two types of document management:
      </p>
      <code>
        - the management of electronic documents (Microsoft Word documents for example)<br/>
        - the management of paper documents (any printed document for example)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Both can be implemented with an electronic system of records. Paper documents can be scanned. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Indexing is an important part of document management, some systems go as far as indexing the content of documents.
