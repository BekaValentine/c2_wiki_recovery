        Old Units
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page presents a consistent system of measurements, traditionally used in England, the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a>, and many other countries. Much of this system is the traditional English units from before the adoption of the imperial and metric systems. Many of these units are still commonly used in the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a>. This page shows how the units are related to each other, and their practical applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of 2003, these units are defined in terms of the metric system.

        The square mile is square, but the acre is not.
      </p>
      <p>
        An acre is an area equal to one chain by ten chains, that's 22 yards by 220 yards. This definition came from the strip of land that used to be worked by one man, and it's long and thin because they packed into a field well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hence the square mile (1,760 yards x 1,760 yards) can be divided into 80 x 8 = 640 one-acre rectangles of 22 yards x 220 yards each. -- vk
      </p>
      <p>
        A square mile, being 80 chains long on a side, divides nicely up into a grid that's 80 x 22 yards one way and 8 x 220 yards the other way, and 80 x 8 is very neatly 640 (acres).
      </p>

        Most of the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a> was surveyed in 6 mile x 6 mile "townships".  ( California's Spanish land grants being a notable exception.)

        Q. Does this mean that 11 yards x 440 yards is not an acre?
      </p>
      <p>
        A. The way the definition used to be phrased, you'd think not. The wording has been altered to reflect that. Consider a 2 acre plot for example? Can we be sure of it's shape? Is it twice as long or twice as wide? A statute of 1878 defined an acre as 4840 square yards, so now the acre is a definition of area regardless of shape. This ties in with present day use of the acre to quantify parcels of land whatever their shape.

        The <a href="NauticalMile.html">NauticalMile</a> does not fit neatly into this system.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           5400 <a href="NauticalMile.html">NauticalMile</a>s between the North Pole and the Equator.
        </li>
        <li>
           1 <a href="NauticalMile.html">NauticalMile</a> is one arc minute on a GreatCircle
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Measuring nautical miles using the latitude scale at the side of the chart is very convenient. Measuring depth by fathoms (6 feet, approximately the spread of a man's arms) is very convenient.

        The Imperial/US Customary system is a very sophisticated system, well suited for its purpose. That purpose being everyday use by people performing craft activities without special measuring equipment. It is pretty hopeless for automated scientific computation, but that's a relatively recent human activity. For almost all of its history the Imperial/Customary system was very flexible and effective.
      </p>

        A pound of most everyday materials is a couple of hands-full. It's easy to divide a pound into ounces (avoirdupois) by eye since there are a power of 2 ounces per pound (and drams per ounce, as it happens).
      </p>
      <p>
        Yards, rods, chains and furlongs relate well to areas measured in acres. And so on.
