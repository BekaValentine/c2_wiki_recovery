        A function is defined as a mapping between two sets. The notation for this is
      </p>
      <code>
        f: A -> B<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This means that the function <em>f</em> maps an element from set <em>A</em> to an element in set <em>B</em>. Or, more informally, <em>f</em> takes an argument of type <em>A</em>, and returns an argument of type <em>B</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Functions come in 3 flavours: Injection, Surjection and Bijection.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Injection</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A function f: A -> B is <em>one-to-one</em> if for all a1, a2 in A, a1 != a2 implies f(a1) != f(a2).
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also known as an injection. Informally, it means that no two elements in A map to the same element in B.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Surjection</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A function g: A -> B is <em>onto</em> if for all b in B, there exists a in A with g(a) = b.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is also known as a surjection. Informally, it means that all elements in B are mapped to. It is possible, unlike an injection, to have an element of B mapped to by more than one element in A.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Bijection</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A function is a bijection if it is both an injection and a surjection.
      </p>
      <p>
        If f: A -> B is one-to-one and onto, then it provides a <em>one-to-one correspondence</em> between the sets A and B. Informally, every element of A maps to exactly one element of B, and all elements of B are mapped to.
      </p>
      <p>
        You often see <em>one-to-one</em> (mis)used to mean <em>there is a one-to-one correspondence</em>.
