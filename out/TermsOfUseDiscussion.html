        Let's cut this down to the essentials. Anon says he's not banned; he is. It was announced in January, and he acknowledged it. Here's an example:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"As I'm sure you are all aware, the person who used to post as 82-44-94-98.cable.ubr04.croy.blueyonder.co.uk... is now using OpenProxy addresses to continue to post here, despite the announced <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>." January 20th, 2006.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Quite right too - as long as proxies are available, I will continue..." -- Anonymous vandal, the same day.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Anon's ISP has advised me to take this matter to the police. I am going to.
      </p>
      <p>
        No further conversation with the vandal will be undertaken. Further comments by the vandal will be deleted on sight. I invite all users to help in doing so. -- EarleMartin
