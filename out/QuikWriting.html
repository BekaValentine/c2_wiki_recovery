        Quik Writing
      </h1>
      <p>
        Quikwriting is a gesture-based character set input style with similar goals to <a href="PalmGraffiti.html">PalmGraffiti</a>. It requires fewer gestures than <a href="PalmGraffiti.html">PalmGraffiti</a>, and you don't need to pick up the stylus so it's much faster. However, it is much harder to learn than Graffiti.

      <p>
        Like the <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a>'s input style, these methods are just what the doctor ordered if you can't use a keyboard with your computer, but don't have enough computational muscle for handwriting recognition or (much harder) speech recognition. <em>Wreck a nice beach?</em>

      <p>
        To be usable, Quikwriting requires more looking at the writing area rather than at what has been written (compared with Graffiti), but this improves over time. It is better than the on-screen keyboard in this regard. The learning curve is rather steep. Less sensitive to external motion, it could be useful for those who have to input data on the move.
