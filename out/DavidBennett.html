      <p>
        My name is David Bennett and I <em>love</em> to build software. 
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest ever project turned into a company called POWERflex (<a href="http://www.pfxcorp.com).">http://www.pfxcorp.com).</a> It's a <a href="FourthGenerationLanguage.html">FourthGenerationLanguage</a> with <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> features, a language that compiled to an intermediate language long before there was <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> or <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> or <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>. Those guys are clever. Designing and implementing your own <a href="ObjectOrientedLanguage.html">ObjectOrientedLanguage</a> is really hard. Trust me.
      </p>
      <p>
        My fascination with <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> turned into another company called Monash.Net, now called Readify (<a href="http://www.readify.net).">http://www.readify.net).</a> We do <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> training and consultancy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I also like to build companies. This is not intended as a plug. It's just what I happen to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like thinking, talking, writing and doing: the philosophy of software, architecture, <a href="AbstractionAndElaboration.html">AbstractionAndElaboration</a>, design (all types), <a href="GeneticProgramming.html">GeneticProgramming</a>, <a href="DesignByContract.html">DesignByContract</a>, <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing, <a href="JoelOnSoftware.html">JoelOnSoftware</a>. And a few other things.
      </p>
