        Checked Exceptions Are Incompatible With Visitor Pattern
      </h1>
      <p>
        I consider the <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> to be a rather import design pattern. When a datastructure gets more complex than
        a kind of thing that a simple Vector (or List or whatever you prefer) it begins to make sense to separate
        the iteration algorithm separate from the code that is iterating over it. For some cases, making an iterator
        class makes sense, but when things get complex, the visitor pattern quickly begins to make a lot more sense.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, different visitors will throw radically different sets of exceptions. One that counts all the nodes will
        throw no exceptions. One that saves the datastructure to a file (or some other kind of stream) just might throw
        IOException.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's say we have:
      </p>
      <code>
        public interface DProcedure { public void call(DAGNode arg); }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public class DAGNode<br/>
        {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        public void WriteNode(java.io.OutputStream target) throws java.io.IOException;<br/>
        public void forAllReachableNodes(SProcedure proc);<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public class DAGTools {<br/>
        public static int CountReachableNodes(DAGNode node)<br/>
        {<br/>
        class ctr implements DProcedure {<br/>
        public int c;<br/>
        public void call(DAGNode arg)<br/>
        {<br/>
        c++;<br/>
        }<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ct = new ctr;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        node.forAllReachableNodes(ct);<br/>
        return ct.c;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public static void WriteAllReachableNodes(DAGNode node, OutputStream target)<br/>
        {<br/>
        class wtr implements DProcedure {<br/>
        public OutputStream target;<br/>
        public void call(DAGNode arg)<br/>
        {<br/>
        arg.WriteNode(target);<br/>
        }<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        wtr wr = new wtr();<br/>
        wr.target = target;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        node.forAllReachableNodes(wr);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        }
      </p>
      <p>
        Now then, consider what exception declaration belongs on the interface. Also consider that forAllReachableNodes
        on a <a href="DirectedAcyclicGraph.html">DirectedAcyclicGraph</a> is way too complex to make many copies of with different exception specifiers
        (normally a <a href="BluePaint.html">BluePaint</a> algorithm is used but that's not thread safe so something more complex is likely to be used
        in a library).
      </p>
      <p>
        This particular example is small enough that <a href="ExceptionTunneling.html">ExceptionTunneling</a> starts to look attractive (path of least resisitance), mainly
        because the callers forAllReachableNodes are always paired with its callees. I've seen code where that was not the case.
      </p>
      <p>
        Due to the <a href="ProblemWithSmallNumbers.html">ProblemWithSmallNumbers</a>, any example small enough to be readily understood is most likely solvable within one
        of the four methods described on <a href="TheProblemWithCheckedExceptions.html">TheProblemWithCheckedExceptions</a>. I have some metrics that suggest that in tightly coupled
        code things start getting too hairy for this somewhere around 100 classes. Loosely coupled code will save you for a while,
        but I think the thousand barrier for the whole project could easily cause this stuff to absolutely break down. Remember,
        all it takes is one exception converted to <a href="RuntimeException.html">RuntimeException</a> that should have been handled. That number will be a lot lower
        if there are any cyclic dependencies between classes (this happens more often than most people think) and exception
        specifiers get involved.
      </p>
      <p>
        The fundamental assumption of <a href="CheckedException.html">CheckedException</a>s is all declared exceptions can be thrown from any point that calls a method
        with that declaration. The <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> reveals this assumption to be faulty.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know, I could call this page CheckedExceptionsAreIncompatibleWithInterfaces if I wanted too.
      </p>

      <p>
        Consider an alternative that better adheres to <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a>: <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> is used to construct a <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>, which is then executed. The <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> is free to throw exceptions, but the constructor for the <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> is not (indeed, the constructor for the <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> should be <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>-free). With that design, there is no problem with <a href="CheckedException.html">CheckedException</a>s. There is, however, a space cost. With support for <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> or <a href="CallByName.html">CallByName</a> to construct the <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> as it is being executed, that space cost may also be avoided. <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>, of course, still costs <a href="OneMoreLevelOfIndirection.html">OneMoreLevelOfIndirection</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A well-designed programming language can take advantage of <a href="SeparateIoFromCalculation.html">SeparateIoFromCalculation</a> to optimize both - i.e. automatically removing/adding laziness where appropriate, knowing that doing so does not impact semantics, and even automatic <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> of <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> elements that won't be needed in the future. <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> support for procedure descriptions (i.e. functions with <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s) in place of <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s helps with the GC aspect, especially if compiling to <a href="ContinuationPassingStyle.html">ContinuationPassingStyle</a>. <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> uses monads to enforce this pattern, with <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> procedures being described by the IO monad.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow, <a href="CheckedException.html">CheckedException</a>s aren't irreconcilable with <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a>... not with a <a href="LayerOfIndirection.html">LayerOfIndirection</a> between them, anyway. <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> can serve as a <a href="FoldFunction.html">FoldFunction</a> to produce an executable <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> that will exhibit <a href="CheckedException.html">CheckedException</a> behavior only when executed. That doesn't mean <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> or <a href="CheckedException.html">CheckedException</a>s are <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>s, though. I still say <a href="CheckedExceptionsAreOfDubiousValue.html">CheckedExceptionsAreOfDubiousValue</a> and <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> is a <a href="LanguageSmell.html">LanguageSmell</a>.
