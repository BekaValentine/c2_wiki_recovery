        If Its Worse Than Mine Its Garbage

      <p>
        One of the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s.  Goes like this.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Assume that there is a metric for assessing the quality of something (overall, or in a given context), and a straightforward metric for determining this quality rating for any given something.  (Often times this assumption does not hold; but that doesn't stop anyone from practicing this fallacy)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The speaker has a something which has a quality score of <em>x</em> (higher is better).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Another party (a competitor, opponent, another researcher, whoever) has a solution which has a quality of <em>y</em>, where <em>y</em><<em>x</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Speaker then asserts that the minimum score for "acceptability" is <em>x</em>; anything scoring lower than <em>x</em> is unsatisfactory.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="IfItsWorseThanMineItsGarbage.html">IfItsWorseThanMineItsGarbage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a fallacy for several reasons.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Converting a multi-valued figure of merit (or a continuous or even qualitative one) to a binary figure of merit (pass/fail, good/bad, etc.) is not a trivial undertaking if it is to be done properly.  Such a determination must consider many factors--the intended use, the intended user, what is reasonable to expect given available technology.  Nor can it be made in a vacuum--the presence of competing solutions is well-known to RaiseTheBar.  The pass/fail criteria proposed by the speaker is often arbitrary--and in many case is selected for the purpose of being able to declare a competing solution garbage. Failure to do so is risking a <a href="FalseDichotomy.html">FalseDichotomy</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As mentioned above, even the multi-valued figure of merit may be dubious.  Is <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> better for writing business applications than <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>?  Damn straight.  Is it better than Fortran for high-performance number-crunching?  Not on your life.  Likewise for many other technologies.  Many peddlers/advocates of a technology make the assumption that the application in which their solution shines is the only application worth considering.  And this is assuming that it's possible to even determine a figure of merit--even a qualitative one--which can be observed and agreed upon.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A related fallacy is IfItsBetterThanMineItsOverDesigned--where it is asserted that any <em>improvement</em> over the speaker's preferred solution is superfluous.  Much of the above applies to that as well.
