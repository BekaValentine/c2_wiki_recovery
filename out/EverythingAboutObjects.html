        Everything About Objects

        <strong>Everything I Really Need to Know About Object-Oriented Design I Could Learn on a Black-Diamond Run.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Friends, I have, like you, struggled to understand the
        fine points of each of our methodologies as presented here the
        last few days.  And, I have been wondering if we aren't 
        making this all more complicated than it need be.  I wondered
        if designing isn't a lot like skiing, that is, easier to do
        than to explain or prescribe.  Then I realized: everything I really
        need to know about object-oriented design I could have 
        learned last weekend skiing Utah's black-diamond runs.  
        [Note, black diamonds mark the expert ski runs that had defeated 
        the speaker until recently.]
      </p>
      <p>
        What are these things that make designing (and skiing) a
        thrilling and natural activity?  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Look Three Bumps Ahead
        </li>
        <li>
           Use Your Edges
        </li>
        <li>
           Have No Fear (related info in <a href="MakeFearFuel.html">MakeFearFuel</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Why <em>three bumps ahead</em>?  Well, things come 
        pretty fast on those steep slopes.  When I'm looking 
        at my ski tips I may get through the first bump but
        I won't be ready for the second.  Same with software.
        But I can't make plans beyond three bumps ahead.  
        Things happen.  Conditions change.
        I must be prepared to revise my plans with every turn.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, to make these turns, I have to
        <em>use my edges</em>.  I can't twist and 
        turn my body to turn the skis;
        I must let the ski's edge do the work.  
        So, let me ask you, what's the object
        designer's edge?
      </p>
      <p>
        (silence)
      </p>
      <p>
        Polymorphic message sends!  That's what we use to turn
        a design around a bump.  We plan and balance our designs
        just so we can apply that edge when we need it, which in 
        practice is most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, while skiing or designing I must <em>have no fear</em>. 
        Fear will distract me
        from the relentless stream of decisions I
        must make to get down the slope or through the design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I met a woman last weekend
        that learned to ski here in Utah on the black-diamond runs.
        She started on them, before she knew they were to be feared.
        It worked.
        Likewise, I learned objects before I knew they were
        to be feared.  I learned them quickly and know them well.
      </p>
      <p>
        Could we be making too much of this object-oriented design
        business?  Could we really just be scaring people; selling
        fear, which sells quite well?  
        We should have more faith in people.  We should simply
        teach that objects introduce an <em>edge</em>, 
        that the edge lets us make sharp <em>turns</em>, 
        and that neither should be <em>feared</em>.

        I like your analogies. I have always liked the creative aspects of both skiing and software. Software is creative in  how you go about solving a problem. Within a set of constraints (the terrain), you can pick you own unique way of solving the problem (like you pick your own unique line). Both also have a lot to do with commitment. You commit to solving a problem as you have to commit to the fall line. Both experiences always teach me something new every time. -- <a href="MikeDolbear.html">MikeDolbear</a>

        You're right.  Being tentative ruins both good slopes and
        difficult projects.  There is plenty of time to think over your
        options while riding on the chair. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        "helicopter" that ends with a "face plant" that results in
        a "yard sale." -- <a href="DonOlson.html">DonOlson</a>

        I'm fairly sure design is not analogous to skiing, and I accuse you of gratuitously enthusing about your skiing holiday when you should be describing a computing methodology. -- Bill

        The meeting was held at a ski resort. It was hard not to think about skiing when the wall of windows in the conference room looked out over some of the finest skiing in North America. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
