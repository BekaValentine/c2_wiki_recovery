        Long Function Examples
      </h1>
      <p>
        A random collection of <a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a>, taken out from exemplary open-source programs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The collection is not intended to show master-pieces or otherwise perfect code, but to show that writing <a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a> is a common and normal occurrence in the life of most skilled and professional programmers. That's why they are really random, no careful study was done to select those examples who can serve as models or masterpieces. In comparison, I'd think anyone would be hard-pressed to select any model open-source projects of comparable complexity (JUnit may qualify but is nowhere near comparable in complexity) that will follow <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> religiously. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't think any of the short method advocates suggested that long methods weren't common and normal. Lots of bad practices are common and normal. That doesn't make them better.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Says <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a> that they are bad practices. Well, your mileage may vary, very reasonable people beg to differ from such opinionated nonsense.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why are your opinions just opinions while my opinions are opinionated nonsense? -- </em><a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, Eric's right, they are bad practices, at least in many people opinion, just go read <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, this has always been on the list, and rightly so. <a href="LongMethodSmell.html">LongMethodSmell</a>, very badly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, guys, your opinions are opinionated and nonsensical, because despite overwhelming evidence in many kinds of ways, despite repeatedly failing to challenges to argue your position <strong>correctly</strong> and <strong>coherently</strong>, which means a hell of a lot more than "I like it better this way therefore everybody <strong>should</strong> do the same". Well despite all that, you clutch at straws but maintain the same indiscriminate and exclusivist message (my way is the only right way - <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> is the only way to write professional code), instead of simply accepting that different people have reasonable different points of views, and some people, not the least of which a whole series of <a href="GrandMasterProgrammer.html">GrandMasterProgrammer</a>s , prefer a more subtle and flexible attitude. Not every method that exceeds <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>' or <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a>s power of comprehension can be qualified as a bad practice example.
      </p>
      <p>
        In spite of having that minimum courtesy and respect for some people fellow programmers, who have shown more than cheap talk on wiki, and therefore allow for a different point of views, you insist on calling what other people consciously decide to do "bad practices", "bad software engineering", "piss poor quality", etc. Well, boys, you are way out of your league. Nobody wants to stick <a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a> down your throat, but when you want to stick your illusions of what's really important in <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> down everybody else's throat, you are way out of your league. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps function length isn't "really important" in your definition of software engineering, but imagine that you owned a company that developed and owned software as intellectual property. The sales of this software would provide income for shareholders and employees as long as you could keep it competitive. Would you (and your shareholders and employees) rather have methods that were easily comprehended by <a href="GrandMasterProgrammer.html">GrandMasterProgrammer</a>s or <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>? -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>We are arguing past each other. I believe that your perception of those arguing against you is much more extreme than reality. The point being made is that short clear methods are better than long involved methods, and that when presented with a long involved method, it is almost always possible to improve the code by splitting it into shorter methods (do we agree to this point?).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, I hope I'm not confusing distinct opinions, but there at least some proponents who expressed something that cannot be qualified as other than extreme and extreme nonsense at that. For example that all the code below is "piss poor", or an example of bad practices, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've added just one more example, that can be qualified for sure as a display of mastery in the art of programming, by somebody who is undeniably <a href="GrandMasterProgrammer.html">GrandMasterProgrammer</a>, furthermore a piece of code who was designed <strong>on purpose</strong> to be a long function, a very long function at that (while the other examples , being taken at random maybe objected to on the grounds that the developers may have put the algorithm together in a hurry and not have enough time to refactor, may contain subtle bugs, etc, etc), but this later example cannot be objected on any such grounds. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What you appear to be arguing is that this improvement is marginal in comparison to many other improvements that could be made. Nobody has denied this. Short methods don't solve everything - they just solve some things. What we </em>are<em> advocating is that if you have a choice between writing one long method and writing two short methods, try to go the route of the two short methods. -- </em><a href="DanielSheppard.html">DanielSheppard</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I can agree with whatever you think you are advocating providing that you can reach a consensus on what is a short method (is 20 lines of code too much to you? how about 50? how about 100?), on what exactly influences the choice ( I hope you're not arguing that in general a 4 liner is better refactored to a two line method invoking two others 2 liners, neither, for example that 12 is better than 6 + 6 + 2 or any other nonsense like that, and provided that you can think of reasonable exceptions to such a rule. And provided that you add yet another provision that <strong>the best judgement of a competent and responsible programmer in the particular context of a project</strong> always overrides whatever <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> dogma promoted on wiki. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then maybe we are in agreement after all. 
      </p>

        It is not - as some people have interpreted - intended to show that <a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a> is always the way to go. The intent is to show that <a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a> are just a normal option like many other options, and making too much fuss that a method is too long (by some standards >10 lines or > 1 screen) is much ado about nothing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I can provide many examples of wars in which civilian casualties are high, yet there are relatively few examples of wars with low civilian casualties. Does that mean that advocating low civilian casualties is "making much ado about nothing"? For each of these examples, it can be argued that breaking down the methods will make them easier to understand. The fact that such change has not occurred is beside the point. Everybody is in rampant agreement that the writing of long methods occurs.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        In an industry where something like 90% of projects fail, you can't make too much fuss about losing bad practices like this. I'm very surprised that someone actually tried to defend the code. While it may be common looking code from your average open source project, it certainly could use a lot of improvement. There's plenty to be fixed in just about every sample shown that could help clarify the intent of the code for future reading of it. Just because code works doesn't mean it makes its intent clear, and clarity is far far more important if the code is expected to live for a while. Unmaintainable unreadable code just gets rewritten rather than reused. While any one of these could be understood with a little effort, a program full of these would be absolute hell to maintain and extend, let alone grow through a few versions. Code should require far more than simply working, to be kept around for the long haul, it should be clear, readable, well factored, dare I say "agile". I'm really beginning think these agile method guys are the only ones who really know what they're doing anymore. Page after page of people defending bad practices like this, what's going on?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, if it is true that >90% of the projects fail, you may consider it somehow related to the following factors:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           dismal education of the workforce
        </li>
        <li>
           disdain for <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and Mathematics
        </li>
        <li>
           Oh, and related to "agile". You may think about that your average programming dude is much more likely to have read the latest Martin Fowler or Uncle Bob, "easy reading" texts, littered with toy examples (well, but short methods nevertheless) and absolutely no Mathematics or anything worthy to be called <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, while the same guys wouldn't read "A Discipline of Programming" unless their lives depended on it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I'd have to enumerate a ton more of other crappy things that happen in the industry before I'd even start considering that people writing unnecessary </em><a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a> may be a significant factor, while I can serve you plenty of examples of <a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a> where <strong></strong><a href="ItJustWorks.html">ItJustWorks</a><em>'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And besides, it is easy to recognize for anybody remotely experienced with the level of programming out there in the wild, that if some team or half that team ( probably including myself in this sample, I know for a fact that one guy is a much better programmer than me ), is on the same level of programming capacity with some of the guys who produced the code examples on this page, that team would not have absolutely any worry for the next deadline.</em>

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't find these that "long". They don't fit in a single screen, but they are hardly what I call long. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The metrics on </em><a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a>, the genesis of this page, range from "5 to 9 lines", to "one screen." To a procedural programmer, these functions certainly may not look over-long, but to a <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> programmer, they would. See the discussion on <a href="LongFunctions.html">LongFunctions</a> (which needs more refactoring after it cools).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        All perfect examples of why long methods are bad. Cryptic variable names, poorly named methods, complete lack of abstraction, you can't even tell what these methods do without reading and executing the code in your head. This code was clearly hacked up, regardless of the projects they came from, they are all examples of how not to write code. No one is claiming good projects can't have bad code, obviously they do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree these aren't examples of "good/readable" code, but their flaws don't seem related to just being a long function. They seem more like unrelated problems. Cryptic variable names and poorly named methods have nothing to do with whether a function is long or not. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree, they have many problems, being overly long, at this point, is just one of many many bad things about these samples. If there were bugs in this code, it'd be very hard to find for someone who didn't write that code.  
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This page is becoming borderline ridiculous. Who is exactly qualifying these examples as piss-poor code? The more likely explanation is that you guys are pissing in your pants when you see a little longer algorithmics.
      </p>
      <p>
        First of all, these examples are taken from successful and highly non-trivial projects, therefore a little bit of deference and presumption of professionalism and skillful programming should apply to the authors of these code pieces, some of which may have extra credentials through their significant contribution to <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>. As opposed for the coward commentators that didn't sign I'd presume them as mediocre or average programmers just by the rush with which they jumped to throw their negative judgements. More experienced programmers, having confronted with situations in which they wrote similar code, and being aware of the effort and the many issues involved are much more reluctant to easily condemn other people code, especially code in successful projects.
      </p>
      <p>
        But let's look over the real or imaginary issues, shall we?
      </p>
      <p>
        There's this issue that you do not understand what these functions do "at a glance", among other things because of bad naming. Boys, and girls, these examples are extracted from their context in complex projects, involving complex algorithms (with the exception of C code which is rather simple). The authors could have named those functions anything that you wished for other than putting the description of the whole thing in the name. As a matter of fact there's <strong>no dubious naming at all in the Java code</strong>. You still wouldn't have much of a clue what's happening!
      </p>

        It is not like those "get this byte from here move it to there and store it in the database". That's the danger of being brainwashed by <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> books who only operate with kindergarten examples. Boys and girls this is about <strong>real code</strong> with <strong>real complex algorithms</strong>. The way to understand this code is by having an introduction to the context, anm introduction to the algorithms involved, and as most open source projects are low in documentation, presumably by asking their authors. ut this is an independent problem of writing long functions. You can write some of these algorithms in Smalltalk if you will, you won't make the code self-documenting, because the complexity of the algorithms involved is just so much more than any naming convention may handle. Once you master the algorithms either from a formal documentation or from direct interaction with the author (as this is open source after all), you won't likely to have any major objection to the understandability of the code above (well, except for the C snippet), but that's a separate issue. But such understanding cannot come from <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> in these cases, or any cases involving more than trivial algorithms.

        There's the raised issue of bad naming. Frankly speaking, I can recognize bad naming only in the C code, and <strong>I'm not at all willing to jump in and be judgemental</strong> of that guy, because purely and simply this is is the prevailing naming scheme in C culture to begin with, and even here on Wiki we have had a little controversy with PanuKaliokolski over his thesis that in some context very short names make for better readability. So whatever, that particular code is kind of simple anyways, the extra effort to accommodate to the naming scheme is quite minimal. The names used in the other examples are pretty normal I think, and I can't quite understand at all what the hell anyone can object to the names used in Java examples. Add to that the fact that we discuss about the length of these functions, we're not discussing naming, and let's move over.

        There's the last "issue" raised, about the "complete lack of abstraction". That's extraordinarily laughable. Hey guys, welcomem to the real code of writing code and being productive and efficient. If you write a function that will output the minimal length string representation of a floating point number, you have to do just that. Having more abstraction that a simple function that iterates through the decimal places, is by any reasonable standard just unnecessary <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> and is something not commendable at all. IOt looks to me that all these examples are just about at the right level of abstraction. For the guy who is probably not accustomed to OCAML: please pay attention that it has anonymous inner function. That doesn't make them less abstract than if you'd have taken them out at the top level and given them a bogus name. The accusation of "complete lack of abstraction" is completely bogus. All except the C example have plenty of abstractions used, while the C example, well, you cannot more concrete than this kind of concreteness and introducing unnecessary abstraction when you have to write some very simple and concrete thing is the most exemplary <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> I can think of.

        Let's go one step further, though. No code is perfect so there always can be improvements. Let's say that the examples above could use some improvements (however it will not be about those ridiculous claims made above). However, these examples represent real working code from real working projects. Quite exemplary projects and code at that! The thing related to LongFunction though, is that most programmers including the examples we have from <a href="GrandMasterProgrammer.html">GrandMasterProgrammer</a>s, will write complex algorithmics just like the code above, at least during the initial ram up of the project (the first write of such a code). Most of us will not write towards <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> from the get go, and there's no real argument put forward so far that writing algorithmics towards <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> is going to help in any way shape or form, other than the alleged advantages for later maintenance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then you'd probably agree that if it is reasonable for programmers to write code like this in open source, does it seem reasonable if we go back to them with the observation: hey refactor this code because we discussed it on wiki we think that it can "look better"? That would be just about ridiculous for open source software, not to mention absolutely ridiculous to tell it to somebody like <a href="DonaldKnuth.html">DonaldKnuth</a>. Hey, the code is working, the guy who wrote it understands it, with just a tiny bit of effort and good will you can understand it also, the only decent conclusion is that the code is more than <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> for the purpose and the context. The effort involved in <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> such pieces and bits to "look better" for whatever is your subjective evaluation of "better" is just ridiculous to be wasted compared to the many issues that are faced by a participant in a complex open-source project.

        Is there situation significantly different in commercial settings? Well, I don't know on what planet you work on, and what kind of projects you develop, but all I can tell you is my experience. As an "architect in charge", team lead, code reviewer, and code writer on significant scale, if anybody on my team would have code like the above, first of all I'd be proud, but if anybody would spend a couple of hours or more to try to refactor any of the code samples above into "better looking" code, I'd say his nuts. Simply put on most projects I worked where the results were needed yesterday, there's no way you can justify such <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> activities. Yep, you can do it as a sport on wiki, but in most commercial settings you can. You can only justify refactoring activities in largely two cases:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the code is bad in <strong>essential ways</strong> (including having bugs that need refatcoring as a precondition to resolution)
        </li>
        <li>
           the code needs to support more or different functionality.
        </li>

        Personally I can't understand most of this but I don't know why I would be expected to, as somebody who has thought very little about the nuts-and-bolts implementation of, say, Apache. Certainly we can find examples of long functions in successful open source projects. But correspondence does not imply causation. Are these projects successful because of their long functions, or in spite of them? -- francis

        <em>Francis, why do you think you are qualified to raise the hypothesis that it's inspite of them?

      <p>
        Costin, I agreed with you when you were arguing against the dogma that long functions are always bad. But your more recent arguments have shifted to say that those who prefer reading short functions must be stupid and incapable of handling complexity. These examples are not algorithms that are especially complex, elegant, or subtle; they are simply harder to read than they need to be. Yes, many professional programmers write code like this (I have myself), but none of us should be satisfied with such results.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the above examples work, I wouldn't change them just for the sake of changing them. However, if I am asked to fix a bug, or to change their behavior, then I would have to start by breaking them up into easier-to-grasp pieces. I would not consider this activity to be <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> nor a waste of time; it is my way of analyzing code and presenting this analysis to future readers of the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you arguing that none of these examples could be improved by breaking them up a little? You are fond of <a href="AdVerecundiam.html">AdVerecundiam</a> arguments: can you find some quotes from your beloved heroes where they argued against breaking down problems into simpler pieces?

      </p>
      <p>
        Kris, I'm not arguing against breaking problems into simpler pieces, I'm arguing against the prejudice that the gold standard for "simple piece" is 5-9 lines of code. A "simple piece" should be no more nor less than what's <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> for that situation (including factors like the personality of the programmer, the overall culture related to the project and the language used, etc). For example I might do some renaming of variables in the C code, but I wouldn't feel any significant improvement by breaking it into smaller functions. It's bloody obvious as it is. I'm arguing that we are not in a position to judge that the above examples can be <strong>essentially improved</strong> by breaking them into smaller pieces.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing, Kris, you say you'd refactor it if you were to fix a bug or change their behaviour, and that's obviously because you don't understand them as they are now. But have you weighed the other factor, the fact that you're not familiar with the algorithms and the context in which they are used? Aren't you trying to judge this pieces of code against an unrealistic standard: that somebody reading them oput of context in wiki should feel comfortable? For example, I don't have a more than superficial comprehension either for anything but the apache C example, but even the language scan level understanding of what's in there allows me to predict quite confidently that if I was to jump into these projects, and being familiar with the context and the algorithms, I wouldn't have any major objection to the shape that the code samples are in right now. Please note with regards to the OCAML example: it is very well factored in small inner functions that just do not have names, and make the top level function look long, but structurally it's made of lots of little pieces that are really functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        I guess a more relevant question would be: assuming you'd have written such code yourself, and having a full grasp of it, are you sure you'll want to unconditionally refactor it the next time you touch it? I, for one, am inclined to respond: most likely no. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm sure I'm more likely to refactor than you are, but I'll have to give a wishy-washy <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a> answer: I'll refactor whenever I need to. Refactoring is something I do for myself, not for others. I don't try to guess what will make sense to other people; I figure I am not much smarter and not much stupider than anyone else, so if it makes sense to me, it will make sense to them.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I immediately see that changing a couple of lines will achieve the desired effect, then I won't bother refactoring it. But if it won't all fit in my brain, I'll break it up until it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things sometimes go the other way: when trying to figure out what <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> do, sometimes I'll inline them together into one function to get the big picture. If I think the long assembled function makes more sense, I'll leave it that way. Again, this refactoring is not <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> or wasted time, in my opinion, and I don't hesitate to do it if I feel the need, nor will I condemn others who do it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We agree that functions should be as long as they need to be, and that is often longer than what the Smalltalkers-who-write-books have decreed to be good.

        <em>Well, I guess I din't make myself properly understood. I don't have a contempt for those who write </em>LotsofShortMethods: let them be happy, it's their style, not exactly my style. But I do have a contempt for those who are judgemental on these code examples without understanding the context of the project, whether they fit the bill or not, how the guy who wrote them originally understands them. The bottom line is that if these code examples are working and fit the bill than there's absolutely nothing to sneeze at, even related to their length. In my judgement they are perfectly OK, and even if I had some doubts, they'd have to break some significant threshold of unpleasantness, before I would make a judgement, in absence of context and understanding, that the initial developer has screwed up. It is simply a matter of collegial respect shown to the guys who wrote this code in projects that are really complex on one hand, and on the other hand projects that really work. And that should prevent us from using phrases like "these are piss poor code examples" or "no professional code should look like that".

        From a quick glance at the Kawa java code, you could probably save a few lines and increase readability by using exceptions rather than using the tr.syntaxError method + return. I don't know the surrounding scope, but it's setting a lot of instance variables before throwing out the syntax error. If this extra context isn't needed, I'd move all the error checking to the start and break it out into a separate method(s). The comment in the middle describing the structure of a string seems to be crying out for the string to be replaced by an object. I'm too lazy to be bothered figuring out what's going on at the end of the method - it could probably do with some cleaning up.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these decisions may have been made for performance reasons, and if that's the case they should probably be commented as such.

        There seems to be a lot of problems with the Kawa code - at least as far as my tastes are concerned. The argument <em>rules</em> comes in as an Object. Isn't there some common interface that all rules can implement? Things like <em>#length</em> or <em>#isPair</em>? This line seems odd:
      </p>
      <code>
        int rules_count = LList.listLength(rules, false);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        What does it mean when I pass false to a method asking the length of a linked list? There's a lot of stuff like this. Things that should be factored into methods on higher-level objects (<em>capturedDeclarations</em> should be something other than an array that has an #addBinding method) or sections of code that can be factored into sub-routines (good candidates are all the sections of code delimited by nested try...catch blocks or in for loops). Might be an interesting exercise to refactor these code snippets. But for me, one of the problems with the code is that it is indeed too long. Rarely can I easily understand code this long. -- <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

However, that <strong>does not</strong> mean I would hold it up as an example of great programming. They are the things we try to sweep and hide in corners of our code. I don't understand this concept of <a href="GrandMasterProgrammer.html">GrandMasterProgrammer</a> as it is being used here. Who cares?

I wonder when it will come the time when people will acuse me of incompetence or unprofessionalism for writing something that is greater than 10 lines of code.<em></em>

        <em>You recognize such "messes we sometimes have to create when being productive", but why call them "messes" then, why not let them have a proper role as part of the normal software engineering activity?

If you, me, some of these master programmers, and many many other competent programmers do not write such algorithmics in <a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> style, maybe it is because writing in such style is not feasible or has other drawbacks, it doesn't make sense in the context of a particular project.

It is interesting to note that you don't see your argument as being just as hard-core as those who say functions should only be 5-9 lines long. I tend to not take such black and white points of views. I attempt to make my methods as small, readable, and maintainable as possible. Sometimes I succeed, sometimes I don't. Every one who has every worked on a large scale project has code in there they are not happy with. One just has to sometimes learn to live with things they are unhappy with and always strive to improve when one can.

      <p>
        Optimized code it may be, beautiful it is not. In general, optimizing code means that you have to sacrifice beauty and readability in order to get the best out of your compiler. I assume that this is the reason for such a large, hideous piece of code as the sample given, though I am not convinced it is necessarily true --- modern compilers are very good at inling functions, and optimizing across function call boundaries, etc. In particular, I find the #ifdefs grating --- take the code that includes the #ifdef and put it in a meaningfully named function, such as "convertArrayToCorrectByteOrder". Not only does this make the original code better express intent, since the function name explains what is being done, but it moves the #ifdefs out of the way of the main function --- you only see them if you really need to know how the low level function is implemented. If this is an example of a "good" long function, I am glad I advocate small functions. Even the Apache sample (which is shorter than this one) strikes me as too long, with clear opportunities for splitting.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, my code sometimes contains long functions, but I am not proud of it, and I split them into smaller parts whenever I get the opportunity. Though I can see upwards of 70 lines on screen at once in my editor, I prefer functions to be less than 30 lines; the shorter the better.

        The apr_gcvt C example is interesting. The code seems to fall into distinct steps. For example, there is a bit which turns a number like 345 into the string "+345". I think the code would be easier to read if there was at least a comment explaining that's what that part did. Then, if I wanted to change the code (eg to make the '+' optional) I could find the place to change more easily.
      </p>
      <p>
        That part would also make a possible sub-function. It is self-contained with few arguments or results. Extracting it would reduce the burden of the main function. Repeatedly extracting chunks like that would lead to the main function being about 6 lines long, and written at a higher level of abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        The downside is that the little sub-function would lose context. For example, it assumes its number has no more than 3 digits. Even though it looks general, it's rather specialised. We could give it a very special name, and add assertions to make its assumptions explicit, and hopefully give it local scope so that it couldn't be called from places where those assumptions were invalid. Alternative we could generalise it to any number of digits, turn it into atoi() and allow its reuse elsewhere. If the latter we'd have to solve the harder problem and we might not be able to use the same efficient solution. We might also need to parameterise it a bit more, eg for the caller to say whether the '+' is optional.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way the code would become more complex. We'd be going from one large function with a complexity of about 1, to, say, 6 small ones each with a complexity about 0.3, so the total complexity would double. However, that refactoring would arguably be easier to work with because we'd usually be dealing with just one sub-function at a time. The complexity in the other functions doesn't matter because we'd ignore it. --<a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
