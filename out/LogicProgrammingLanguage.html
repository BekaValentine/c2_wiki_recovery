        Logic Programming Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A logic programming language is a <a href="DeclarativeLanguage.html">DeclarativeLanguage</a> based on the application of <a href="PredicateLogic.html">PredicateLogic</a>. <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> is the prime example.

        There's also <a href="MercuryLanguage.html">MercuryLanguage</a>, <a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a>... Lots of others, I'm sure. I think <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a> is a really powerful tool for decision-making. I don't know if I'd ever want to write major applications in it, but having an InferenceEngine around is really slick.

        There's also <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a> ... <a href="http://brownbuffalo.sourceforge.net/">http://brownbuffalo.sourceforge.net/</a> has some great examples for teaching constraint logic programming with finite domains using Eclipse, which seems to be a lot like prolog. Eclipse is a pain to download (you have to fax stuff), but I found I could follow the examples fairly easily using <a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a>, another <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a> language.

        Common Logic Controlled English (CLCE) <a href="http://www.jfsowa.com/clce/specs.htm">http://www.jfsowa.com/clce/specs.htm</a> is a language for logic in English-like syntax proposed by John F. Sowa. An implementation of the language in Scheme can be found at <a href="http://www.leidig-online.de/torsten/archives/2004-12.html#e2004-12-31T15_59_46.txt.">http://www.leidig-online.de/torsten/archives/2004-12.html#e2004-12-31T15_59_46.txt.</a>

        Logical statements read much like ordinary English and easier to understand as the following sample statements show:
      </p>
      <code>
        Every person has some person as mother.<br/>
        ;<br/>
        Every cat is on a mat.<br/>
        ;<br/>
        Some person is between a dog and a blue cat.<br/>
        ;<br/>
        If some person x is the mother of a person y,<br/>
        then y is a child of x.<br/>
      </code>

        <em>The original version could be called a logic language, due to the backtracking feature (very similar to </em><a href="AmbSpecialForm.html">AmbSpecialForm</a>.) No modern implementation has that feature, unfortunately.<em></em>
