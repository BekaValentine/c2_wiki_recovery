        Quality Isa Feature
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many projects are managed by features. This makes sense as customers
        pay for and track features, people work on features, features are
        tested and integrated. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately quality is often not considered a feature. Improving the
        system is frowned upon because it is risky. Work related to features
        is ok, but work on related to quality is not. Therefor the system
        does not improve. It may degrade because there is emphasis placed
        on changes the don't cut across the system and that change the fewest
        files.
      </p>
      <p>
        Quality is a feature. Have a quality feature in every release or your
        system is degrading.
