        Vague Identifier
      </h1>
      <p>
        This generally happens when the <a href="OneResponsibilityRule.html">OneResponsibilityRule</a> has been violated. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Example: An identifier for a class is given a very vague name because each meaningful name for the class is incomplete; it only describes part of the use of the class and not its whole responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than fix the class with refactoring, the author takes the short cut and invents a name that doesn't clearly mean anything in order to avoid disinformation.

        Can also happen in a well-factored class or method if the programmer is simply sloppy about naming things. I once came across a method called <strong>boolean </strong>NumVal(String)<strong>. Nuts. I had to search for the method's code before I found out that it returns </strong>true<strong> if every character in the string is a digit. I could think of a dozen better names for that method.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is <strong></strong>NumVal<strong> a bad name?</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Does not describe what the method does.  (It's not a verb, so how could it? -- See: <a href="NounsAndVerbs.html">NounsAndVerbs</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Does <strong>val</strong> stand for <em>value</em> or <em>validate</em>?
        </li>
        <li>
           The method does not validate all numbers. In particular, it will reject numbers with decimal points or signs.
        </li>
        <li>
           So it really checks for natural number (integer >= 0).
        </li>
        <li>
           Except that there is no (practical) limit on the size of the number.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There may be valid reasons for the method to have these limitations, but the name of the method should reflect this.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If I saw a method called NumVal, I'd instantly expect it to return a numeric representation of the object whose method it is.</em>
