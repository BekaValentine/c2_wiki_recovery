        An American laundry detergent company marketing a pre-soak named Whisk
        invented a terrible scourge of laundresses everywhere - <a href="RingAroundTheCollar.html">RingAroundTheCollar</a>. It consists of the slight discoloration at the inside collar of the typically white shirts worn by typical American middle-class office workers. It is not seen by anyone other than the person doing laundry (due to the wearing of neckties), and is usually solved by the periodic bleaching of the white shirts (to handle stains elsewhere). Yet it was the bane of housewives across the nation.

        Long, insipid television commercial series always featured a housewife publicly humiliated when someone points out her husband's collar. About as politically correct as marketing a soap called "ERA" at a time when the USA refused to ratify the EqualRightsAmendment.
