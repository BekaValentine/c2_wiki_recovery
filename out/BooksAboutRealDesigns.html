        Books About Real Designs
      </h1>
      <p>
        Books describing the design and implementation of significant programs, all the way from overall philosophy down through the source code.

        <li>
           <strong></strong>ProjectOberon: The design of an operating system and compiler<strong>, by </strong><a href="NiklausWirth.html">NiklausWirth</a>. [ISBN 0201544288]. Describes the complete <a href="OberonOperatingSystem.html">OberonOperatingSystem</a> and compiler. This is an amazing account of applying <a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a> to operating system design.

           <strong></strong>TheArchitectureOfConcurrentPrograms<strong>, by </strong>PerBrinchHansen. [ISBN 0130446289]. Thoroughly describes three small special-purpose operating systems. Includes a very instructive example of using performance analysis to drive the design of concurrency and buffering in a system, among many other things. <em>29-Oct-2002: There are currently a lot of cheap second-hand copies of this book available via </em><a href="http://www.bookfinder.com/''">http://www.bookfinder.com/''</a>

      <p>
        These books are true classics, don't be put off by the publication dates.

        Side note: TheArchitectureOfConcurrentProgram includes a quotation of <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>, which surprised me since the book was published in 1977! It also appears on <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>'s <a href="GreatSoftwareBooks.html">GreatSoftwareBooks</a> list.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why does the reference to Alexander surprise you? There are mentions of his work on design in the proceedings of the original "software engineering" conferences, back in the late 60's</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It surprised me because I didn't know that. :-)

        The Practical Guide to Enterprise Architecture by <a href="JamesMcGovern.html">JamesMcGovern</a> also has good case studies on applying measures of goodness to large projects.

        Don't forget <a href="LiterateProgramming.html">LiterateProgramming</a> books! The LCC book (<em>A Retargetable C Compiler: Design and Implementation</em> by Fraser and Hanson) is one great example. So is <em>C Interfaces and Implementations</em> - it's about how to write reusable libraries (with a focus on C), API design, etc. Highly recommended, whatever language(s) you use. --<a href="ScottVokes.html">ScottVokes</a>

        <a href="PayrollExample.html">PayrollExample</a> discusses an arguable example of such.
