        What We Wanted All Along
      </h1>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, we can't see the future.  And the ones of us that can probably downplay it as mere coincidence. <a href="WhatWeWantedAllAlong.html">WhatWeWantedAllAlong</a> is what we rejected in the first place. Only now that we know what it is, we are able to have a better appreciation for it.

        Case in point: How many <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>s duplicate features of <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> in some way? I've been through a couple of them and recently having moved back to <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>, I can say that it, more or less, is what I wanted in the first place.

        If what you want is Smalltalk, wonderful!  Use Smalltalk.  It's a fine language.
      </p>
      <p>
        OTOH, it's rude to insist that what <em>we</em> (meaning the programming community as a whole) want ought to be Smalltalk as well; many of us have very good reasons (besides "the boss said no") for choosing something else.  Even something that might be clearly inferior in some important fashion.
