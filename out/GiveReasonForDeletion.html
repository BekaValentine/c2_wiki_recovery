        Give Reason For Deletion
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's at the individual's discretion to delete a page, but deletion without reason is unacceptable.
      </p>
      <p>
        I propose a new guideline: <strong>Any page deletion without a reason will be auto-reverted regardless of the page's content.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words: Simply putting "delete" on a page is unacceptable and considered anti-social behaviour. If it needs to be deleted, give a reason.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hard to enforce automatically.  And what if the deletion is on the grounds that it's "offensive nonsense"?  A legitimate complaint for some things (i.e. somebody posting Holocaust denial), but something which can be applied to any post whatsoever.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well - not completely automatically, but I plan on autoreverting any page deleted without reason. Putting "delete - offensive nonsense" *is* a reason.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>Note!</strong>  When adding comments after the word "delete" the page needs to be less than fifty characters long. (This page won't delete even though it says delete over and over.)

      <p>
        <em>Unacceptable</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "delete"
        </li>
        <li>
           "delete - all your base are belong to us"
        </li>
        <li>
           "delete - I hate the poster" (Dumb, inflammatory)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Acceptable</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "delete - offensive nonsense"
        </li>
        <li>
           "delete - spam"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>This isn't a guideline for whether pages should be deleted or not - it's just a guideline for when they are.</em>

        <em>The problem is, vandals will then give a bogus reason for their deletion.  As a </em>WikiSocialNorm, I'm all for <a href="GiveReasonForDeletion.html">GiveReasonForDeletion</a>--I often revert deletions (assuming good faith) made without an explanation, unless the content is obvious rubbish, or unless it's somebody deleting their own stuff.  But I wouldn't enforce it.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't really have a problem with them putting a bogus reason - because we can then evaluate it's "bogosity". It's the deletion with no reason that causes problems because there is nothing to evaluate.
