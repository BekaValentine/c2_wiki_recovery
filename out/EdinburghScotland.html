        Kent, if that's you, I thought you'd have realised after Sardinia that Scots live for the chance to make Americans look stupid.  It's actually pronounced "Throat-Wobbler-Mangrove", I just wanted the yanks to look dumb saying "Embra" :-) --<a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>  <em>You're a very silly man and I'm not going to interview you!</em>

        British toponyms are notorious traps for the uninitiated. Leicester is my personal favorite.

        ... And also a haven of peurile humour... I work near a place called Haseley Nob, which sounds like a particularly nasty affliction. And you'll <em>never</em> guess what the local graffiti artists did to the signs pointing to Snitterfield. -- <a href="JayBell.html">JayBell</a>

        I used to live in an area of Coventry called "Cheylesmore". Some people pronounce it "Chay-als-more" like it's spelled. Some people pronounce it "Charles' Moor".. the next area round is called Styvechale, and pretty much anything starting with an S is considered a viable attempt at pronouncing it..

        Hey I live in Coventry!   But toponyms get more fun further South.... Towcester ("toaster") and Bicester  ("bister") confused me ... and oddly-named villages in the Cotswolds.  <a href="BillWeston.html">BillWeston</a>
