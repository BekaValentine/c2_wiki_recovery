        <a href="BillTrost.html">BillTrost</a> got a bee in his bonnet and wrote a <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> <a href="TestingFramework.html">TestingFramework</a> for the <a href="IconLanguage.html">IconLanguage</a> and a white paper for <a href="EaseSoftware.html">EaseSoftware</a>. The white paper is at <a href="http://www.ease.com/company/whitepapers/trost-200212-IconUnit.htm">http://www.ease.com/company/whitepapers/trost-200212-IconUnit.htm</a> -- go to the bottom of the paper for a reference to the framework itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As of April 2011, the paper is still present but the framework is gone. The paper makes it pretty clear how to implement the framework, though.</em>

        The abstract from Bill's paper is as follows:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This paper describes a unit testing framework for </em><a href="IconLanguage.html">IconLanguage</a> (<a href="http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/),">http://www.cs.arizona.edu/icon/),</a> a programming language with novel features such as expressions that may produce sequences of results and goal-directed evaluation. Most unit testing frameworks are written for object-oriented languages with exception handling mechanisms. By contrast, Icon is a procedural language whose unusual semantics make a straightforward implementation of a testing framework challenging. The testing framework uses Icon's sophisticated control flow facilities and its primitive preprocessor to create a functional, albeit aesthetically crude, unit testing framework.<em></em>

        <a href="BillTrost.html">BillTrost</a> gave the Tuesday, March 4, 2000 Portland XP group talk. He volunteered to talk about his <a href="IconUnit.html">IconUnit</a> <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> software. The talk is only about half an hour, so if anyone would like to hear about additional, related material, let Bill know.
