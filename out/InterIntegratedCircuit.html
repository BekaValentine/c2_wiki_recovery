        Inter Integrated Circuit
      </h1>
      <p>
        IIC (or I2C) stands for <a href="InterIntegratedCircuit.html">InterIntegratedCircuit</a>, also (and usually) pronounced <a href="EyeSquaredCee.html">EyeSquaredCee</a>.  The two is typically superscripted like the standard mathematical notation for exponentiation; <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> doesn't allow us to write super or subscripts currently.

        It is a 2-wire, clocked serial bus developed by PhilipsSemiconductor as an inexpensive, electronically simple way of communicating between the various ICs in a complex circuit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is enabled directly in a variety of MicroProcessors and MicroControllers, and a purpose-built controller, the PCF8584 (also by Philips).
      </p>
      <p>
        It can be called a semi-synchronous, session-framed, bit-serial, byte-acknowledged protocol.  It is the foundation for a widely used protocol convention, the AccessBus.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using IIC, several small, inexpensive devices, each with its own control duties, can be chained together with a central controller.  Quite useful in modular device systems.
