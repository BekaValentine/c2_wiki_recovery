        I'm into AnalyzingWiki. I just don't look a lot at the contents, but at the activities.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems the huge majority of the people who make an edit just make one edit.
        Finally, I've got all into a block_graphics.
        When I make both the x_axis and the y_axis use a logarithmic scale, I just see a straight line, going down, with a small hump at the end - something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        |\ <br/>
        | \ <br/>
        |  \	  y-axis = log(number of people)<br/>
        |   \	  x-axis = log(number of pages)<br/>
        |    \ <br/>
        |     \/\	<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (see also end of page, if luck is on)
      </p>
      <p>
        So the graphics show how many people edited how many pages.
      </p>
      <p>
        I think this graphics show a general rule. For instance in all kind of sports.
      </p>
      <code>
        Most people aren't involved at all.<br/>
        A lot of people are involved a little.<br/>
        Some people are involved a lot. <br/>
        Only very few people are involved a real lot<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I figure when you study how many people are involved in a sport, and you measure the time they spent in this sport and put these two values in a loglog graphic, it will generate a straight line. 
      </p>

        This is contrary to a normal distribution, well maybe someone can explain this some day later. <em>Why would you expect a normal distribution in the first place?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        About the lump: The most active people also do a lot of small edits. The people in this lump are the real community. The lump causes the self-repairing activity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Q</strong> <em>How do you know that "the lump causes the self-repairing activity"? How do you know that "the people in this lump are the real community"?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A</strong> Well I do not "know" this, I think this, so this is my interpretation. If I look at the contents of the data it also seems this way. The data is all ChangesIn<Months> and <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a>, so you can check it out yourself too. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another interpretation:  Still, this huge mass of people who just pass by and aren't involved are needed, to generate a small community. So this huge mass of people is the backbone. If you look around to other <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>s you will find a lot with just occasional edits, and those <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>s are mere guestbooks. Those <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>s are not really alive.

        A straight line on a log-log plot means log <em>y</em> = <em>A</em> log <em>x</em> + <em>B</em>, which means <em>y</em> = <em>C</em> <em>x</em>^<em>k</em>. In this case, it looke as if <em>k</em> is close to -1, which would suggest an instance of <a href="ZipfsLaw.html">ZipfsLaw</a>.(<a href="http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ZipfsLaw.html">http://mathworld.wolfram.com/ZipfsLaw.html</a> )
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, the line hits the X_axis at <em>about</em> log(400) and it hits the Y_axis at <em>about</em> log(2000). <em>(</em> <em>about</em> = a citation from my  memory<em>)</em>.
