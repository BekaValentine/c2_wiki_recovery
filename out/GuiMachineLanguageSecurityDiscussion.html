        <strong>Security Issues</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        When analyzing the security issues, one kind of scenario to consider is "recursive events". For example, form-A may have an "on-open" trigger that opens form-B, and then close itself. Form-B may in turn have a trigger that does the same to form-A. Thus, they run each other back and forth. Other stuff could be put into such triggers as to potentially have an almost infinitely loop that could make it <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>.  -top
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I know you hate me for my adherence to definitions and logic you'd prefer to ignore, but termination properties aren't 'security' issues, and while </em><a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> does imply infinite loops, the converse isn't true (infinite loops do not imply a language is <a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a>).

        The more "code time" the hacker gets, the more damage they can cause. TC is only secondary to that issue. TC is the golden goal of the hacker, but there are also silver and bronze standards if the hacker gets some command time. If the number of trigger cycles and/or the number of lines of code is limited somehow, the hacker has fewer options and/or time to do something complex. I agree that ideally they'd have none, but *dictating* such decisions is not the job of this language. It just facilitates choices. (Limiting trigger cycles and/or code lines would not be the only security feature.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If the amount of damage the hacker can cause is merely a function of time or of doing 'something complex', you have security issues regardless of termination properties. If not, then termination properties aren't security issues. Either way, termination properties are orthogonal to the security issue. I suggest you stop making claims one way or the other about 'security' unless you're willing to spend some time learning the field (consider starting with </em><a href="IwannaLearnComputerSecurity.html">IwannaLearnComputerSecurity</a>, though <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> is a rather poor site for this subject; www.erights.org is good). I am of the belief that security is <strong>not</strong> a separable concern (<a href="http://www.erights.org/talks/no-sep/).">http://www.erights.org/talks/no-sep/).</a> To say that you're not going to make decisions for security is pretty much to say you're designing an insecure language/protocol/architecture. But it's probably better to not make any decisions unless you know what you're doing.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That said, I'd simply suggest you avoid 'on-open' triggers. They're bad mojo. Well, more technically, they cause problems for scalability of the GUI for such goals as </em><a href="ZoomableUserInterface.html">ZoomableUserInterface</a>, robust persistence and regeneration, and composition/sharing of documents (i.e. including one document within another). They also hurt high-performance display through <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a>. If one was to make a big list of all the neat features they'd want their <a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a> for GUIs to support, I'd bet money that 'on-open' triggers would be directly or indirectly harmful to well over half the features on that list.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You are not being specific. You can't just claim that clicking button X gives puppies cancer; you have to SHOW how it happens. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In this particular case, I'm making a suggestion, not a claim. You're free to ignore it at your own peril. You're free to analyze the reasons I offered for my suggestion for merit on your own time. If you're curious, analysis on the robustness and scalability and composability issues surrounding 'on open' events, look up </em><a href="ImmediateModeGui.html">ImmediateModeGui</a>, <a href="DocumentDefinitions.html">DocumentDefinitions</a>, and the comparison in the latter between applications and document UIs.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What kinds of triggers are allowed should also be configurable. The minimal trigger would only allow actions that notify the server, and letting the server change the client UI state as needed. But I'm sure many authors will find this limiting or slow. Having buttons or menu items that un-hide ("on-open" is perhaps the wrong phrase) new and existing forms/windows/widgets is a common and useful need. Waiting for the client to do such makes responses sluggish. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree. Strongly. That simply introduces a big-ass semantics conflict between document authors (who are deciding which triggers their documents </em>use<em>) and the browser users/implementors (who are deciding which triggers are </em>respected<em>) without introducing the required negotiation layer between them. A standard with 8 boolean configuration variables is really up to 2^8 = 256 standards. It takes a </em>handshake<em> to negotiate which of these standards to use. And, since authors are typically not around to make that handshake, it's not going to happen without defining an agent to perform the hand-shake and rewrite the document for them. It's pain, it's complexity, and it's </em><a href="AccidentalDifficulty.html">AccidentalDifficulty</a> all introduced by your silly, naive belief that choice is usually a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'm not sure what you mean. The browser builder does not control (choose) what triggers are allowed. The server for a session does. For example, let's say the default is to only allow sending form content when button is pressed. If the app session server wants buttons to also be able to un-hide forms without a round-trip, it then explicitly grants that permission. (Different sessions would use different GUI browser instances.)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Same issues apply. Just replace 'semantics conflict between document authors and browser builders' with 'semantics conflict between document authors and server builders'.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Le scenario, Senior?
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>The scenario: a document author wants to have an (independently developed or configured) document server provide his/her document. If the server doesn't respect how the button-events were written, the document is broken when provided from that server.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           So you are talking about cross-server sharing and/or links. I generally was targeting "applications", not competing with a web-browser. We already have those, and they are fine for semi-static content. An "app browser" generally wouldn't allow different servers to manage forms within the same "app", which we'll consider an MDI base window for now. If you hyper-link to another app, the hyperlink would create a new app-browser instance, and thus another MDI base window. The MDI window is thus the solid boundary between one "app" and another. It would still be possible for the server to integrate info and "pages" from different sources if desired. Thus, there's a way to meld them in a single MDI without creating client-side security complications.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Ah. So you mean that you don't care about composition of applications, service mirroring and load balancing, and such. Well, aside from the fact you still can't compete with </em><a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a> (which is also going through its own upgrades over time, along with HTTP, to better target '<a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>s'), and aside from the common demand for shared access to applications, and aside from the fact that the future seems to be steadily moving towards supporting user composition of disparate services into a single application-style interfaces (e.g. portals or <a href="MashupMaker.html">MashupMaker</a> or <a href="SmartWiki.html">SmartWiki</a>), you might be able to succeed! Good luck!<em> </em>
        </li>
        <li>
           See Page-Anchor: "Server-mixing"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The option to only allow one "on-X" trigger per user-performed event could also limit cascading on-X's.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Behavior in response to user-input (e.g. due to a button press, due to mouse hover, etc.) is okay (good mojo). That doesn't cause any of the scalability or robustness or composition/sharing problems associated with events based on mere 'display' of the document. It's on-show or on-open that's problematic.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Possible security settings set by user (client) and/or server for a given session and/or domain:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Number of trigger cycles per user action (triggers triggering other triggers)
        </li>
        <li>
           Number of trigger cycles per server packet
        </li>
        <li>
           Max number of statements allowed to execute per user action 
        </li>
        <li>
           Max number of statements allowed to execute per server packet
        </li>
        <li>
           Limit triggers to only server messages (such as send form content, aka "submit")
        </li>
        <li>
           Limit triggers to a given set, or perhaps "level" group
        </li>
        <li>
           Limit content changes (such as text and label) to only server commands.
        </li>
        <li>
           Limit subroutine call nesting (zero = no subroutines allowed)
        </li>
        <li>
           Limit access to branching operation(s)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Those aren't security settings. Process control and accounting, maybe.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Regarding "hiding", I'd suggest having these "show-states" (when applicable):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hidden (default for forms/windows)
        </li>
        <li>
           Minimized (with visible place-holder. Not applicable to basic widgets.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Regular (default for widgets)
        </li>
        <li>
           Maximized (not applicable to widgets)
        </li>
        <li>
           Automatic, for auto-popup or auto-expand widgets
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An "onShow" trigger would happen when transitioning from either of the first two to either of the last two. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Show-states are fine, but transition triggers are still bad-mojo.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You mean like "on-change" triggers? Can you provide a few scenarios that demonstrate why they are bad?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't mind state-based display properties (e.g. where the document simultaneously includes information for display at different states), but </em>'display events<em>' are very bad things. Scenarios where they are bad:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Analysis. (You can't examine just part of a composed application with on-display events. You need the whole damn thing because you can't readily determine which piece of on-display code goes with which component. This also hurts accessibility; to whatever degree you can't analyze a document, you also can't transform it automatically to fit different screens or support blind users and such.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Where did you get this? Each component has a unique address.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Perhaps you can explain how that is relevant to breaking down code of on-display events.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Perhaps I misunderstood your statement. Please restate it or give an example.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Perhaps I misunderstood your statement. I already asked for a better explanation.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Initial composition. (When you're using display-events, you lose the ability to piecewise construct the application, as the events get to be associated with the whole composition rather than with individual pieces. This means the events, if they are used, grow to reference more display artifacts.) [in small words: app becomes <a href="BigBallOfMud.html">BigBallOfMud</a>. Pieces all tied together by side-effects of events.]
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>I have no idea what you are talking about.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               I'm going to blame that one on your lack of domain competence.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>You mean I'm lousy at deciphering bad writing?</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               No, it's more like you're trying to read trigonometry with an education that never passed basic arithmetic, and you're <em>blaming</em> the trigonometry.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>If that was the case, then you'd be able to bust me left and right with clear, objective proofs.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               I'm fairly certain that for objective proofs to be "clear" <em>to the audience</em>, there are some prerequisites on knowledge. For example, you can't just bust a child left and right with objective proofs about, say, the properties of <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> - no matter how clear they are to <em>you</em> as the speaker. Do you believe otherwise? What if the child were not only ignorant, but a fully <a href="HostileStudent.html">HostileStudent</a>? Some say that <a href="YouCantLearnSomethingUntilYouAlreadyAlmostKnowIt.html">YouCantLearnSomethingUntilYouAlreadyAlmostKnowIt</a>. If you <em>"have no idea what [I'm] talking about"</em>, then I have no places to start... and that's <em>if</em> I wanted to educate, and you wanted to be a student. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I've been in cases where somebody will say, "X cannot do Y, you big dummy!". Then I show X doing Y, and they shut up. I don't even have to insult them, the works do it by itself.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               That implies they had some idea of what you were talking about, does it not?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>You are just making up convoluted excuses to be obtuse.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Network disruption. (If a network event on-display goes sour, the document or application may be in an undefined state. This is anti-robustness, anti-disruption-tolerance, anti-offline-friendly. Document is no longer data-driven or <a href="ImmediateModeGui.html">ImmediateModeGui</a>.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>This is a problem no matter what. If the server croaks, it croaks.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Not really. There are plenty of designs that allow useful work to continue in the face of network disruption. Again, lack of domain competence?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Yes we could add such, but I don't think it's worth it to bulk up our language with many of those issues. You seem to want to over-engineer this doo-dad, just like you did with the "sharable" language type-a-tron contraption of yours. I don't want to repeat that kind of debate here again. -t</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Design for such doesn't require "bulking up our language". It's the other way around: it requires removing stuff from the language. On-display events are one of the big things needing removal.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sharing. (If you wish to share the application between multiple users, the semantics of different users representing the application in different states (e.g. minimized vs. maximized) are poorly defined.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>We already discussed this. Not a real issue.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Where did we discuss sharing an application between users? I do recall discussion of secondary composition/sharing between servers. I'll note that in <a href="GuiEngineGoals.html">GuiEngineGoals</a>, one of those you listed is: <em>"Ability to migrate displays/window across systems. An application should be able to run on a server and be displayed on a client and the display should be able to move from client to client. </em>'Even better if the display can be rendered on multiple clients at once (e.g., to enable screen/window SHARING)<em>'"</em>. Are you still going to say it isn't an issue?
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>How about some sample scenarios. Your writing is not clear.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               How about you detail scenarios in your <a href="GuiEngineGoals.html">GuiEngineGoals</a> page, if you want more than one? I already provided one sample scenario on the opening line for those with a eyes to read and a brain to think: different users (i.e. two or more, call them user A and user B) sharing the GUI (multiple clients at once) represent the document in different display states (e.g. minimized vs. maximized - i.e. user A has the application minimized, and user B has the document maximized). The proper display event for this state is not defined.  
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Use off-the-shelf remote screen-mirror software. I don't want to gum it up with low-probability scenarios. Wait until version 6.0 for that kind of crap.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Why bother gumming up your design with on-display events? That crap can wait until version 6.0, after you've proven you need it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Client-side scalability. (<a href="ZoomableUserInterface.html">ZoomableUserInterface</a> ideally requires that the resource consumption of the GUI be bound not by the number of display artifacts, but rather by their screen real-estate. Events on 'hide' and 'minimize', especially, mean the otherwise possibly <a href="ZoomableUserInterface.html">ZoomableUserInterface</a> will be consuming MORE resources as objects are hidden.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>If "minimize" etc. is not applicable to zoomable widgets, so be it. It doesn't need to be applicable all widgets.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Applicability to certain widgets is 100% irrelevant to anything I wrote.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Server-side scalability. (The relationship between application and server is maintained in part by on-display events, which implies that the server will in the general case need to maintain state for each user's view of each application. This is not scalable for servers, and especially resists caching, intermediate distribution (which is an exponential bandwidth saver), and persistence.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Multiple servers can run the same application. This is not a problem.</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               That's irrelevant to scalability. 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Secondary composition. (For similar reason to server-side scalability, the 'view' being handled as a relationship between browser and server greatly hinders ability to embed, link, stylize, and extend applications.)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>I see very little need for this for *applications*. I'm not proposing dismantling web browsers. -t</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               You still lose the ability, which is still a disadvantage, even if you don't care about this one in particular.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Undefined states. (What do you do for persistence? What about when recovering from a crash - can that be solved in general by the browser? How about tiny 10x10 pixel state? Partially occluded?)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Same way it's dealt with for web apps. -t</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Ah... you mean: 'requires <a href="SelfDiscipline.html">SelfDiscipline</a>, foresight, and a really good understanding of the issues'. That'll do, but it ranks your language pretty damn low on the <a href="FourLevelsOfFeature.html">FourLevelsOfFeature</a>.
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>If that keeps it relatively simple, focused on purpose, and easy-to-try without lots of investment in a convoluted framework with lots of up-front investment and buy-in (</em><a href="TechniqueWithManyPrerequisites.html">TechniqueWithManyPrerequisites</a>), then yes.<em> -t</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               Are you claiming these hypothetical properties are achieved by your favored design? Or are you just suggesting, hypothetically, that <em>if</em> they are achieved, then you <em>might</em> have a point?

            <li>
               <em>It was being compared to HTML-based web-apps. Did they acheive them? As far as simplicity in concept, I beleive they have.

               The above was intended to question the peculiarities of your favored design. Merely pointing out that on-display triggers exist in a successful standard (HTML-based web-apps) says little about whether they were hurtful vs. helpful, much less whether that element of the design helps achieve relative simplicity, focus, and ease-of-use relative to alternative designs. What makes you believe that these on-display triggers were of significant aide in keeping the standard simple, focused, easy-to-try without lots of investment in a convoluted framework, etc?

            <li>

        I assumed interpreted. I suppose the base set up could be "compiled", but that's not my focus. HTML doesn't have to be compiled to use-able, I would note.

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           My mention of "compile down to [<a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a>]" didn't actually refer to "compiling <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a>". Two different things. If you truly have something like a '<a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a>', I'd expect it to service effectively as a compilation target language for other display languages (like HTML).

            <li>
               <em>Using HTML as a test scenario, it indeed can represent HTML. In fact, it could represent dynamic HTML if each tag has some kind of ordering value (such as a hidden/internal attribute "~tagOrder" or the like).

            </li>
            <li>
               Is "<em>can represent</em> HTML [with enough finagling]" all that "<em>service effectively as compilation target for</em> [HTML]" means to you? 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I guess I am misunderstanding your complaint. How about an example. -t</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               My first bullet had a rather simple complaint: you either skipped or disregarded the modifying preposition  "down to" following "compile", and thus read something different from what I had written. But perhaps you can show me some advantages from 'representing HTML' in this <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> in order to demonstrate a <em>"reason to compile down to it"</em>. Without such a reason, I do not believe that it will 'service effectively' as a compilation target.  
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I don't care what you believe. I won't believe it until you show a realistic scenario(s) of bad things happening. Your "summary" assessments are not very useful. Specifics, details, details, and specifics.</em>

            <li>
               Sigh. This isn't a situation of me saying "<a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>s are happening", <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, and I have no idea how you're reading that from what I've been writing. I'm saying that unless you (or someone) can show <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>s happening, your pet <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> will fail. Miserably, no less. People aren't going to switch to a product that provides no demonstrated advantages over HTML, especially when HTML is already established. Heck, it would take more than a few advantages to make the switch. HTML is a better <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> than yours merely by virtue of incumbency - the number of existing compatible browsers makes it 'service effectively' as such, and both <a href="GoogleWebKit.html">GoogleWebKit</a> and <a href="MicrosoftSilverlight.html">MicrosoftSilverlight</a> use it as such. Unless you can provide a <em>"reason for other languages to compile down to [your </em><a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a>]"<em>, as I originally stated, your particular brand of </em><a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> is already sunk.

           Your assumption that <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> was to be interpreted isn't relevant.

        <li>
           While it is true that "HTML doesn't <em>have to be</em> compiled to be use-able", it commonly is compiled in the sense that compilation is just staged <a href="PartialEvaluation.html">PartialEvaluation</a> and most (maybe even all) browsers compile HTML into an internal graph of document objects and plugin objects.

        <em>Red herring. This does </em>not<em> prevent plugins nor client-side scripting.</em>

      <p>
        You misread me. I did not say your system is incompatible with plugins and scripting. I said that systems with hacked-in support for client-side plugins and scripting should be counted forever among the doomed/damned. Indeed, I fully expect your <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> would be among these, providing it were ever to become successful.

      <p>
        Organizations generally want to control their applications and content. The "central server" approach still allows cross-server sharing, as long as the central server permits it and manages it. Thus, it's "controlled mashups".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Users also want to control their applications and what is presented to them. I wonder who will win? Content providers, or content consumers? As someone who consumes content from more outlets than he provides it to, I think I'd rather invest in the latter.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As far as <a href="DistributedProgramming.html">DistributedProgramming</a>, a central server (from client's perspective) does <em>not</em> prevent distributed computation. For example, a Google search may send a thousand servers into parallel content hunts. However, only one server needs to report back the finds to the client. We don't need bunches of servers for that. The user can only digest a few thousand finds at the most anyhow. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Uh... I never suggested it 'prevents distributed computation', though it hurts the ability of the client to construct such computations.</em>

        Show me some common needs for such and I'll start caring.

        <em>:Rolls eyes: We don't even 'need' the Internet; humanity survived most of its history without one.

The vast majority of video-games and chat programs and interactive systems on the web today would be more efficiently constructed with standardized support for client-side integration into a distributed network.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The "server" can be on the client/desktop</strong>, and thus talk to gajillion other servers. I never said the server had to be far way. The only requirement is that a single "server" (near or far) manage the GUI. This still leaves a lot of flexibility. I run local "web apps" all the time (however, better packaging standards for such would be nice). If you have speed- or hardware-intensive needs that won't work under this, fine.

        <em>Having a "server" on the client/desktop only reduces latency.

           Languages in use tend to keep adding features as they age to "keep up" with the competition, real or perceived. Parallelism is the current flavor of the day.

        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Languages add features to either keep up with demand or to create it. Competition rises to meet that demand when languages fail to do so, but the incumbent advantage is nearly insurmountable. Parallelism has always in the past been the 'long-term' future for all computing architectures, and is now being realized: processors of 4-8 cores, more processors, more machines, more networking, more tabs in the browser, more multiplexing of operator input, more sensors, more actuators. Do you honestly believe it to be a passing fad?</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           On the app-side, Yes. There are ways to partition processing without having the app developer overly concern themselves with it. And more collection-oriented features or tools will also help out. For example, searching an array using predicates instead of index-and-loop can be parallelized without having to explicitly manage threads. As far as the browser, one processor may manage networking I/O, and another the GUI, for example. Having a different chip manage each tab is silly, and will probably fail to help speed because of the high cross-coupling of related info for such. Common idioms such as progress bars and status tracking for batch reports could also be farmed off to a different process also, not unlike the "download manager" in <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>If you believed app-side parallelism to be a passing-fad, that would suggest you believe applications will be bound to a single processor, that protocols will involve primarily synchronous (wait-for-the-result) protocols for remote calls, etc. - as it has been in the past. But it seems what you actually believe is that app-side will be highly parallel, and that the languages, protocols, and programming environment will progress to the point that much parallelism can be achieved safely and correctly with very little explicit effort on part of the application developer. That's not a 'passing fad' at all.</em>

        </li>
        <li>
           I think you read it a bit too literally. Obviously if you split up tabs to different processors and there are 8 tabs but only 4 processors, then each processor would get approximately 2 tabs. Perhaps the sub-windows or panels can be split, but that's not something the GUI-CLR language has to worry about. The GUI manager will handle that.

        A new protocol cannot jam every possible wish-list item into it. The wish-list items given attention versus those ignored in the first releases need to be weighed based on need and target audience. Roughly, I see 3 possible divisions:

           Proof (that secure mobile code and <a href="PublishSubscribeModel.html">PublishSubscribeModel</a> are the way to go) is readily available to people who aren't ignorant of existing systems: 
          <ul>
            <li>
               every GUI language is based on mobile code, and every successful scripted GUI involves secure code (e.g. <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, LUA) that is sufficiently expressive to be a <a href="GeneralPurposeProgrammingLanguage.html">GeneralPurposeProgrammingLanguage</a>.

                <li>
                   You're such a contradictory fellow, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. Asking for a 'demonstration' of a categorical statement is merely asking for evidence - point data - not proof. Asking for 'concrete evidence' means asking for evidence that exists now. What you can observe 'now' is that every attempt to do it <strong>your</strong> way - with a limited GUI language and no accompanying expressive general purpose language - was eventually deemed insufficient. The fact that people have failed repeatedly is, in fact, inductive evidence (not <strong>proof</strong>, but <strong>concrete</strong> evidence, just like you asked for) that you also will be forced to support distribution of an expressive general-purpose language. As Shirley Bassey would say, <em>"It's all just little bits of history repeating"</em>. The general purpose language is used to achieve high performance and greater scalability for client-side verification, describing input handlers, decision trees, etc.. Despite the past, though, you still <em>might</em> escape with a different configuration than has been used in the past... e.g. distributing the 'general purpose' code in a separate layer from the GUI code. That's what I'm betting on in the design I most favor (document model for UI, described and contrasted against application model in <a href="DocumentDefinitions.html">DocumentDefinitions</a>).

                   I consider this belief of yours to be naive. <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> is a language. CLR is a language.

Your goal to communicate without first establishing a particular language is logically, mathematically, and physically impossible. You <strong>cannot</strong> have an open standard without a language. A decent open-standard means producing a decent language. But there are intermediate forms where you can use one language to invoke another... that's essentially what plugins and <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> are all about. That means even more mobile code, though, since using plugins means you need to distribute the plugins, make sure they're portable and browser and language-friendly and secure and what-have-you, etc.

                   You say HTML-based web-apps are doing "just fine" without disruption tolerance? Despite the usual use of 'fine' to avoid meaningful conversations about health, my favorite online dictionary tells me that "fine" means "of superior or best quality". "Session expired" is not "of superior or best quality". Hitting the "back" button but not returning to a usable prior state is not "of superior or best quality". Editing a C2 page locally then saving and getting an "offline" message is not "of superior or best quality". The long wait time when firing up a laptop and browser and getting back to the previous activity is not "of superior or best quality". Session management is hacked in nowadays because people want features like disruption tolerance. Usable 'back' buttons for web-apps has been achieved with some complex trickery involving '#' anchors in the URI that are painful to code on a per-web-app basis. Development of "fine" of web-apps could someday be "just fine", but they seem far from "of superior or best quality" today. I'd say it's still struggling to achieve <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>, thus the great many frameworks aimed at making this sort of development easier.

                   HTML-based techniques grew into the organic mess of DOM, Scripting, Plugins, AJAX, Cookies, and CGI that exists today because <strong>HTML was insufficient to meet user requirements without additions and compromises</strong>. I agree with one thing you said: we do need new standards. But the reason for new standards is to clean up the existing mess, simplify interoperability, and obtain features that have been difficult to achieve with the existing design (including reduced dependency on plugins, video, audio,  greater support for service transactions & partial undo, offline interaction with web apps, better latency for live updates to pages, better support for cross-site operations (including cross-site drag&drop, online file-systems, identity management), high levels of security and privacy for both client and server, etc.). The goal should be to avoid the explicit hackery that happens at every stage in the current cesspool of standards - hacks for browser compatibility, hacks to support back buttons, hacks for offline interaction with Internet applications, hacks for communications contexts, and so on. "Fuller GUI" 'sounds' nice, too, though I have no clue what "fuller" means (some sort of <a href="BuzzWord.html">BuzzWord</a>?). <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> doesn't achieve <em>any</em> of this - except maybe "fuller" GUIs under a <a href="HumptyDumpty.html">HumptyDumpty</a> definition. <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> is <em>not</em> the new standard we need. It seems that, to you, simplicity means <em>denial of </em><a href="EssentialComplexity.html">EssentialComplexity</a><em> rather than </em>resolution of <a href="AccidentalComplexity.html">AccidentalComplexity</a><em>.

                <li>
                   <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>, how are you measuring "more likely to get adopted"? If you're saying that "standards adopted are often simple", I'd agree. If you're saying that "percentage-wise, any given simple standard has a better chance of being adopted" then I think you lack necessary statistics to make a judgement. For every simple standard that gets adopted, how many simple standards are rejected? Anyhow, I think that if you observe industry patterns, you'll also learn that people would rather find complex ways to use established standard than switch to an unfamiliar new one. A <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>-friendly GUI standard might be nice, but I see you setting yourself up for doing a <strong>lot</strong> of rework to ultimately end up living in the same organic mess we do today.

                   You need a refresher course in statistics. "Percentage wise" - percent of proposed standards that get adopted given they are simple is P(Adopted|Simple), and percent of proposed standards that get adopted given they are not simple is P(Adopted|~Simple). The "standards adopted are often simple" refers to the probability a standard is simple given it is adopted - P(Simple|Adopted). These are very different measurements. Imagine that P(Adopted|Simple)=1/10, and P(Adopted|~Simple) was 2/10, but 10x more simple standards get proposed: then P(Simple|Adopted)=5/6 even though any given complex standard has a higher probability of adoption. Until you grok everything I just said, I suggest you avoid using wors "more likely".

           Sure, that's okay. Those who are pushing HTML++ to its technical limits today should get a nice reset so they have entirely new limits to push. Once we know the new limits, the problems being encountered at those limits, we can upgrade again. That's called <strong>progress</strong>.

        The idea is simply ~20 years too late to gain traction, at least without a couple significant advantages in a niche (performance, <em>real</em> security, disruption tolerance and recovery, more eye-candy, better animations and transitions, better 'liveness' properties, accessibility to blind and deaf, better support for automatic transition to tiny touch-screen mobile-phones, etc.). We desire something better than <a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a>, but there is no reason (unless you want to take <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s word for it) to believe <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> offers an advantage in any of these.

        A style similar to <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s '<a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a>' is commonly emulated simply by creating a body-script in HTML (sequence of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> commands executed in body or i-frame). The basics behind it is the same: each command manipulates the DOM just a bit. This approach even has significant advantages over <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> in that one can abstract update commands from the server with client-side procedures, thus saving on bandwidth, and can pre-process some inputs from the user, thus saving even more bandwidth and making the program more disruption-tolerant. Perhaps <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> should try to understand why that style of <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a> composition isn't more popular - considering not just the client-side, but also the server side processing needed to make it as interactive like applications are expected to be.

        <strong>On-display Events</strong> (continued)

      <p>
        I'll create <a href="OnDisplayEventsConsideredHarmful.html">OnDisplayEventsConsideredHarmful</a> to explain in detail, along with describing alternatives that provide the same features without creating challenges. In the meantime, perhaps you can provide a few common scenarios that illustrate why they are allegedly useful, that you believe couldn't easily be done with something much weaker. I'll use them to illustrate the alternatives.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Scenario 1: when a form/window/panel opens, say via a menu option or "see reference list" button, you want to update a list it contains with the latest info from the server. Thus, it sends a notification to the server upon opening, and the server responds by sending (populating) a new list.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That one's too easy. Either move the update event into the same menu option that opens the page, or provide a declarative data dependency (e.g. data as a function of a side-effect-free query) such that the browser can decide between pulling the 'latest info' from the cache vs. going all the way to the server vs. subscribing to keep the view continuously up-to-date. (But I appreciate the scenario. Need harder ones. Keep them coming.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Suppose that reference screen is called from several places and they all want to refresh it upon open. [...] Factoring would dictate that an "on open" event do the retrieve/refresh instead of </em>'duplicating<em>' the call for every "show screen" button or menu. I suppose repeating the refresh call is not a show-stopper, but first I'd like to see the down-sides of on-display events before sacrificing the better factoring.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Factoring dictates no such thing: another perfectly reasonable factoring is to write a "show_screen_and_update()" function, then call that from several places. Did you not consider this possibility?

You've got to know OO pretty damn well to really know the problems and limitations. You also need to know it in many languages, so you can distinguish language issues from those inherent to the design. (Same is true for any paradigm, I suspect. I imagine that much paradigm zealotry comes from those least experienced. The rest comes from people like you, who knows the value of a paradigm and sad to see it trampled beneath the feet of the ignorant. Unfortunately, you don't know the other paradigms well enough to make a proper argument about their limits.)

        There are many ways to do that without putting the logic for doing so into an 'on-display' event associated with the screen.

Where does <a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a> 'forbid' editable grids and MDI? (Oh wait! It doesn't! Then why are you complaining?) GML lacks the architecture to support cross-app drag+drop of anything but raw text or images, and even then supporting text and images would require some explicit features be added to GML (e.g. some sort of 'on_dragdrop' event like you recently added above).

But, before writing a neat conversion utility, I'd look at the mind-bogglingly vast repository of Python utilities to see if someone else already did it. And if I looked, I'd find neat tools like Pyjamas (<a href="http://wiki.python.org/moin/Pyjamas)">http://wiki.python.org/moin/Pyjamas)</a> and Skulpt (<a href="http://www.skulpt.org/)">http://www.skulpt.org/)</a> that convert or support Python for <a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a>.

As is, I can leverage my existing skills (limited as they be) with <a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a>+<a href="AjAx.html">AjAx</a>+Cookies+CGI independently of the language I use to write the server. And if I don't want to work with <a href="HtmlDomJsCss.html">HtmlDomJsCss</a>+++ directly, then I can use a tool to do the transformations for me because HTML+++ is 'standard' enough that people have written tools like Pyjamas and Skulpt.

                   The Access 2007 interface sucks in my opinion. As a choice, fine, but not forced.

You lose that "on top of" visual. Second, one cannot create <strong>modal</strong> dialog boxes. The dialog box in a web browser may get accidentally placed behind the primary window via one wrong mouse-stroke, leaving the user in a confused state.

           As far as "can't trust Microsoft", I believe the trend towards <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>s continues regardless of Microsoft's desires; they simply aren't any longer in a position where they can effectively sabotage that effort without being obvious about it.

The control they have on IE browser is more precarious than you imagine - down to 65% in 2009, and only maintained through competing feature-wise with alternatives (e.g. they took a huge hit to tabbed browsing). Chrome is up to 3% and is less than a year old and pushes <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>s (and even WebOS) heavily. Even if Microsoft makes no effort to "make it easy to abandon native desktop apps", it will continue to become easier to abandon native desktop apps. Even if Microsoft makes explicit effort to sabotage <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>s, it will continue to become easier to abandon native desktop apps. Microsoft aims to lock people into an alternatives, like <a href="WindowsPresentationFoundation.html">WindowsPresentationFoundation</a>, that compete with <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>s via more advanced networking, persistence, integration, etc. and a similar flexibility profile - a reasonable tactic to avoid a complete loss.

That said, modern applications are networked, hooking into external data sources, needing up-to-date data in near real-time, and involve more than one simultaneous user interacting and issuing updates. Many apps still holding to the desktop are graphics-intensive or require specialized input devices. Modern services cross organizations - reservation of a plane ticket, hotel, and car from three different organization, for example - and people want the ability to abort halfway through, back up, guarantee they pay for a service only once rather than once-per-click, and maintain security and privacy all the while. Can HTML+++ 'scale' to support these desktop applications and services of today and tomorrow without resorting to plugins? I doubt it.

           <em>Okay, ESC worked, but that's not intuitive and against common spreadsheet convention. The down-arrow should take it out of edit mode rather than do nothing.

        </li>
        <li>
           Whether that is "right" is a matter of opinion and historical convention, and depends on what sort of data gets stored in the cell ('down' for the drop-box in edit mode, for example, should navigate the box). Chances are 'down' navigates multi-line text (which you can't enter in this case). The distinction seems to be that the 'forms' used for the grid are not grid-aware - they're the same, generic forms that could be added anywhere else on the page. Most of the Tutorials for editable grids focus on hooking them up to Databases. But you're free to explore the API if the small details are bothering you. I certainly agree on the check-box, but I suspect they have already heard that complaint and have it on a backburner. Ultimately, you're quibbling. The <em>relevant</em> question is <em>"can HTML++ do this with less effort than creating a new standard, deploying it, and convincing </em>'enough<em>' clients to use the new standard that skill in it becomes marketable?"</em>, and the answer is 'yes'. <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> is icing on the cake at best - it isn't as though you have a serious <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> competitor lined up. Perhaps you should give me an estimate on how long it would take you to have an editable grid in <a href="GuiMachineLanguage.html">GuiMachineLanguage</a> that has all the 'little details' filled in, including correct behavior for each cell based on 'type', support for date types with a date-picker, support for enumerative drop-box, etc. and that can load data from an XML file as with the example in question.

           I have never said HTML++ is 'great' - not in any absolute sense. What I've been saying is that GML isn't any better.

What makes you think your GML - <em>by which I refer to the four-column design and anti-scripting and alleged 'security' rules, as opposed to a much more general concept of restarting</em> - would be 'better' for CRUD-screen developers? If your <em>point</em> is that it's time to look for something better, I certainly agree. I've done much thinking about how to do better - and the approach I've come up with is full of what you consider to be 'gold plating' fulfilling feature-requirements of today and tomorrow rather than of yesteryear. If your <em>point</em> is that GML long-term will be better than HTML++, I remain extremely skeptical. Which is your point, or am I missing it entirely?

           <em>It's not clear to me what the two choice paths are in your paragraph. My suggestion will be better because turning a car into a boat has proven so ugly such that any problems arising from just making a boat from near-scratch are likely to be fewer.

Your approach is likely to fail because it solves problems that people don't currently give much thought to. <strong>You are scratching the wrong itch</strong>. Thus, it's a hard-sell, which means people will just ignore it. Further, I don't believe in your sells skills to make it clear to most practitioners why they need that stuff and how your contraption actually works in the field. Dr. Codd got more listen when he showed it reducing the size of queries compared to CODYSAL (sp?) rather than just rant about theory, elegance, and purity. -t<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Your claim that "people don't currently give much thought to" the problems being solved seems contradicted by leading software development blogs I read, but I'll admit that I tend to be biased towards reading software-architecture and language-design blogs. To which people do <em>you</em> refer, and what are <em>your</em> biases? And I agree on my salesmanship skills - they suck; I'm not the one to sell my ideas to others. But I also don't believe you'll be able to 'sell' your idea, either - not when it requires a bunch of changes to browsers and servers to take real advantage. Inertia is a bitch, and HTML++ is her alpha male. You want to know what sells? <a href="GoogleWebToolkit.html">GoogleWebToolkit</a>, and <a href="http://www.extjs.com">http://www.extjs.com</a> widgets, and other approaches that leverage modern architectures such as Flapjax and Caja and HTML5 and <a href="MicrosoftSilverlight.html">MicrosoftSilverlight</a>. That's what sells.

A lot of people are frustrated with HTML++ and are growing impatient waiting for it to catch up with desktops from the mid-90's. I don't know what you mean by "change to servers". It would merely require language-specific adaptors and/or an XML service. As far as inertia of HTML++, maybe, but IT history is full of meteors that came out of nowhere to smack a dinosour square in the nuts. Sometimes the hype was merely hype for hype's sake, but still managed to change the scene. It's not always rational.

           <em>My observation differs from yours. Let's </em><a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a> on the feature popularity thing. Yes, people want magic session recovery, but they also want a decent GUI at least as much.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Sure, people want a decent GUI. That has never been a point of contention. But your belief seems to be that providing primitive support for a few extra widgets is sufficient to achieve a decent GUI and allows you to ignore and dismiss both a long history of lessons learned that lead HTML to add cookies, scripting, DOM, <a href="AjAx.html">AjAx</a>, iframes, etc. Additionally, you ignore and dismiss (as 'gold-plate') long wishlists of features that HTML++ has yet to meet, which means you aren't meeting the goals of <em>today</em> whether you agree they are important or not. (Who are you to say what's important to other people?)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>That "long history" has also made HTML++ into a convoluted mess that carries a lot of interface and convention baggage.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           That doesn't make it wise to dismiss it, <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>. Those who don't learn from history are doomed to repeat it. When your GML can account for the problems solved by scripting, DOM, <a href="CascadingStyleSheets.html">CascadingStyleSheets</a>, <a href="AjAx.html">AjAx</a>, cookies, iframes, etc. you might have a decent replacement for HTML++ as GUI assembly.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>I did learn from history: make it fit the task (</em><a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>) so that we don't have to bend other standards (e-brochures) in an ugly way.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>

Am I to simply assume it does? You really do believe that a few different UI primitives would make the "convoluted mess" go away, don't you? Well, you give that a try. I don't know many people that will take that on faith; the only reason <em>you</em> take it on faith is because it's your idea.

           <em>Are we to just accept HTML++ because it gets us 70% of the way there by saying "since we are already 70% there we should stay there"? The open issue is if HTML++ can get us nearly all the way without bending so far backward that it sniffs its own butt and snaps.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Are we to "just accept HTML++"? No, not at all. But we are to look at any potential alternative to HTML++ and say: "is it worth the nigh-Herculean effort to replace HTML++ with this alternative?" It would not be worth the cost to replace HTML++ with a solution that gets us to only 75% of the way. It would be a step backwards to replace HTML++ with a solution that gets us to 65% of the way. Therefore, we do not need to "just accept HTML++", but we ought to be skeptical of promises and claims about alternatives.

           <em>I don't beleive any of our forcasting skills is accurate within 10%.

           The numbers were merely didactic: they don't account for different 'subsets' of useful features (e.g. your 65/100 and my 70/100 might only overlap for 50/100) or moving goal-posts (natural to progress). It wasn't an attempt to be precise. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Anyhow, I still doubt the value of your 'sabotage' argument as an argument against HTML++ for many reasons: (1) I don't believe Microsoft is as capable as you suggest. (2) Even if MS sabotages its own browser, that <em>still</em> leaves HTML++ in a better position of development and deployment than most new alternatives. (3) With an equal degree of paranoia and speculation, I should respond: Who is to say that MS or some other organization won't sabotage <pick alternative to HTML> the moment it starts becoming popular? (<a href="EmbraceAndExtend.html">EmbraceAndExtend</a> is Microsoft's friend.)

        <li>
           <em>Re: 1, MS has done plenty of sneaky things in the past and I've seen no evidence that they've stopped. Re: 2, Why do you say it leaves it in a better position? Re: 3, How could MS sabotage a dedicated GML browser? Most OSS GUI kits don't use the deeper MS Windows libraries, but draw most stuff from scratch, pixel-by-pixel, if I'm not mistaken. This is how they keep it cross-platform. Plus, if they damage native desktop libraries, then too many established desktop vendors will become pissed, which would hurt their main cash cow. Sabotaging an HTTP-based protocol is more likely to drive companies away from HTTP-based apps, which wouldn't hurt MS, perhaps even help by driving some back to desktop.</em>

           RE Re 1: I repeat: I don't believe MS is as <strong>capable</strong> as you suggest. Even if they don't stop doing sneaky things, I don't believe they're going to 'sneak' some critical element of HTML++ out from underneath it.  RE Re 2: It's in a better position because you'd still have Firefox, Chrome, etc. already widely deployed, implemented, debugged, maintained by other people. RE Re 3: MS has no need to sabotage a dedicated GML browser; they'd simply re-implement and beat the crap out of you in the popularity race, would they not? That'd simply put them back into the same position as IE is today, where they could 'sabotage' your paranoid self.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>As far as MS's abilities for sabotage, I'll leave that discussion in </em><a href="LimitsOfHtmlStack.html">LimitsOfHtmlStack</a>. Non-MS browser share is too small in corporate environments, where most CRUD features are used. Companies will not easily abandon IE. This is partly why XUL failed. I'm not sure where #2 fits in. Please elaborate the relationship. Number 3 would be fine because there'd be multiple browsers that support at least a "regular" set of CRUD features the same way all current browsers support basic e-brochure features.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Logic on #2:
          <ul>
            <li>
               The "development and deployment of most new alternatives" is in a position with zero clients developed, zero clients deployed. (This is because they are 'new' alternatives.)
            </li>
            <li>
               If Microsoft sabotages Internet Explorer, I would need to tell my clients to switch to <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a>, <a href="GoogleChrome.html">GoogleChrome</a>, or some other browser.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>Or they say, "Make it work in IE or you lose our business/sale". Corporate bosses only know that IE is their current corporate standard and your product doesn't work in the latest IE. Only if MS busted a bunch of products all at once would people blame in on MS. Instead MS would likely gradually F-up IE such that it's blamed on web-app vendors: the </em><a href="BoiledFrogs.html">BoiledFrogs</a> concept.<em></em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> and <a href="GoogleChrome.html">GoogleChrome</a> already hold over 30% of the market. Thus, on average I'd need to tell fewer than 70% of my clients to install something. By comparison, a browser client for a 'new alternative' (like GML) requires that I tell 100% of my clients to install something. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Even if share of non-IE browsers is smaller in corporate environments, it's well above 0%. Besides, if Microsoft <em>does</em> sabotage <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>s to the point that extjs and Google Calendar and such stop working, I am willing to gamble heavily that the corporate share for IE will drop like an anchor, and I won't even need to tell 70% of my clients to install something new. Additionally, if I were a paranoid crank like <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> who was absolutely convinced of Microsoft sabotage, I'd just tell all of my clients to use <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> or <a href="GoogleChrome.html">GoogleChrome</a> from the start, and <em>even then</em> I'd be in a better deployment situation.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>No. Google would change their JS to work in IE because it has market share, even if they use an "IF-vendor-equals-X and version=Y" statement.</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <em>Further, if the gui browser became as popular as Chrome, then it would be one of the choices to consider.</em>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               Further, a new browser client for a 'new alternative' (like GML), isn't fully developed yet, nor will be the standard. Therefore, I cannot trust its stability, and its maturity is relatively limited compared to HTML++. For example, even many years <em>after</em> a GML browser exists, it is unlikely that I'll have neat tools to help me develop GML applications. HTML++ is more mature, more developed, in every sense.
            </li>
            <li>
               Therefore, sticking with HTML++ leaves me in a better position of deployment and development than new alternatives even in the event of Microsoft sabotage. QED.

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           As far as your "Number 3 would be fine", what happened to your paranoia? Microsoft was going to <em>sabotage</em> HTML++ because they are super-anti-web-apps" by your moderately paranoid assessment, right? So they're not going to find sneaky, under-handed ways to sabotage a slightly more <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a> friendly design? Hmm. Well, Number 3 was an appeal to what I considered your paranoid faith that Microsoft will find <em>some, unnamed, sneaky way</em> to undermine HTML++.
