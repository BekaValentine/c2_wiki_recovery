        SANGUINE - Specific Action Notation for Graphical User Interface Navigation for Everyone
      </p>
      <p>
        The 'everyone' part of this acronym is probably not valid. It turns out that this notation is geared toward kinesthetic learners.
        A new name for this is <a href="GuiActionTrace.html">GuiActionTrace</a> (GAT), since one use of this notation is to trace what actions user takes with a GUI. The extension .gat also makes a nice (and generally unused) file name extension.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="SanguineGuiShorthand.html">SanguineGuiShorthand</a> is one possible solution to the <a href="GuiShorthand.html">GuiShorthand</a> problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The context and forces for this <a href="ProtoPattern.html">ProtoPattern</a> are on the <a href="GuiShorthand.html">GuiShorthand</a> page.

        This system of GUI shorthand is based on the idea of having the direction 
        to click on a button look a little bit like a button:
      </p>
      <code>
        [button]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The idea is to make things look something like in ascii what they look in the GUI.

        The notation for Sanguine Gui Shorthand is based on the idea of a button.  The following
        symbol is the notation that says 'press the label button':
      </p>
      <code>
        [label]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This looks like an ASCII representation of a button with the label 'label' displayed on it. It means 'press the label button'. The rest of Sanguine notation is based on this symbology.
      </p>
      <p>
        The proper level of detail for this is probably the symbolic keystroke level of detail, so that every keystroke is represented. This provides enough detail for a nontechnical person, and a symbolic format provides enough terseness for a technical person.

        Why does the name refer to blood?  Or is that just the way the acronym worked out?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sanguine does indeed come from the latin sanguin, or blood, but in English the adjective sanguine has the common meanings of "healthy" or "optimistic".  It comes from the 'four humors' theory of medieval medicine.  Other humorous [ugh, </em><a href="WorstPunEver.html">WorstPunEver</a>] adjectives include choleric  (easily angered), melancholy (depressed), and phlegmatic (cool, unemotional); how medieval psychologists came to these as the four basic emotional states is beyond me.<em> --</em><a href="TimLesher.html">TimLesher</a>

        I've been working with and on the notation for the past five years now and I have found that a possibly better name for it is GAT. This stands for GUI Action Trace, and seems to be good for tracing what a user actually does in a GUI. I have opened a new page at <a href="GatCouldMakeGuisEasier.html">GatCouldMakeGuisEasier</a> to perhaps further the discussion. --<a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>

        Doesn't SAP have something like this?

        Users will probably reject this because of the complexity of the notation. A translator would have to be written to convert this to English in order to be acceptable to users. In addition programmers will find the notation ugly.
      </p>

        This proposal is very ambitious.  It tries to show pictures of text boxes and command buttons, using a very brief syntax.  Unfortunately, the [] syntax for showing command buttons can be confusing, especially if the command button text has an arrow on it.

        This would be easier for a computer to parse.

        The 'everyone' part of this acronym is probably not valid. It turns out that this notation is geared toward <a href="KinestheticLearner.html">KinestheticLearner</a>s.
        A new name for this is <a href="GuiActionTrace.html">GuiActionTrace</a> (GAT), since one use of this notation is to trace what actions user takes with a GUI.
        .gat also makes a nice (and generally unused) file name extension. --<a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
