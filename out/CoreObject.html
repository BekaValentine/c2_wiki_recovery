        Core Object
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="CoreObject.html">CoreObject</a> is an encapsulation of an encapsulation, a further abstraction of <a href="ObjectOrientedDesign.html">ObjectOrientedDesign</a>. A quickie concrete example is the WarpCore on <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> ships (I don't really watch the show often, but every time I click through it, they dump the WarpCore 4 or 5 times). Imagine the "guts" of an object as a removable, replaceable core which can be "gotten" by a requesting object and later replaced by that object. If you're familiar with the <a href="MementoPattern.html">MementoPattern</a>, this should all be very familiar: an object can request a "snapshot" of an object (without violating encapsulation) and replace it with a new one. Now, to me, that kinda violates OO, knowing what's inside an object, whether done by "legal" means or not. Using a <a href="CoreObject.html">CoreObject</a> design, an arbitrary object contains a <a href="CoreObject.html">CoreObject</a>, which maintains the current State of the object. The encapsulating object has externalized methods with which an external object may request a clone of the <a href="CoreObject.html">CoreObject</a>. The encapsulating object should also contain a method to request that the current Core be replaced with a new Core, provided by the calling object.

        This sounds like a Memento object, doesn't it? One of the key advantages of a CoreObjectDesign, at this point in its construction, is that an encapsulating object may contain two or more cores, which may be interchanged at will. One application is a complex <a href="StateMachine.html">StateMachine</a> (big whoop). Another, more useful, application is the object's ability to jettison a core and replace it with a "good" core. -- <a href="BrianBrazil.html">BrianBrazil</a>
