        Stumbled across this Aussie company and just requested a developer registration.
        Looks like some interesting technologies.  --<a href="DanGreen.html">DanGreen</a> (always happy to plug his own country's companies)

        The Bullant language is heavily influenced by an early version of the <a href="EiffelLanguage.html">EiffelLanguage</a>. An Eiffel programmer would immediately feel "at home".

        <strong>Grumpy Review:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           More buzzwords than content
        </li>
        <li>
           The funny motion of the menu bar makes me queezy (using IE  4.72.311.8).  It's pure showing-off, adding no value to the site.  If this is what their web page does, what will their technology do to <em>my</em> web site?
        </li>
        <li>
           You too can make your web pages only viewable by your customers that are using an 80x86 and who are willing and able to tolerate the download of a 1.23 MB plug-in.
