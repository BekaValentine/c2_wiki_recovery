        Corporate Media
      </h1>
      <p>
        Describe <a href="CorporateMedia.html">CorporateMedia</a> here.
      </p>
      <p>
        An oft-repeated charge that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The media outlets in the US (henceforth TheMedia) are owned and operated mostly by large corporations;
        </li>
        <li>
           Said corporations use ownership of said media to suppress reporting that might expose corporate wrongdoing; and otherwise exercise editorial control in order to advance conservative causes;
        </li>
        <li>
           There is a wide-ranging conspiracy (explicit or one of convenience) to do so.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is often charged when a particular story is not covered, or a particular analysis is not explored, by the mainstream media outlets.  In many cases, there is a legitimate reason--namely that the story that is allegedly being suppressed is one that has no evidence to support it; and to report it would be tantamount to YellowJournalism.  
      </p>
      <p>
        In other cases, you start to wonder....
      </p>
      <p>
        There are many mechanisms by which corporations filter the news. Some of these include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           appointing only arch-conservatives and/or libertarians as editors
        </li>
        <li>
           promoting only right-wing journalists
        </li>
        <li>
           demoting left-wing journalists
        </li>
        <li>
           controlling ad revenue (try to find an anti-car ad in the corporate press)
        </li>
        <li>
           suing muckraking journalists for libel
        </li>
        <li>
           paying celebrity journalists 6 figure salaries, making them sympathize with the rich and turning them into economic conservatives
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Hiring complete and utter idiots like </em>GeraldoRivera to represent "the left" in order to claim balanced coverage (see FoxNewsChannel).  If TheManWhoGotKickedOutOfIraq were representative of liberalism; I'd want to be a conservative, too--<a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a><em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, much of the above assumes that media outlets (independent, corporate, or government-sponsored) have an overriding duty to </em>TheTruth, and that placing any other concern (whether ideology or profit) over TheTruth is inherently and unequivocably a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>.  TheLaw, of course, doesn't see it that way--if you own a newspaper, you can pretty much print whatever you want for whatever reason.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The other problem is that too many people assume that what THEY think is </em>TheTruth.  I know lots of "liberals" who believe that MotherJones and its ilk is the only place TheTruth may be found; and lots of conservatives who feel the same way about AmericanSpectator.  When in fact no publication or ideology has a monopoly on truth, no matter how hard they try to convince themselves (or you) otherwise.--<a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a><em></em>
