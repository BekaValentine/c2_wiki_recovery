        Better For Loop Construct
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a performance <a href="JavaIdiom.html">JavaIdiom</a>. (But we also seem to be talking about loops in C and C++ and Smalltalk and Lisp).
      </p>
      <p>
        The common way of coding an for statement is as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        for (int i=0;i<<em>upperbound</em>;i++) {<br/>
        ... do something<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (Even the second example that is concerned with performance in <a href="CheckDontCatch.html">CheckDontCatch</a> uses this idiom).
      </p>
      <p>
        When you know <em>upperbound</em> is invariant, sometimes a different idiom can speed this loop up a little.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           calculate <em>upperbound</em> once
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes you might measure to see if it would be faster to
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           count down
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you know <em>upperbound</em> changes (is not invariant), perhaps it would be less confusing to use <em>while</em> instead of <em>for</em>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>calculate <em>upperbound</em> once</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the vast majority of cases, <em>upperbound</em> is an invariant value obtained though some function call such as array.length, string.length() or arraylist.size().
      </p>
      <p>
        Most compilers are so dumb that they call that function on every iteration, just in case it has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Don't know about Java, but C/C++ compilers are </em>'prohibited<strong> (in general) from optimizing out such function calls; as there is no way for the compiler to know whether or not the function has </strong><a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>s or depends on external state (and might return different values on successive calls).<em> [in the case of java strings and arrays, strings are immutable, and arrays are fixed-size, so the compiler can confidently hoist the upperbound calculation out of the loop (the same holds for strings and arrays in .net languages, too, although in c# I'd just use a foreach, since the compiler will produce IL exactly equivalent to the for loop)]</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Most of the time,the programmer knows it is an invariant. (Sometimes a <a href="SufficientlySmartCompiler.html">SufficientlySmartCompiler</a> will also figure this out).
      </p>
      <p>
        When <em>upperbound</em> really is invariant, the following syntax causes the invariant <em>upperbound</em> value to be calculated once.
      </p>
      <code>
        for(int i=0,iMax=<em>upperbound</em>;i<iMax;i++) {<br/>
        ... do something<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This format can conveniently be templated with an editor (such as MultiEdit <a href="http://www.multiedit.com)">http://www.multiedit.com)</a> such that the construction of the preferred idiom is automatically done just by entering "fo ".

      <p>
        <em>Is the gain significant? What should be indicated is whether or not the upperbound needs to be recalculated.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>significance</em> of the gain is a function of what is the cost of calculating the <em>upperbound</em> and how many times we will go through the loop. For array.length it would eliminate a dereference. For string.length() and arraylist.size() it would eliminate a function call and dereference. In other cases it could involve an expensive function call. The main point is that since there is no penalty for using this construct in simple variable cases, acquiring the habit to use it in all cases improves performance for the situations where it really matters.

        <em>True. But setting iMax in a separate line makes it easier to add a comment as to why you're doing it. Though it needn't apply in this case, it can be handy to group critical variables together just to make it slightly easier to check their values make sense while you're verifying all is well.</em>

        <strong>Count down</strong>

      <code>
        for( int i=<em>upperbound</em>; i--; ) {<br/>
        ... do something ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or equivalently (to make the test for zero explicit)
      </p>
      <code>
        for( int i=<em>upperbound</em>; 0 != i--; ) {<br/>
        ... do something ...<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        See <a href="LinearShuffleSummary.html">LinearShuffleSummary</a> for another example.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a common idiom for (former?) assembly language programmers, because it makes the executable code smaller and faster in most assembly languages (what about Java bytecode?). 68000 assembly language has dedicated instructions for counting down - <strong>dbcc</strong> = "Decrement and Branch if this doesn't carry, unless (Condition Code)" - though these are relatively slow. DSP processors often have "zero-overhead looping".
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides <a href="ReduceUnimportantInformation.html">ReduceUnimportantInformation</a>, this has the additional benefit of making the <em>conditional-expression</em> more efficient, as the test for zero is automatic with the decrement. The assembler can <strong>jz</strong> immediately after <strong>dec i</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If <em>upperbound</em> is some parameter value to the function or other variable that you won't need after the loop, you can use that variable name directly instead of declaring the new variable <em>i</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A common idiom for string parsing functions <em>that are given the length of the string as a parameter, such as memcpy() or substring(),</em> as <em>upperbound</em> is typically the length of the string. This has much greater parsimony than the normal <strong>for</strong> triple-expression, and I think it's consequently more readable since I'm used to the idiom. Then again, I recall losing a mark on an exam because the TA thought I was off-by-one. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I gather this idiom is indeed too confusing. I recommend sticking with <strong>for( int i = 0; i < <em>upperbound</em>; i++ )</strong>. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        Very few C/C++ programmers really understand the difference between "upperbound--" and "--upperbound." Also, it is confusing to have an implied test rather than an explicit test for zero. Finally, it is also confusing if the test variable is decremented before the code it is controlling. It is better to stick with the more common for loop that most programmers know and recognize than to throw in constructs to cause programmers to "be in over their heads." -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>

        Going downwards through an array generates horrible amounts of cache misses - x86/x86-64 cache is optimized for looping forward (see intel/amd optimization manuals); therefore, downward counting is really MUCH SLOWER.
        When not looping through an array, though, downward counting may be a little faster, but the difference is negligible. -- pz

        In Java, [] would translate to an anonymous inner class with one method. [] is a function literal or block. In <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, for a syntax example, it would look like this.
      </p>
      <p>
        aList.Do(function(anItem){"body here"});
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the word function is basically declaring an inline function with no name, more importantly, it's body has access to all variables in the scope of where it was defined, this is called <a href="LexicalScope.html">LexicalScope</a>. I think smalltalk got it right by having a special syntax for literal functions, make writing them more idiomatic.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another way to do it in Java is to use the new (in Java 1.5.0? or before?) for-each construct:
      </p>
      <p>
        // Returns the sum of the elements of array a
        int sum(int[] a) {
      </p>
      <code>
        int result = 0;<br/>
        for (int i : a)<br/>
        result += i;<br/>
        return result;<br/>

      </p>
      <p>
        Interestingly, the literal Smalltalk translation of the "for"-loop is
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           to: <em>upperbound</em> do: [:i | i doSomething]
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Note that the loop upperbound gets evaluated only once, at the beginning of the loop. This again means that for a sufficiently expensive <em>upperbound</em>, the Smalltalk version will outperform its "equivalent" C version. This fact can in turn be used to craft a micro-benchmark that will "prove" that Smalltalk is more efficient than C. Which teaches one something about the value of micro-benchmarks... -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>

      <p>
        <em>Suppose the upperbound isn't invariant? Suppose it shrinks and we're testing for the intersection between it and </em>i<em>?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the size of the collection is changing in size as you process it, you have a very complicated problem and any defined looping method will not handle all cases. There is a limited set of changes that can be applied even with the upper bound being re-evaluated each pass.

        Yes this is premature optimization. This optimization is important IFF
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           'do something' compiles into about 10 or fewer machine instructions and when profiled they occupy a significant fraction of the compute time and the process is compute bound.
        </li>
        <li>
           the function call obtain upper bound is something significant like strlen()
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In all these cases, my (and I believe it should be your) preferred solutions is to assign the upper bound to a variable declared on a separate line. I think we observed some time ago that cramming as much logic as you can in one line of C is obtusification.

        To all the people attempting to turn this into language war (as if we need another). Better loop constructs are not created by changing flavour of syntactic sugar from C++ to PERL or smalltalk, cobol or basic. Changing to Malbolge however is not a better loop construct.

        Why hasn't anyone suggested the use of iterators as opposed to indices within the for construct? The advantages of iterators are that the evaluation is often directly based on the data, not an abstract size, and the resulting value can be used directly, no index table look-up. I have found this eliminates any question of off by 1 looping errors and eliminates some obscure array size calculations (for example sizeof(array)/sizeof(element)). In three years of using this approach, I haven't found a for loop that could not be written with iterators as opposed to indices. Examples may exist, but I believe they occur very rarely in practice. -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In Java, for loops are more efficient than iterators. Also, I've written so many for loops over collections that off by 1 errors don't arise. Finally, I sometimes need to treat certain elements differently, according to index, and with iterators I'd need an additional variable.

        Do we really need to drag C obfuscation into this discussion? Why would anyone want to strip the whitespace out of what was a clear expression in order to simulate a non-existent syntax? A writer should not make code unclear to future readers just because the writer thinks it looks cool.

        Care to test also this? Surely it expresses the programmer�s intention (to have a sum of all the elements of the array) most clearly. (Of course, inside it should look very much like sumArrayWithIterator� though this one evaluates end() <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.)

        Also, this test will not show much difference between indexes and iterators, because for std::vector iterators are usually pointers; but this one will be a completely different story:

        I really dig the way BASIC does it (minus goofy block ending conventions):

      <code>
        for x = 3 to 50 step 2 {....}<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Or
      </p>
      <code>

        ....<br/>
        endfor<br/>
      </code>

        It is easy to remember and English-like. I am not normally a fan of English-like syntax, but the for-loop is an exception. (Step 1 is the default of no step clause). Note <a href="ColdFusionLanguage.html">ColdFusionLanguage</a>:

        I like that Basic layout too - but there is something which annoys me about loops in general. More often than not, there is a need to exit at other than the beginning or the end of the loop. This is a common requirement across all languages. Yet the syntactic structures we use all hide the exit condition within the body of the loop, not at the same level as the loop. Like -
      </p>
      <code>
        for x = 3 to 50 step 2<br/>
        ....<br/>
        If Not(Condition) leave<br/>
        ....<br/>
        If (Condition) leave<br/>
        ....<br/>
        endfor<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I am used to, and prefer, this sort of syntax -
      </p>
      <code>
        for x = 3 to 50 step 2<br/>
        Code<br/>
        ....<br/>
        ....<br/>
        Until Condition<br/>
        Code<br/>
        ....<br/>
        ....<br/>
        While Condition<br/>
        Code<br/>
        ....<br/>
        ....<br/>
        endfor<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or, using <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> style for the exits,
      </p>
      <code>
        for x = 3 to 50 step 2<br/>
        Code<br/>
        ....<br/>
        ....<br/>
        Leave If Condition<br/>
        Code<br/>
        ....<br/>
        ....<br/>
        Leave Unless Condition<br/>
        Code<br/>
        ....<br/>
        ....<br/>
        endfor<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The main reason I prefer this is that it gives a clearer visual scan of the code. It makes loops and their exit conditions clearer.

        I read something about optimization once that said to iterate over an array on a Pentium, it was (at least in certain situations - I forget which) more efficient to do this (for clarity, I'm decompiling assembly here):
      </p>
      <code>
        element *end = array+n;<br/>
        int i = -n;<br/>
        do {<br/>
        /* Do stuff with end[i] */<br/>
        } while (++i);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I think if n might be zero it's better to test it outside of all that, and avoid the initialization.
