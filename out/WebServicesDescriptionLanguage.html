        WSDL is an XmlApplication for describing NetworkServices as a set of OperatingEndpoints on messages containing either DocumentOrientedInformation or ProcedureOrientedInformation. The OperationsAndMessages are DescribedAbstractly then bound to a ConcreteNetworkProtocol and MessageFormat to define an endpoint. RelatedConcreteEndpoints are combined into AbstractEndpoints (or Services). WSDL IsExtensible to allow EndpointDescriptions and their messages RegardlessOfMessageFormat or NetworkProtocolsUsedForCommunication. DescribedBindings in this document are only on HowToUseWsDl with the <a href="SimpleObjectAccessProtocol.html">SimpleObjectAccessProtocol</a>, HttpGetPost and MiMe.

        Original from the W3c site:

        "WSDL is an XML format for describing network services as a set of endpoints operating on messages containing either document-oriented or procedure-oriented information. The operations and messages are described abstractly, and then bound to a concrete network protocol and message format to define an endpoint. Related concrete endpoints are combined into abstract endpoints (services). WSDL is extensible to allow description of endpoints and their messages regardless of what message formats or network protocols are used to communicate, however, the only bindings described in this document describe how to use WSDL in conjunction with SOAP 1.1, HTTP GET/POST, and MIME."

        The purpose of Changing the Buzzwords into <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s was to illustrate how much technical writing uses terms understandable only to those who have already been exposed to what the Buzzwords mean.  The shortened version  of "WSDL is just an <a href="InterfaceDefinitionLanguage.html">InterfaceDefinitionLanguage</a> that uses <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> syntax." merely shortens the buzzwords down to two dealing with language and syntax instead of twenty dealing with formats, networks, endpoints, documents, interfaces, concreteness, abstractions, formats and protocols. The longer version suffers from attempting to load many concepts into a concise description and is not suitable for a person newly introduced to what <a href="WebServicesDescriptionLanguage.html">WebServicesDescriptionLanguage</a> is. What is called for is clarity and completeness.
