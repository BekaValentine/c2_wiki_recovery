        All Languages Are Alive
      </h1>
      <p>
        I keep reading about how languages are dead or failed.
      </p>
      <p>
        My workstation at home running <a href="GnuLinux.html">GnuLinux</a> has everything I need to program in:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ToolCommandLanguage.html">ToolCommandLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="EcmaScript.html">EcmaScript</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> (several implementations to choose from)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PrologLanguage.html">PrologLanguage</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ObjectiveCee.html">ObjectiveCee</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        ... and those are just the ones I know about! Plus, it's a pretty ancient distribution. I can't imagine how much more would be available to me if I'd bother to upgrade. Even <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> now.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nothing keeps me from using any of those to write the software I need. I've written programs in most of them and used programs written in all of them.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I can use them on my Mac, too:
          <ul>
            <li>
               About five of those came with my Mac. I've easily installed many of the rest. I'm pretty sure I could get very nearly all of them on my Mac without spending a dime.
            </li>
            <li>
               My Mac also has a couple my Linux workstation lacks:
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                   <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> (simply because I haven't bothered to install in under Linux)
                </li>
                <li>
                   ... and I'm thinking about installing <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> on the Mac as well to compare/contrast with Squeak.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           I can use them at work, too:
          <ul>
            <li>
               The servers I most depend upon at work also run GNU/Linux, so I can use those languages there. (Many of my coworkers have Linux on their workstations as well.) I can't use them in our actual products because, like any product, there are practicalities, tradeoffs, and choices that have to be made. Producing our products, however, requires a lot of code that doesn't actually run on the product itself.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           I can use them on Windows, too:
          <ul>
            <li>
               When I have to use Windows, I install <a href="CygWin.html">CygWin</a> and now I've got the ability to use almost all those languages. Plus, I can install native Windows versions of many of them.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In short, it is a great time to be alive and interested in programming languages. Implementations of many languages are easy to acquire and nothing is stopping us from putting any them to work.
