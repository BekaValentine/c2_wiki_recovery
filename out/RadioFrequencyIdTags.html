        Soon to replace bar codes, which are scanned individually at line of sight, the application of radio ID tags will overcome the need for visuality and singularity. The tags within the field of a wireless reading device can read hundreds of tags a second. The RFID tags can contain much more information than barcodes.

        The applications for this technology are ubiquitous with the possibilities of being installed in assemblies, containers, packages, clothing, shoes, luggage, books, rentable objects, saleable objects, and even your pet. (Yes they could conceivably be implanted beneath your pet's (or your own)skin.)

           Feb05 news told the story of a grade school attempts to use RFID to track children, and one reason cited was to lower the costs of vandalism. Any US privacy laws restricting the use of electronic monitoring devices?

        I have seen the predecessor of these utilized by manufacturers who need to track an assembly process to match the parts required at different stages of the manufacturing process. Utilizing tag readers and PLCs, over 100 bytes of information could be stored and written to as well as read from. This is an old technology which would be updated to be much smaller and less expensive.
