        Written Language Metaphor
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Language metaphors</strong> refer to the application of constructs developed from human languages (i.e. linguistics) into the programming language landscape.  Since so many languages depend on non-verbal <em>punctuation</em> of some sort, we can more specifically, talk about applying <em>written</em>-language metaphors.
      </p>
      <p>
        Firstly:  A part of general <a href="CodingStyle.html">CodingStyle</a> suggests putting a human-readable name to every conceptual unit.  This begins with variable names, and scales upwards to functions -> classes/structs/objects -> modules/files-> programs.  There are probably only a few exceptions, like general index variables and lambda functions, where this rule can be broken, unless you're writing code that will never be used again.
      </p>
      <p>
        Secondly, use the semantic categories to aid in naming objects (which helps every reader of the code):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Variables</em> should always be <strong>noun-named</strong> since they are static and act as the building blocks for your <a href="ObjectArchitecture.html">ObjectArchitecture</a>,
        </li>
        <li>
          After that use <strong>verb-names</strong> when applying computation -- the forces acting on these data,
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adverbs</strong> for when your modifying such methods (like Python decorators), and
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Adjectives</strong> for properties of your noun-objects.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition to using these linguistic concepts, I support the use of <em>punctuation</em> for being clearer than having none:  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "?" for query-object methods (isWritable?(file)),
        </li>
        <li>
           "!" for (possibly) mutating methods, writing to/within memory (sort!(myList)), 
        </li>
        <li>
           "#" for changing an otherwise immutable variable or writing to the file system (myDataBase#(all_current_objects)), 
        </li>
        <li>
           "^" for delegating to super/parent classes.
        </li>
        <li>
           "@" for referring to "self" in a method, 
        </li>
      </ul>
