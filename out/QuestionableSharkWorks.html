        Before: OOP let's you create any relational language you like, and use it natively in your language; it can be translated to Sql under the hood and on the fly. Why wait for something better when you can have it now?

      <p>
        Before: Doesn't look more tedious to me; looks quite simple, and far safer than appending strings since an OOP version would likely build a syntax tree from it that can be cleanly turned into paramaterized sql automatically.

        This page was originally headed 'If you spot problematic or curious alterations done by "grammar shark", please point them out here for peer review.' It's not clear whether that was intended to refer to <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> or <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If it's the former, there's no point in addressing any edit hints to <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> will delete his edits.
        </li>
        <li>
           If it's the latter, there's no point in addressing any edit hints to <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>. It is unable to distinguish whether a semi-colon is more or less appropriate than a comma. <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> merely identifies <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> edits and reverts them, regardless of content. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Reporting false positives is encouraged, but for obvious reasons please email these to me, <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>, along with the IP address(es) you've used to edit, via the email address on my <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        Er... About what? -- DV

      <p>
        I have a feeling that <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> may incite people to start rewriting bits of pages when it reverts their minor edits. It's a bit of human nature I've seen before: when a piece of forum software rejected posts that had a high mispelling-to-overall-length ratio, people started padding forum posts with unneeded sentences "to get around the spellchecker". Also, it discourages dyslexics from contributing (since needed corrections are opposed).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While that's possible, I would hope folks would not pad their edits in an attempt to circumvent the </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>First, it won't work.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Second, </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> maintains a whitelist of IP addresses associated with legitimate edits. I've already been adding IP addresses to it as folks contribute content or do obviously non-<a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> gnoming. You can email me (see above) to have your IP address(es) manually added.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Third, </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> is intended to enforce a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>, <strong>not</strong> prevent legitimate gnoming, including spelling corrections. Corrections of dyslexic spelling are less likely to trigger the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> than <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>'s specific modus operandi, anyway. If done from a whitelisted IP, automated reversions will not occur - as long as the editor does not have his or her <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> spoofed by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. As noted on the <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> page, <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> cookies are prone to spoofing by <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>. <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> uses <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> spoofing to combine his edit with a legitimate edit. Thus far, I have found no reliable deterministic way to distinguish this from an edit that is wholly <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>'s, so <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> responds in a predictable manner.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Fourth, I closely monitor my pet shark for misbehaviour. Corrections to </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> will be made as expeditiously as possible.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Fifth, over time </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>'s ability to discriminate <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> from legitimate edits will improve. While I obviously can't guarantee 100% reliability, the number of false positives should decline. Indeed, the most recent example involving <a href="IanOsgood.html">IanOsgood</a> was <strong>my</strong> mistake, not <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>'s. <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> flagged his edits as suspicious, but not to be automatically reverted. I was overzealous and approved the reversion.<em> </em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Sixth, unless </em><a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> is pathologically masochistic, he should soon realise editing here is futile and move to where he will be appreciated. (I recommend <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>.) When that happens, Shark will be manually shut down, not to be re-started until humans have verified that <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> (or some equivalent) has returned.<em></em>

      </ul>

      </p>
      <p>
        No, what's going to happen is that eventually the shark or something like it will piss off someone who is a) pathological and b) competent and they will write a distributed attack upon the wiki which will destroy it. Avoiding this kind of robotic escalation was the main point behind <a href="SoftSecurity.html">SoftSecurity</a>. The shark bites off this leg of <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. That the shark has the unintended effect of automatically maintaining spelling and grammar errors is an additional sad irony. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="ImminentDeathOfWikiPredicted.html">ImminentDeathOfWikiPredicted</a>!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>That Shark maintains spelling errors is unfortunate, but arguably preferrable to issuing </em><a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>s that have no teeth, and tacitly approving the participation of the <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a> who refuses to cooperate, employs <a href="UnethicalEditing.html">UnethicalEditing</a> including spoofing <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>s, rudely badgered an individual until he left and then obstructed his attempts to withdraw gracefully. <strong>That</strong> is when a leg of <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> was bitten off, and clearly the individual in question must be barred or it will probably happen again.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The spelling mistakes will eventually be fixed by me or someone else.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As for the the risk of distributed attack, I doubt </em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> makes it any worse. A pathological individual could as easily get pissed off by anything - an edit he or she doesn't like, the choice of font, phases of the moon, etc. From a technical point of view, such an attack is so trivial (simply scan <a href="http://c2.com/wiki/history">http://c2.com/wiki/history</a> to obtain all the page names, then issue deletes from a large set of open Web proxies) that I'm surprised it hasn't happened yet. I assume Ward maintains backups. Of course, it would be equally easy to restore Wiki using exactly the same method.<em></em>

            <li>
               1) do not need to be more pathological than the people who support <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a>, the <a href="ZeroTolerance.html">ZeroTolerance</a> gang. <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> is reversing edits in lots of pages that has not have activities for many weeks, and not even authored by few people that they have put on <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>. 
            </li>
            <li>
               2) do not need to be competent either as it is very cheap to finance such an attack, enough to drive away long term contributors like <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>.

        "Writing is on the Wall in regards to the future of VBA. In August this year, Microsoft announced they would be dropping VBA in the next version of <a href="MicrosoftOffice.html">MicrosoftOffice</a> for the Mac. Lots of protests then but things quieted down, probably accepting the futility of it all."
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> indicates a high probability that it was written by <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>, who is <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>ned.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        What about a suggestion that such be quarantined or marked rather than outright deleted. If questionable authors stick to the topic and are reasonable, then maybe it can be reviewed and kept. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It would be a strange interpretation of "</em><a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>" that permits continued participation, even if quarantined or marked.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed the point of a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> is to ostracize specific authors due to past disruptive behavior. To achieve this end, the community policy is one of <a href="ZeroTolerance.html">ZeroTolerance</a>: reject all attempts by the banned authors to contribute, regardless of the value (or lack thereof) of the contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The reverted contributions appear to even be deleted from the page's history directory, as I discovered while looking for a copy of my shark-bitten contributions after Anon impersonated my <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>; to me this seems to go beyond <a href="ZeroTolerance.html">ZeroTolerance</a> and smacks of <a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a>. For that matter, I'm not sure what the policy is if a non-<a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>ned author decides to integrate such rejected material unattributed in a later edit though - does it invite further vigorous application of the BanHammer? -- <a href="JeffreyHantin.html">JeffreyHantin</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Deletion of entries from the page history directory appears to be a function of </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>. <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> uses the same mechanisms available to a human editor, and has no special access to the page history or anything else. As for a non-<a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>ned author integrating rejected material, that's fine, as long as it isn't identical to the original, i.e., merely a page restoration or copy-'n'-paste.
