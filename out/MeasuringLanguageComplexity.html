        Measuring Language Complexity
      </h1>
      <p>
        Wiki, and TheLiterature (and all manner of casual programming conversation) is chock full of claims like "Language X is simpler (more complex) than language Y, because..."  Many such claims are based on rather trivial metrics, like number of keywords, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is a <em>meaningful</em> definition of simplicity/complexity?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ease with which a novice can write his own <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a> program?
        </li>
        <li>
           Ease with which a novice can become a competent programmer in the language?
        </li>
        <li>
           Ease with which a novice can become an expert in the language?
        </li>
        <li>
           Ease of implementation of the language?
        </li>
        <li>
           Ease of extension/tool development?
        </li>
        <li>
           Ease of developing simple applications (glue code, <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>s)
        </li>
        <li>
           (Relative) Ease of developing difficult applications
        </li>
        <li>
           Ease of developing applications in the language's intended domain area?
        </li>
        <li>
           Ease of developing applications outside the language's intended domain area?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And various metrics which get bandied about
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Size/complexity of grammar (number of rules of BNF, presence of ambiguities, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Number of keywords or "special forms"
        </li>
        <li>
           Size of the standard library
        </li>
        <li>
           Comprehensiveness of standard library
        </li>
        <li>
           Number of "kludges" in the language definition (all mature languages have quite a few, it seems)
        </li>
        <li>
           Presence of any smaller "subsets" of the language which are useful (does the <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a> apply to the language)?
        </li>
        <li>
           Number of <a href="ForDummies.html">ForDummies</a> books, training courses, college courses, etc. available for the language
        </li>
        <li>
           Quality of implementations/tools/environments
        </li>
        <li>
           Way programs are entered, integration with environment
          <ul>
            <li>
               <a href="ImageBasedLanguage.html">ImageBasedLanguage</a> (ie <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>)?

      </ul>
      <p>
        There isn't (despite what some will tell you) a clear cut answer to the above; and many of the above factors are opposing.  (I.e is it better to have a "simple" language like <a href="AlgolSixty.html">AlgolSixty</a>, <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>, or <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> with a minimalistic library; or something like <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> or <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> with libraries for everything under the sun?  When measuring complexity, should libraries be considered separate from the language or extensions of the language (such that you measure core language + libraries)?)
