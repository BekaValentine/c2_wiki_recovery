        Domain Value
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some operational definitions: <strong>domain value</strong> describes any value used in <a href="DomainModelling.html">DomainModelling</a>. <strong>value</strong> describes anything for which an intrinsically complete representation can be provided in finite space and time. Some properties of values and domain values include immutability (of the value, not of the representation), intrinsic identity (ideally decidable), finite <a href="KolmogorovComplexity.html">KolmogorovComplexity</a>, and computability. Related concepts include <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>, <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>, <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>, <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a> (since <a href="DomainModelling.html">DomainModelling</a> often utilizes a concept of 'objects'), and <a href="MultiValuedLogic.html">MultiValuedLogic</a> (most <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s inherit a set of values from a logic).
      </p>
      <p>
        Sources of <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s include (but aren't necessarily limited to):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>measurement</strong> - wavelengths, amplitudes, distances, temperatures, delta-time, geometries, topographies and relative positions, connectivity, masses, counts, etc. As a rule of thumb, measurements have units and limited precision or potential for inaccuracy. Fundamentally, these are 'initial' observations only with respect to a particular <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>: they are no less derived than any other <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> (indeed, they are usually derived from "more primitive" <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s, sometimes the implicit models we carry around in our heads that derive of our experience and use of language), yet they are often primitive in the sense that a given <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> will be capable of using these values but incapable of deriving all of them. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>assignment</strong> - addresses, regions, phone numbers, latitude and longitude, date, names, <a href="ObjectIdentity.html">ObjectIdentity</a>, etc. Things assigned by human institutions rather than derived from other properties or provided by mother nature. These are almost always primitive <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s in the sense that, seeing as they are assigned externally, most <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s have little or no support for deriving them (except from other assigned values).
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>assumption</strong> - assumed defaults in the absence of extra information... e.g. when predicting the weather tomorrow, we assume there won't be a freak solar flare or massive meteoric impact. And when talking about birds, we often assume we're talking about the sort that can fly.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>deduction</strong> - deductive application of <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> axioms to measured or assumed <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s will result in more <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s. Within the <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>, axioms are considered 'true'. In Science, they just haven't been falsified yet. Axioms that hold under great scrutiny are sometimes considered 'laws'. 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>induction and abduction</strong> - there are several forms of inference weaker than deduction and axioms. Primary among these are induction (which is based on strengthening or weakening of a conclusion based on combining evidence that is individually inconclusive)
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>scores</strong> - arithmetic combinations of other <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s and conditions over them (e.g. +1 if X, -1 if Y, *1.2 at the end if Z). Scores can be objective and automated, and will generally be somewhat arbitrary, but have proven repeatedly in practice to support effective prediction and planning. Scores can be made in multiple categories. Used as a tool in induction and abduction.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>qualification</strong> - assigning truth values (from <a href="MultiValuedLogic.html">MultiValuedLogic</a>) to properties; generally derived.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>classification</strong> - related to scoring, but one ends with a class (e.g. a name for a color, a genus for a plant) instead of a number. Generally based on qualitative combinations rather than quantitative ones. A useful tool here is the <strong>Rubric</strong>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In addition, one should consider <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a>s - or models of models. In the domain of <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a>s, components of models themselves become <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s, including: axioms and laws, Rubrics, systems of scoring, description of assumptions, mechanisms of assignment, and forms of measurement. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes we call arrangements of 'primitive' <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s "data" while we call the derived forms (from deduction, assumption, induction, scores, rubrics, etc.) "information". It's all derived, of course, but it is sometimes useful in discussion to note the relative 'level' of derivation. In a <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> we might call it all 'information', but assign each piece of information a few numbers based on how many 'steps' from 'initial' information it happens to be. These numbers, in a <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a>, can be useful for limiting confidence in a deduction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DomainModelling.html">DomainModelling</a> can be used for both analysis and synthesis, for both prediction and planning. For planning, we're interested in deriving <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s (e.g. arrangements of troops, or connectivity in a graph) necessary to achieve desirable properties (e.g. victory, failover redundancy). For prediction, we're interested in deriving future properties (e.g. victory, failover redundancy) from <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s (e.g. arrangement of troops, or connectivity in a graph). When it comes to <a href="PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition.html">PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition</a> in <a href="DomainModelling.html">DomainModelling</a>, it is very useful if the set of "properties" being planned for or predicted are themselves <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s; this property allows one to predict or plan multiple 'steps' forward since in each step you have <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One might consider a <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> as a modeling system in which synthesis of language structures is aimed to achieve particular properties. In this case the <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s would be the language structures. Relative to <a href="PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition.html">PrimitivesAndMeansOfComposition</a> and the composition of models, one predicts it useful that arbitrary language structures can be composed to achieve new language structures - this is a property we on this wiki have described as <a href="SymmetryOfLanguage.html">SymmetryOfLanguage</a>, and in CS in general we call '<a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a>' those language structures that can be produced and composed in this manner. Of course, like all models, those written in a <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> often becomes less reliable and more difficult to analyze, verify, and confirm as the compose new layers. Like <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s, programs need testing, analysis, and sometimes some optimization analogous to the sort we achieve by combining axioms into theorems.
      </p>
      <p>
        A '<a href="DomainSpecificLanguage.html">DomainSpecificLanguage</a>' in this analogy is one that supports <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s (language structures, measurements) and embeds domain derivations (assumptions, axioms) targeted toward a specific domain or class of domains. A '<a href="GeneralPurposeProgrammingLanguage.html">GeneralPurposeProgrammingLanguage</a>' would be the <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> of programming language systems, and could probably be analyzed in terms of how readily one can construct domain models (perhaps as library APIs if not working with <a href="ExtensibleProgrammingLanguage.html">ExtensibleProgrammingLanguage</a>) and how well one can compose different domain models (without invasively modifying their domain APIs or stumbling over <a href="CrossCuttingConcern.html">CrossCuttingConcern</a>s like mutexes, locking, logging, garbage collection, problematic inefficiencies, etc.).
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, data is modeled as relationships between <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s, and <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> models the data (not the domain). In this sense, <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> is not domain specific. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In practice, most RDBMS technologies are limited to supporting <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s targeted towards 'typical' business applications such as customer and order databases. (This makes sense. They're paying for it.) Existing RDBMS technologies are too limited for efficient application in general science, math, and any sort of <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> application due the limitations imposed on <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s. This is not a fault of <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        Related to this, there's been some ongoing combat in pages including <a href="CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing.html">CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing</a>, <a href="RelationalAndTrees.html">RelationalAndTrees</a>, <a href="RelationalTreesAndGraphsDiscussion.html">RelationalTreesAndGraphsDiscussion</a>, and other pages regarding whether 'complex' domain values (such as geometries, topologies, graphs, and <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s such as rules, axioms, propositions, assumptions, requests, permissions, etc.) should be represented in the manner specified by <a href="EfCodd.html">EfCodd</a>, <a href="DateAndDarwen.html">DateAndDarwen</a>, et al. as <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s in a relationship, or be unfolded into external relations and referenced by use of surrogate keys. It isn't a <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> - as noted, it doesn't count as a <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a> if it's just <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> is <a href="HandWaving.html">HandWaving</a> by himself against the world. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>YOU are the handwaver, not me. You are vague, obtuse, and difficult.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You say that, but it's just more of your handwaving, this time with a bit of a temper-tantrum thrown in.

        <em>I find this definition vague. It needs a rework. Examples of domain values and non-domain values to compare would be helpful.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I do agree examples are helpful, and that's why I provided a list of examples: measures, scores, classifications, multi-valued logic, assignment, etc. You claim this 'vague'. I ask that you justify that claim rather than just asserting it.
      </p>

        I am willing to provide more specific examples.

        <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s can be derived from axioms and assumptions, induction and abduction, scoring systems, etc. These assumptions and systems constitute the '<a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>'. Examples:

        <em>Equally important, perhaps more so, and also requested above, are examples of "information" that is *not* a </em><a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>. If no information is not a <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>, then we might as well call it "info" instead of some geekier term that will only serve to confuse. In other words, <a href="PrematureComplexity.html">PrematureComplexity</a> of terms.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Logically, you have that point reversed. There are infinite examples of <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s that are *not* "information", so one shouldn't indiscriminately call it all "info". A simple example of a value that is not information: 'true'. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Axioms, assumptions, rubrics, scoring systems, algorithms, etc. are also not "information"; they are parts of <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s, and <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s are more or less formal sets of prediction rules. It <strong>is</strong> information to know that a particular <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> is successful at making predictions about observations, but <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s themselves should be treated like prime numbers: each has some unique properties and common properties that distinguish them from other values, but there are infinite of them and simply because you're holding a <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> doesn't imply it is based on any observations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Vice versa, by stratifying into a <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a>, all forms of <em>representable</em> 'information' can be expressed as <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s by stratifying into the <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a>. E.g. the relational schema models a particular domain with specific semantics for each tuple in each relation. The <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> says that units of data are described as tuples in relations, and thus makes 'tuples' and 'relations' the <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s. A model of the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> is written in a logic that allows many variants... an 'implementation' of the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, for example, is a model of the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a> is utilized relative to a given <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>. Confusion about stratification into the <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> is very rare in practice. Every 'value' is a value in at least one domain, but it is generally obvious which values aren't relevant in a given domain (e.g. we don't deal with "furious" and "angry" in the study of triangles). As with many other words, it would usually take a <a href="HumptyDumpty.html">HumptyDumpty</a>/<a href="DevilsAdvocate.html">DevilsAdvocate</a>/sophist bastard to utterly ignore context and word-lawyer "<a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>" in an active attempt to confuse the issue. My 'model' of the Internet tells me I can count on a few such guys hanging around any active forum, of course, but that doesn't reduce the value of the words to make useful distinctions.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a final note, use of <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>, <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>, etc. were refined over several centuries. Calling it "<a href="PrematureComplexity.html">PrematureComplexity</a> of terms" is a statement made in ignorance of the processes and forces leading to the distinctions, a tad arrogant and disrespectful, and a few centuries late.

        <li>
           'Logic Model' is a system of <a href="MultiValuedLogic.html">MultiValuedLogic</a>, variables, statements, and inference rules. A formal logic is a math or calculi, but not all logics are formal.
        </li>
        <li>
           'Theorems' are things that are true if the <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> is accurate and the logic is consistent. These are thing things you can prove 'on paper' without ever making an empirical observation. Theorems include "hypotheses" that can be used to <strong>verify</strong> a <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           '<a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>' includes axioms, classifications, assumptions, scoring mechanisms and rubrics, etc.
        </li>
        <li>
           box 'U' contains things that can be described in the logic model, but that are meaningless (undecidable, divergent, paradoxes, undefined, unknowable values, etc.). These are problematic when implementing the Logic Model. Not all logics stretch into the undecidable.
        </li>
        <li>
           box 'A' is that fraction of the Data that can be input into a particular <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>, but cannot be outputs from the <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> (i.e. "input-only" data). 
        </li>
        <li>
           box 'B' is the fraction of the Data that could be output from the Logic Model, but isn't used by the <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>. I.e. stuff from 'B' could be output by theorems in the <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>. Stuff from box 'B' could be inputs to another <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> that uses or overlaps the same Logic model.
        </li>
        <li>
           box 'C' is the fraction of data that can be both input to the <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> and output from <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> theorems. It can be used in iterative (i.e. multi-step) predictions and planning. It is often favorable for box "C" to be fairly large.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Everything in the 'Data' box (including overlap with 'A', 'B', 'C') qualifies as "information", though some people prefer to further distinguish 'raw' Data (e.g. input streams from a sensor device) from Information by calling only "processed" stuff (theorem outputs found in boxes 'B' and 'C') "information". I don't care one way or the other, as I tend to view Data as a "flow" (as per <a href="DataflowProgramming.html">DataflowProgramming</a>, <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a>) rather than a static entity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Everything <em>outside</em> the 'Data' box <strong>is not information</strong>. Axioms aren't information. Theorems aren't information. Logics aren't information. <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s aren't information. Since you like the word so much, it might help for you to think of it this way: Anything that can be produced by pure <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a>, without any inputs from the outside world, cannot possibly be information or data. Since one can invent <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s and Logic models on whim, those aren't information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        If I pull the number '7' out of my arse, the number 7 isn't information, even though it is a <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>. And if there is a number that nobody ever uses for the lifespan of this universe, that is also not information or data, but it is still a <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>. The fact that I pulled number '7' out of my arse, however, is information, since it says something about the world. Data that a particular <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> is correct 99% of the time <em>is</em> information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite what you're thinking, tools do benefit from treating <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s as distinct from Data. The main difference between them: For <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s, you need operators, equality comparisons, conversions, serialization, storage, and <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>. If your tool is "general purpose" or "<a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a>" in nature, you additionally require expression support for a range of <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s wide enough to describe a Logic Model, Theorems, Axioms, Assumptions, Heuristics, Rubrics, Scoring systems, and user-defined types to support new classifications, new measurements, new assignments, etc. so that people can create entirely new <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s.  Data, on the other hand, needs <a href="DataManipulation.html">DataManipulation</a> support, and will be described by the expression of of <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s <strong>in</strong> a <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> (such as the expression of a tuple <strong>in</strong> the <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a> of data).

      <p>
        [When someone doesn't understand something, it is helpful to explain even that which appears obvious, especially when they write general phrases like "common computerized 'stuff'".  Keyboards are common computerized "stuff".  I hope the explanation that pointers and surrogate keys are not domain values clarifies things.  By the way, I'm not sure what you mean by "the helicopter example."]

        <em>"Computerized stuff" and "computer stuff" do not mean the same.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [Ah.  I interpreted it in a very broad sense.  You might have been clearer to ask for examples of common values that are not <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s.]

        <em>It would probably turn into a fight over the definition of "value". Thus, I avoided the word.</em>

        [In retrospect, you probably shouldn't have.  Anyway, to me, "computerized stuff" implies things like mobile phones, fancy dishwashers with digital front-panels, automotive fuel-injection systems and the like, i.e., things with embedded CPUs.  (They aren't <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s either, by the way.)]

      <p>
        <em>I probably should have said "digitized". (When people say "you should computerize your accounting", usually they mean use software instead of paper and hand-calculators. I generally didn't associate it with "has a little CPU chip inside", but I suppose its possible to interpret it that way.) Now that that's out of the way, where's the examples?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [I gave you some examples:  In the context of end-user applications, surrogate keys and pointers are not domain values.]
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>"In the context of" leaves too much wiggle room. The distinction between "pointer" and "ID" can be fuzzy, for example.

           [*Eyes roll*]
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Of the things that are 'digitized', the ones most clearly not <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s are services and objects and anything else with extrinsic identity. Those aren't values at all (as noted in the opening, values have intrinsic identity and are intrinsically complete). Since they aren't values, they cannot be <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s. I cannot provide examples of the region outside '<a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>' and inside 'value'. That represents the pool of potential value types that don't yet have names or uses. That region is not empty, though. That can be proven non-constructively. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They don't yet have names? That is fishy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        More usefully, where '<a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>' is a useful distinction, is when discussing <a href="DomainValue.html">DomainValue</a>s relative to a given <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>. In this sense, surrogate keys between elements of the domain model (be they values or objects) are not themselves domain values. Nor are computation errors or evaluation forms in the logic model.

        If you are truly confused on this issue, why don't you provide an example you think is problematic in actual application?

        Data - even data from box "C" - in general shouldn't be stored or encapsulated as part of the model (having it <em>cached</em> as part of the model's <em>implementation</em> is a different story).
