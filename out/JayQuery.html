        Jay Query

        jQuery is a lightweight cross-browser <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> library that emphasizes interaction between <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and HTML. <a href="http://jquery.com/">http://jquery.com/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        An very interesting (and the reason of its name) is that JQuery allows the developer to "query" for DOM nodes and modify them
        somewhat dealing with the page as it were a database. (Although not one following the relational model... I guess it is more like network model based)

        jQuery is crying <a href="GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreencoddsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>, and is the evil Frankensteinian son of CODASYL (a <a href="NetworkDatabase.html">NetworkDatabase</a>). SQL is the de-facto standard (even though it's not a perfect language); so let's not invent more query languages. (Adding some tree-friendly SQL functions could help out in the case of markup documents.) Yet another reason why it's time to blow up the <a href="HtmlStack.html">HtmlStack</a> and start over. Tim Berners-Lee 2.0, where are you! A nation [world] turns its lonely eyes to you. --top

        <em>jQuery isn't a query language, and has nothing to do with query languages.  It's a </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> library with a misleading name.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is indeed a query language: "Put an event handler on all green tags with purple classes". It's a lot of things, perhaps too many. It may just end up being the next Emacs.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A query language answers questions, which is why it's called a </em>'query<em>' language.  Obviously, if you find jQuery difficult, you're free not to use it.  Instead, you can implement all its functionality from scratch.</em>
      </p>

        <li>
           Okay, my example is more like an UPDATE statement comparison, so technically you are correct. But it uses "query-like" idioms the same way an SQL UPDATE command often does. Personally, I don't see a reason to make an iron-wall distinction between "display" and "do something with". It's a predicate plus an activity applied to or with the results (filtering) of the predicate. (Lispers have a special term for that IIRC.) That activity may be to display something, update something, etc. But some feel such distinctions are important for some reason. If it's a security issue, then use security idioms. The general form is:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        structure(s) to traverse -> filter criteria -> action(s) on filtered results<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I think you are missing my point. JQuery is a band-aid. Yes, the band-aid may be better than no band-aid, but there is still a massive wound.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You claimed jQuery "is the evil Frankensteinian son of CODASYL (a </em><a href="NetworkDatabase.html">NetworkDatabase</a>)".  Whether that was your core point or not, it's nonsense.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        When you build a band-aid for a specific kind of mess, you tend to end up with Frankensteins. The CSS "selector" rules are also part of the disease. 
      </p>

        My "fix" is to make stylesheets be XML and then find a convenient XML query language or devise SQL tree-oriented functions. That way we don't have to reinvent one query language for CSS and another for XML and another for tabular data, etc. <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
