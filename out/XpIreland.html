        <dt>XPSIG</dt>
        <dd>This is a quarterly meeting organized by eXoftware. We organize specialist speakers on various XP topics. We had our inaugural meeting May 16th at IONA Technologies Headquarters. It was a tremendous success with over 90 attendees. See <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20010803090853/http://www.exoftware.com/xpsig.htm">http://web.archive.org/web/20010803090853/http://www.exoftware.com/xpsig.htm</a> for more details. The slides are available at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpsig/files/XPSIG/.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpsig/files/XPSIG/.</a> We plan on holding our next XPSIG in September.</dd>

        <dt>Last Tuesday Club</dt>
        <dd>This is a casual get together the last Tuesday of each month and takes its inspiration from the XTC of <a href="LondonXpUsersGroup.html">LondonXpUsersGroup</a>. It provides an informal forum for people to meet and share their experience, ask their questions, or bitch about work etc. Occasionally, we will have specialist nights if somebody has something specific to offer e.g. a tool report, an experience report, etc.</dd>

        <dd>The second 'Last Tuesday Club' will be held this coming Tuesday, July 1st, again in Hourican's Pub on Lower Leeson Street starting at 6.00pm. Again as an added incentive the first drink for all attendees is on me.</dd>

        <dd>There is also the beginnings of a Yahoo Group for <a href="XpIreland.html">XpIreland</a> located at <a href="http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpsig.">http://groups.yahoo.com/group/xpsig.</a> This is fairly quite right now but I make regular postings of significant XP articles, books, etc.</dd>
