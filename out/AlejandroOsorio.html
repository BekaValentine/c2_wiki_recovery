          -07-02 Hey, looking up my name with some browser, I ran into this page which, long ago, I created.  Cool!  Now, from some time now I own my own web page, so if you want to know more about me, just go to <a href="http:www.maoo.biz">http:www.maoo.biz</a> (It's in spanish, though).

        BTW, and as it's usual in my lifestyle, this page will evolve with time, with no hurry at all. I'm a fervent believer in non-pressured-processes. So try not to get pissed off if there's nothing else to read about me for the moment."
