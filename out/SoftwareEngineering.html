        Shouldn't <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a> be more like engineering? Or is this a case of <a href="DisciplineEnvy.html">DisciplineEnvy</a>. Many CS (that "S" is for "Science", as in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>, another envy) departments have been moved into engineering schools, though that may simply be a tactic to grab industry dollars.

        These steps have lead to an engineering discipline ...

        <em>Check out </em><a href="DavidParnas.html">DavidParnas</a>'s claim that "[...]new methods in [Electrical] Engineering were not adopted as a result of the kind of things we are trying in Software Engineering. Engineers use methods if they work. [...] It wasn't necessary for Gauss or Kirchoff to form "User Groups" or write "Ten Commandments" style articles to sell their ideas. The ideas sold themselves. [...] We are putting too much effort into selling methods that are not yet ready. If they were ready, we would not have to sell them."<em></em>

        Software engineering is just like software development, except with the following difference: imagine signing the paper below and giving it to your employer:
      </p>
      <code>
        I, __________, do hereby pledge that the project I am running<br/>
        works for the requirements described by my employer.<br/>
        If it does not work, I accept full personal, financial,<br/>
        and criminal responsibility.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        signed,<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        _______<br/>
        Engineer.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That's it. Engineering isn't about design, or architecture, or abstraction, or algorithms, or fiddling with bits. It's about a personal guarantee. Canadian engineering societies weren't formed because people wanted "higher standards of practice" - they were formed because a bridge in Quebec fell down three times, killing many people, and nobody was responsible. Engineering is sucking it up and saying "I'm responsible". Not the compiler vendor, not Microsoft, not your boss, and not your subordinates. Your job is to make sure that everything you use is safe - if Microsoft's module isn't safe, you don't use it. If your employee's code isn't safe, you don't use it. "I didn't know" isn't an excuse. It was your job to know. If your bosses have ordered you to do something that isn't safe - you don't sign off on it. You argue until they either give in or fire you, and if they fire you then you take them to court and prove that they fired you because they wanted you to sign off on something unsafe for their customers, employees, or public.
      </p>
      <p>
        This means that nobody wants an engineer, or to be an engineer, without a good reason. Engineers are needed where it is _necessary_ - not because it's a neat idea. An engineer is perfectly capable of working in software development, but it isn't engineering until he gives his personal guarantee - otherwise, he's just an engineer working as a software developer.
      </p>
      <p>
        All the other stuff about standards of practice, conventions, etc. come as a product of this first accountability - not the other way around.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        But being responsible is a two-way street: You cannot be responsible if you aren't allowed the freedom to make your own choices, especially as to toolset and materials and the fundamental methodology. Imagine trying to find an engineer to build you a bridge if you demanded all calculations be done on four-function calculators, cheap plywood and glue construction, and a disregard of the accepted best practices. (Best practices are a legal concept, as I understand them: They're a way of saying "I did my best according to what everyone else qualified to judge me says is the right way of doing things.") That is an obvious absurdity and you would never get a competent engineer to sign on to the project. (By definition, any engineer who <em>would</em> is incompetent.) So why do we demand responsibility when the current common tools are junk, the current common languages are worse, and the standard methods are a <a href="SoftwarePatent.html">SoftwarePatent</a> minefield? You can tell me <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> exists as something other than a hyperbolic term when the people who create software have as much freedom (including freedom from the WesternWorld's current psychotic patent system) as the people who design bridges.

        Where can I go to study software engineering? <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> is great, but I don't want to write a compiler or an operating system. I want to write software (apps and libraries). Do I have to teach myself?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Top tier universities require you to take courses on compilers and operating systems because they realize that such things are just part of understanding what you are doing when you go off and do any kind of software at all. If you write apps and libraries and know nothing of operating systems, compilers, assembly language, etc, then you will continually run into trouble and won't even know why, whereas someone who has learned the proper foundations will not have those difficulties.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If you don't care, and just want to do what you want to do, and screw the consequences, then yes, either teach yourself, or go to a trade school (although they, also, are annoying in trying to teach you more than you might want to know :-) But less so than a university)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But you'd be cheating yourself. You </em>'cannot<strong> do "software engineering" without learning </strong>all<em>' of the fundamentals. At best you can learn to do a little programming.</em>

        There is a fundamental failure here in definitions. People think "engineering" is prestigious, like design and architecture. They think being a software "engineer" sounds better but don't realize they're completely different things. Engineering isn't about "design", or about "theory". It's about safety, failures, and fault-tolerance. You want to be a "software engineer"? Start programming in <a href="AdaLanguage.html">AdaLanguage</a>. The difference between an engineering and a designer is personal liability. If a designer's product fails, the worst he can get is fired. If an engineer's product fails, he can lose his license and be sued into oblivion.

        An essay on this topic by <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> appears in the July/August issue of the <a href="CppReport.html">CppReport</a> [what year???]. The main tenet of this essay is that patterns draw on art and the soft sciences and on people issues, thereby providing a strong counterpoint to computer <em>science</em> and software <em>engineering</em> and their pretense at formalism. We are interested in architecture, and would be well-instructed to heed Rybczynski's formula:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Engineering + culture = architecture</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Patterns help us embrace cultural aesthetics and help us put science and engineering in perspective.
      </p>
      <p>
        The essay explores the classical architectural literature in depth, and underscores largely unsung Alexandrian principles.

Mature branches of engineering do tend to have big manuals of accepted practice, and quantitative methods in support of those practices. But that isn't what <em>defines</em> them.

        I had a recent such discussion with a representative from the Provost's office of the university. He simply sneered at the mention of "Computer Engineering", wanting to make a curriculum as "high" as Chemical Engineering. He wasn't looking at artifacts; he was looking at reputation, alumni donations, federal and industry grants.

        When I have bumped into civil engineers who build buildings and ships and things, their life struck me as remarkably like ours. Simulations with lots of tests.

        I come from a university named after an engineer which graduates large numbers of engineers. So I have engineering friends. I've worked with some of them on joint hardware and software projects. One thing I have noted is that they tended to draw pictures before they started making things. These pictures tended to be untidy unless it is a large project: e.g., remaking a house. They fitted the paperwork to the project. Lightweight for small projects (on a napkin:-), heavyweight (get out the drawing board) on larger ones. -- <a href="DickBotting.html">DickBotting</a>

        A management goal of software engineering is to create software that can be programmed by non-programmers. Marketing and management can dream up program ideas in 10 minutes, so what can possibly be so hard about making it work? It implicitly recognizes the difficulty of the task - if it actually was easy, they wouldn't have hired programmers in the first place - while disrespecting the value of a programmer's contribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see that attitude a lot from non-programmers. They are used to software that makes it easy to render 3d scenes, spell check, chat online - and they try to extrapolate that to writing software. They completely miss the fact that all those "easy to do things" are because of programmers. Programmers making easy to use software does not extrapolate into software that makes it easy to replace programmers.</em>

        <em>Every now and then someone comes out with a wizard/automation/case tool they say can "generate complex software from a few simple fields" - the part they don't mention is the extremely small scope it can handle.

        <em>The best analogy I can think of is if mechanical engineers had to put up with products that claimed to "automatically generate complex blueprints and schematics, as well as the parts - from a few simple fields!"

        Is creating software even Engineering? I would posit that it is closer to <a href="ResearchAndDevelopment.html">ResearchAndDevelopment</a> than Engineering since in may cases something which has never been built is being created (except, perhaps for small problems or mature programs in their maintenance phase). The key to what makes Engineering work is that in a given problem domain, such as building bridges, solutions templates exists (prefab design and components) which ensure a very high success rate. Software, except for the smallest problems, does not have this. And if it does, it can be largely automated to replicate itself (Such as localized versions of an office application) requiring no skilled human intervention.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Even if solutions templates exist in the case of building briges, you don't blind-fully apply them for reasons of factors such as weather, natural disaster, culture, etc.

        I worked as a contractor on a government project that used a MIL Spec Software Engineering standard. Though, the project was standard business data processing. The part I worked on was a yearlong high-level design. The military users read and formally signed-off on the document. Low-level design was next, then development and testing, user acceptance, etc. They must have paid 5-10 times the cost of a corporate project of similar size and complexity. The same MIL Spec was used to design and build the Saturn rocket, a good spec, misused for the project I participated in.

        If programming is at all like engineering, it's most like <em>Manufacturing Engineering</em>--designing and building the Rube Goldberg-esque machinery that turns out by the thousands the simple familiar things around us. Designing these things is 60% standards, 10% creative genius and 30% optimization. Make a mistake, and thousands of parts come out the end carrying your error. A small tweak can save a great deal of money or turn out garbage at a high rate. Does all this sound familiar?
      </p>
      <p>
        Like software, most manufacturing systems are one-of, each one has its own challenges, and the solution to each challenge becomes part of the tradecraft for future designs. Most manufacturing systems also include software, and when you're cutting metal, an error can be very expensive, possibly deadly--so there are no errors.  That leaves a question: "What can programming learn from Manufacturing Engineering?"

        The two hardest problems in software engineering are managing complex variations-on-a-theme (such as what sub-classing is sometimes used for), and managing the inherently interweaving cross-cutting concerns of the domain or the requirements. The second makes clean or pure modularization difficult since the reality we are modeling usually has "leaky" parts or categories. It's perhaps a form of the <a href="ButterflyEffect.html">ButterflyEffect</a>. Perhaps this is less of an issue in <a href="SystemsSoftware.html">SystemsSoftware</a> than domains involving or modeling business, law, politics, etc. --top

        Perhaps this relates to <a href="SufficientlyFlexibleAppsResembleInterpreters.html">SufficientlyFlexibleAppsResembleInterpreters</a>.
