        Microsoft Fake Grassroots
      </h1>
      <p>
        Any attempt by Microsoft to simulate a grassroots movement to spread the perception that the general public agrees with and supports Microsoft's position. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Interesting.  Microsoft is certainly trying to create and foster developer communities.  It looks to me like they are having some limited success with this.  From the outset, the </em><a href="GotDotNet.html">GotDotNet</a> site has had the pretense of community, and it achieves this goal in some respects, as much as a portal probably can, but it's Microsoft owned and controlled patina underlies everything...<em> -- </em><a href="StevenBlack.html">StevenBlack</a>

        This is related to "MediaAstroturfing", where a massive public protest/email campaign is simulated by spamming the media.
      </p>

        <em>They are so wealthy they can </em>'buy<strong> public support. They can afford it. Remember when they had problems with the Department of Justice? They invoked </strong>freedom to innovate<em>' (read: drown their competitors with illegal tactics). That was quite a weird strategy! Imagine! They counter-attacked the Goverment of the USA by creating a sort of grassroots movement supporting their "just cause" and their "right to innovate"!.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This new grassroots campaign is part of their campaign to renew their image into a friendly Microsoft who cares about the community, who cares about users. Pretty soon you'll have Bill Gates cooking hamburgers in poor communities!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The fake grassroots campaign was run(or is still active) during the antitrust proceedings, not as a result. Microsoft communities(especially developer communities) are not really part of a <a href="MicrosoftFakeGrassroots.html">MicrosoftFakeGrassroots</a> campaign. <a href="MicrosoftFakeGrassroots.html">MicrosoftFakeGrassroots</a> refers to deceptive practices where the public is not aware of Microsoft's presence behind the supposed "grassroots campaign". Legitimate corporate communities/sites are not included. MSDN is most certainly not part of <a href="MicrosoftFakeGrassroots.html">MicrosoftFakeGrassroots</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Concretely, how do they operate this fake grassroots campaign? Do they pay people?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some techniques:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Planting/astroturfing letters to the editor/op-ed pieces.
        </li>
        <li>
           Organizing letter-writing campaigns to lawmakers(appears to be spontaneous outpouring)
        </li>
        <li>
           Creating activist organizations that are microsoft controlled, but do not initially appear to be(Freedom To Innovate, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
           Influencing other corporations through third parties(Baystar Capital)
        </li>
        <li>
           Creating local user groups.  In contrast to user groups for other technologies -- Java, Apple, Linux, Ruby that formed gradually when like-minded people organized themselves, early .NET user groups were simply created fully formed by Microsoft. Skeptical -- read about the organization here and ponder how it compares with other technical user groups: <a href="http://www.padnug.org/padnug/Organization.aspx">http://www.padnug.org/padnug/Organization.aspx</a> <a href="http://www.ineta.org/DesktopDefault.aspx">http://www.ineta.org/DesktopDefault.aspx</a>
