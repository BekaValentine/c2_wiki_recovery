        Right Thing
      </h1>
      <p>
        According to the Jargon File, version 4.1.2:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Right Thing (n.)</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That which is compellingly the correct or appropriate thing to use, do, say, etc. Often capitalized, always emphasized in speech as though capitalized. Use of this term often implies that in fact reasonable people may disagree. "What's the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a> for LISP to do when it sees (mod a 0)? Should it return a, or give a divide-by-0 error?"

        See also <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>, where a different definition of the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a> is made, namely the MIT/Stanford approach as opposed to the <a href="NewJersey.html">NewJersey</a> (C/UNIX) style pragmatism (called <a href="WorseIsBetter.html">WorseIsBetter</a>).  In this sense, trying to achieve the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a> is a sort of <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> or <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>, which should be avoided (<a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>).

        <em>The </em><a href="IncompatibleTimeSharingSystem.html">IncompatibleTimeSharingSystem</a>, whose PcLosering was the canonical <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a>
        in <a href="RichardGabriel.html">RichardGabriel</a>'s <a href="GoodNewsBadNewsHowToWinBig.html">GoodNewsBadNewsHowToWinBig</a>, isn't <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>
        by any stretch of the imagination.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Untrue. Adding PcLosering to Unix would have meant making guarantees about the behavior of every single system call without exception, including that any partial work previously accomplished would be seamlessly tracked by the kernel. And this, on a PDP-11 whose hardware couldn't even recover from an interrupt in the middle of a partially executed instruction!
      </p>
      <p>
        But hardware issues aside, still it <strong>is</strong> a big deal to make such guarantees for any and all current and future system calls. PcLosering is arguably the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a>, sure, but don't gloss over the difficulties.

        You can do something the quick and dirty way, or you can do the <a href="RightThing.html">RightThing</a> and do it properly.  Sounds like <a href="CantDoRightRightNow.html">CantDoRightRightNow</a>.

        Used by the advertising campaign in Australia that ran for about 10 years and changed people's attitudes towards rubbish - Australia is much cleaner than it used to be. The advertising slogan was <em>Do the Right Thing</em>, but without the jingle it loses something in the translation.
