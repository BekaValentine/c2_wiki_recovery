        Pulp Fiction
      </h1>
      <p>
        Genre of writing. "Pulp" was the lowest quality of paper and the cheapest. Low production costs meant frequent typo and rehash of other work. Derivitive. Popularist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Curiously both progressive as well as conservative in tone.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pulp magazines included all types of fiction: science fiction, horror, super-hero, AND crime genres. Doc Savage, Conan the Barbarian, and <a href="TheShadow.html">TheShadow</a> were pulp fiction success stories. <a href="AsimovsFoundation.html">AsimovsFoundation</a> novels were originally shorter stories in <em>Astounding Science Fiction</em> magazine.

        Modern day pulp adventure can be found in sources ranging from the Indiana Jones, Hellboy, and Sky Captain films to James Rollins's adventure novels (<a href="http://www.jamesrollins.com)">http://www.jamesrollins.com)</a> to works that are straight-out homage to the old pulps, such as the Doc Wilde stories written by Tim Byrd (<a href="http://www.DocWilde.com).">http://www.DocWilde.com).</a>
