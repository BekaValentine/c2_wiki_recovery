        Preferred Syntax
      </h1>
      <p>
        Informally, the <em>preferred syntax</em> of a language consist of those features which can be accessed by the programmer with a minimal amount of typing (compared to other features of the langage).  Other features may have non-preferred syntax (though be implemented by the language itself); still others may require an external implementation outside the language proper or its libraries.
