        European Data Protection Legislation
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="EuropeanUnion.html">EuropeanUnion</a> has a strict policy on who is allowed to access <em>personal</em> information.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you, as an individual or a company, process information about real people, you have to declare: what data you store and/or process; why you process it; who can access it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you let your developers use <em>live</em> data for software testing, you might have to justify this to the authorities.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the UK, the initial implementation of the legislation only covered computer based information storage and processing, but now it also covers paper-based (or anything-based) storage and processing.
