        Bad Smell
      </h1>
      <p>
        Something that smells fishy (in code).
      </p>
      <p>
        Where can a list of (common) BadSmells be found?
      </p>
      <p>
        I have since had more of a think about this and realise that such a list would be meaningless and impossibly long!
      </p>
      <p>
        Programmers are lazy by nature and will always take the path of "least resistance".  This invariably means they don't wash and that leads to nasty smells :).
      </p>
      <p>
        Something may have smelled <em>sweet</em> when it was first done and subsequently went off.  This just means refactor it.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am sure if this gets deleted, the page will resurface, because smelliness is used and like me people will want to know if there is a common list....

        Ahhh...   I thought I had seen it somewhere.  Thanks.
