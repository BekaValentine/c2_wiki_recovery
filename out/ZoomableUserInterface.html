        Zoomable User Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Two Questions</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What is Zoomable? 
          <ul>
            <li>
               It covers a lot of aspects: the acts of zooming, scalable graphics primitives (such as SVG), LevelOfDetail to keep CPU and network costs commensurate with screen real-estate. 
            </li>
            <li>
               In an 'ideal' ZUI, you'd be offered the illusion that all your files and hyperlinks are already open and you're just zooming in for a closer view. I.e. to view a video, you zoom in on the icon rather than double-clicking and opening an application. To enter a folder, you zoom into the folder rather than double-click and open a new window. 
            </li>
            <li>
               ZUI requires different UI concepts for navigation, bookmarking, layout. Even the 'applications' concept must change a lot if we're to offer illusion that all files/objects are open all the time - i.e. orthogonal persistence and mostly 'settling' into quiescence in the absence of observation (so we can scale to tens of thousands of 'open' apps). A document metaphor (<a href="DocumentDefinitions.html">DocumentDefinitions</a>) or shared-world metaphor (<a href="ObjectBrowser.html">ObjectBrowser</a>, <a href="OpenCroquet.html">OpenCroquet</a>) may be more appropriate than the applications metaphor we use today.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Is this one of the least-recently-used features? 
          <ul>
            <li>
               No, think more along lines of <a href="ProgressiveDisclosure.html">ProgressiveDisclosure</a>, except by continuous zooming.
            </li>

        A User Interface similar to a convention of hiding seldom-used functions until the user might need them, then "zooming" in on them by selecting the little "show more" arrow or by lingering with the mouse.

        <em>ZUIs are about being able to zoom into and out of graphic user interfaces by scaling the graphic elements. Jazz uses a </em><a href="SceneGraph.html">SceneGraph</a> to layout and group them. The graphic elements may choose to use completely different representations at different scaling levels (for example, when zoomed-in the whole document is shown, when zoomed-out only the headlines), similar to the LevelOfDetail device used in 3D systems.<em></em>
