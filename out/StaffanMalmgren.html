        I'm a software developer in <a href="StockholmSweden.html">StockholmSweden</a>. Drawn to Wiki by the wealth of XP information available here. Currently I work at Xcellenet's swedish office, which used to be known as Ehand, of which I was one of the founders. Previous to that, I worked at Spray and Razorfish Sweden (the remains of which are now known as Creuna). During this time, I maintained the punk rock web resource "The Swedish Punk/Hardcore archive", of which only a few stale links remain.

        I occasionally write columns for IDG.se. For more information about me, my interests and ongoing projects, my blog at <a href="http://blog.tomtebo.org/">http://blog.tomtebo.org/</a> provides more information. Eventually.
