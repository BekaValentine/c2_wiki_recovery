        Meeting Report 10 December 1998
      </p>
      <p>
        Three persons were present to the meeting of "Montreal Pattern User Group".
      </p>
      <p>
        The persons were:
        Regis Brochu                    regis.brochu@pwc.utc.com
        Jack Azoulay                    jack_a@iname.com

      </p>
      <p>
        The purpose of this meeting was to study some of the "Creational Patterns" from GoF book.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          / Singleton (GoF-127)
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We discussed mainly about the Singleton (GOF-127) pattern and found some questions and answers.
        The purpose of this pattern is to furnish a way to insure that a single instance of a class will be created. Here are some relevant issues discussed during the meeting:
      </p>
      <p>
        a/ How to destroy the singleton?
        The singleton destruction isn't study in the GoF book.
      </p>
      <p>
        b/ How to take care of multithreading?
        The multithreading aspects shall be considered due to possible concurrent accesses on Instance method of the singleton class.
      </p>
      <p>
        c/ How to suppress the switch statement in the sample p133?
        I think we should take few minutes on the next meeting to answer to this question?
      </p>
      <p>
        Next Meeting (01-13-99)
