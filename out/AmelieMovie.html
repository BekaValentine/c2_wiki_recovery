        She's a <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> sort of gal - notice that she seems to put forth a lot of complicated <a href="RubeGoldberg.html">RubeGoldberg</a> plans into action with no contingency plans. But this is one of those movies where serendipity happens a lot.

      <p>
        Perfect date movie.
