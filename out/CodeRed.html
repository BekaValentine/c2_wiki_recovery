        <a href="JohnFarrell.html">JohnFarrell</a> says that in "A Few Good Men" (<a href="http://us.imdb.com/Title?0104257),">http://us.imdb.com/Title?0104257),</a> when one of the marines broke the <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a> build, the CO orders that he be tied to the bed and beaten to death.  I feel appropriately intimidated. -- <a href="MartinPool.html">MartinPool</a>

        Strictly speaking, the orders were just to beat him senseless.  The marine's death was accidental.  Of course, any time two large marines are beating a helpless man, accidents tend to happen.
