        Tagless Garbage Collection
      </h1>
      <p>
        One key issue with <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> is identification of the <em>root set</em>--the set of objects which make the roots (sources) of the object dependency graph.  In general, the root set consists of all references located in <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a> (or stacks, or wherever <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s are stored), cached in registers, and in the static object area (static objects have unlimited extent), which are <em>live</em> (will have an effect on the future computation of the program).  Any object reachable from the root set is (possibly) live, and is not reclaimed by the collector.  Any object <em>not</em> reachable from the root set is garbage and may be reclaimed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that there likely will be objects which are reachable by the root set, but not live (and thus could be reclaimed by the collector); this is called SemanticGarbage.  Determining the SemanticGarbage in a program is in general undecidable; thus reachability is used as an approximation.  (Determining what is reachable from the root set is simple graph traversal; and all live objects are reachable.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Several strategies for determining the root set:  One is to treat all suitably-aligned objects in <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a>, etc., as a potential live reference; this is commonly known as ConservativeGarbageCollection.  Languages with unsafe typing such as C/C++ are limited to this sort of collection--obviously, this will cause many "false alarms" as ints on the stack are treated like potential pointers.  In languages which make a clearer distinction between references and non-references, it is possible to exclude ints.  
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to do this is to maintain (in the <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>) a <em>tag map</em>--essentially a vector or bits indicating whether or not a given item in <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a> is a reference or not.  These bits are typically set/cleared at runtime--if a pointer is loaded onto <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a>, the corresponding tag bit is set; if a pointer goes out of scope or is replaced with an int, the bit can be cleared.  This adds quite a bit of runtime overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
        A better way is <em>tagless</em> <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>--wherein the compiler knows what elements of a given stack frame are pointers and what aren't, and can free the runtime code from having to deal with keeping track of this.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Separate from the issue of whether tags are used or not, is the issue of <em>liveness</em>.  Knowing what is a pointer and what isn't is a significant improvement, but we can still do better.  At any given time, some of the pointers in a stack frame might be <em>dead</em>--unable to contribute to the program any further.  For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        {<br/>
        Foo s = new Foo(1);<br/>
        s.do_bar();<br/>
        this.my_s_ = s;<br/>
        // hundreds of lines of computation that don't involve s anymore<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        After the statement <em>this.my_s_ = s;</em> the pointer <em>s</em> is dead.  It has no effect on the computation.  (Note that the object pointed to by <em>s</em> is not necessarily garbage; it is referenced by the <em>my_s_</em> attribute of the enclosing object).  The garbage collector can--in theory--safely ignore <em>s</em> when determining the root set, if it is invoked after <em>s</em> becomes dead.  By doing so, the garbage collector can become both faster (fewer vertices in the dependency graph to traverse) and more efficient (less likelihood that examining the dependencies of a dead reference will keep SemanticGarbage from being collected). 
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in most languages (those that don't do explicit <a href="PointerKilling.html">PointerKilling</a>), the pointer <em>s</em> will continue to be considered "active" (and part of the RootSet) until the enclosing block goes out of scope.  If the block does extensive computation (calls a ray-tracer, say, or streams in an MPEG off the net--not returning until these operations complete)--the object pointed to by <em>s</em> may remain live until long after it becomes SemanticGarbage.
      </p>

        Benjamin Goldberg was doing research on tagless garbage collection with programming languages with <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> (using <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a>) when he discovered a rather interesting thing:  <em>If in a language with certain properties, you can use compile-time analysis to recreate the types of </em>'most<strong> references on the stack.  Those references which you cannot determine the types for via this analysis are </strong>SemanticGarbage--they need not be handled by the garbage collector.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A cool discovery, if you ask me.
