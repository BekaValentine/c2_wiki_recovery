        Wiki Watering
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiWatering.html">WikiWatering</a> is deliberately selecting what you believe are pertinent topics for the community and creating branches (<a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s) primarily for the sake for showing the community (or nurturing) all the possibilities of wiki.  <a href="WikiWatering.html">WikiWatering</a> helps people see the power of a wiki, and thereby helps the wiki grow. Not being able to envision the variety of ways a wiki can be used seems to be one of primary reasons <a href="WhyDontOthersGetWiki.html">WhyDontOthersGetWiki</a>.

        Although I prefer WikisInTheWild (a collective free flowing consciousness), like this one, I find that in the early stages wikis need some "gardening".  Like plants, it's important that you have fertile soil. I liken fertile soil to a community that is willing to share and communicate (few wikis can grow in barren soil).  This wiki thrives because it's a community of developers... and we can be a noisy bunch. ;-)

      <p>
        I generally use the following steps:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <strong>Till the soil</strong> by expressing the need for communication, such as: the need for a forum to discuss pertinent issues; the need for "persisting thoughts", so that we don't lose information in this brief random conversations we have with one another; the need to a complete perspective on ideas and issues; etc.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <strong>Plant the wiki</strong> A brief orientation to wikis and how they work.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <strong>Water the wiki</strong> Sprinkle it with some pertinent topics. It helps if you talk with others first to get some ideas and encourage them to wikify a topic.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Hmmm...this section could possibly be refactored to "starting a wiki" or something.

        We have two wikis at work, one for managers and one for developers (one wiki for both might work; <a href="YourMileageMayVary.html">YourMileageMayVary</a>).  I "water" it with the following topics, respectively:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Managers' wiki</strong> - Focused on coherency and unified vision.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The organization's TopTenRisksList - Works well for addressing, prioritizing, and mitigating critical areas.
        </li>
        <li>
          The Training initiatives - Provides everyone with the complete perspective of the skills needed.
        </li>
        <li>
          Management techniques - There are certain "rules of thumb" which are not usually written anywhere but are essential to managing the organization.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Developers' wiki</strong> - Focused on technical growth and sharing.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Emerging software techniques - a knowledge base for software technologies (XP, RUP, OO techniques, etc).
        </li>
        <li>
          Software Tools' bugs and gotchas' - we need to share this kind of info.
        </li>
        <li>
          Brownbag lunch presentations - Informal technical talks and presentation at lunch.
        </li>
        <li>
          TechnicalDebtList for software builds, etc. 
        </li>
        <li>
          BookReferences and recommendations - Encourages learning and sharing of view. Save people money too!	  
        </li>
        <li>
          Book reviews - good for interactive reviews.
        </li>
        <li>
          Requirements gathering/analysis - Although we don't currently use the wiki for this, I think Wikis offer a great end-user interaction tool for requirements and use cases.  Doesn't require a CASE tool.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>When you say that you "water" it, do you mean that you go in and make changes on a fairly regular basis? How do you encourage others to read it, and write into it?</em>
