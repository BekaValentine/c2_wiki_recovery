        Portland Access User Group
      </h1>
      <p>
        A group for users of Microsoft Access.  They have 4 member meetings per month, General, Fundamentals, Intermediate (VBA), and Advanced.  Unlike many other software user groups, they actually talk mostly about the product during the meetings rather than have presentations by vendors of vaguely related products.
