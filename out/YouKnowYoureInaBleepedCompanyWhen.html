        <em></em><a href="WarningSignsOfCorporateDoom.html">WarningSignsOfCorporateDoom</a> covers downturn-related scenarios. This topic is more about all-around bad, not just (identified) Titanics in the making. Amazingly, bleeped-up organizations can survive in stasis for long periods due to the likes of monopoly power, evil patents, brand-name stickiness, pork laws, etc. The "corporate doom" topic pertains to signs management <em>knows</em> the ship is taking on water quickly. If you (or fellow peons) seem like the only ones concerned about the icebergs in sight, then this is the topic.<em></em>

           To "deal with" morale problems, they have a required "Achievement and Leadership Training" course that gave multiple anecdotes and films/videos of people without arms, legs, eyesight etc. who achieve great things despite difficult circumstances. The message: "If Helen Keller can achieve without having eyes and ears, then YOU can also be productive despite having ahole managers like us." So, crappy management is equivalent to having your arms and legs chopped off, eh? Fucking True Story (the course, not necessarily my interpretation of their message.) My coworkers and I just kept looking at each other with a WTF expression.

               <em>That's probably a ploy to lay off older people and replace them with younger workers who expect less pay and can work 60 hour weeks because they don't yet have a family, and don't scrutinize flashy fads that the executives think they want.</em>

           People spend way too much time making pretty presentations and reports for higher-ups. Debates among lower managers over wording and layout last for hours as the "grunts" re-work presentations a 12th time, staying late to do it.

           You fill out a standard form to give a customer a small discount.  The form is one that is almost never used, you're only filling it out because someone else is away, and you'll probably never fill out one again.  In completing the form, you intentionally leave out a number that is clearly both optional and unrelated to the discount.  Several hours after you submit the form, you receive a lengthy email from an executive explaining how and why the number must <strong>always</strong> be filled in, and the form is returned to you for "correction".  The email must have taken hours to write and the customer's discount is delayed by at least a day, when the executive <em>could</em> simply have filled in the number and approved the form.  That would have taken about ten seconds.

           The Security Dept. mandates that you must use product X for task A. Product Y can do A and is 1/10th the cost of X, but it's not on the approved security list. The problem is that there is no budget for X yet A must get done. Therefore, nothing gets done and/or you wing-it with a self-rolled POS that's probably a bigger security risk than Y.

           When told we were going to an online time-keeping system, we were initially glad to see the paper approach go away. However, because they can't get their act together, now we do <em>both</em> the paper version and the online version. Worse, one is on a weekly cycle, the other on a bi-monthly cycle. And you have to clear all your cookies and history from the browser each time to get the online one to work. Rumor has it the wife of the software selector has connections to the online time-sheet company, which is why it was selected for reasons other than merit.

           The background-check questionnaire asks, "Have you ever had sex with animals or office equipment?" (Some past actual event(s) must have given birth to such questions.
