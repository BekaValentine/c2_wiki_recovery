        Static Cling
      </h1>
      <p>
        The object of the game is to invent a "problem" that does not exist, market a "solution" which is absolutely free to make, and achieve infinite profit. If a product costs nothing to produce, and everyone buys it, your return over cost is a positive number divided by zero, which is infinity.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are the rules:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The problem must be totally imaginary. Curing cancer, feeding the poor, or getting public pay phones to accept incoming calls again don't qualify.
        </li>
        <li>
           The solution must be marketable, preferably to that category of the public not trained in critical thinking.
        </li>
        <li>
           The solution must be as imaginary as the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
           The solution must be as easy as printing a label on a box claiming the box contains the solution to the problem.
        </li>
        <li>
           Being imaginary, there is no way to tell if the problem has been solved, so marketing must lead users to filter the results on behalf of the solution.
        </li>
        <li>
           Extra points if you can patent the solution, so other vultures can't share your carrion.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The game is over when infinite profit is achieved, or the public wises up. Don't hold your breath. --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>

        Sorry, but static cling is not imaginary, where did that idea come from anyway?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Running your dryer too long causes static cling! Take the clothes out slightly damp - problem solved!</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Static can make clothes cling.  The idea that this is a problem is imaginary.  Who cares if your clothes cling?  Why waste money stopping them?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a problem because it makes clothes very uncomfortable to wear, and applies equally to men and women.  Newer fabricated materials like polyester have problems with static, and it's well worth the price of dryer sheets to get rid of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        [I used to have a shirt that was prone to this, and it was uncomfortable; reach to get something, and the shirt resettled in an odd twisted position and then stuck that way like glue. But in any case, the market niche is primarily women, with whom static cling can be more than annoying -- e.g. a skirt that sticks immodestly high on the body, or similarly with a slip, causing weird bulges, etc etc. Everyone raise your hand if you're an expert on the problems women have with clothes and what's the best way to solve them...what? Only men were bitching that the problem is imaginary? Huh.]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How did women survive for thousands of years their skirts stuck immodetly high on their bodies?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Materials susceptable to static cling (polyester, nylon--see below) are recent inventions.  At any rate, <a href="StaticCling.html">StaticCling</a> is only an issue in those societies where basic survival is largely taken for granted; women 200 years ago (let alone thousands) and women in poor countries frequently have more important things to worry about than fashion.  (It could be argued that even in the West, people have more important things to worry about than fashion issues; but that's another matter altogether).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="StaticCling.html">StaticCling</a> is caused by running your dryer after clothes are dry. Tune your hygrometer correctly and the problem goes away. You save money, and reduce societal pressures causing the OilWar.

        [Perhaps "split ends" is a better analogy. People probably never noticed them until they were advertised as a "big" problem. It became a self-fulfilling problem.]

        A few years back, Pacific Bell (and possibly other phone companies) tried to convince consumers that answering machines were horribly unreliable, and should be discarded in favor of a $7/month voicemail service. (Which proved to be rather unreliable.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Voicemail does have some advantages; mainly that you can use it simultaneously with your phone, and it works if you leave the phone off the hook.  Whether that is worth $7/month is debatable.

        The beer company Keystone has been running this "bitter beer face" campaign for the past few years. It shows a drinker enjoying a beer when all of a sudden, the dreaded <em>bitter beer face</em> strikes and the guy's face shrivels up violently. The solution? Drink Keystone! It's smooooth. And probably flavorless.

        Have you seen these Visa card commercials? A person goes into a shop and tries to buy something with a check. Clerk either asks for ID, which the shopper doesn't have/can't produce, or makes ridiculous demands for other documentation. The message: Checks are such a hassle! Use your Visa check card!

        Who carries a checkbook and no identification?? Also, stores don't always require ID for a check, and they 
        never require birth certificates, oaths or affirmations.

        Today it's tooth-whitening products.  You've all seen the commercial.  Girl smiles at guy.  Guy smiles with DARK YELLOW TEETH.  "This is what you might as well look like if you don't use our extra-brightening toothpaste."  For the product to be extra-effective, the marketing should play in your head whenever you talk to a member of the opposite sex, and make you think you can never attract a mate until you buy the product.  Ironically, at least two sitcoms have used "stupid tooth whitening product makes your teeth TOO WHITE!" as a major plot point.  See BreathAzure.

        The audiophile and home computer markets have produced dozens of these ... here are some of my personal favorites:
      </p>

           Monster Cable: Get "Time Correct Technology", a "Magnetic Flux Tube", and "Microfibers" for YOUR audio system.

           Oxygen-Free Copper: Oooooh, watch out for the dreaded oxygen in your copper. Right.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>For the record, this one isn't entirely gibberish. The oxygen content in copper makes a </em>'huge<em>' difference in conductivity... up to a 5-10% difference between 'normal' copper and deoxygenated copper. Of course, if that copper is being used to carry digital signals, it makes not one whit of difference; but if it's for analog, I wouldn't be surprised to find a real distinction. (For the record, I'm not an audiophile, so i'm not sure how well this applies to audio equipment; my experience with deoxygenated copper was in a physics lab setting, where the difference made or broke the experiment.</em>

           CD STOP LIGHT, CD Backlight, etc: Cover the edge of your cd's with special patented green ink, applied with a special patented green ink marker. Also paint the inner circle. Here's a testimonial: "The sound? There's less harsh treble, more smooth sound, more open sound, more dynamics, more contrast, better tonation - al in al a great way to improve on the poor sound quality offered from CD-players in general. But there's a limit to the improvements - it is not enough to get optimum sound quality (Would also be too good to be true!). Thus an overall rating of 4*." Oh boy. I wonder if it works on DVD's too?

Inspection showed that most of the diodes in the surge protector had burned up, but after diode replacement the modem worked perfectly.  Surge protectors can work.  On another note, there is usually a huge difference in ability between the $7 one and the $100 one, although that's not guaranteed by the price difference.  -- </em><a href="PeterHansen.html">PeterHansen</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The heavier the load a surge protector can take and the faster it responds to a surge the better it is.  Some also include a line conditioner to help take out the extra noise and jacks to protect your modem.  It's fairly true: the el cheapo surge protectors aren't worth the money.  Find a better one and the money should be worth it --but if you can, get a UPS.

        Hmm, let's see now. None of my clothes exhibit static cling, but that's because they are all made from leather, cotton, linen or wool, and they are all always hung out to dry naturally. Plus, I never actually wash the leathers, just rub the road grime off them from time to time. Not only do I not use any anti-static type laundry products, I don't even use specialist laundry detergents (don't like those optical brighteners, or the sickly fragrance, or the phosphates, or...) just industrial liquid soap. Works a treat. So I'd be a sucker to buy any cling-be-gone stuff, certainly.
      </p>
      <p>
        But didn't these anti-static products first appear back when it was the latest thing to have all your clothes made out of nylon, polyester etc and to dry them in a tumble-drier? And if one were in the position of doing a large family's laundry week in, week out, wouldn't a product that made each laundry episode just a little easier soon be worth just a little bit of money? Just a thought.

        Ironing water.  Just go door-to-door with some <em>special</em> water (tap water with food coloring in it) made specifically for steam irons.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          The problem with tap water is that the minerals in the water build up rusty deposits inside the iron. Then the next time you use the steam function on your iron it spews all this gunk on your shirt and makes your slacks look like they got poo stains. Although tap water with food coloring is a very brilliant idea, it would make the residual gunk even more colorful.
          <ul>
            <li>
              That's why we always use distilled water in our clothes irons and automobile batteries.

        "Body odour" was created by marketing geeks in the 1960s. For those people who still believe in it, and regularly smear pore-blocking potions under their arms, you need to know that being clean is an entirely acceptable substitute.

        Who needs a problem? Arbitrarily want to double sales of shampoo? Add the word "repeat" to the instructions on the label.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>This is simply wrong, and dealt with in </em><a href="LatherRinseRepeat.html">LatherRinseRepeat</a>, but more than one person simply seems not to get the point. It is elementary physical chemistry. Shampoo (and detergents in general) interact with oils in a dynamic equilibrium. For a given amount of detergent, some oil will combine with it and some will remain free. Over any given time span some of the combined oil-detergent mix will separate, and some free oil will combine with detergent. The balance remains fairly constant unless you drive the equilibrium. You can only drive the equilibrium by removing some of the oil-detergent combination, and the best way to do this is to rinse off the existing detergent-oil combination and put in more clean detergent. The "Repeat" part is good advice. You should use half the shampoo each time. It's not a ploy to make you use more.<em></em>

        Here's a good one I like - "freshness" labels on cans of beer. I think it was Coors who did this one. Amusingly they started the campaign right after I finished a marketing course. Create a problem, then solve it. Genius.

      <p>
        <em>Actually fresh beer really is better -- like bread it can go stale.  Of course, whether or not a watery macrobrew like Coors (or Budwieser -- pushing the "Born On" date) tastes any worse stale is another matter.</em>

        Anheuser-Busch started that one.  And it does make a difference.
        Maybe not as much of a difference on your third can of beer at a party.  ;->
        Maybe not as much of a difference when downing a cold one while mowing the lawn.
        But it does make a difference.
