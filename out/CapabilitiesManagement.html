        delete - I have flown off half cocked, mea culpa, mea maxima culpa. I trust the stewards' judgement in this case completely and implicitly, and I humbly remove all objection to their edits here. I  have deep misgivings about our practice of stewardship in general, its mechanism and guidelines. But those misgivings are not specific to the circumstances or stewards involved in this case and it was careless and poorly thought out for me to use this as a springboard for voicing these concerns on wiki. --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
