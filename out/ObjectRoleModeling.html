        Object Role Modeling
      </h1>
      <p>
        The designer of a database builds a formal model of the application area or <a href="UniverseOfDiscourse.html">UniverseOfDiscourse</a>. The model requires a good understanding of the <a href="UniverseOfDiscourse.html">UniverseOfDiscourse</a> and a means of specifying this understanding in a clear, unambiguous way. <a href="ObjectRoleModeling.html">ObjectRoleModeling</a> simplifies the design process by using Unnatural language(such as deontic and alethic), as well as intuitive diagrams which can be populated with examples, and by examining the information in terms of simple or elementary facts. By expressing the model in terms of natural concepts, like objects and roles, it provides a conceptual approach to modeling. Its attribute-free approach promotes semantic stability.

        ORM's rich graphic notation is capable of capturing many business rules that are typically unsupported as graphic primitives in other popular data modeling notations.

        First, please do <strong>not</strong> confuse <a href="ObjectRoleModeling.html">ObjectRoleModeling</a> with <a href="ObjectRelationalMapping.html">ObjectRelationalMapping</a> ;-). <a href="ObjectRoleModeling.html">ObjectRoleModeling</a> is designed to work with RelationaDatabases, not ObjectRelationalMappers or ObjectDatabases, <a href="ObjectRoleModeling.html">ObjectRoleModeling</a> is (IMHO) about finding the best schema to store facts (See <a href="DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts.html">DatabaseIsRepresenterOfFacts</a>).

        Now the real subject:
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyone here has tried modeling their databases using this? (<em>I did a few years ago with mixed results, it was my first system in my first job, so I think many of my problems were due to my inexperience, but back then I thought that this was going to be the modeling standard of the future, so now, I am surprised that is has not been widely adopted</em>) I think it could be a better match for TrueRelationalModeling than the typical <a href="EntityRelationshipModeling.html">EntityRelationshipModeling</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I also wonder if anyone here has compared <a href="ObjectRoleModeling.html">ObjectRoleModeling</a> <a href="ConceptualQueries.html">ConceptualQueries</a> with <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a>.
