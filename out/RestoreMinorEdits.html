        Restore Minor Edits
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s function would be worth restoring. The bytecount feature of <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> is useful but doesn't always do exactly what some people want (witness discussion in January-March 2006 on <a href="TooMinorEditsConsideredHarmful.html">TooMinorEditsConsideredHarmful</a>, <a href="EmDashInAscii.html">EmDashInAscii</a>). <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> could continue to show all edits, as at present, but could gain a URL parameter for not showing minor edits, and the original <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> could function as it used to, along with <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do other people think?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I never use </em><a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>. It doesn't tell me what I'm interested to know. Until yesterday, I hadn't looked at <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> in several months. Looking at <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a> didn't even <em>occur</em> to me until yesterday. I only use conventional <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. I would appreciate the restoration of <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s if we get a <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a> page. MinorEdits would be useless to me if it were only a feature of new-style recent changes. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree with Eliz about <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>, but I think there's a remaining issue about <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s: the problem with Anon was that although he arguably provides a service by obsessing about editing punctuation (I don't agree with all of his tastes, thus "arguably"), he was obscuring conversations by leaping in and doing his obsessive edits right between two people who were trying to discuss something, which made the diff against the previous version useless, and thus obstructed conversation.
      </p>
      <p>
        If we brought back <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s, so that Anon could go wild without cluttering <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, we would still have <strong>that</strong> problem, which would then be solved only if the normal diff were applied only between major edits, not between minor edits - something that I sort of doubt Ward sees as interesting to support, although it <strong>would</strong> help solve this particular kind of problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        As a reminder, <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s went away because it was being abused to hide major edits during <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a>; that particular Achilles Heel remains even with my suggestion. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, there are now committed stewards with powers to deal with abuse; they should be keeping an eye on <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s. The possibility of abuse is why I suggested leaving <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>' functionality unmodified.
