        I like to create software that people use, ideally software that people love to use.

        I'm not longer at Macromedia.  In a couple of weeks, I'll be starting at <a href="LaszloSystems.html">LaszloSystems</a>.  In the meantime I am experimenting with wikis and other internet tech on <a href="http://www.ultrasaurus.com">http://www.ultrasaurus.com</a> -- the wikis aren't linked yet because they are *very* experimental and only one will stay.

        I would appreciate feedback on the wiki thoughts below by anyone, especially experienced wiki people who might be reading this.

        New to wiki. I really just wanted to set up a FAQ, and wiki was suggested as a format. It took me minutes to install <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a>, but it is taking me much longer to understand wiki culture and how it could be (should be?) applied.

      <p>
        Wiki Technical info (kept here as I learn about wiki)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the perl wikis seem to be very responsive, PHP and some other languages seem slow
        </li>
        <li>
           I like the <a href="ChiqChaq.html">ChiqChaq</a> look-and-feel (I must admit to a preference for interCaps, but the international issue is real, not that I expect to be writing in Hebrew or Japanese)
        </li>
        <li>
           a wiki FAQ by TyberiusPrime <a href="http://faq.ozoneasylum.com">http://faq.ozoneasylum.com</a> (custom wiki engine)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Wiki Culture info
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           not half as important as the software you'll finally use is the community, and one, two or more people with a dedication -- TyberiusPrime <em>This is a subtle point about open source software that I hadn;t thought about: if I find like-minded people, then the software will likely evolve where I want it to go.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiUserInterface.html">WikiUserInterface</a> is confusing for the newbie, but I like the powerful concepts behind collaborative site design, really perfect for a FAQ, but a FAQ must also be very easy to use
        </li>
        <li>
           To start or note start my own wiki.  From <a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a>, "The discussion here is focused on <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in software development, and is an <a href="InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas.html">InformalHistoryOfProgrammingIdeas</a>." However, 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        different wikis have different purposes, and such rules wouldn't normally be enforced on home pages. Since I have a pretty focused target community, it makes sense to start my own wiki.  But I think a discussion of <a href="WikiPatterns.html">WikiPatterns</a> or WikiEnginePatterns would be appropriate for this site.

        I worked with <a href="HarryChesley.html">HarryChesley</a> on <a href="ShockWave.html">ShockWave</a>. I was delighted to find his home page and left him a note, only to discover through later reading that someone else created it for him, so I've moved my note here for now.
