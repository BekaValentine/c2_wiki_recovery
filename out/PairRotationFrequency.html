        <em>Rotate pairs frequently. Some teams report good results obeying a timer that tells them to shift partner every sixty minutes (every thirty minutes when solving difficult problems). I don't think I'd like this but haven't tried it. I like to program with someone new every couple of hours, switching at natural breaks in the development</em>

        What are the pros and cons of frequent and infrequent rotation? In what contexts is hourly/daily/weekly rotation advised?

        I'm about to use XP on a project developing numerical analysis software. Some of the algorithms are quite involved. The programmers generally understand the algorithms/mathematics but some aren't very experienced programmers. What frequency of rotation is advised? I was thinking of daily.
