        Test Driven Development Challenges
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is a page for listing tasks that are or appear to be difficult to accomplish in <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>.

      <ul>
        <li>
           AutomatedInstallationTesting.  I'm considering embarking on an endeavor to produce a <a href="ShrinkWrapped.html">ShrinkWrapped</a> Java application.  Since one of my biggest fears is smooth installation in a wide variety of environments, I want to work on that story early and do it <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a>.  To do that, though, I believe I need to automate GUI interactions in a <a href="VirtualComputer.html">VirtualComputer</a>.  So far, the only way I can see to do that is to buy a combination of software from IbmRational and <a href="VmWare.html">VmWare</a> totalling about $3,500.
        </li>

        The cost of your unit test fixtures aren't really a part of test driven development.

        Whether you use TDD or not won't change how much it will cost you to have test environments <em>(I didn't mean to imply that I thought it would)</em>. If you decide to do your installation testing after all the code is done, test environments will still cost the same. <em>Or potentially cost even more since having test tools early on may help us to build a more testable installer, where as selecting the tools after the fact may require us to buy more tools or more expensive tools</em>

        Anyway, if there's an equivalent to java.awt.Robot for Swing (or whatever Java gui toolkit your installer uses) then you only need a few spare PCs and a copy of the target OS on each PC.

        That might be a starting point, but it would take some more thinking to get that to the point of a point-and-click test suite.  Somehow, before each test on each system, it must be set back to a known pre-installation state, including JRE version, etc.  What if I use the standard <a href="VmWare.html">VmWare</a> or VirtualPc (which can run a session without saving it), and have each session load a program on startup that sets up an IP link to the test harness already running...?
