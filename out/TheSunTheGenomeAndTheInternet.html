        <a href="FreemanDyson.html">FreemanDyson</a> describes three technologies that he sees as having a large effect on the future of humanity:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cheap solar energy
        </li>
        <li>
           Advanced bio-engineering
        </li>
        <li>
           Pervasive Internet access
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As usual, Dyson's concerns for social justice play a prominent role in the book. He views technology as a means to better distribute the spoils of our effort across the globe. Thus, he sees cheap solar energy as a great way to provide energy to the millions of villages that don't have electricity, bio-engineering as a way to increase food and fuel yields to provide for them, and the Internet as a great disseminator of information. He's equally concerned about a Gattaca-style dystopia where biotech leads to a caste system of superior bio-engineered humans on top and legions of normal proles on the bottom.
