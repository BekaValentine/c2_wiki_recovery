        Editing Pie Menus
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PieMenus.html">PieMenus</a> rely, once you have grown accustomed to them, on your <a href="MuscleMemory.html">MuscleMemory</a>. You perform an action often enough that you can do it without thinking.
      </p>
      <p>
        How about and example of this starting to go too far? The <a href="OperaBrowser.html">OperaBrowser</a> can use <a href="GestureRecognition.html">GestureRecognition</a> for closing a window:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           drag the right mouse button
        </li>
        <li>
           move right
        </li>
        <li>
           move left
        </li>
        <li>
           move right
        </li>
        <li>
           let go
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        It resembles shaking one's head. Sometimes I do this to the <a href="MozillaBrowser.html">MozillaBrowser</a>, and of course it doesn't work (<em>it will work once you install </em><a href="http://optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures/'').">http://optimoz.mozdev.org/gestures/'').</a> The point is that my brain has issued the command and my hand has carried it out, and this is fast and efficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except when it doesn't work.

        So, I imagine that changing the entries on <a href="PieMenus.html">PieMenus</a> will cause huge confusion. Changing the sort order of the entries or inserting/removing entries would be the worst, since every item in the menu will have a new position.
      </p>
      <p>
        Changing the meaning of one position will only affect that command or sub-menu.

        <strong>Efficiency</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm reminded of the <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a> algorithm. It's a binary tree (<a href="PieMenus.html">PieMenus</a> seem to have four to eight entries per node?), but the main point is the one attempts to keep all legs of the tree to similar sizes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, more important would be to keep related operations together, and most frequently used operations near the top of the tree. This departs from the <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a> since most leaf nodes will be N levels down.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is, your <a href="RedBlackTree.html">RedBlackTree</a> can be shuffled if necessary, and it will still work just as efficiently. <a href="MuscleMemory.html">MuscleMemory</a> requires a training period to reach maximum efficiency.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I wonder how long it takes to </em>TrainMuscleMemory, and what software can do to accelerate this without forcing the user to practise? -- <a href="DigressingOne.html">DigressingOne</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DebianGnuLinux.html">DebianGnuLinux</a> has some tools for generating menu structures, and I believe these have an assortment of heuristics which can be used for balancing up the tree sizes. <a href="http://packages.debian.org/menu">http://packages.debian.org/menu</a> -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>

        <strong>Solutions</strong>

        (ha)
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, it sounds like <a href="PieMenus.html">PieMenus</a> need to be <a href="ConfigurableUserInterfaces.html">ConfigurableUserInterfaces</a>, with all the complications this entails and the usability problems that PerpetualBeginners have with reconfiguring their software.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           menus restricted to a closed set of operations (eg. physical directions, add/remove) seem to work well
          <ul>
            <li>
               I offer the digression of non-quantized directions ... but I'm not sure where I'm going with this yet
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           menus with operations which are <a href="SetInStone.html">SetInStone</a> when the menu is created
        </li>
        <li>
           a "future expansion" sub-menu position (this is a kludge, and smells of NotDesignedRightFirstTime)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A simple alternative is making some items twice as wide as normal, and shrinking those items to accommodate more.
