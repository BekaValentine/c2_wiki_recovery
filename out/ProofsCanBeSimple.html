        Proofs Can Be Simple
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Can we see an example of a simple piece of code, accompanied by a simple proof?</em> I think this discussion would be much more fruitful and illuminating if there was a concrete example that went with it.

        People seem to think that a proof needs to be a mechanically verifiable step-by-step crawl from the obvious to the conclusion. Proofs in mathematics are rarely that, and I don't see where this attitude comes from.

        How do you show that <strong>sqrt(2)</strong> is irrational? You don't use <a href="PeanoArithmetic.html">PeanoArithmetic</a>, nor do you go back to <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a>. You use your understanding of what it really means.
      </p>

           The Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic says that any positive number can be written uniquely (up to ordering) as the product of primes. This is called the prime decomposition.
        </li>
        <li>
           A prime can be defined as a number <strong>p</strong> such that if <strong>p</strong> divides <strong>a*b</strong> then either <strong>p</strong> divides <strong>a</strong> or <strong>p</strong> divides <strong>b</strong> (or both).
          <ul>
            <li>
               This follows from the usual definition and the fundamental theorem as quoted above.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Suppose that <strong>sqrt(2)=a/b</strong>, so that <strong>2*b*b</strong> = <strong>a*a</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Substitute the prime decompositions of <strong>a</strong> and <strong>b</strong> into that equation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Observe that <strong>2</strong> occurs an odd number of times on the left, and an even number of times on the right.
        </li>
        <li>
           This is impossible, therefore it is impossible to write <strong>sqrt(2)</strong> as <strong>a/b</strong>.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This may not be your field of expertise, but that proof is clear, complete and correct. Similar proofs can be given for elementary facts about programs, and given that that probably <em>is</em> your field of expertise, such proofs can similarly be clear, complete and convincing.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem, as I see it, comes down to:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           People don't know what constitutes a proof and get embroiled in philosophical argument instead of simply doing it.
        </li>
        <li>
           People have been drilled to believe that proofs are useless in computing
        </li>
        <li>
           Thinking is hard, and proofs require that you think about your code
        </li>
        <li>
           Simple code is easier to prove things about than complex code, and people seem to delight in complex code
        </li>
        <li>
           Proofs are best when developed with the code, not afterwards
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        OK, the above will now no doubt be torn to shreds by people who have never succeeded in proving things about code. I'll go away and continue to prove things about my code and deliver on time and to budget using a mixture of techniques including, but not limited to, <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> and SimpleProofsOfCorrectness. If you deny yourselves a tool that improves code quality then I just don't understand.

        I would estimate that 90% or more programmers would not be able to come up with the above proof (though a computer scientist would probably have an easier time). Proofs are much easier to read than to write.

        Tell me and I forget, involve me and I learn. Here's some incorrect code to do a binary search. The array is indexed from 1, not from 0, and the code should return the first occurrence of the key.
      </p>
      <code>
        int find( Object Array[], int n, Object Key,<br/>
        int (*cmp)(Object *, Object *),<br/>
        int notFound<br/>
        ) {<br/>
        int low=1, high=n+1, mid;<br/>
        while (low < high) {<br/>
        mid=(low+high)/2;<br/>
        if (cmp(&Array[mid],&Key) < 0) high = mid;<br/>
        else                           low = mid;<br/>
        }<br/>
        if (cmp(&Array[mid],&Key) == 0) return low;<br/>
        else                            return notFound;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        What should you prove about it? How can you do so? Perhaps your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s can find something wrong with it, but do they find everything?
      </p>
      <p>
        The remainder of the previous discussion was moved to the bottom of this page.  It's irrelevant to the questions asked.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I would do is work inside out, since more often than not, the interior of a construct tends to be more primitive.  In this case, it is:
      </p>
      <code>
        mid=(low+high)/2;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        which can be proven trivially, and,
      </p>
      <code>
        if(cmp(&Array[mid],&key) < 0) high = mid;<br/>
        else                          low = mid;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This is the crucial factor.  Given an array Array[] in ascending, pre-sorted order, and a function cmp(a,b) = -1 iff a < b, 0 iff a = b, and 1 otherwise, then immediately I can see a bug.  If the first element compared is less than the search key, we need to be resetting <strong>low</strong>, not <strong>high</strong>, as we know the key <em>must</em> reside at least in the upper half of the data set.
      </p>
      <p>
        To ensure confidence, we can factor this comparison out into a function,
      </p>
      <code>
        void check(int Array[], Object key, int mid, int *high, int *low) {<br/>
        if(cmp(&Array[mid], &key) < 0) *high = mid;<br/>
        else                           *low = mid;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        then write ourselves a few unit tests:
      </p>
      <code>
        int A[10];<br/>
        void setup() {<br/>
        A = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10};<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        void test_checkUnderstandsAscendingOrder() {<br/>
        int h, l;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        h = 10; l = 1;<br/>
        check(A, 5, 5, &h, &l);<br/>
        assert(h == 10);<br/>
        assert(l == 5);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        h = 10; l = 1;<br/>
        check(A, 3, 5, &h, &l);<br/>
        assert(h == 5);<br/>
        assert(l == 1);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        h = 10; l = 1;<br/>
        check(A, 8, 5, &h, &l);<br/>
        assert(h == 10);<br/>
        assert(l == 5);<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        When first run, this test will fail.  Swap high and low assignments in check() to fix the failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, common sense would suggest that if this works for an array of 10 elements, it ought to work for an array of any size greater than or equal to two.  So, you can test this by writing similar sets of unit tests for arrays of length 1 and 2 as well.  Given these tests, you can now inductively prove the check() code works as intended, for all arrays given to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Having proven that code works, you may now advance to the more general procedure itself.  Namely:
      </p>
      <code>
        while (low < high) {<br/>
        mid=(low+high)/2;<br/>
        check();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Unless my math is wrong, the loop terminates when low+high = 2*high, in which case mid=low=high.  This will terminate the loop.  However, I cannot think of a single occurance where (low+high)/2 > high, provided that low < high at the beginning of the process.  To do so, we would need a division operator which rounds up in the face of any fractional component to the result.  Hence, via the observed behavior of the /-operator, we can assert that low <= mid < high for all low and high, such that low <= high.  Knowing that check() works as intended for all conceivably valid inputs, we therefore know that mid > high can never be true.  This proof can also be codified as a unit test.
      </p>
      <p>
        Since everything else is essentially straight-line code from there, writing tests for that should be relatively trivial.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, that's how <em>I</em> would attack the solution to the posed question.  --SamuelFalvo

        <em></em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s aren't supposed to prove correctness. At least, that's how I've always approached them.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's not the point. I'm not saying that you should use proofs and not do <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. I am saying that proofs are an additional tool that complement <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. Mathematicians only prove things when they have some idea not only that they are right, but why they are right. You can produce code and use <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s, but there are some errors and failure modes that are easier to find by reasoning about code instead of trying to test it. Tools like "Perfect Developer" can help, but simple thinking about code in the right way can help just as much.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd lay odds that nobody is going to take the above example seriously. Yes, it's a toy example, no, it's not irrelevant. I use these techniques every week and it finds errors and provides confidence.

        But some people are interested in how to automate proofs and logic in general, for its own sake whether or not it is applied to ProgramVerification or ComputerAidedMathematics. Going all the way back to <a href="GottfriedWilhelmLeibniz.html">GottfriedWilhelmLeibniz</a> he wanted to formalize thought so it could be analysed step by minute step, and come up with an "algebra" where thought could be manipulated as symbols.

        <dd>"A sort of universal language or script, but infinitely different from all those projected hitherto, for the symbols and even words in it would direct the reason, and errors, except for those of fact, would be mere mistakes in calculation.

        He actually built a "step wheel calculator" - the history of logic and proofs is intertwined with the desire to make machines do it which makes it necessary to be able to analyse every step. Not that you have to do that if you are doing proofs manually but if you want to do <a href="AutomatedTheoremProving.html">AutomatedTheoremProving</a>, then details are important.

        <em>Yes, and I wish them luck. Automated theorem proving is probably making great strides, just as the GPS appeared to. I look forward to the day when it can duplicate or exceed the efforts people who want to be released to do more creative things.

      <p>
        Understandable point of view but I think the younger generation will say <a href="ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate.html">ThreeStrikesAndYouAutomate</a> and get it done. Note that the same way a human saves steps by proving <strong>s1->sn from s1->thm_i->thm_j->thm_k->sn</strong> even though <strong>thm_i</strong> may "contain" <strong>si1->si2->...->six</strong> (and <strong>thm_j</strong>, <strong>thm_k</strong> similarly have multiple steps in their sub-proofs) a computer can also use theorems and lemmas without expanding out the steps in each theorem. It does not necessarily have to prove <strong>s1->si1->si2->...->sj1->sj2->...sk1->sk2->...->sn</strong> if the right theorems are part of the proof environment. A computer proof of the <strong>sqrt</strong> problem at the top could also be 6 steps if formulated the right way.

      <p>
        [Certainly it is doable to convert the above to SecondOrderLogic not that I have time right now. It would not be possible to prove "any other theorem" but you could provide a set of theorems and heuristics to solve similar proofs in the "neighborhood" of this one, which helps one understand the domain and the proof process in general. Mathematica has not obviated the need for mathematicians and engineers to do calculus manually but it is a helpful tool. As a programmer it is natural to want to automate processes. Even if you can't create a program to do "all mathematics" or even some mathematics better that a human it does not hurt to peer into the mechanics of it.]

        Start somewhere! Yes, do it in the comments to start with (that's what we do), and when you've done it a few times, see if you can automate it.

Specialized theorem proving of specific programming constructs is here. Let's adjust to the idea that it's possible to do something that really does help, rather than constantly saying "We can't achieve perfection so let's not bother". The few researchers working on it are going at it from the top end, and we need some respected, able and influential people to say - "This is actually achievable in these special cases, let's see if we can make it better."

        What does it look like? I am dubious that you do proofs for all your code, but i am not trusting.

      <p>
        <em>Of </em>'course<em>' I don't do proofs for all my code - have you not read what I have been saying? It's completely obvious that I can not and never have been able to make myself clear about this. As soon as I say "proof" everyone assumes line-by-sodding-line, crawling, step-by-step formal verification of the entire bloody system including hardware, compilers, operating system, user requirements, and resistance to cosmic rays! I don't! I mean a balance between testing, proofs of some areas, reviews of code, automatic code generation, and other techniques as well. I'm not looking for perfection - it's expensive and mostly over-the-top. I'm looking for fewer bugs and more confidence.</em>

        [[So you're saying that you're always able to be clear about this? That you're always looking for perfection, because it's cheap and necessary? Ok, got it. :-) Seriously, though, <strong>I</strong> at least understand what you mean...but then, I have an amateur side-interest in automated provers, so I have some idea of what's reasonable versus unreasonable in that subfield. I don't think it's surprising that comments about proofs get misunderstood; there are existing wide preconceptions/misconceptions on the topic, after all.]]

        <em>Doug, in reply to your first sentence, I assume you're being ironic - hence the smiley - but I'm not in the mood. I've had a bloody awful day and this is a subject I take very seriously.

        We all have bad days from time to time. But since it's been several days, it's time to get over it and clean this up; it's not the most constructive thing to leave sitting here permanently. We could either delete a number of paragraphs here, or you could proceed by addressing the point made above that this is a topic where people have existing preconceptions, so of <strong>course</strong> there will tend to be misunderstandings.

        <em>From a post on yahoo's agile-testing ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        XP insists the code be kept clean. We know that <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s aid in refactoring, the primary method of cleaning. But the reverse is true too. Clean code helps in unit testing several ways. First, clean code tends to be more modular and therefore easier to access as units. But, more importantly, clean code is more easily reasoned about. And it is this ability to reason that fills in the gaps between our unit tests. Dijkstra pointed out the futility of testing for quality and sought correctness by reason alone. We're not so quick to discard the "checked example" as an aid to reason. But be clear: It is our ability to reason about our code that makes XP productive. And it is our ability to reason about the code that makes something as simple as unit testing surprisingly complete.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me reduce this to a formula:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           reason x test = confidence
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        <em>As the situation stands now (things can always change for the better) </em><a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> looks at best to be a dilution beyond recognition, and in the worst case, a downright betrayal of the direction set forth by the great pioneer. XP gurus like <a href="UncleBob.html">UncleBob</a>, and <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> use almost every occasion at hand to bash and discredit formal methods with nothing but misguided personal rants (a summary google on comp.object will document this sordid state of affairs), so there's something XP and proofs have a very uneasy relationship to say the least. If "checked examples" as an aid to reason should not be summarily discarded, it is quite sure that XP discarded the more fundamental direction that <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a> (and many many others set) forth. Therefore it is very refreshing to see <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> voting for a belated return to the basics.<em></em>

        <em>There are two issues to be settled in conjunction with XP and proofs. First of all, in my rather pragmatic opinion tests are extremely useful even in conjunction with proofs, at least for the foreseeble future. There are many reasons for that, including the fact that not every property of a software systems is currently amenable to formal proofs and will continue to be so for a while, second that they are independent experiments that may detect "bugs" in proofs themselves.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But the more fundamental issue, is what drives the development of programs. XP is primarily "test driven", while </em><a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a> and many others claimed that it is proof and provability that should drive the development of programs. Of course, <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a> is a much more reliable and trustworthy source. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a><em></em>

        Obligatory quote on the topic of tests in conjunction with proofs: "Beware of bugs in the above code; I have only proved it correct, not tried it." (<a href="DonKnuth.html">DonKnuth</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        A more memorable quote is the introduction that LeslieLamport wrote for his book SpecifyingSystems, which follows the succession:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Writing is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your thinking is. (Guindon)
        </li>
        <li>
           Mathematics is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your writing is
        </li>
        <li>
           Formal mathematics is nature's way of letting you know how sloppy your mathematics is.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And he concludes:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Most mathematicians and scientists think that formal mathematics, without words, is long and tiresome. They're wrong. Ordinary mathematics can be expressed compactly in a precise, completely formal language. It takes only about two dozen lines to define the solution to an arbitrary differential equation in the <a href="DifferentialEquation.html">DifferentialEquation</a>s module of Chapter 11. But few specifications need such sophisticated mathematics. Most require only simple application of a few standard mathematical concepts.</dd>

        <em>People seem to think that a proof needs to be a mechanically verifiable step-by-step crawl from the obvious to the conclusion. Proofs in mathematics are rarely that, and I don't see where this attitude comes from.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me show you. Take the above binary search example (which I assume is in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>). Even after fixing the wrong comparison, the code still contains a bug. Most people won't see it -- in fact I wouldn't have seen it if I hadn't heard of it before. The problem is, that <em>int</em> has a fixed range, and for large arrays, <em>low+high</em> can overflow and return a negative value; dividing by two then gives you a value for <em>mid</em> outside of the array. The problem with non-formal, or "intuitive", proofs (as opposed to mechanically verifiable proofs), are statements like <em>which can be proven trivially</em> that are just plain wrong. A formal proof with a proper model for int-variables and int-addition would catch that bug, respectively a mechanical verifier would reject the proof. The comparison-bug would have been found by any reasonable unit test, but I doubt that you write tests that search in arrays with more than MAX_INT/2 elements. Note that I'm not saying proofs are useless, just that informal proofs are mostly useless. -- AdrianWillenbuecher
