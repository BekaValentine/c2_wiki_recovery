        Lisp Programs For Beginners

      <p>
        I saw the <a href="InteractiveFiction.html">InteractiveFiction</a> project over in <a href="CeeProgramsForBeginners.html">CeeProgramsForBeginners</a> and, seeing some of the code there, was reminded why I have been learning lisp. I wrote an alternative version. It's about the same size, more readability, and has more functionality, and even some syntactic sugar. :)
      </p>
      <p>
        I've added comments to the code, which should hopefully kind of explain what's going on. Abandon all hope of totally understanding the "Loop" statements until you've played with it a bunch. It's a great tool and I like the resulting code, but it's actually a complete sublanguage.
      </p>
      <code>
        ;; We define a "struct", which is like a C struct, for the rooms. Note that there<br/>
        ;; Are default values which can be used if we omit one from construction. <br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (defstruct my-room<br/>
        (desc "An empty room.")<br/>
        ;; The exits will be a list of lists, what lispniks call an "assoc-list"<br/>
        ;; like so: ( (north room1) (south room2) )<br/>
        ;; Think of it as a kind of simple tree.<br/>
        (exits ()))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; This function does the work of "displaying" a room. <br/>
        ;; It shows a room, its exits,<br/>
        ;; and then waits for the user to type in a valid exit. <br/>
        ;; The Lisp reader is what we use, <br/>
        ;; which means we can do some funny things.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        (defun run-room (loc)<br/>
        ;; Firstly, we fetch the fields "name" and "exits" from the room structure.<br/>
        (let ( (desc (my-room-desc loc))<br/>
        (exits (my-room-exits loc)) )<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; Format is Lisp's printf, with all that entails. This prints out the room<br/>
        ;; description and then prints out a line "Exits:"<br/>
        (format t "~%~a~%~%Exits:~%" desc)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; Dolist does just what it sounds like. It does the statement for each<br/>
        ;; member of the list in "exits". In this case, it displays the name of each<br/>
        ;; exit on its own line <br/>
        (dolist (x exits) (format t "~a~%" (first x)))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; Then we print a prompt<br/>
        (format t "~%> ")<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; We use LOOP here, instead of the more obtuse do macro. The general idea<br/>
        ;; is to keep reading from input, letting lisp do the parsing. <br/>
        ;; We check if the input is a valid exit (if it exists in the assoc list)<br/>
        ;; and if so we return the SYMBOL that is in the next result. So we'd return<br/>
        ;; the NAME "forestroom" instead of the actual instance forestroom. This is<br/>
        ;; only to make things more convenient. <br/>
        (loop for dir = (read) <br/>
        for arc = (assoc dir exits)<br/>
        when arc<br/>
        do (return (second arc))<br/>
        else do (format t "You cannot go ~a~%> " dir)))))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; This function actually starts the maze. You just say (run-maze room1) or whatever<br/>
        ;; It is another loop. All it does is keep looping over rooms, making sure that if<br/>
        ;; the symbol "DONE" is ever returned, to terminate the loop. This means the maze can<br/>
        ;; actually end. :)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; The "symbol-value" means "get the value at the symbol", which is pretty useful here<br/>
        ;; since it means that rooms don't depend on each other, only on symbols which lisp provides. <br/>
        (defun run-maze (start)<br/>
        (loop for next = (run-room start) <br/>
        then (run-room (symbol-value next))<br/>
        while (not (eq next 'done))))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ;; This is a macro, which means fancy syntactic sugar. All it does is <br/>
        ;; make it so that our room definitions can look pretty, and can safely<br/>
        ;; be ignored. <br/>
        (defmacro def-room (name desc &rest exit-pairs)<br/>
        `(defvar ,name (make-my-room :desc ,desc<br/>

      </code>
      <code>
        ;; Our macro makes our room definitions very pretty. <br/>
        ;; Note that we refer to rooms by name <br/>
        ;; without caring if they are made yet or not. <br/>
        ;; This is because we refer to them symbolically,<br/>
        ;; and run-maze is wise to this <br/>
        ;; and understands to look up the value at the symbol. <br/>
        ;; That kind of coding is one of the real benefits of lisp's approach. <br/>

        This was a surprisingly fun little thing that I took a while to write. I had something done real quick but I didn't like the simple way that the C program handled input, so I tweaked it a little and did some basic validation. I feel a lot better about using LOOP now. :)

        Maybe this page could start a trend, something like *X* Programs for Beginners. The same simple programs implemented in many languages with the intent of educating beginners. <a href="DaveThomas.html">DaveThomas</a> made some excellent <a href="CodeKata.html">CodeKata</a> pages for these kinds of exercises.
      </p>
      <p>
        [For the above to be really useful to non-lispers, explanatory notes should be added to explain what is done, and also why. BTW, I quite liked the revised messages.]

        <em>That's all I have time for at the moment. This is rather out-of-context, I should make supporting examples. It was more that I saw the text adventure program and had a little fun. -- </em><a href="DaveFayram.html">DaveFayram</a><em></em>

        You Lispers seem to be having fun with this, so how about a request for something a little more applicable for someone in the .Net world.  How about doing a simple lisp program that connects to a <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a> database and spits out the results of a query to a single web page, with maybe a little processing of the result to show off a few cool lisp features?  Nothing too fancy, just enough to maybe get someone up and running in the windows world with Sql.  I know it'd give me some incentive to try some sample projects in lisp if I could use it in my current environment, I'm sure others feel the same.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'd be willing, but not on this page, which is divergent. Perhaps </em>PracticalLispExamples or some other such titled page. It'd be a nice opportunity for me to play with the cl database libraries at common-lisp.net. But your idea a bit under-specified. Could you be more specific? Preferably at my home page? -- <a href="DaveFayram.html">DaveFayram</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>SQL examples can easily be found in tutorials from the major Lisp vendors like Franz Allegro and Xanalys </em><a href="LispWorks.html">LispWorks</a> who make their products easily available for evaluation and learning (compared with players like Microsoft or Borland they are really to be appreciated for their no-hassle try-out policy ), but on the other hand it is non-standard. See for example <a href="http://www.lispworks.com/reference/lw43/LWUG/html/lwuser-179.htm#pgfId-886165''">http://www.lispworks.com/reference/lw43/LWUG/html/lwuser-179.htm#pgfId-886165''</a>

        <em>Speaking as somebody with some experience in database application, and experience with ADO.NET, Lisp based data access is a breeeze. The language itself is so much more conducive of good design for frameworks.</em>
