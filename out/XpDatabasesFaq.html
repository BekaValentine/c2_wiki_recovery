        <strong>How do I test database tables?</strong>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Have each test set up its own state and return the DB to
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        clean-and-pristine when it's done. The effort of doing this will be
        substantial at first, but over time is much less than the effort of finding
        defects that were masked by test sequencing, or false defects that were
        created by changes in test sequencing. That's one of the lessons of
        xUnit-test isolation is wonderful.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Don't assume one unit test per stored procedure.
        </li>
      </ol>

        There is no substantial effort to do this for most DBMS. Any DBMS that has transaction processing requires just two statements to return the data to it's pretest state... Begin Transaction and Rollback. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A more significant issue is unit testing large data sets (when it's a requirement, or when it's impractical to create test data). If it takes to long to run the unit tests due to this, they won't be run.
