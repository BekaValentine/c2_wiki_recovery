        Algorithm Wiki Link Structural Analysis
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here is the algorithm for Analysis of Wiki Link Structure:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Download from Ward's server the file containing all links.
        </li>
        <li>
           Ignore all links to external sites, and all "links" to non-existent pages. For the purposes of finding potentially valuable but hard to access pages, these "links" are irrelevant.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Consider removing from consideration all pages with <a href="CategoryHomePage.html">CategoryHomePage</a>. Some pages only have signatures as their out-going links. Removing all home pages should make more pages into dead ends, and more pages into orphans, but will no longer list home pages in the output.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        We now have a digraph with pages as vertices and links as directed edges. We begin by removing from the graph the vertices that are not part of any strongly connected component.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Remove from the graph all vertices listed on <a href="CategoryAutoIgnore.html">CategoryAutoIgnore</a>. These are pages that should probably be ignored when trying to understand the linkage structure of the wiki. There is some discussion about this issue on that page.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Next we print a list of dead-ends (and pages that point only to dead-ends).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the remaining graph, find all vertices with zero out-degree. List them, then remove them from the graph. Repeat this process until all vertices have out-degree > 0.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Next print a list of orphans (and pages that are pointed to only by orphans).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the remaining graph, find all vertices with zero in-degree. List them, then remove them from the graph. Repeat this process until all vertices have in-degree > 0.
          <ul>
            <li>
               The graph that now remains is such that all vertices have non-zero in-degree and non-zero out-degree.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Print "orphan clusters":
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Identify all small (up to 100 vertices) sets of vertices such that the set is strongly connected and has no incoming links.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Print "dead-end clusters":
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Identify all small (up to 100 vertices) sets of vertices such that the set is strongly connected and has no outgoing links.
        </li>
      </ul>
