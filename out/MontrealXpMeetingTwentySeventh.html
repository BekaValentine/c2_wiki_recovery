        <a href="JeanPhilippeBelanger.html">JeanPhilippeBelanger</a> led an animated discussion about why patterns could be considered harmful. We discussed classically misused patterns such as <a href="SingletonPattern.html">SingletonPattern</a>, <a href="VisitorPattern.html">VisitorPattern</a> and <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a>.

        There were various discussions about interfaces in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, generics in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, XSLT transformation of SGML to XML, DTDs versus schemas in XML, functional vs. OO and how the languages/technologies used change the "rules of engagement". Also, how refactoring fits into an overall approach to programming and how it lines up with <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        We were joined by Francois, who will hopefully find his way back to us next meeting!
