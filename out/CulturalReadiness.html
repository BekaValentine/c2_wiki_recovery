        <strong>Q</strong> Does this approach to Supply Chain Management cater for the social aspects of an organisation?  For example the politics of an organisation.  We have encountered a great deal of <em>resistance to a SAP implementation</em> because the employees were not fully consulted and perceived the implementation was enforced from above.  How do we get everyone on board when implementing SAP in a large, well established organisation with a deeply entrenched culture of doing things the "old" way? by 132.234... from question in <a href="SupplyChainManagement.html">SupplyChainManagement</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           note the description in the source page said this of Supply Chain Management: "an approach that examines the company in the context of the "world" around it, from suppliers to customers"

        <strong>A</strong> The <a href="SocialDynamics.html">SocialDynamics</a> that exists in an organization is a crucial concern for any <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a> exercise. Quite often "Middle Management" need to engaged to communicate the impetus for change, and to consolidate feedback from the frontline (and backoffice) operational staff so the majority of affected people can feel their contributions are valued. In situations where segments of the affected organization will have to take a "bitter pill", then the communication process need to start early. Transparency of the <a href="ChangeManagement.html">ChangeManagement</a> process is a very step to building trust. There may be some lessons one can learn from strategies adopted by military, in building trust of the frontline soliders.

        It is also important for management at all levels to be more sensitive to <a href="HumanBehavioralPatterns.html">HumanBehavioralPatterns</a>, e.g. Ways to expedite the <a href="FiveStagesOfGrief.html">FiveStagesOfGrief</a> may be applicable for some people caught in difficult situations.
