        Successful Meeting
      </h1>
      <p>
        A successful meeting has three phases:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Phase 1: Preparation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Always ask a few questions before you start:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What is the main goal? (the email Subject:)
        </li>
        <li>
           What are the topics of the meeting?
        </li>
        <li>
           What are the expected results for each topic?
        </li>
        <li>
           Who has to join the meeting? (the email To:)
        </li>
        <li>
           Who will be interested? (the email Cc:)
        </li>
        <li>
           Can the goal be achieved in a different way?
        </li>
        <li>
           Are the selection of topics and participants homogeneous? Is it possible to split the meeting? To refactor the meeting?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Check that the meeting room is available, and reserve it. Sometimes the room will be occupied by your boss, and he has a more important meeting than you.
        </li>
        <li>
           Reserve 15 minutes more time than you think you'll need.
        </li>
        <li>
           Check that all the equipment you need is available.
        </li>
        <li>
           Invite the participants directly and at least one day before the meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
           Check the schedule of the participants to make sure they can make it.
        </li>
        <li>
           Inform any interested people about the meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
           Include an agenda with the invitation.
        </li>
        <li>
           Assign the recorder and moderator.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result of the preparation is the Agenda.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Agenda contains:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Place
        </li>
        <li>
           Time and date, duration
        </li>
        <li>
           Participants
        </li>
        <li>
           Topics with description, goal, owner and estimated time
        </li>
        <li>
           Moderator
        </li>
        <li>
           Recorder
        </li>
        <li>
           If a regular meeting, the last minutes of the meeting and the goals achieved and issues still open
        </li>
        <li>
           A hint about the penalty if a participant is late
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And keep in mind:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Fewer participants is better.
        </li>
        <li>
           If a goal is to generate work, invite those who must do this work, or at least one who will be responsible.
        </li>
        <li>
           Fewer topics is better.
        </li>
        <li>
           Describe the topics in two to five sentences.
        </li>
        <li>
           Describe the goal for each topic along with any related information.
        </li>
        <li>
           Always assign a topic owner.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Phase 2: During the meeting</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Welcome all participants, and say a few words about the main goal.
        </li>
        <li>
           If it's a regular meeting check the last goal list.
        </li>
        <li>
           Assign work only to the participants. A participant can delegate work, but is still himself responsible to see that it gets done.
        </li>
        <li>
           Be as brief as possible.
        </li>
        <li>
           Moderate the meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
           Avoid off-topic discussions.
        </li>
        <li>
           Avoid discussions that are relevant only to some of the participants. Suggest an action item, that these participants discuss the issue off-line.
        </li>
        <li>
           Avoid long discussions over complex issues. Move the discussion to its own meeting, with its own agenda.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Ending:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Make a summary of the goal achieved and the results.
        </li>
        <li>
           Thank the participants.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Phase 3: After the meeting</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Stay for a few minutes for further questions. These questions may be off-topic, but they can be helpful in planning the next meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
           The recorder should write and publish the minutes immediately after the meeting.
        </li>
        <li>
           The minutes are similar to the agenda, except they include the actual participants, start, duration, and results.
        </li>
      </ul>
