        Conceptually, it's more complex than this.  You aren't simply preprocessing to add some code, you're separating common behavior that cuts across classes into separate modules (in <a href="AspectJay.html">AspectJay</a>, they're called Aspects--analogous to Classes).  These modules are then "woven" into regular classes.  In AspectJ, this is done at compile time, but AOP "weaving" doesn't have to occur at compile time, it could conceptually happen at runtime. -- <a href="KenLiu.html">KenLiu</a>
