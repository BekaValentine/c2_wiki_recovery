        What other language features are "fundamental"?  I'd list (off the top of my head):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Concurrency
        </li>
        <li>
           Access to OS-supplied resources
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Regular Expressions and Context Free Grammars (unfortunately often left as an external tool e.g. YACC) support 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Isn't a library good enough for those (as in Ocaml)?</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, that is better than as an external tool, isn't it?  Perhaps you mean that those aren't as fundamental is some way since they can be relegated to a library?  
      </p>

        I would question whether any of the above can be regarded as <a href="FundamentalLanguageFeatures.html">FundamentalLanguageFeatures</a>.  We really don't need another <a href="LanguagePissingMatch.html">LanguagePissingMatch</a> page.

        Below are some features that could be considered fundamental, i.e. common to all.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Multiple representation of numbers trading off efficiency, range, and accuracy.  We commonly have integers, long integers, and at least one kind of floating point.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Addition and subtraction.  Multiplication and division may also be included, though there are some assembly languages that do not provide a multiply and divide operation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Text representation (but not necessarily text string manipulation).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Array representation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Data comparison.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Branching and conditional branching.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Concept of volatile versus non-volatile storage.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Subroutines.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Copying data. <em></em><a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> and other <a href="PurelyFunctional.html">PurelyFunctional</a> languages do not have this, nor the next one.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Difference between copies of data and references to data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use of a single return value.  Arguably, exceptions may be providing an alternative to allow functions to return two independent values, a result or an error.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I believe one of the most fundamental features is <a href="AbstractDataTypes.html">AbstractDataTypes</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another thing I'd like to mention (despite that I'm unsure it can be considered to belong to <a href="FundamentalLanguageFeatures.html">FundamentalLanguageFeatures</a>) is LanguageMinimalism; that is, everything which can at all be implemented by an external library, actually <strong>must</strong> be implemented as a library not a part of the language.  
      </p>
      <p>
        And, by the way, <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> is to my mind a thing which limits a language to some certain problem domains only. Hmm... it can even be implemented by a library, as it is done for C++, so I'm unsure there can be a good reason to include it into a language... unless the language needs it naturally, like Lisp which has no memory management facilities at all.

        If I had to create this page again, I would name it CrossCuttingLanguageProperties.

      <p>
        <em>Language aspects?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        One would think so based on AspectProgramming, but the word aspect has a sort of nebulous feel to it. A language aspect could be just about anything, even the term 'fundamental language aspect' could mean just about anything. I mean hell, it could refer to the syntax or the fact that it uses English words. -- RK

        Isn't this page a poor version of <a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>s ?
