        Requirements Vs Wishes
      </h1>

        File this under "words are important" (see also <a href="AdoptVsAdapt.html">AdoptVsAdapt</a>).

        Requirement: <em>n.</em> that which is required; a thing demanded or obligatory.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is exactly the wrong word for this thing. In my projects, I often deliver a quarter of the original "things demanded or obligatory", and I still get paid. Either I do a terrible job of writing down these things, or they aren't actually "demanded or obligatory". If the latter, we should use a different word to denote them.

        I nominate <em>wishes</em>, as in "What are the wishes for the project so far?" "How have the wishes changed in the last week?" This puts us in the (perhaps uncomfortable) position of wish fulfillment, a ProgramFairy. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        I believe the phrase I voted for was WishFairy... but if that makes people too uncomfortable, SomewhatPowerfulGenie works well too... The "wish lists" that I've seen tended to contain low-priority items.  Maybe "goals", "targets"? -- <a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a>

        My vote goes to "intention" and its cousins.  Sometimes people feel duty-bound to ask for what they do not wish for.  I understand their predicament.  As long as they intend for us to take them at their word, I'm happy not to pry into their private feelings on the matter!  For a set of intentions (a project scope, for example), I like to talk about "intent"; this connotes the state of being in a dynamic, flexible and insecure temporary structure.
