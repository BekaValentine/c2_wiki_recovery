        A common phrase used by computers to confuse their users.

      <p>
        Apart from it being general in a world that is usually very specific, the problem with it is that, often, any key will not do; Ctrl, Shift and Alt keys may not even send events to the port let alone be recognized as keystrokes.

        I haven't seen "Press Any Key" for a while. Usually, when something happens that motivates the computer to pause in such a matter, it's in the form of a dialog box with a big OK button. -- <a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>
