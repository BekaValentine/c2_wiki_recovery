        == # What is Habitat ==
      </p>
      <p>
        Habitat is a very small, super fast, easy-to-install and highly customizable
        content management system designed for personal or community use.
        Habitat is written in perl, and can use sqlite database as the
        backend. It even contains a build-in cgi webserver. Habitat
        can be run from a local computer by an individual user, or installed
        on a public website serving a group of users.
      </p>
      <p>
        Habitat is a wiki engine too. Users can quickly build their 
        own websites or information archive using this software by
        creating, editing and managing wiki pages online. It provides
        an efficient collaborative platform for an online community 
        to develop software or resources.
      </p>
      <p>
        Habitat was written by [<a href="http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~fangq/">http://nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/~fangq/</a> Qianqian Fang] 
        who had also founded the collaborative font development project - 
        [<a href="http://wenq.org/en/">http://wenq.org/en/</a> WenQuanYi]. Habitat is a result of 5 years 
        continuous improvement of the WenQuanYi Wiki engine. A lot of 
        new features were added, such as the user management system,
        database backend, hierarchical wiki page namespace, multi-language
        support, object-oriented structure and interfaces for plugins.

        == # How to install Habitat ==
        To download the latest stable release of Habitat, please browse
        the download section of [<a href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/huc/files/">https://sourceforge.net/projects/huc/files/</a> this page].
        <b>If you are using Debian/Ubuntu, please download and install
        the deb package. It will set up everything for you 
        and you can find Habitat in the "Accessories" menu.</b>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to try out the latest code, you can 
        access it from our SVN. On Unix/Linux/Mac OS, you can use the 
        following svn command:
      </p>
      <code>
        svn co <a href="https://huc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/huc/trunk/habitat">https://huc.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/huc/trunk/habitat</a> habitat<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        On Windows, you might want to install [<a href="http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads">http://tortoisesvn.net/downloads</a> TortoiseSVN]
        to run the above command.
      </p>
      <p>
        You may run Habitat in 4 modes: Standard, Extended, 
        Basic and Tiny. Under "Tiny" mode, you can even get most
        things done with a SINGLE cgi script (only 200kB in size)!
      </p>
      <p>
        It is recommended to run Habitat under the Standard mode.
        With this mode, sqlite database is used as
        the backend, which not only saves a lot of disk space,
        but also makes it super fast for searching and data backup. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To use the Standard mode, you must make sure the following
        perl modules are installed on your system:
      </p>
      <code>
        DBI, DBD::Sqlite3, Text::Diff, Text::Patch, Crypt::DES<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        If you are running a Debian/Ubuntu desktop, you can install all the 
        dependencies using the following command:
      </p>
      <code>
        sudo apt-get install perl python sqlite3 libdbd-sqlite3-perl \<br/>
        libtext-diff-perl libtext-patch-perl libcrypt-des-perl<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In most cases, perl and python have already been installed. So, the 
        above command only adds about 1M space. If you do not have 
        permission to install these modules, you can download the pre-compiled 
        modules from our website. Extract the downloaded modules
        into a subfolder called "lib" under the Habitat main directory.
      </p>
      <p>
        The next step is to initialize database, please run the 
        following command from Habitat's main folder:
      </p>
      <code>
        sqlite3 db/habitatdb.db '.read db/gendb.sql'<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        For safety reasons, we strongly suggest you setting your own
        administrator password and site hash. To do so, you need
        to edit a global config file with command:
      </p>
      <code>
        nano habitatdb/config<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        search for <tt>AdminPass</tt> and <tt>CaptchaKey</tt>, replace the values 
        in the quotations to whatever password you prefer. Note,
        <tt>CaptchaKey</tt> must be a 16digit hex number. You should
        also consider moving the <tt>habitatdb</tt> directory to a safe place to 
        avoid direct exposing of the <tt>config</tt> file. A suggested place is 
        <tt>/var/lib/habitatdb/</tt>. Remember to update the value for <tt>DataDir</tt>
        variable at the beginning of index.cgi if you have moved the <tt>habitatdb</tt> folder.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now it is time to test Habitat. Open a terminal, and
        navigate to the Habitat main folder, and run
      </p>
      <code>
        ./runlocal.sh<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A browser window will pop-up, and the home page will be displayed.
        If you prefer to use Chinese (or other languages) as the default 
        language, edit "<tt>index.cgi</tt>", search for <tt>LangID="en"</tt>, and
        replace en to cn (or other language codes).

      <p>
        If you run Habitat for the first time, please click on the
        "[<a href="http:?action=newlogin">http:?action=newlogin</a> Register]" link on the left to create a username/password
        for yourself. You can also apply the admin password you set
        previously. Otherwise, you will be considered as an 
        anonymous user and Habitat will only display your IP address.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to make you the only person who can make changes, 
        you have to login as an administrator (by setting the admin password
        in the register page), and set <tt>EditAllowed</tt> to 0 in the <tt>config</tt>
        file. If you want to run Habitat for personal use, this is 
        highly recommended.

      </p>
      <p>
        A new feature of Habitat is the support of hierarchical pages.
        You can create something like "[[Page/Subpage]]"
        or "[[Page/Subpage/Subsubpage]]" to represent more complex
        information or resources.

        == # A bigger picture ==
      </p>
      <p>
        Habitat is a sub-project of the [<a href="http://huc.sf.net">http://huc.sf.net</a> Human Understandable Computing]
        (HUC) project. The overall goal of HUC is to promote open, safe,
        collaborative and intuitive programming models. The focus of
        the project is to develop software tools that are written 
        in non-obscured scripting languages and driven by human understandable 
        text, graphics and multimedia data (such as voice, video or gesture).
        Habitat is a demonstration of the basic principles for HUC,
        as it is written by high-level scripting language and 
        manipulates human understandable text information.
      </p>
      <p>
        We welcome anyone who embraces the notion of HUC to join
        us. We believe that the more software following the principles of
        HUC, the more open and safer our software ecosystem will be.
