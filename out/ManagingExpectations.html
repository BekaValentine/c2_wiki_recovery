           <em>" ...Actively managing business expectations is crucial to CIO success because it leads to better IT governance, alignment to business strategy and more sophisticated project management."</em>

      <p>
        The above paper later laid out 4 steps to <a href="ManagingExpectations.html">ManagingExpectations</a>, and is definitely worth your time to do the reading:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Get your house in order
        </li>
        <li>
           Shut up and listen
        </li>
        <li>
           Educate them
        </li>
        <li>
           Get on the Agenda
        </li>
        <li>
           Communicate early and often
