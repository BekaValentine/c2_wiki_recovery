        Perhaps this book can serve as the starting point and dictionary for a <a href="RefactoringLanguage.html">RefactoringLanguage</a>, much as PatternNames, used together, can form a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>.

        I picked up a copy at <a href="JavaOne.html">JavaOne</a>. It's a wonderful book. It is organized roughly along the lines of the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> book - some introductory chapters about what refactoring is, where it came from, and why you should care, followed by a catalog of refactorings. However, I found it to be a much more pleasant book to read than <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> (as useful and important as that book is, I don't think it's an easy read).

        Like Fowler's book <a href="UmlDistilled.html">UmlDistilled</a>, Refactoring is subversive. Along the way, readers learn about many, if not most, of the XP techniques and principles: pair programming, continuous unit testing (and writing unit tests first), <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, and others. -- <a href="GlennVanderburg.html">GlennVanderburg</a>

        If you've read <a href="SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns.html">SmalltalkBestPracticePatterns</a>, you'll find this book is quite similar in a lot of ways. As well as showing you better ways to use the language, this book shows you how to take poor code and improve it by applying those patterns. It uses <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> rather than <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> and is much easier to apply directly for those of us using <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>. I couldn't recommend this book more! -- JohnBurton

        Kudos, Martin! This book is fabulous! Within an hour, I had decided that I will order several copies to spread around my company. And I was thrilled when I showed it to a colleague first thing this morning only to learned that he ordered it this weekend after discovering it (and reading chapter 1) at a local bookstore. -- <a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        I'd like to thank Martin for putting together some of the theory of Refactoring with some actual practice here. Writing code is not simply written, but evolved, and this book gives some very specific methods and pathways for common programming techniques.
      </p>

        The odd thing is, like <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>, once you have seen the pattern (or idiom, or whatever you want to call it) you think to yourself Oh yeah, I do that (aka I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>). But having a roadmap in front of you is a thought aid and useful reference point when you're in the thick of code without a flashlight.
      </p>
      <p>
        I must also thank this book for introducing me to the <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a> (actually JUnit, but that's not wiki friendly) testing framework. I would have liked to have seen more focus on the pre-emptive unit testing methodology as it seemed interesting, but I am concerned how it would scale up to large scale software projects, specifically client/server or distributed systems.

        One thing that I found confusing was the UML class diagram of JUnit on page 92. It shows that TestSuite and TestCase both implement <<interface>> Test. That much was reasonable, and consistent with <a href="MartinFowlersJunitPaper.html">MartinFowlersJunitPaper</a>. However, it also shows that TestSuite extends zero or more Test. -- <a href="PatrickParker.html">PatrickParker</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That looks like an erratum. The relationship should be aggregation, rather than inheritance. That is, a Test<strong>'Suite <em>contains</em> zero or more Tests.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>JUnit uses the </em><a href="CompositePattern.html">CompositePattern</a>. TestSuite both implements Test <em>and</em> contains zero or more instances of Test.<em></em>

        I just finished reading Chapter 6 and I have a question regarding <a href="ReplaceMethodWithMethodObject.html">ReplaceMethodWithMethodObject</a>. I have used this pattern before, creating an <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a> to replace a classes method. The book makes no mention of using <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a><strong>'es, and I was wondering if there are any reasons why you might not make the new </strong><a href="MethodObject.html">MethodObject</a> an <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, why not? It's a simple extension of <a href="ReplaceMethodWithMethodObject.html">ReplaceMethodWithMethodObject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally I consider ReplaceMethodWithInnerClass to be the obvious implementation of the pattern. The question I was asking is: <em>"Are there any times when using an inner class is inappropriate for this Pattern?"</em>

        Having finished reading Chapter 8 I thought I should ask why there was no treatment of the threading issues inherent in DuplicateObservedData. The issue is that any modification of the <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a> will be propagated to the GUI widgets automatically via the Observer update() method. As this occurs within the setter method of the <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>, it will run within the updating Thread <strong>not</strong> the GUI Thread. As neither AWT nor Swing are <a href="ThreadSafe.html">ThreadSafe</a>, this can lead to DataRace<em></em>'s and resulting bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The solution is for the <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a> to register an update with either javax.swing.InvokeAndWait() or javax.swing.InvokeLater(). Note that if you use InvokeAndWait() you must be careful you avoid <a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a>, InvokeLater does not have this problem however it will leave your GUI Object and your <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a> out of sync until the update runs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both functions use Runnable as a <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>, in most cases I use <a href="AnonymousInnerClass.html">AnonymousInnerClass</a>es for this.

        Excellent book - wish I'd come across it sooner. Quite practical/hands on, though with decent explanations. I found the GoF book unreadable, so I bought a clone, which still makes some of the patterns clear as mud. This book however couldn't be clearer, and what's more it's easy to read - written with a light touch and interspersed with humour. I was pleased to see that I was already using most of the refactorings - but having a good reason why is very reassuring. Still not taken 'Change Unidirectional Association to Bidirectional' on board though - I'm sure I've needed to achieve the same end before, but I can't figure out how else I would have done it. 10/10 for <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> & co. -- <a href="DannyAyers.html">DannyAyers</a>

        You know, I'm still not happy with the use of the term <em>design</em> in relation to refactoring. Design happens before coding. Code is supposed to reflect design. Refactoring can improve <em>implementation</em>, but it really can't affect design. If it does then there was something wrong with the design in the first place, now wasn't there?
