        Hi, my name is John I can't stop reading wiki. I've come to wiki once from cetus-links and now I'm trapped. Many other tasks suffered from timeconsuming reading. I feel bad. But I can see the light...

        Hi, my Name is Fred. I didn't want to.  It started with a page.  Just a little insight into XP I thought I would share.  Now I can't stop.  I get the shakes if I go too long without checking <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.  I post constantly.  Is there any way to stop this vicious circle?

        Relax. Don't be afraid. Wiki is your friend. Make <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> your browser home-page. It's so much easier that way.

        It is so weird, when I read the above statement I think, wow, good idea.  When I read below, I kinda take a pause. . .

        <em>I came here to get help and instead got the idea to make </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> my homepage<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But making <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> your browsers home <em>will</em> help you. Oh no, wait a minute, I see the confusion. You didn't think we were going to help you <em>stop</em>, did you? Bwuh-hahahahahahahahah.

        I first started reading Wiki for insight into a <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a>, I thought I could control it, after all I didn't visit more than a few times a month. But late last year I was sick in bed with a laptop and net connection and found myself spending the better part of the day hitting recent changes, then I started to write...

        I was a Wiki addict for six months when I first found it. Now I am reformed. I only check recent changes about once a week. You too can make it out of the trap.

        Hi my name is <a href="ChuckSmith.html">ChuckSmith</a>.  I couldn't help myself and ended up starting the <a href="EsperantoLanguage.html">EsperantoLanguage</a> <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> and now have an active community of over 1,500 pages from people from 12 countries.  I'm also now regularly checking the Recent Changes on the <a href="AndStuffWiki.html">AndStuffWiki</a>.  How did I get here anyway?  Why am I editing this page?  It's all a blur...  but it's ok, 'cause I've got Wiki.

        Hi, my name begins with J.  I should be learning an archaic tool I'd rather not have to deal with.  I decided to hit recent changes, you know, just to brighten my day a bit before I got down to boring stuff.  It's now four hours later.

        Hi, I didn't really get into wikis much until I started contributing.  Now I'm writing pages for the sake of it -- I'm not even that interested in CanineDentistry or VacuumCleanerRepair.  I even had to buy a bigger dictionary to find words that no-one has used before.  I'm dreading the day all of the good word combinations have gone.

        I feel like I'm losing my religion, but that's because I only saw Synecdoche, because she was hot, and wiki is amorphous and androgynous. But wiki was really the one for me, the honored guest of my <a href="WikiPrayer.html">WikiPrayer</a>; wiki, God, it's all the same thing. Just running a different simulation for ultimate concern.

        Hi, everybody, my name's Matt. I used to be a regular guy. Since I discovered Wikipedia I find myself getting into edit wars about Gamal Abdel Nasser's connections with the nazis. I curse the day somebody told me about something called internet.
