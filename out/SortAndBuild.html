        Sort And Build
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was reading a computational geometry textbook the 
        other day. And, in the first chapter, the author made 
        an offhand comment. Something along the lines of 
        "This is the standard way we build algorithms in 
        computational geometry. First we sort the input 
        data, then we construct the solution incrementally."
      </p>
      <p>
        And a few moments ago, I was thinking about state
        space search (for games) and I realized that much 
        the same thing is true. One sorts, builds, sorts, 
        builds, ....
      </p>
      <p>
        Which suggests to me that there's a general
        approach to algorithms here: When you're not sure 
        what to do, sort the data and deal with it piecemeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        The big question: Is this a generally applicable 
        pattern? Or is it only for certain restricted
        domains like, say, AI and Computational Geometry? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Is sorting a more powerful tool than I had hitherto
        realized? What other algorithmic patterns use 
        sorting?

        Is <em>sorting</em> taken
        to mean <em>separating</em>
        as opposed to <em>ordering</em>?

        I'm a little confused as to how to read the above with sorting meaning separating but not especially ordering.  However, in computer graphics real time simulators, we used to organize the polygons in special ways to simplify their processing.  This would count as separating the data into groups, and then working on the groups separately.  We also ordered the groups, and within groups when we could.  --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

      <p>
        Don't <em>sorting</em> and
        <em>separating</em> fall
        under the more general banner of <em>organizing?</em>
        The general approach to many problems is to first organize data
        (e.g., sort it, separate it into piles, structure it for quick retrieval
        or efficient querying),
        and then to analyze or process the aggregate.
        <a href="SortAndBuild.html">SortAndBuild</a> might be the trivial case of <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a>.

        I meant "ordering" by sorting. And this may be just as 
        trivial as <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a> says, but it still struck me 
        as interesting. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When you're designing objects, you can use a laundry 
        list of questions in order to guide the process, 
        suggest object structures, and make sure you haven't 
        overlooked anything that commonly occurs. 
      </p>
      <p>
        What I'm starting to sense is that there is a similar
        list of questions and, possibly, patterns at a much 
        lower level (I knew that patterns scaled up, but 
        didn't really suspect they scaled down. My natural 
        stupidity shining forth, I guess).
