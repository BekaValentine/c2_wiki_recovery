           The change in the amount of space required to store References of textual, visual and audible material has drastically shrunk since the 1920's. Changes in the LibrarySciencesAndTechnology has transferred much reference material from original physical artifacts to micro-formed artifacts. One of the earliest was microfilming on rolls of film or on microfiche. This was especially true for periodicals including magazines, journals and newspapers, and also included books. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Projects to archive books, including many which have become public-domain, as well as those which are rare and fragile, into DigitalArtifacts begun years ago and being continued currently by organizations and institutions who then allow wide-spread public access to them. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Many current books will include published digital reproductions. 
        </li>

           This includes many to most publications.

           Since the early to mid 1940's with the micro sizing of, and personalizing of computers, their footprint has reduced from room-size-computing devices and peripherals, to desk-sized, to lap-sized and presently to palm-sized devices.
        </li>
        <li>
           Reducing the size of a device does not necessarily mean that the viewing footprint need be confined to the device-display. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Display may become enlarged as the device projects displays to walls or surfaces where it may be individually of severally observed.
        </li>
        <li>
           This may also become true for devices made to project their sounds to devices through radio wi-fi networks. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Displays may also be directed through wearable devices to the retina of the eye(s).
