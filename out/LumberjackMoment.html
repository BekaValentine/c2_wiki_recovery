        Lumberjack Moment
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>"I've always wanted to be... a Lumberjack!  Leaping from tree to tree, in the mighty forests of British Columbia!..."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A phrase related to me by a former manager.  A <a href="LumberjackMoment.html">LumberjackMoment</a> is one realizes (or confides to one's boss) that one is not happy in his/her current career, and desires to do Something <a href="CompletelyDifferent.html">CompletelyDifferent</a>.  In the case I heard about, an engineer told my ex-boss that he wanted to leave the engineering profession and become a food wholesaler.  Now he works for Sysco (as opposed to Cisco; though both companies seem to be in the "routing" business...)
      </p>
      <p>
        Name comes from the <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a> "lumberjack" skit...speaking of which, lets Sing! Sing! Sing!
      </p>
      <code>
        I'm a lumberjack and I'm OK<br/>
        I sleep all night and I work all day<br/>
        (He's a lumberjack and he's OK<br/>
        He sleeps all night and he works all day)<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I cut down trees, I eat my lunch,<br/>
        I go to the lavat'ry<br/>
        On Wednesdays I go shopping<br/>
        For butter'd scones for tea!<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And so forth.

        Here is a start on a new version:  In the original, the Lumberjack-wannabe has just expressed dissatisfaction at being a barber (or a pet-shop owner; several different versions of this are found in Python).  In our version, OurHero is an intrepid salesman at <a href="RadioShack.html">RadioShack</a> (something I regret I used to do--<a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>)
