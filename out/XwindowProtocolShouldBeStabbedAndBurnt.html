        Lots of people talk of replacing X11 as if it were a GUI system, and don't realize what they are really replacing. The argument for a *different* single-user stand-alone GUI server for workstations is completely separate. Pretending you can replace X11 with something like that is, however, ill-conceived at best. All the 'baggage' is completely necessary for many people. What the complainer is usually <em>really</em> saying is 'I don't want all of X11's capabilities, so why can't I have something simpler'..."

        One of the reasons they say Microsoft Windows is so crashy and kludgy is because it's based on a legacy GUI from the late 80's, and a legacy OS from the early 80's. But at least its legacy GUI and legacy OS were designed with mortal users in mind. Most X-Windows applications I've seen, with their big windows and small fonts, think they're running on a 22-inch monitor at 1280x1024. And every application seemed to use the mouse buttons for something different. I do hope this has changed since 1999.

        I'm hoping that the <a href="FrescoFramework.html">FrescoFramework</a> (formerly known as <a href="TheBerlinProject.html">TheBerlinProject</a>) will eventually replace X.
      </p>
      <p>
        <Digression> I have a feeling that the story of X is something like the story of <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>. When I had to learn Fortran II, it was a terrible letdown from <a href="AlgolLanguage.html">AlgolLanguage</a> -- it had no block structure, no if then else, it required line numbers (IIRC), etc. Over the years, Fortran incorporated most of the advances that other languages innovated and is now very little like the Fortran I learned, significantly better than Algol, and has characteristics of <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a>, <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, etc. (IIUC, there seems to be one defining underlining characteristic that makes people who are aware of it choose between C and Fortran, but I forget what it is.) I suspect X has gone the same way, continuing to incorporate improvements without a significant enough name change (for me) to facilitate discourse about the characteristics of X.
        </Digression> 
      </p>
      <p>
        IIRC, X does (or did) one thing that I think is bass-ackwards. If it needs to render, e.g., a combobox on a CRT display, the application generates the bits and X carries them from the application to the display. In today's world, where bandwidth is a bigger bottleneck than processing power on the computer driving the display, it would be more effective for the application to tell X that it needs a combobox displayed, and let X just carry that message and generate the combo box at the computer that is driving the CRT display (whether you call it the server or the client). IIUC, this is what Fresco is trying to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This was the fundamental premise of </em>NeWS and STEWS -- the application requests that the display perform a graphical operation. The argument with the X community, at the time, was about what graphical vocabulary the display server offered the application. The X community insisted that the vocabulary should be fixed, that specific "extensions" could be installed into the server, and that applications choose from whatever server they were connected to. The NeWS/STEWS community argued that any application should be able to load any vocabulary it wished into the display, and then invoke it. The approach of NeWS was to use <a href="DisplayPostscript.html">DisplayPostscript</a> for both image model and behavior. The STEWS approach (unbuilt, though) was to specify behavior with Smalltalk and us <a href="DisplayPostscript.html">DisplayPostscript</a> as the image model. It looks to me as though Berlin has perhaps rediscovered the principal that it is often compellingly more efficient to move the program to the data then attempt to deliver processed data, especially when bandwidth is more precious than processing power. It appears to me that <a href="DisplayPostscript.html">DisplayPostscript</a> is still a more robust and portable image model than the baroque pixel-oriented approaches we still live with at the moment. --<a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

      <p>
        PS: To argue that there is no room for confusion about the client/server terminology used by X is silly or worse <not sure of the word I want -- non-perceptive, intolerant, condescending, ..., or some combination thereof>. In the ordinary user's mind, the client is the computer he is using (touching, typing into, viewing the display) -- the server is a remote computer that is providing data or services for his computer. At some level of detail, the opposite terminology of the X definition of client/server is technically correct in some contexts, but just needlessly confuses everyone -- why bother -- we should be making things easier, not more difficult.

        Don't bet on it. Berlin embeds the toolkit into the server. Imagine where X11 would be today if it had embedded 1980's widgets into the server. Do you really believe that X11 would have survived with Athena widgets?
      </p>
      <p>
        [This is a misunderstanding.  In Berlin, a toolkit is just an object factory.  Since objects are network transparent, it doesn't need to be part of the display server, though it should be colocated on the same machine.  In fact, had Berlin started with Athena widgets, it would have been easy to derive the GTK+ interface from the Athena interface and then transparently replace the toolkit for all applications without recompiling anything.  It's also easy for an application to supply completely new widgets, though that could incur more network roundtrips.  However, Berlin is dead (again), so none of this matters any more.]

        "If it needs to render, e.g., a combobox on a CRT display, the application generates the bits and X carries them from the application to the display."
      </p>
      <p>
        Wrong. X11 has high-level graphics primitives and display-side storage, and it is getting display-side stored vector graphics.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wrong again.  X11 is a middle-level language of sorts -- it has the graphical rendering sophistication of a good dialect of BASIC, but not much more.  The raw primitives are based on that of Postscript, but unlike Postscript, you cannot define your own functions for the display server to interpret on your behalf.  There is no "high level" capability of any kind.  When drawing a combobox, for example, X11 sees a list of commands to execute (draw a white line here and there, draw a black line here and there, use polyfill to draw a down-ward arrow, and we're done).  Considering that most combo-boxes are only 16x16 pixels (if that) even on large, color-deep displays, and considering how much space each graphics command takes, it very often <strong>is faster</strong> to just transmit the dang bitmap than it is to draw it using vector commands.  I can't help but notice how, in <strong>most</strong> usage scenarios (but not all), using VNC is just plain faster for accessing a box remotely than X11.  This is particularly true when using a cable modem with limited upload performance.  --SamuelFalvo

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I'd like to clarify, for those who might mistake my intentions in the previous paragraph.  I am not against the X11 protocol, and in fact, I rather like its overall architecture.  But nearly all of the common, every-day complaints that people have against X11, the protocol, etc. could be ameliorated if X11 were provided with an <em>extension</em> that allowed applications to upload commonly used graphics commands.  Kind of like <a href="LispMacro.html">LispMacro</a>s or SQL stored procedures.  We're already doing this with Javascript in today's web browsers.  It cannot be that hard to get working in X11.  Just an idea.  :) -- SamuelFalvo

      </p>
      <p>
        Postscript's imaging model was never in doubt--it's a great imaging model, provided you have the resolution and color depth to display it; what sucks about Postscript is the language. Fortunately, X11 now has the Postscript imaging model without the language (the defacto-standard Render extension). Same, incidentally, for Macintosh, which also got rid of the language and adopted PDF instead.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Postscript and PDF are completely orthogonal technologies.  PDF is awesome at describing static renderings.  But that's about all it's good at.  When you're running an <em>interactive</em> and highly dynamic environment, putting the display server on the same machine as your application, you can harness the local IPC mechanism for break-neck fast inter-process event notification, bitmap transfers, etc.  In this case, your programming language replaces Postscript as it passes static images around to the display server.  But when you've got a bottleneck in your IPC, that model breaks down <em>very</em> fast indeed.  Now, to handle user interaction with acceptable levels of performance, you now need the ability to manipulate these static display descriptions right on the display server itself.  This just <em>screams</em> for a language at least as powerful as Postscript. -- SamuelFalvo

        "To argue that there is no room for confusion about the client/server terminology used by X is silly"

        Of course, there is room for confusion. But if you called the <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a> what it actually is called, namely the "DISPLAY server", you would not be confused.

        Over X11's design decisions have stood the test of time. All its contemporaries are dead, while X11 has been able to keep up with changes in tastes, imaging models, toolkits, and hardware (all the while remaining backward compatible). GUIs built on top of X11 are every bit as modern as those built on MacOS or Windows.

        [X11 has its problems, but 99% of the people who complain about it, and about 99.9% of the people who complain about the X11 <strong>protocol</strong>, have never studied the protocol in question, so typically the two sides of the discussion are talking past each other. Nor has X11 stood still over time, so implying that it is 25 years behind the times implies lack of knowledge of enhancements made over time.]
      </p>
      <p>
        [The impressiveness of certain apps, like GTA3, doesn't mean such things are impossible under X11 with direct rendering and good vendor drivers, they're just expensive to develop, and for the most part companies don't see enough market share under Unix/Linux.]

        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           People who object to the low-level nature of X (and the C implementation of xlib), and want to replace it with something "higher-level"; often something which will require use of some non-mainstream programming language of which they are an advocate.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           People who are still upset about NeWs (or similar systems) losing out in the marketplace, and wish to rewrite history.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           People who think that because X can (and was originally designed to) support low-level graphics hardware from the 80s and early 90s; that it must <em>not</em> be able to support modern hardware.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           People who saw an ugly GUI on a Linux/UNIX box once (using Athena widgets or something else which is similarly godawful) and thus believe that X is inherently ugly.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           People who have used X without a proper session manager/UI toolkit (e.g., Gnome or KDE), noted that their apps behaved differently, and think that X is inherently unusable.

        More precisely, you need to differentiate the different and separate layers of a graphics architecture:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The display driver -- something that simply pushes instructions to the GPU and bitmap data to texture RAM.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The composition engine -- for composing lines, circles, polygons, rendering fonts, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The network protocol and GUI toolkit. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The 3D and physics engine.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All four parts are absolutely necessary and at the same time are built from different principles and use completely different APIs.
      </p>
      <p>
        X tries to meld all four into one steamingly monstrous pile of crud. While this is a typical approach for a college sophomore term project like X, trying to build a modern system capable of "supporting GTA3" on top of X is simply laughable to anybody with any experience in the industry at all.
      </p>
      <p>

        <li>
           Sorry, but no. The above things are absolutely necessary for <strong>some</strong> things, like a good 3D game, but the total number of things that X11 is used for is far broader than that in one sense, and X11 doesn't even pretend to support a physics engine, so saying that X rolls all that together misunderstands X11.
        </li>
        <li>
           Also, when I say that doing a game like GTA3 with X11 is possible, I specifically mean using the direct rendering interface that was added as an extension to it (direct rendering is always how best performance is achieved for the fast graphics on all platforms), and that was architected, designed, and implemented primarily by commercial companies, not by random hobbyists, so you're making lots of assumptions that are factually incorrect. -- Doug

        <em>It should be pointed out that X has most of these things, in a well-defined place in the </em>SoftwareStack. Low-level bit-twiddling with your frame buffer, GPU, or whatever-else is handled in the <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a>. X provides many low-level 2D primitives for things like lines, circles, etc. The Render extension, once an add-on but now part of X, allows server-side composition of more complicated documents, including full support for modern scaleable, anti-aliased fonts. <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a> handles 3-D rendering; done in HW on platforms that support it; or on the server in SW if the hardware doesn't have good 3-D acceleration. The network protocol is a strength of X; the asynchronous nature of the X protocol makes X usable even over high-latency links. Numerous good GUI toolkits exist on top of Xlib (a common complaint is that X doesn't force a particular app framework on the user, instead it gives the user a choice; hence the <a href="KdeVsGnome.html">KdeVsGnome</a> situation). As Doug points out, X doesn't have a "physics engine"; but that's probably not a major liability.<em></em>

      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't had much experience with the Mac, but I do consider DirectX a better alternative to X. (Though it has its own problems, of course.) That said, if somebody took the time to refactor X, throw out old cruft and integrate extensions and third-party libraries into the standard core, it just might work as a viable alternative. Oh, and the frame buffer driver must reside in the kernel; I consider this to be a major blocking point for X adoption. -- <a href="IvanTkatchev.html">IvanTkatchev</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why must the frame buffer driver reside in the kernel? For performance reasons? Seems to me if you want direct access to the hardware, then mmap()ing it into user space - which is what X does. For "normal" X clients, the frame buffer is mapped into the server process. For DRI, the clients can mmap it directly.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Keeping the graphics subsystem out of the kernel is rather nice for system security/stability. When Microsoft released Windows NT 4.0; system stability went down compared to NT 3.5. One major reason is they moved the frame buffer support into kernel space; with the attendant result that buggy drivers and the like were now in kernel space and thus able to crash the whole system. X server crashes generally don't bring down Unix boxes. (That does assume that users know how to change virtual terminals and/or log in remotely; as the primary UI may be hosed).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you aware that every other single driver resides in the kernel? Microkernel designs and whatnot are nice, but all important consumer OSs (including various Unixes) that I am aware of are not microkernels.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyways, your comment perfectly highlights the incredibly braindead design decisions of X. (Read: complete lack of any semblance of architecture.) The framebuffer/VRAM driver needs to be completely separate from the graphics engine, living in separate spaces; the framebuffer needs to be part of the kernel, whereas a graphics engine like X is simply a user process. The only way to crash a framebuffer driver is by crashing the GPU, and there is no way a user process could accomplish something like that through sending commands to the composition library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course X, in their infinite wisdom, decided to act on opposing principles and amalgamated all the code they could get their hands on into one huge mass of a spaghetti-code super-user process. Brilliant, what can I say. -- <a href="IvanTkatchev.html">IvanTkatchev</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        These things are not "necessary" - rather, they highlight how a proper graphics architecture stack must work. You can ignore the last 25 years of industrial experience that made modern graphics possible and persist in bolting new ugly hacks on top of old ugly hacks, (c.f. "direct rendering" or whatnot) but please be aware that in doing so you basically lag several years behind decent architectures in features while at the same time costing significantly more and requiring disproportionately larger resources.
      </p>

        The Unix crowd that is living in an arrested-development fantasy of 1970's hardware "boxen". Like it or not, modern "application servers" and "office productivity machines" are running on modern hardware, and supporting modern hardware means absolutely supporting things like GPUs. Currently, it is still viable to emulate a 1970s-fantasy-land just to satisfy Unix bigots, but there will come a time when paying through the nose to placate bigotry and ill education will become unprofitable. And at that point Unix will die, unless there comes along someone smart enough to understand reality. Unfortunately, for most "geeks" wearing their unixness as a badge of merit is more important than solving real problems efficiently. Such is life, and I don't really want to dedicate my life towards the goal of saving Unix. It is high time for progress already anyways. -- <a href="IvanTkatchev.html">IvanTkatchev</a>

        <em>I think you've missed my point, which is that the majority of applications for which Unix/Linux/*x boxes are used do not require "next generation GPU technology." Indeed, many Unix boxen are run headless in racks. Do you plan on plugging a 27 inch plasma screen into every 1U rackmount server so the computer room techs can reconfigure Apache in full 3D? Do you believe </em>'every<em>' application demands high performance graphical capability? The world, in fact, does not consist solely of games, simulators, and scientific visualization. There is a big place outside of these domains, and most of it is non-graphical -- let alone something that demands "next generation GPU technology." Certainly modern hardware will come with such things on-board, but will it be needed for anything except displaying a minimal UI? For data processing and serving (I'll make a wild guess that's the majority of Unix boxen are doing) X is sufficient for the task and nicely handles the common case where the host is headless and the display is geographically remote.</em>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           lessen computational load (imposed by the modern-day gaming industry, first set off by Wolfenstein 3D.  Prior to this game, the <em>most</em> you'd find on a VGA card was a 2-D blitter, with a level of sophistication barely exceeding that used in the Commodore-Amiga, and even then, <strong>only</strong> in high-end video cards intended for CAD work),
        </li>
        <li>
           promote good parallelization practices (imposed by the modern-day gaming industry, otherwise 60fps or better at detailed resolutions wouldn't be possible; prior to this market, the only way you'd find hardware-accelerated OpenGL was on multi-thousand dollar SGI workstations, for use in <strong>science</strong> applications, and in the high-end video post-production industry), and, in the end,
        </li>
        <li>
           for making computing more efficient (imposed by modern-day gay-as-heck eye-candy UIs, but only because they appeal to those suckered in by hollywood effects and, you guessed it, those who play high-powered games on their PCs.  Remember, "sex sells.").
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        No matter how "minimal" your UI is, it will <em>always</em> run more effectively on a GPU; after all, two processors is always better than one. The point is that modern computing is moving towards modern hardware architectures (read: advanced parallelism) and Unix is quickly losing pace thanks to bigotry and failure to understand basic industry practices. -- <a href="IvanTkatchev.html">IvanTkatchev</a>

        [Also, you are simply factually incorrect. First off, modern GPUs <strong>are</strong> supported with X11 (go look at Nvidia's site, for instance, amongst many other places that prove similar points). Secondly, consider that no practical GPU (read: ATI or Nvdia) is as generally capable as a general purpose CPU, which means that GPUs <strong>CANNOT</strong> run an entire UI by themselves.]

You can't run an entire GUI on a GPU. Now it sounds like you agree with that, so perhaps it was just an unfortunate phrasing.
        </li>
        <li>
           As for your middle point: It certainly is true that many kinds of graphics displays, including many <strong>parts</strong> of GUIs, will perform better if GPUs are supported. But X11 <strong>does</strong> support GPUs. And as Dave said below, the X11 "cost" and "gain" you are critiquing is questionable, for one thing, but actually, too vague to mean anything.

        <li>
           In what way? What hardware do you have, and what access is X preventing you from accomplishing? And why do you suppose that is? If the answers to the first two questions are reasonable and the answer to the third question is "because my chipset vendor refuses to support X11 themselves, nor will they publish specs so someone else can write a decent X11 driver", then I suggest the fault lies with your chipset vendor and not with X11.

        Is anyone else bothered by this comparison? It seems rather silly. X may have problems, one of them possibly being the lack of widget standards leading to different applications looking different, depending on the API they use, but that has nothing to do with DirectX vs X. In fact the whole comparison is somewhat meaningless. DirectX is an API for accessing direct rendering capabilities, input devices and the like. In the X world the nearest comparison would be with the direct rendering interface, but even that does not make much sense. A more sensible comparison would be to <a href="SimpleDirectmediaLayer.html">SimpleDirectmediaLayer</a> + <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a>.

        The X11 design breaks a very important principle: <strong>optimize for the most common case</strong>. 99% of the computers display graphics on the local machine. Windows GDI, Direct3D, <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a> are good designs for this situation, while X11 sucks big time. Performance numbers and market forces have spoken and consumers voted with their feet. The rest pro-X11 arguments are largely a matter of handwaving and sheer speculation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The common case is rather optimized (at least on Unix machines): Unix-domain sockets, which the X11 protocol runs over when client and server are on the same machine; is a very fast IPC mechanism. </em>OpenGL is an orthogonal issue--it happily runs on top of X. If you think that the performance bottleneck in a X deployment is the socket layer, you ought to look elsewhere.<em>  Unix-domain sockets are, AFAIK, only used for notifications if you also use the shared-memory extension.  That makes things even faster still!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Pray tell, what do "domain sockets" have to do with pumping texture data to VRAM? Welcome to the '90ies, dude. We have these magical things called "GPU"s now.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Indeed so. And for best performance, as I said above, a high quality 3D game using X11 would use the direct rendering interface, <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a>, or <a href="SimpleDirectmediaLayer.html">SimpleDirectmediaLayer</a>, not domain sockets.
        </li>
        <li>
           Domain sockets are, however, a great way to do normal everyday graphics that don't need the raw speed and the accompanying programming complexity and lack of hardware independence that go along with direct rendering -- the latter is simply inappropriate for all of the other purposes.
        </li>
        <li>
           There's a myth that domain sockets in X11 are slower than other possible approaches, but this is in fact highly dependent on the hardware and OS platform. Some implementations of X11 have used shared memory instead, for instance, and on some platforms that was faster, but on other platforms it was slower (there's always the cost of synchronization on top of the shared memory itself). -- Doug
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You miss the issue. X lacks any concept of architecture. The issue of using or not "domain sockets" resides in a completely different and separate architectural layer. (c.f. above.) -- <a href="IvanTkatchev.html">IvanTkatchev</a>

        <em>On modern Windows machines; most graphics rendering is done in the kernel--which also requires a context switch.</em>
        [[ Actually, that's false. Windows rendering requires only a privilege elevation, from user to kernel mode, which is far cheaper than a context swap. The most expensive thing about a context swap is the TLB flush -- the VM hardware has to dump all of its cached VM mappings and rebuild them on each context swap. This does not occur with U/K or K/U transitions. Thus, Windows GDI U/K/U transitions cost quite a bit LESS than even a single process-to-process-and-back context swap. -- <a href="ArlieDavis.html">ArlieDavis</a> ]]

           So, one context switch on Windows versus how many on Linux/X11? Is it 4, 5 or more? I don't know how happily OpenGL runs on top of X11 (<em>very</em>), but certainly OpenGL vendors don't submit their OpenGL performance results obtained by happily running on top of X11. And by the way, if you have an <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a> already, which is a way better contract between the client app and the graphics provider than X11 could ever have hoped to be, why would anyone want to run OpenGL on top of X11?

        <em>One other longstanding problem with Linux is chipset manufacturers who don't support Linux with drivers.

The only difference is that Mac OsX hackers afforded to start with a clean sheet of paper and they ditched X11 without blinking, while Linux hackers live on a dime, so that's why they have to suffer the iniquities of X11.<em></em>

        [What is the claim here, that there is an alternative for Unix workstation users? It's not just about Linux/BSD hobbyist home users, after all. What alternative is that? I don't see that a difference of opinion constitutes "trolling".]

        <li>
           The claim was that X11 is broken by design, and this is known for a long time (longer than TheUnixHatersHandBook, who just happened to have made it popular). What constitutes trolling is to contest the fact that the designers of <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> ditched X11 from their architecture, based on the presence of an X server in their distribution (that guy is bypassed by most <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> applications). Or to claim that every major video card manufacturer maintains X drivers. Or to imply that people who think that X design is broken don't know what they're talking about. Or to claim <strong>without any concrete facts</strong>, that X suffers of no performance problems, when performance problems related to X are well known and documented, and there's no known X station that can compare with a similar hardware running Windows. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               X11 is broken: it is known that X11 has problems, anything beyond that is open to discussion.
            </li>
            <li>
               Mac OS X vs. X11: yes, but that's just a matter of emphasis. Mac OS X is a fusion of older Mac OS, which naturally never included X11, with <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a>, which as you pointed out, started with a blank slate. It is interesting that they bother to include X11 at all, considering that; some users want it, despite various aspects in which the native OS X stuff is superior. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Major video card manufacturers: Those who decide to market to Unix/BSD/Linux maintain X11 drivers. Many do not decide to thus market, and it is absolutely true that not all major manufacturers support X11 -- if some phrasing above implies otherwise, it is wrong.
            </li>
            <li>
               Implying that people who critique X11 don't know what they're talking about: perhaps I overstated the percentage, but note I said they don't know the <strong>protocol</strong>, my point being that X11 is a large subject, and most looking at it casually don't know that. I know the X11 protocol (and the Xlib internals, etc etc), and my observation over the years is that most critics do not, and hence inappropriately lump together a dozen subjects rather than taking them one at a time. If you personally do, then I will apologize to you personally. If you prefer not to say one way or the other, note that I did not claim you fall into that class, just that in my experience, that's largely true of people in general.

               X suffers no performance problems: as a flat claim, that is purely false, you are right, but the topic is nontrivial. Does it suffer fewer performance problems than people usually think? Yes. Does it depend on details? Yes. Are there some really fast X11 apps on some platforms? Yes. Does X11 always win speed contests? Hell no.
            </li>
            <li>
               No X11 platform is as fast as the fastest Windows platform at graphics: this sort of thing obviously changes over time. Once upon a time, the SGI workstations certainly outperformed all Windows platforms, and they integrated IRIS-GL with X11. This year, I really don't know, you may be right. No doubt you're right when it comes to game performance. Is it true for scientific visualization using OpenGL on all Unix workstations? I don't know, but that seems less certain (and OpenGL, note, is an X11 extension in some cases, not always just a complete alternative, which is one of the complexities of the topic).

           What is the alternative for Unix workstation users? If you count Mac OsX as Unix, then you can see there are alternatives. If you don't count OsX as Unix, than the lack of alternatives is attributable to the high barrier of entry that discourages independent open source developments and the need to maintain compatibility with older apps. If you refer to Sun, HP, SGI engineering workstations, those are disappearing species specifically because Wintel provides <strong>more</strong> horsepower and <strong>cheaper</strong> horsepower at that, the X11 may be part of the problem but it can be argued it's not the worst of the many problems killing the high end Unix workstation species. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Mac OS X as an alternate for Unix workstation users: A nice one, if switching to Apple hardware is an option, but you can't just ignore e.g. all of the Sun workstations in the world. The point is that, unless one is willing to switch to PC or Apple hardware, then the Unix workstations have just one primary graphics solution, X11.

        </li>
        <li>
           You can keep your opinion that X is nice and good all you want, but to classify the people who think the opposite into the stupid categories you put above <strong>is trolling</strong>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               I thought it was the other guy you accused of trolling, but in any case, I'm trying to say that people who don't understand the X11 protocol will be "talking past" those who do, was the way I put it, and that's not trolling, that's just common sense.

               If you rephrased each of your sharp critiques into a simple statement of issue, rather than insisting that what you had the final word on the topic, then each each could be addressed one at a time, as I just attempted to do. -- Doug

        I was unclear about one of my major points in the above: this page's title includes the word "protocol", but there's extremely little discussion of X11's <strong>protocol</strong> per se here, and what little discussion there is, is not only wrong but also essentially completely uninformed.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sounds like we need to talk about specific <a href="XwindowServer.html">XwindowServer</a> implementations.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The rest of the discussion is about things that are not necessarily related to X11's <strong>protocol</strong> at all (except that some have expressed the clear but unsubstantiated opinion that perhaps it shouldn't even exist). There's a lot concerning the inappropriateness of X11 for top speed highest quality 3D games, and that is partially true, but not completely true, since those who say so are apparently unaware of the direct rendering interface, yet any criticism of X11 in this area should single that out directly for a technical critique.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly there seems to be a misunderstanding of <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a> <strong>versus</strong> X11, whereas actually it has been incorporated <strong>into</strong> X11. So has e.g. <a href="DisplayPostscript.html">DisplayPostscript</a> (which does indeed have some very nice features, and like Tom, I was sad when Sun's NeWS failed the marketing war). Etc, etc, etc. X11 has a vast number of extensions, and certainly has not stood still for 20 years.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I keep saying, X11 does indeed have problems (from the start, I've always been unhappy with the sheer size and also clumsiness of the overall API), but it also has strengths that are misunderstood by non-X11 programmers.
      </p>
      <p>
        And then finally, even if it <strong>did</strong> completely suck, there is no complete replacement for it suitable for the same range of purposes on Unix/Linux systems, and telling people to change their hardware platforms and OSes just doesn't cut it; on those platforms, it will not be dead unless and until there is an alternative.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that one of X11's strengths is that it is uniquely platform independent, and that is not similarly true of any of X11's competitors on any platform. To miss this point is to miss the entire point of X11 from the beginning of time. -- Doug

        I know little of the internals of X11. My opinions of it have been formed mostly as an end user. Every instance I've worked with has seemed slow and clunky compared to other window systems on similar or identical hardware. It's hard not to conclude that the fault lies in X itself and not specific implementations or uses of X. Can anyone point to modern X implementations that don't suffer by comparison with Windows? -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>

        <em>I'm currently running Suse 9.3 on an AMD Athlon 64 of respectable-but-not-great speed. X runs fine. KDE runs fine as well; my only complaint is that </em><a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> takes forever to start up; which I suspect has little to do with X. Unfortunately, X often gets blamed for things which are not really its fault (such as slow load times for applications, poorly-tuned virtual memory systems, inefficient dynamic loaders, etc). The Linux community (and this means both the KDE and Gnome camps, as well as those working on distros, the Gnu toolchain and the kernel itself) could do quite a bit to improve the performance of interactive GUIs on Linux. I don't think that scrapping X itself is the answer. At any rate, the situation has improved quite a bit in the last couple of years; there's a night and day difference between my previous PC and my current one. Part of that may be <a href="MooresLaw.html">MooresLaw</a>; but part of that is improvements on the SW side. Of course, all of this is anecdotal evidence and speculation; but your experiences are also anecdotal.

        Is that XFree86? What graphics card? How does it compare to Windows? Ignore start up times and look at basic responsiveness. I agree that X is "fine" compared to X a few years ago, but it never seems "fine" compared to Windows today. -- EH

        [At the moment, I'm using an ancient HP OmniBook XE2 with a PII 400. I have Fedora Core 4 on one partition and XP Pro on another. I mainly use it to do 'net things or program in Java using Eclipse, so I can use either XP or FC4. I have no particular operating system bias -- as far as I'm concerned, from an OS architecture point of view the similarities between XP and Linux far outweigh the differences. Yet I prefer to use FC4 for two reasons: (1) The vast gaggle of utilities, applications and goodies that come pre-installed with FC4 make it worth enduring the relatively slow start-up time and sluggish <a href="OpenOffice.html">OpenOffice</a> load-time. (2) The fonts look better under FC4. The difference in graphics performance between XP and FC4, on the built-in Silicon Motion Lynx EM, is not sufficiently different for me to notice, let alone make me choose one OS over the other. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>]

        Interesting. Do you notice a difference between Java Swing apps and native Windows apps? -- EH

        I'd like to hear about that, too. Also, I'm surprised that fonts in general look better under FC4; I'm aware that they <strong>could</strong>, but historically there are issues about which particular fonts are included in a distribution, so I'd like to hear more about that, too. -- Doug

        [Java Swing apps are noticeably sluggish compared to native Windows apps and, for example, GTK apps under FC4. I wish I could recall which <a href="RedHat.html">RedHat</a>/Fedora release significantly improved the font quality, but I can't. It's been there for a while, for some unknown value of "a while". If you want to see what I see, go to <a href="http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/FC4Desktop/">http://shark.armchair.mb.ca/~dave/FC4Desktop/</a> and tell me whether that's better, worse, or the same as XP.
