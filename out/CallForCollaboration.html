        Call For Collaboration
      </p>
      <p>
        The wiki media is perfectly suited for collaboration. A <a href="CallForCollaboration.html">CallForCollaboration</a> can be thought of as similar to a call for papers for a seminar or proceeding. It is a marshalling of resources based upon common interest in the creation of a RealWorldObject or a RealWorldProcess utilizing the synergy of many people working as one, but supplying their several mind sets, abilities, and resources (cf. <a href="CrowdSource.html">CrowdSource</a>ing).
      </p>

      <p>
        Collaboration is hard. A media (even as cool as wiki) is not sufficient to enable collaboration.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A call for papers is a call for individuals to present what they know - easy.
        </li>
        <li>
           A call for collaboration is a call for individuals to work together - hard.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I would like to work together in a synergistic way to create software and value (and I guess I am not alone in this). I am trying this on a local level in Chicago (but even this, with face to face communication, is hard).

        Collaboration requires several principles to be in place:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a unifying purpose
        </li>
        <li>
           a clear understanding of who does what
        </li>
        <li>
           an integration plan
        </li>
        <li>
           unambiguous interfaces
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        There are some other useful principles at: <a href="http://www.communitycollaboration.net/id22.htm">http://www.communitycollaboration.net/id22.htm</a> (<em>this link is broken</em>) Summarized by the following:

           Underlying these rules, always remember three fundamental principals.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Everyone needs to be treated with dignity and respect.
            </li>
            <li>
               Everyone needs to be heard.
            </li>
            <li>
               All of the information needs to be clear for everyone.
            </li>
          </ul>
