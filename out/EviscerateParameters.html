        Eviscerate Parameters
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="JavaIdioms.html">JavaIdioms</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your Java program creates a large number of objects.  These objects themselves contain references to <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a><strong>'s as member variables.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           * *
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each Java object requires an extra two or three words of memory to hold the per-object mutex, the reference to the object's Class and other housekeep data used by the runtime.  A <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> also requires a reference to be stored in the object that is using it, which requires another word of memory.  So compared to a raw value, a <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> has an overhead of three of four words of memory.  This overhead is a problem if you have a very large number of objects -- tens or hundreds of thousands for example. <em>(See </em>ObjectOverheadIsRidiculous.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How can you reduce the overhead of using </strong><a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> instance variables?<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           * *
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many Java <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> classes provide methods for getting a copy the raw representation of the object.  For example, the Date class provides a getTime method that returns the date as the number of milliseconds since the "epoch", as a long value.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, raw values don't have any methods, and so are far from convenient.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Within an object store the raw representation of a </strong><a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> property and expose the property as a <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> at the object's interface.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Declare a member variable to store the property as a primitive type.
        </li>
        <li>
           Define public methods whose parameters are of the <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> type.
        </li>
        <li>
           Methods that set the value of the property should store the raw value of the <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> in the member variable.  (E.g. it should "rip the guts" out of the <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>, hence the name of this pattern).
        </li>
        <li>
           Methods that return the value of the property should initialise a <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> from the raw value stored in the member variable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Example<br/>
        {<br/>
        long _timestamp;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public Date getTimestamp() {<br/>
        return new Date( _timestamp );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public void setTimestamp( Date date ) {<br/>
        _timestamp = date.getTime();<br/>
        }<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The use of this pattern saves 3 or 4 words per field, which can be important if you are creating thousands of objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        However:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The implementation of the class is made more complex, which will make maintenance harder.
        </li>
        <li>
           Coupling between the class and the class of the <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> is increased.
        </li>
        <li>
           Use of the pattern decreases performance, because <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a><strong>'s need to be created every time the property is accessed.  This is not much of a problem with modern JVMs, because object allocation requires only a couple of pointer calculations.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In conclusion, only use this pattern if testing has shown that the pattern is 
        absolutely necessary.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="CrossSection.html">CrossSection</a> is a related pattern that uses a similar technique to reduce the memory requirements of an array of objects.

        Two words about the title. <em>Eschew Obfuscation!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't understand?  "Eviscerate Parameters" seems a good description for the pattern. What problem do you have with the title?  Could you explain?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not the one who complained, but I have a problem with the title as well.  "Eviscerate", in the context, seems to be an obfuscated (and unnecessarily gory) synonym for "change the form of".  But the real beef I have is that this pattern seems to have little to do with parameters, but instead with instance variables.  A better title might be "Use Primitive Types in Value Objects", or just "Use Primitive Types Instead of Objects" as the context doesn't seem to matter much--the real point of the pattern is that primitive types are more efficient in terms of memory usage than are Object types. --<a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        How about 'Inline Value Objects' or 'Flatten Value Objects'? -- <a href="TomAnderson.html">TomAnderson</a>
