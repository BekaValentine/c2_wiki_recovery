        Just In Time Reuse
      </h1>
      <p>
        You didn't fall prey to <a href="PrematureGeneralization.html">PrematureGeneralization</a>; you didn't try to write reusable code ahead of time. When you're about to perform <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a>, <em>then</em> you cut it, paste it into a reusable module (class, function, method, whatever), and call it from both the old code (replacing the code you just cut) and the new (where you were about to paste it).

        In <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> we call this SwitchingHats. You have to add some functionality:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           You turn it into a <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>, perhaps the first of many for the story, but you have to start somewhere
        </li>
        <li>
           You ask yourself "What is the simplest code that could possibly work for the current test cases and the new one?"
        </li>
        <li>
           Switching hats: If you can now see a simpler structure for the existing code that will comfortably accommodate the new test case, you forget about the new test case and refactor, keeping all the old test cases running
        </li>
        <li>
           You get the new test case running
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Refactor, refactor, refactor. Refactor some more. Then refactor it a bit. Why not let the <a href="CopyAndPasteProgramming.html">CopyAndPasteProgramming</a> code "age" a little before doing all this? I like the arguments presented in <a href="CodeHarvesting.html">CodeHarvesting</a>; they seem to fit my experiences pretty well.
