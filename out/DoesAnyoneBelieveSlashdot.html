        Does Anyone Believe Slashdot
      </h1>
      <p>
        Does anyone really take anything said at Slashdot seriously? And if so, why? Would, in particular, any regular Wiki reader take them seriously?
      </p>

        I'm not sure if I agree... There are a number of well educated people with experience in the industry that post to Slashdot - usually those who get their posts moderated up to 4+. I find the articles themselves (and the book reviews) are very valuable...  As for the zealotry, remember that these are the people that will be working in industry several years from now.. and their opinions regarding intellectual property & the "revolt against corporatism" do have some interesting points to them.  [many of them wrong, in my opinion, but certainly worth debate]
      </p>
      <p>
        I sometimes worry, however, that the site will just implode upon itself because of the growing belief in its ranks that Slashdot is a centre for political action.

        Personally, I just wish there were an easier way to filter out all the posts that have absolutely zero worth. <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> does cover a lot of cool topics, but I never have enough time to read an <strong>entire</strong> thread.

        FWIW, I am 22 and I've been working in the industry for over 5 years now straight out of high school. While my situtaion is obviously <em>not</em> TheNorm, I wouldn't ever discard anyone's opinion based solely on their age. Unforunately however, you are right Sam... most of the waste comes from them.

        I can't stand slashdot, but being younger than the "average age" of their posters, and myself rabidly anti-microsoft (albeit in a quieter sort of a way), I can't help but think some of the comments on this page are unpleasant overgeneralisations :). -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>

        Well Drew, I'm 22 as well, and have been in industry for about 5 years too.. so you're not alone.  I do feel frustrated in the amount of over-generalizing and judgementalism that is common among our age group (on Slashdot). --<a href="StuCharlton.html">StuCharlton</a>

        Janes Defence Weekly does.  See <a href="http://slashdot.org/features/99/10/07/120249.shtml">http://slashdot.org/features/99/10/07/120249.shtml</a> .

        Oh, there's all sorts of great stuff there. Of course there is stuff to be taken seriously! On the other hand, There is <em>a lot</em> of static, even when you set the <em>threshhold</em> to 3. <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> is a little like wiki ... with a much lower signal to noise ratio. --<a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a>

        What I find interesting about Slashdot is the growing political nature of the site.  Part of me heaves over the unbelievably ignorant opinions thrown in the ring.  I also think, however, that this is perhaps the only major forum for airing this issues out. [if only because the moderation tends to keep the S/N ratio down]
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples of the growing political rhetoric.
        - The DVD CCA / MPAA lawsuit against the authors of the DvdHack, DeCSS.  People are considering boycotts against DVD's.  Readers are joining the EFF and the ACLU.  People are pledging to support the DeCSS's authors legal battle if need be.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Are people listening?  DanGillmor from the San Jose Merc is. [<a href="http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/]">http://www.mercurycenter.com/svtech/columns/gillmor/]</a>  <a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        - The growing "corporatism" vs. "individualism" debate, popularized by JonKatz's op-ed pieces, the SeattleWtoRiots, etc.  I think this debate is in many ways harder to swallow because it really exposes people to how complicated international economics and trade can get.  At the same time however, it is impossible to ignore the corporate trend towards "bigness", as if fat == power. <em>(no, fat = profit, the reason most corporations want to / try to get big, and the power only happens to protect the profit.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Slashdot seems to be afraid of this trend, but they also believe that these corporations will be destroyed by the "Jihad of Open Source" and the revolt of the "proletariat masses" (sound familiar?). 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have an easier explanation:  bigness means slowness. As an example, AOL/Time Warner is going to have a really interesting time generating NEW content, because I hope they don't think they're going to build the world's largest media conglomerate on BugsBunny reruns and back issues of TimeMagazine.  And <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> will at the very least continue to keep these companies aware of the intellectual property debates ahead of us.

        Reading <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> requires some grain of salt:

           The stories are arbitrary selected, with no intention of beeing balanced or "fair". <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> lacks the basic decission making process story/no story which classical media like news papers have (not saying that newspapers are not biased).

           <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> is US biased (<a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>), although <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, and esp.

           Most stories are anyhow only pointers to other publications.

        <li>
           The <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> moderating system is sub-optimal. A recent demonstration showed how one can get a zero-information, totally crap, all made-up, comment to level 5 (almost the highest rate). BTW, it was a fine pice of <a href="SocialEngineering.html">SocialEngineering</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The moderation is as arbitrary as the selection of stories, based on nothing put personal preferences.

      </ul>
      <p>
        And still, this system brings up valuable information to read, interesting pointers to issues going on in the computer industry, and  questions worth to discuss. I would, however, not make <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> my only source of information (as some readers tend to do).

        I agree that <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> has a far lower signal/noise ratio than Wiki.  However, unlike wiki, Slashdot has fairly effective means to filter out most of the noise.  To me, the PPR wiki is about 30% noise.  Raw Slashdot is about 95% noise, but the filtering brings it down to a quite readable level.  (I even read the Jon Katz discussions--some of the threshold 5 posts are reasonable.)  In the discussion referenced above, one of the 13 "good" posts is an excellent summary of UN views on the subject (with a URL for more information), and is better than most "good" wiki pages.  Slashdot has done an amazing job with a community at least 100 times larger than wiki's.  (Slashdot could be better--I particularly dislike the low rating of anonymous "cowards", and the +1 "Karma" bonus seems to be too easy to get.)--<a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>
