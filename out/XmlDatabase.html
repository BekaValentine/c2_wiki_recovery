        Xml Database

      <p>
        An XML "document" modeling a small data set (the equivalent of a handful of relational tables), which can be queried with <a href="XpathLanguage.html">XpathLanguage</a> or <a href="XsltLanguage.html">XsltLanguage</a> to achieve a pattern similar to <a href="LittleDatabase.html">LittleDatabase</a>, but much more appropriate in the contexts in which the latter is often used.

        This term also refers to the <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> of lashing together a <a href="RollYourOwnDatabase.html">RollYourOwnDatabase</a> out of a collection of files written in XML (with an appropriate DTD/schema) and a set of libraries for manipulating XML documents. That XML is a file format/markup language and <em>not</em> a database (nor a particularly good foundation for making one) should be obvious; but many instances of this regrettable <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> exist in the industry.

        I fully expected the first words on this page to be "An <a href="OxyMoron.html">OxyMoron</a>" -- I was part of a project that had this as a <a href="BuzzWord.html">BuzzWord</a>. Oh, the horror -- oh, the humanity! XML makes a serviceable packaging vehicle for bridging disparate databases or carting data around between processing modules, but don't ever let someone sell you on the idea that this <a href="BuzzWord.html">BuzzWord</a> actually has any semantic value.
