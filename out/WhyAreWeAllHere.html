        I thought this page was about what it is we have in common that brings us together on this site, which should be that we are all interested in the <a href="ContentAndCommunity.html">ContentAndCommunity</a> that covers a diversity of subject areas including: <a href="TheTimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TheTimelessWayOfBuilding</a>, <a href="ApplicationDevelopment.html">ApplicationDevelopment</a> and <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>, <a href="ArtOfComputerProgramming.html">ArtOfComputerProgramming</a>, <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a> and <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, <a href="BarnRaising.html">BarnRaising</a>, explore <a href="RoadMaps.html">RoadMaps</a> and so on.
