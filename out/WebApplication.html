        Web Application
      </h1>
      <p>
        An application that is implemented inside a <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a> with most functionality implemented on the server side (<a href="WebServer.html">WebServer</a> or <a href="ApplicationServer.html">ApplicationServer</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        Web applications are often implemented with J2ee (jsp, servlets,...) CGI, <a href="AllaireColdFusion.html">AllaireColdFusion</a>, ASP, and so on.

        Other definition that was here before:
      </p>
      <p>
        The module of the overall application that handles a user session, application flow, Web Page requests, navigation. This is as opposed to the <a href="StoredProcedures.html">StoredProcedures</a>, EJBServer, and JSP Servlets although the JSP Servlets are part of the <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a> technically, in our development environment we keep JSP Servlets separate.

        See <a href="http://virtualschool.edu/wap">http://virtualschool.edu/wap</a> [<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>] for articles and software for WAP, which has
        proven far more productive than perl and/or JSP for my needs at least. Described
        in the May 2001 Dr. Dobbs' Journal. -- <a href="BradCox.html">BradCox</a>

        There are some applicaltions that run completely locally but are designed like <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a>'s. An example is Yandex Personal Search [<a href="http://desktop.yandex.ru/how.xml]">http://desktop.yandex.ru/how.xml]</a> - an utility for local search of files, that runs residentally as a local HTTP server and is accessed by an HTTP link - so it looks like a popular Russian web search engine. Less precise example is DiffDaff [<a href="http://www.cyberpromote.de/software/diffdaff.htm]">http://www.cyberpromote.de/software/diffdaff.htm]</a> - a local file compare tool that produces output in an HTML page.

        I thought a <a href="WebApplication.html">WebApplication</a> was precisely the opposite of the definition given at the top of this page: an application with most of its code implemented client side in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and using HTML/CSS for its UI, not requiring a server to be installed locally.. A web app should not require be able to perform its function with no internet connection, only requiring net access for data or code updates.
