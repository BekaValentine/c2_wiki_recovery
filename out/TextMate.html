It is developed by MacroMates <a href="http://macromates.com/.">http://macromates.com/.</a>  It comes with code markup for most programming languages, and a built in integration with subversion and X-Code's compilers, and it looks sexy.  It is highly extensible with macros and "snippets" which are like shell expansions.
