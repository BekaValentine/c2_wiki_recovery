        Primitive Obsession
      </h1>
      <p>
        A generalization of <a href="NoStrings.html">NoStrings</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Smell</strong>: Primitive Obsession is using primitive data types to represent domain ideas. For example, we use a String to represent a message, an Integer to represent an amount of money, or a Struct/Dictionary/Hash to represent a specific object.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The Fix</strong>: Typically, we introduce a <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a> in place of the primitive data, then watch like magic as code from all over the system shows <a href="FeatureEnvySmell.html">FeatureEnvySmell</a> and wants to be on the new <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>. We move those methods, and everything becomes right with the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I introduce a <a href="ValueObject.html">ValueObject</a>, I expect it to become "attractive code", meaning literally a class/module that attracts behavior towards it as new methods/functions. For example, instead of scattering all the parsing/formatting behavior for dates stored as text, introduce a DateFormat class which attracts that behavior as methods called parse() and format(), almost like magic.  -- <a href="JbRainsberger.html">JbRainsberger</a>

      <p>
        <strong>The Tools</strong>: Some languages make this easier or harder on you. For example, in Ruby, it's easy to start with a String and then upgrade it to a proper Object, since everything is DuckTyped. However, even with its flexibility, it can be a good idea to <a href="AvoidHashySyntaxInRuby.html">AvoidHashySyntaxInRuby</a>.
