        <a href="RelationshipManagement.html">RelationshipManagement</a> competencies have always been a required skill for people involved in <a href="ProjectManagement.html">ProjectManagement</a>. And in this age of <a href="OutSourcing.html">OutSourcing</a>, the awareness and sensitivities are being expected of other IT staff as well.

        In "The New Competencies in IT" , at <a href="http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=4525&t=technology,">http://hbswk.hbs.edu/item.jhtml?id=4525&t=technology,</a> a CIO was quoted as saying "You need staff who can deal with relationships and create the right network of contacts..". IS staff , at all levels, need competencies that allow them to bridge business and technology.
      </p>
      <p>

        And yes, <strong>technical skills</strong> are needed. The article said "they have become a base".
