        <a href="TestFirstUserInterfaces.html">TestFirstUserInterfaces</a> recommends instrumenting the <a href="GuiLayer.html">GuiLayer</a>, and its tests, with more than just assertions. <a href="GraphicalUserInterface.html">GraphicalUserInterface</a>s should record animations of activities during tests. AcceptanceTestFrameworks can command <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a>s to record a gallery of results.
      </p>
      <p>
        These tests cases could also have assertions, in their edit fields. The fields are arbitrary XML, transcluded into <a href="MiniRubyWiki.html">MiniRubyWiki</a>:

        That wiki page tests <a href="FractalLifeEngine.html">FractalLifeEngine</a>'s OpenGL skin. However, someone changed the numbers from the defaults, at <a href="http://flea.sourceforge.net/reference.html,">http://flea.sourceforge.net/reference.html,</a> and hit the Test buttons.

        Because nobody should test every bit of GUI glitz, escalating the review of GUI usability aspects provides FeedBack.

        When a tested GUI such as a game has animation, one can collect a sequence of snapshots, merge them into an animated GIF with <a href="ImageMagick.html">ImageMagick</a>, and upload this. If you stay under your browser's megabyte limit for GIF animations...

        The bench version of <a href="MiniRubyWiki.html">MiniRubyWiki</a> transcludes XML, generating an instant GUI that edits each top-level XML node as a form. This permits incredible flexibilities as the nucleus of an AcceptanceTestFramework. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, suppose each node has an attribute called <em>title</em>. (The screenshot above uses <em>name</em> in this role.) The current version of MRW will convert a <em>title</em> of "snowFlake" into <a name="snowFlake">, providing the ability to link directly to any test case in a long list:
      </p>
      <p>
        (click): <a href="http://www.zeroplayer.com/cgi-bin/wiki?TestFlea#tropism">http://www.zeroplayer.com/cgi-bin/wiki?TestFlea#tropism</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can e-mail that link to a colleague, and say "please inspect, or execute, this test".
      </p>
      <p>
        You can also write <a href="http://www.zeroplayer.com/cgi-bin/wiki?TestFlea#tropism">http://www.zeroplayer.com/cgi-bin/wiki?TestFlea#tropism</a> directly into the wiki, because it's still a wiki around the transcluded XML part. However, wikis shouldn't contain external links to themselves if they can avoid them.
      </p>
      <p>
        To fix this, in <a href="MiniRubyWiki.html">MiniRubyWiki</a> you build a page called <a href="TestServer.html">TestServer</a>, and you write for the first line RemoteLink:<a href="http://myTestServer/wiki.rb?">http://myTestServer/wiki.rb?</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Thenceforth, <a href="TestServer.html">TestServer</a>:TestPage#snowFlake will link to a specific test, by name.
