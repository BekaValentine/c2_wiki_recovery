        Those in this culture perceive the <a href="UnixCulture.html">UnixCulture</a> as insensitive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Insensitive? I take offense at that remark. We are very sensitive. Especially to case. We just hide it behind a shell of indifference by not crashing at every little thing. We bottle our feelings, then explode (haven't you ever seen the mess that is a crashed Unix machine?). How dare you call us insensitive.</em>

        Programs which have been ported from the <a href="UnixCulture.html">UnixCulture</a> tend to have descriptions and manuals which assume familiarity with the <a href="UnixCulture.html">UnixCulture</a> and do not provide explanation for <a href="UnixCulture.html">UnixCulture</a> terms.

        Actually, many Unix programmers and users are not crazy about the Unix Aesthetic. The book <a href="TheUnixHatersHandbook.html">TheUnixHatersHandbook</a> was written recently about what torture it is to use Unix (by a Unix guru no less). -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>, mostly quoting <a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        A real conversation I had some years ago:
      </p>
      <p>
        DR: <em>What platforms are you targeting?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anon: <em>Oh. Everything.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        DR: <em>What exactly do you mean?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anon: <em>Windows 95, Windows NT (version x and y)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        ... reminds me of the story of the little boy over on <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>.

        Three things: You forgot *BSD, which is still popular. Your statistics depend on what market you are talking about. And I don't think it matters much, as long as your cost/earnings ratio is low enough. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        Sam overlooked <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> too. Not that I like it too much and yes, it was almost dead some time ago, but nonetheless there are markets where the 'everything' from above would certainly be <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a>. -- <a href="MarkoSchulz.html">MarkoSchulz</a>

        And of course he forgot that Linux controls 62.73% of the server market!

        I remember seeing an article complaining that Linux wasn't ready for the enterprise. It wasn't too keen on W2K, either. They suggested that you needed a real mainframe OS for an enterprise. So I don't feel so bad... -- <a href="RobMandeville.html">RobMandeville</a>
