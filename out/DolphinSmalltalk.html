        Dolphin Smalltalk offers a family of Windows-based Smalltalk products that includes a free or low-cost version.  It's very Windows-oriented, allowing you to build GUIs with real Windows widgets, etc.  It's nice, reasonably efficient, builds small images, and is small enough to make it less daunting than <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a>.  A choice worth considering if you're a Windows buff.  (Editorializing by <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>, not associated with <a href="ObjectArts.html">ObjectArts</a>.)

        How funny. When I first saw the title of this page, I assumed the topic was the Smalltalk-80 system that ran on the old Xerox 1100 workstations, affectionately known as "Dolphins". The Dolphin was the third Xerox computer that ran a Smalltalk VM, after the Alto and the Dorado (also known as 1136). In the early and mid-1980s, Xerox actually sold Dolphins running Smalltalk (and applications written in Smalltalk) to several customers, making it the first commercial Smalltalk product platform. --<a href="JoshuaSusser.html">JoshuaSusser</a>

        Yes, we realized that when we were creating Dolphin. However, the name actually came from this little adage that I bandied about in-house during the development of the product:

        "Dolphins have been around for quite a long while but it's only relatively recently that everyone has come to appreciate how brilliant they are. A bit like Smalltalk really.. " --<a href="AndyBower.html">AndyBower</a>

        If dolphins really were brilliant, they would've invented Smalltalk. :)

        What I love about Object Arts's marketing is that there are actually no dolphins in sight. Maybe <em>you're</em> supposed to be the dolphin, having fun with your brightly-coloured ball? It's an appalling thought...

        <em>Appalling, or appealing?</em>

        From what I heard and read, dolphins were terrestial animals a long time ago.  Eventually, they must have gotten sick and tired of other terrestial creatures, acquired a taste for seafood, and decided to go back in the water.  I love seafood, and think that might have been a very smart move!  F Razo

        March 2008 - <a href="ObjectArts.html">ObjectArts</a> has finished major development of Dolphin. In particular, <a href="ObjectArts.html">ObjectArts</a> will not be moving Dolphin from the now-"legacy" <a href="WinThirtyTwo.html">WinThirtyTwo</a> API to <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a><em></em>' new <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> platform. However the Professional Edition and the trial version remain available and supported. According to Bower, the demand for <a href="DolphinSmalltalk.html">DolphinSmalltalk</a> is too small to make the major effort of a <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> port worthwhile for <a href="ObjectArts.html">ObjectArts</a>.

        (<a href="ObjectArts.html">ObjectArts</a> had originally announced in 2007 that the commercial version would no longer be sold: <a href="http://www.object-arts.com/content/news/developmentDiscontinued.html">http://www.object-arts.com/content/news/developmentDiscontinued.html</a> But the announcement proved a <a href="GoodCareerMove.html">GoodCareerMove</a>: it produced an uptick of interest in Dolphin. <a href="ObjectArts.html">ObjectArts</a> is willing to agree to a buyout of Dolphin or the sale of source licenses, but only for substantial amounts of money: <a href="http://www.object-arts.com/content/blog/2007Sep07.html">http://www.object-arts.com/content/blog/2007Sep07.html</a> )
