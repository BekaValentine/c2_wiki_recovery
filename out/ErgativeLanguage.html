        Ergative Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        In an <a href="ErgativeLanguage.html">ErgativeLanguage</a>, the subject of an intransitive verb and the object of a transitive verb are considered to be the same case and are marked in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indo-European languages, including English, are NominativeAccusative languages. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider:
      </p>
      <code>
        The man opened the door.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The door opened.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In English <em>man</em> is Nominative, whereas <em>door</em> is nominative in the second sentence and Accusative in the first.
      </p>
      <p>
        In an <a href="ErgativeLanguage.html">ErgativeLanguage</a>, <em>door</em> has the same case (Absolutive) in both sentences, <em>man</em> in the first sentence is Ergative.
      </p>
      <p>
        It takes a lot of brain-warping to switch from one system to the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Basque, Georgian, and the Yucatec (Mayan) languages are ergative.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been suggested that <a href="IndoEuropeanLanguage.html">IndoEuropeanLanguage</a> was originally ergative.
