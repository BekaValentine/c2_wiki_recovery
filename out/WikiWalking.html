        <strong>[From </strong><a href="WalkingTheWiki.html">WalkingTheWiki</a>]<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wiki is a Way. We are Walking The Wiki, not surfing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Surfing implies being carried by some sort of imperative, unknowable force. The waves are marvels of physics, and have a volition of their own, unfathomable by human minds (without much preparation.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The Wiki is something that carries you, just as waves do, but unlike the waves, it is unlikely to dash you onto the rocks unless you set yourself a course there. You're in control, I'm in control, we're all in control. You don't even have to take control, because how can you take something you already have?
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, it's procrastination all the same.
