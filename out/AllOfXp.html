        All Of Xp
      </h1>
      <p>
        The standard line of XP pundits is that if you aren't doing <a href="AllOfXp.html">AllOfXp</a>, you aren't doing XP. I'm not just talking about <a href="IfXpIsntWorkingYoureNotDoingXp.html">IfXpIsntWorkingYoureNotDoingXp</a>, but about previous comments (by <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>) about how when <a href="ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation.html">ChryslerComprehensiveCompensation</a> stopped doing certain practices <em>extremely</em> they felt they were worse off.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of people out there are in the midst of trying to get XP adopted in their organizations, and one thing that commonly holds them back is that by the above reasoning, they can't legitimately say they've "done XP", even if they do have legitimate experience in all or most of the XP practices.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can be frustrating, especially if they have not been on a full XP project <strong>per se</strong>, but have done <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing, <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, etc. I.e. they have done all the practices but not all together as XP itself.

        <em>By definition</em>, if you're not doing all of XP, you aren't doing XP. <a href="AlmostExtremeProgramming.html">AlmostExtremeProgramming</a> isn't, not even doing <a href="XpLite.html">XpLite</a> nor <a href="XpJr.html">XpJr</a>. There is no negotiation. You may want to read some pages in <a href="CategoryAdoptingXp.html">CategoryAdoptingXp</a>. <a href="IsXpSynergistic.html">IsXpSynergistic</a>?

        <dd>I've observed that when C3 goes off-process, productivity drops substantially. This is consistent with our claim that XP is synergistic. It is also consistent with Alistair's work discussed below. The inquiry behind this page relates to an Extreme Project needing, quickly, to see that it's off track, to determine whether it's off-process or under-process, and to fix things. The page isn't about failure, it's about tracking. It's about humans and their flaws. It's about me and mine. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a></dd>

        I think those pages in <a href="CategoryAdoptingXp.html">CategoryAdoptingXp</a> are pretty hopeless. See my short discussion with <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> about <a href="TransitioningToExtremeProgramming.html">TransitioningToExtremeProgramming</a>. If XP can't apply to itself, XP is deeply confused. <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, all that <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> that XP preaches you. Refactor in small steps, after all; that includes your own process. <em>Don't</em> do <a href="AllOfXp.html">AllOfXp</a>. Solve the only the problems that you actually have. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've read most of the stuff about <a href="TransitioningToExtremeProgramming.html">TransitioningToExtremeProgramming</a>, including your comments, and I disagree that it is hopeless. Specifically, I <em>have</em> made progress towards <a href="AdoptingXp.html">AdoptingXp</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, I haven't yet done <a href="AllOfXp.html">AllOfXp</a>, so I don't know whether you're right about it being an unnecessary quest. I think I'll try anyway and see for myself. It's certainly better than what we're doing now at my organization. -- <a href="RobHarwood.html">RobHarwood</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think the <em>pages</em> are hopeless because they seem to keep reiterating, "Do it all right away!" I'd prefer much more pragmatic suggestions. -- ss
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree that many of the pages take this stance, and I've been frustrated by them since they don't give examples of how to start. The intent of the <a href="AdoptingXpPatternLanguage.html">AdoptingXpPatternLanguage</a> is to provide such pragmatic suggestions to adopting one practice at a time. Whether or not this is successful really depends on the contributors. The more examples, the better, I think. -- <a href="RobHarwood.html">RobHarwood</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree, and I wish you well. By the way, my purpose of adding the naysaying text was so I cut it down as being useless. I <em>don't</em> agree with it. Nor do I respect it. It's bad methodology. XP advocated like that--the official party line, mind you - is a solution imposing itself on your problems. This only creates more problems. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sunir, I can't believe I am agreeing with you again but you couldn't be more right. In the half-dozen projects/places I have tried XP, I have never found anyone willing to adopt the whole thing. I *did* find people interested in trying *one* idea at a time and adding it. For instance, </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. People seem to like <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and will adopt them after being convinced. It took me a month to convince a major software development company to adopt <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s. That took showing them evidence. There was no way they were going to adopt the whole thing. I tried to write a letter to <a href="SteveMcConnell.html">SteveMcConnell</a> at IEEE Software and he said that XP lacked evidence and empirical data. I do believe that it is an OK thing to adopt the practices one by one. Forget the "purity" solution. -- sg<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've done XP twice now. Each time I gave up after about 15 minutes and did something more practical. Right now I'm the <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>ing freak at work, despite my naysaying in <a href="UnitTestsReconsidered.html">UnitTestsReconsidered</a>. I don't think people really get my position. <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        XP isn't recursive, and it isn't a cure-all. It is a way to write software given today's technology and the business realities of many companies today. Those who think that XP can do anything should consider <a href="ExtremeSurgery.html">ExtremeSurgery</a>. It doesn't apply to itself because it isn't a way to write ways to write software. -- <a href="RobMandeville.html">RobMandeville</a>
