        It's probably in one of those links but the following exchange between <a href="GeorgeBernardShaw.html">GeorgeBernardShaw</a> and a young <a href="WinstonChurchill.html">WinstonChurchill</a> is one of my favourites.  Shaw had written a new play which was shortly to open in London.  He wrote to Churchill along the following lines:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I have pleasure in enclosing two tickets for the opening night for you and a friend - if you have one."
      </p>
      <p>
        To which Churchill replied:
      </p>
      <p>
        "I regret that I am not available on the opening night and am returning the tickets.  I would however be grateful for tickets for the second night - if you have one."
