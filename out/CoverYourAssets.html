        Problem:  This <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a> is very similar to the <a href="AmbiguousViewpoint.html">AmbiguousViewpoint</a> Anti-Pattern except that both the design team and management are now in armed camps ready to sue each other over issues that could have been resolved by a strong manager.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution:  Dump the design and management team members who won't let go of the issues and start over!  Sacred Cows make the Best Hamburgers! - Mike Addison

        Trivia:
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually Sacred Cows are usually near starvation. It is assumed that god provides for them, so humans don't. Sacred Cows are lean and sinewy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sacred Cows are sacred so they can not be eaten, so you can plow the fields when the weather improves; in context: be careful what you throw away, some customs are there for a reason, which you will only discover months later when you need to plow by hand.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, in urban India cows have an important secondary function as part of the garbage removal system.
