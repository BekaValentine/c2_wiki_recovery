        Comparison Shopping Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm looking for a <a href="ComparisonShoppingWiki.html">ComparisonShoppingWiki</a>. Several times now I have gone shopping for stuff, making notes along the way, comparing vendors, etc., and it has occurred to me that others could benefit from (and update) the stuff I have done. I'd like to find a semi-free wiki to host his --- a least until I get my own wiki server back online; the thing I am shopping for today is internet presence. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Any pointers to a site to host a <a href="ComparisonShoppingWiki.html">ComparisonShoppingWiki</a> appreciated. Tables required, if not a more general script. 
      </p>

        We are in the process of creating just that.  The site will be <a href="http://www.shopwiki.com/">http://www.shopwiki.com/</a>  There will be a public beta this summer (July/August 2005).  If you go to the site now you can add your e-mail address to notified when it launches.  We are testing/demoing our wiki technology at <a href="http://www.littlewiki.com/">http://www.littlewiki.com/</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I envisage a <a href="ComparisonShoppingWiki.html">ComparisonShoppingWiki</a> as containing topics that are things that you might like to buy
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Internet access
        </li>
        <li>
           DNS service
        </li>
        <li>
           swimming pools
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Such topic pages would be linked to discussions of various criteria, the various things to consider.
        That sort of data might last longer.
      </p>
      <p>
        They would also be linked to tables comparing vendors against each of the criteria.
        Table support in the wiki would therefore be a minimum requirement for a <a href="ComparisonShoppingWiki.html">ComparisonShoppingWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        More general scripting support to generate comparison tables might be desirable.
        Large tables, with many columns and rows, are unwieldy.
        Therefore, it would be nice to allow the viewer to specify what criteria he
        wants displayed, and which vendors,
        and then to generate a table of the same.
        Vendors as rows or columns would, of course, be selectable.
      </p>
      <p>
        The actual data to be compared would probably be a self schematizing database
        like XML, organized by vendor at the top level.
        Arbitrary fields and distinctions can be added.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Security or access control may matter to a <a href="ComparisonShoppingWiki.html">ComparisonShoppingWiki</a>:
        else, if popular, unscrupulous vendors might take it over.
