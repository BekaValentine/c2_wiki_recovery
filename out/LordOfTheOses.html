        Recently one of my friends, a computer wizard, paid me a visit. As we were talking I mentioned that I had recently installed Windows XP on my PC. I told him how happy I was with this operating system and showed him the Windows XP CD. To my surprise he threw it into my microwave oven and turned it on. Instantly I got very upset, because the CD had become precious to me, but he said, "Do not worry, it is unharmed." After a few minutes he took the CD out, gave it to me and said, "Take a close look at it." To my surprise the CD was quite cold to hold and it seemed to be heavier than before. At first I could not see anything, but on the inner edge of the central hole I saw an inscription, an inscription finer than anything I had ever seen before. The inscription shone piercingly bright, and yet remote, as if out of a great depth:

        'I cannot understand the fiery letters,' I said in a timid voice. "No but I can," he said. "The letters are Hex, of an ancient mode, but the language is that of Microsoft, which I shall not utter here. But in common English this is what it says:

        <dd>One OS to bring them all and in the darkness bind them</dd>

      <p>
        It is only two lines from a verse long known in System-lore:

        Origin uncertain, but possibly by Darcy Brockbank, who posted the following version to comp.sys.next.misc Mar 4 1993:

        Seven rings for the Mac lords, with their System 7 <br/>
        Nine rings for vapor Pink, doomed to die <br/>
        One OS to rule them all, one OS to find them, <br/>

        One of the older (1998) versions to have an added hex string for the inscription used the following hex: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          F6E65204F5320746F2072756C65207468656D20616C6C2C204F6E65204F5320
        </li>
        <li>
          F2066696E64207468656D2C0A4F6E65204F5320746F206272696E67207468
        </li>
        <li>
          D20616C6C20616E6420696E20746865206461726B6E6573732062696E6420
        </li>
        <li>
          D0A
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        ...which makes sense, whereas the other hex I don't get.
      </p>

        Very nice.  Have you ever really thrown a CD in the microwave before, though?  They spark a lot, and then cool patterns emerge on them.  So this is almost semi-plausible.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>
