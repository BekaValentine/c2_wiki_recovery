        Trademarking Xp

        What does that mean to the term XP? Will they have a trademark on it? Will we have to find another name? --<a href="HaskoHeinecke.html">HaskoHeinecke</a>

        Hey guys -- <strong>We</strong> are the newcomers to the "Extreme" party. There were "Extreme" sports, ExtremeSkateboarding, <a href="ExtremeCooking.html">ExtremeCooking</a>, Extreme everything ... long before there was "<a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>". Let's not get so arrogant that we think Microsoft is pointing at US when they choose a name -- we should be so lucky! -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        That wasn't my point. <em>We</em> never claimed a trademark on the term, which Microsoft may well choose to do. And they might want to enforce it upon <em>us</em> consultants, coaches, trainers, authors, etc. while nobody did this to "Extreme" sports, yet. Besides, this is not about the term "Extreme" but about the acronym "XP". --hh

        Why don't we just get a trademark on XP as 'a name for a software development methodology'? If MS doesn't have the trademark yet, the XP community certainly has precedent. -- <a href="RobHarwood.html">RobHarwood</a>

        It's always a matter of money. I don't know how the contesting stage works, but I'll bet it costs money. If you've already got the trademark things are generally a lot easier. -- anon

        MS grabbed the following trademarks on January 19, 2001:
      </p>
      <code>
        "Microsoft Office XP"<br/>
        "Office XP"<br/>
        "Windows XP"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Used singularly, "XP" is currently being used in describing jewelry, water squirting toys, building materials, computer peripherals, nutritional supplements, and a medical apparatus. (reference <a href="http://www.uspto.gov).">http://www.uspto.gov).</a>

        Perhaps Addison Wesley (XP publisher) is in the best position to trademark the XP graphic and contextual use?  I'm not privy to the publishing arrangement between Kent and AW.  --<a href="MichaelLeach.html">MichaelLeach</a> (not a lawyer :-)

        In Norway, there is a new line of no-name brand products called XP (how can a no-name brand have a brand name?).  I have a bag of XP Cornflakes next to my computer at home.  -- <a href="JohannesBrodwall.html">JohannesBrodwall</a>
