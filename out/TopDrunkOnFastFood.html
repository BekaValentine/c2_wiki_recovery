        Top Drunk On Fast Food
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> keeps mentioning things like burgerkinging, promotional action figures, bargain lunches, on the cheap, ketchup (and condiments?), etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        It sounds like <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a> is drunk on fast food, or maybe he is just joking.
      </p>
      <p>
        This page is simply here to document all of <a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>'s fast food references (As they are humorous and, useful, ehm, heh).

        That vinegar in the ketchup, can be toxic to the brain! Go easy, Top - and balance with <a href="KombuchaTea.html">KombuchaTea</a>.

        <em>Bwwuuuuurrrrrrrrpppppp</em> - There's your data dump. It didn't "pass" type safety validation -- top
      </p>
      <p>
        {What you guys don't understand is that Top goes to 'burgerking', adds some salt and ketchup, <strong><em>then eats the tables!!!!!</em></strong>}
      </p>
      <p>
        As part of my diet, I need to switch to thin tables instead of wide ones. Otherwise, I'll need a 64-bit belly soon.

        Actually, if you don't order fries or onion rings, then the nutrition value of fast food is about the same as medium-cost restaurants.

        <em>You call that </em>'fast<em>'?!? I eat really fast food -- carrots. Carrots are fast, really fast -- you don't even have to cook 'em! ;-></em>
