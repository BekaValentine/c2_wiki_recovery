        Gross Exaggeration

      <p>
        <a href="GrossExaggeration.html">GrossExaggeration</a> is a communication that is blown out of proportion. It is different from a viewpoint that is misleading due to contextual matters (need a better term for this instance).
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a viewpoint that is valid to some extent, but carried to an extreme that degrades its validity (or usefulness, see <a href="TautologicalDefinitionFallacy.html">TautologicalDefinitionFallacy</a>).

        A complains about B as temperamental, whereas in real life B is usually a jovial person, except in the instance observed by A where A initiated an unwarranted verbal attack. This is a case of <a href="GrossExaggeration.html">GrossExaggeration</a>, as well as misrepresentation because A deliberately provoked B into the responses observed.
