        Answer All Questions
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> children aged 3 and up are inquisitive. This is usually fun - but sometimes, you get tired of the unending <em>why</em> game, or the 'why' is just too complex to explain, or you are embarrassed by a question that touches 'adult' topics, or you just don't want to answer.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong> you don't know how to answer your child's question (or don't want to). Like a lot of parents, you are tempted to lie, or evade the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces:</strong> as a parent, you are the authoritative source of information for everything the child doesn't find out by herself. Your child trusts you absolutely; undermining that trust deprives your child.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> answer truthfully, even if you don't answer the question. If you don't want to answer, for whatever reason, say so; if you don't know, say so; and if you think the answer is too complex, say the simplest thing that could possibly answer the question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting context:</strong> trust is preserved, and in addition your child learns that you are not always inclined to answer questions, which will incite her to find things out by herself.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, you'll also encourage her to ask more questions. ;)

        My father used to make me sit by his side when I asked a question, as he proceeded to look up the subject matter that I had just asked about in our Encyclopedia. I soon picked up the habit of looking it up myself. This doesn't work all the time, but at least it instilled a life long habit of self-education and research.
