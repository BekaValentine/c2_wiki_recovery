        Write Only Page
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <strong></strong><a href="WriteOnlyPage.html">WriteOnlyPage</a><strong> is a page that people put information on, but feedback and questions on the original content get ignored. It's particularly annoying when the original page <em>could</em> be construed as some sort of advertising or </strong>AwarenessRaising, and one possible result is that people who visit the page and take an interest get annoyed at being ignored.

        The page does, of course, mostly likely get read; it's just that the people who put it there originally seem to have treated it as "WriteOnly". This partly harks back to <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> where people got annoyed by posters saying "Please respond by email as I don't read this group." The standard response was that <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> is not a WriteOnly medium, and it seems to me that in the same sense neither should be the Wiki. If you put up a page, it should be because you care about the subject and are willing to pay attention to it. Wiki works best as a collaboration, not a MeTalkYouListen environment.
