        A companion of the <a href="MozillaFirefox.html">MozillaFirefox</a> browser, <a href="MozillaThunderbird.html">MozillaThunderbird</a> is an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> email client that comes with a <a href="RssViewer.html">RssViewer</a>. <a href="GetItFirstFromHere.html">GetItFirstFromHere</a> if you want an alternative to <a href="MicrosoftOutlook.html">MicrosoftOutlook</a> or <a href="MicrosoftOutlookExpress.html">MicrosoftOutlookExpress</a>.

        <strong>Q:</strong> Can it be configured to use <a href="HotMail.html">HotMail</a> and Yahoo mail servers? 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Not out of the box, but the third party apps that slurp down hotmail and yahoo mailboxes could probably expose it as a POP feed.  Would take some hacking to do though, since Thunderbird doesn't implement the full range of MAPI that many of the windows versions of these adaptors use.
      </p>

        <strong>Q:</strong> Has it got any extension mechanism similar to <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> XPI? I would be particularly interested in linking it to <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Its extension mechanism <em>is</em> XPI (XPCOM actually, xpi is the file extension that means "XPCOM Interface").  There are a scant few extensions, and it might be instructive to grab some of them and tinker with them.  Be sure to share any results that you can -- documentation is otherwise so scant that aspiring hackers need the examples.
