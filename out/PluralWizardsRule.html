        Plural Wizards Rule

      <p>
        You can do crazy hack A, or you can do crazy hacks B through Z, but put any two of them in the same space and they'll fight each other.
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           RVM vs. any other shell tricks. Since rvm affects basic shell pieces, such as the `cd` command, it's likely that you'll run into odd with other tricky shell invocations. For example, running `:!something` in vim isn't smooth.
        </li>
        <li>
           Metaprogramming.  Usually you can get away with it cleanly for one or two things, but it's going to get crowded pretty fast. See: <a href="StumblingBlocksForDomainSpecificLanguages.html">StumblingBlocksForDomainSpecificLanguages</a>

           Pentadactyl is a wonderful, but invasive UI change to Firefox. It works very well, that is until you visit a site that attempts to make an invasive UI text widget (such as <a href="http://jsfiddle.net">http://jsfiddle.net</a> ). Two wizards. Same room. Big fight.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AspectOrientedTheHardWay.html">AspectOrientedTheHardWay</a> when somebody else in the same process is also doing it. Hope you both got the binary patching protocol exactly right.
        </li>
      </ul>
