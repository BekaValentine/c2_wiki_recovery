        Incentivate Gossip
      </h1>
      <p>
        Do not say negative things about people, specially about your boss but motivate others to publicly speak negatively about their own bosses. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example you can privately speak bad of someone, so that the victim feels safe to speak bad about his own boss. Then you make him repeat it in public, by his mistake of course.
