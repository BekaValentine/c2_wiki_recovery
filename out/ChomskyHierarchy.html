        Chomsky Hierarchy
      </h1>
      <p>
        A hierarchy of languages in terms of the power of the
        machine needed to recognize (parse) them and the complexity of the grammar that describes them:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Type 3: recognized by <a href="FiniteStateAutomaton.html">FiniteStateAutomaton</a>, Described by <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s and right linear grammars.  <em>Note that the programming construct commonly referred to by the name </em><a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s are <strong>not</strong> equivalent to a true <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>; the construct that came out of various Unix tools (sed, etc.) and is now commonplace in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and other programming languages, can handle many grammars which are Type 2 and Type 1.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Type 2: Context Free recognized by PushDownAutomaton (that is, an non-deterministic <a href="FiniteStateAutomaton.html">FiniteStateAutomaton</a> with a stack), described by <a href="BackusNaurForm.html">BackusNaurForm</a> type grammars.  <em>There are many sub-categories of Type 2 grammars; a non-deterministic </em>PushDownAutomaton is more powerful than (that is, can recognize more languages than) a deterministic PushDownAutomaton.  On the other hand, a non-deterministic <a href="FiniteStateAutomaton.html">FiniteStateAutomaton</a> is <em>not</em> more powerful than a deterministic <a href="FiniteStateAutomaton.html">FiniteStateAutomaton</a>; nor is a non-deterministic <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> more powerful than a deterministic <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Type 1: Context-sensitive recognized by linear bound <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>, described by grammars that include the context in the LeftHandSide of the definitions
        </li>
        <li>
           Type 0: Recursively enumerable, that needs a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>, described by really horrible grammars:-( /Ahem: These are described by a PhraseStructureGrammar.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>And there are languages which are are not </em><a href="RecursivelyEnumerable.html">RecursivelyEnumerable</a>; there is no computational model (which we can build or approximate) which can recognize such a language.<em> Also, if a set is not denumerable, can it fall under the definition of a language?</em>
