        Initially, I wasn't satisfied with the <a href="AtsSystemMetaphor.html">AtsSystemMetaphor</a>.  We had trouble coming up with one, and "settled" -- or so we thought -- for a warehouse metaphor:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>ATS is like a bunch of warehouses.  Users pull objects out of warehouses, change them, and then put them back into warehouses.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We chose that metaphor because we had already been instinctively using it to describe the classes that mediated between our objects and the database.
      </p>
      <p>
        As I said, I was initially unhappy with the metaphor.  Now that I look at it some more, though, I'm realizing that it's quite apt.  ATS doesn't have any real <a href="BusinessRules.html">BusinessRules</a>; all it ever does is pull data out of the database, present it to the user with a nice interface, and then save the changes back into the database.  There's some relationships between objects and there's some security, but the warehouse metaphor does a nice job of covering the basic innards of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this point, I'm not sure if the <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a> is supposed to describe the <em>internals</em> of the system, or the <em>user's</em> view of the system.  I'm guessing it's supposed to convey the overall architecture of the system (i.e., internals), so in that case the <a href="AtsSystemMetaphor.html">AtsSystemMetaphor</a> seems to be about right to me.
