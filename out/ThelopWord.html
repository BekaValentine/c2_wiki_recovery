        Thelop Word

      <p>
        <a href="ThelopWord.html">ThelopWord</a>s are the basic building blocks of the <a href="ThelopLanguage.html">ThelopLanguage</a>. They are used to form <a href="ThelopName.html">ThelopName</a>s (sometimes called <a href="ThelopSentence.html">ThelopSentence</a>s) according to the <a href="ThelopRule.html">ThelopRule</a>s following the ideas of <a href="LanguageOrientedProgramming.html">LanguageOrientedProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ThelopWord.html">ThelopWord</a>s work according to their meaning in <a href="ThelopWordClass.html">ThelopWordClass</a>es. There are currently four word classes: Objects (O), Actions (A), Properties (P) and Modifiers (M). In general a <a href="ThelopWord.html">ThelopWord</a> may belong to and work in one or more <a href="ThelopWordClass.html">ThelopWordClass</a>es. But this is not true for ThelopActionWords which belong to and work only in the ThelopActionClass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most <a href="ThelopWord.html">ThelopWord</a>s are either short English words or abbreviations of English words. They have been chosen carefully to avoid collisions and to build an efficient vocabulary.

        In the <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> each construct is a word. So it might be an ideal candidate to experiment with the <a href="ThelopLanguage.html">ThelopLanguage</a>. -- fp

        I know little Forth and never thought about using THELOP for it. Perhaps because the terse naming ideology of Forth doesn't fit well to the much longer <a href="ThelopName.html">ThelopName</a>s. Technically it would be trivial to redefine Forth words to fit into <a href="LanguageOrientedProgramming.html">LanguageOrientedProgramming</a>, e.g. :
      </p>
      <code>
        : TosPrintDrop . ;<br/>
        : TosPrint dup . ;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        but somehow I doubt that Forth people would like it. On the other hand using names *completely* describing functions would reduce the need to look into the documentation for stack effects and the potential naming problem (I think there must be a problem to find 5000+ consistent names for tomorrow's APIs) would disappear.

        <em>Perhaps because the terse naming ideology of Forth</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What ideology is this?  If ANSI Forth is at all a consideration, then remember that the core wordset documents only <em>common usage</em> of historical words.  Literally all other Forth wordsets are packed with long-hyphenated-names-just-like-Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        That being said, one can say that Forth coders have adopted an ad hoc convention -- <em>the more you type it, the shorter it becomes.</em>  Note that this is just like a spoken language, where the more it's said, the shorter it becomes.  For example, <em>is not</em> becomes <em>isn't,</em> and <em>television</em> becomes just <em>TV</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        As such, the most primitive of all Forth words tend to be atomic: @ ! + - * / AND OR XOR IF THEN ELSE DUP DROP SWAP OVER etc.  The only really shorthand here is @ (fetch) ! (store) and DUP (<strong>dup</strong>licate).
      </p>
      <p>
        Coding conventions involving atomic concepts also abound.  Many words originally intended for use <em>internally</em> to a program, but which are used often, have short names.  <# # #s and #> come immediately to mind.  */ is perhaps an exception -- it is short for * / (the difference being that it uses a double-precision intermediate representation, which means */ is more precise than * and / in succession).
      </p>
      <p>
        Conventions then find themselves using <em>common</em> symbols as prefixes.  # maps to <em>number of</em>.  / maps to <em>size of</em>.  I personally use & to map to <em>address of</em> (from my C experience), though this is generally not necessary.  So, for example, most Forth systems have a <em>terminal input buffer</em> (TIB) of a certain size (/TIB), with a certain number of characters inside it (#TIB).  Some might argue that this bears much resemblence to Hungarian notation, and there is some argument for it.  However, back in the day when Forth systems rarely allowed more than 8 characters in a word's name, adopting conventions like this were commonplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I prefer to use longer names for most things, generally following a distinctively Smalltalk-ish look and feel.  But, I will regularly adopt the use of short, concise, almost symbolic names for use with <em>private</em> words.  There are generally less than 12 lines of code separating their definition from their use(s), so there is no problem at all with context.  And with <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> being a <a href="HyperStaticGlobalEnvironment.html">HyperStaticGlobalEnvironment</a> language, there is <em>zero</em> problems with re-using names either.  The name <strong>p</strong> might draw a pixel to the screen in one part of the code, while in another it could establish a pipe with another process.  Of course, I never intend you to call such names yourself; I'd rather you called drawPicture_toSurface_ or spawnProcessUsingCommand_ (note I use underscores in the order parameters appear on the stack; again, just another <a href="CodingConvention.html">CodingConvention</a>).
