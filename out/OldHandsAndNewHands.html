        If a program committee is the same year after year,
        it is difficult for a conference to move forward.
        It develops its own ruts and blind spots, and becomes
        isolated from mainstream progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yet a committee learns pragmatic techniques and practices
        that are part of the culture.  Part of this is the culture
        of program committees, which is remarkably regular across
        software conferences.  But part of this is the culture of
        the conference itself.  This culture serves the industry
        and must be preserved;  yet, it must change with time as
        the industry changes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>  Staff the program committee so that at
        least half are old-timers, who can carry on the traditions
        of the conference through time.
        These experienced members also tutor the newcomers so they
        can support the next generation.
        This experience brings solutions to tactical problems that
        would be lost on the newcomers.
      </p>
      <p>
        A program committee is a culture, and much of the
        culture of a conference derives from the program
        committee culture as it is handed down from year to
        year.
