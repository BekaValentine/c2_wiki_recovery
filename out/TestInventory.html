        Test Inventory
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you collect tests automatically using a <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> (and even if you don't), it's also a good idea to use a <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a> to detect if tests have silently disappeared. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a> is, well, a list, or inventory, of tests that have run in the past, and which can be expected to run in the future. Usually, a test framework implementing <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a> will record the names of tests run, e.g. into a file, say CurrentTestInventory. This file will be diffed against the ExpectedTestInventory.
      </p>
      <p>
        If no changes, all seems well.
      </p>
      <p>
        If tests have been added, the diff will report this, and the human running the tests has the option of making the CurrentTestInventory into the ExpectedTestInventory.
      </p>
      <p>
        If tests have been accidentally deleted, the diff will report this, and the human running the tests can go look for the missing tests, and why they were not run.

        I started using the <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a> pattern after bugs in my <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> resulted in tests that were written not being run. Also after I accidentally deleted some tests while editing, not noticing it for a while because I was using a <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> and not paying attention to the <a href="TestSuiteConsistencyCheck.html">TestSuiteConsistencyCheck</a>.

        <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a> is a <a href="TestSuiteConsistencyCheck.html">TestSuiteConsistencyCheck</a>.

        <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a> is related to <a href="ProjectBillOfMaterials.html">ProjectBillOfMaterials</a>.

      <p>
        <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a> to some degree goes against <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. To add a new test, you have to code it, and then add it to the <a href="TestInventory.html">TestInventory</a>. This is two steps, but the latter is (or should be) automated.
      </p>
      <p>
        It guards against accidental deletion of tests by requiring the same two steps, first deleting the test, and then confirming. You're unlikely to do both by accident.
