        What some unit testing tools display when all unit tests run
        successfully.  For example, here is <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>'s GUI after a successful test run:

        The term "green bar" can also be a reference to
        the wide paper with alternating horizontal green and white stripes that we used to get our printouts on. (<a href="ImissGreenBar.html">ImissGreenBar</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        See also: GreenBarPolicy and <a href="RedBar.html">RedBar</a> (the opposite of a <a href="GreenBar.html">GreenBar</a>).

        Before you do anything risky with code, you want to get yourself to a green bar, or a known state.  When you're working under a green bar, with good tests, you can change code around, and improve it, more easily than when you're working in an unknown state.

        At work we sometimes say we're "yellow-diffing a green bar."  Our check-in script does color syntax highlighting of our diffs, and the subtractions from code show up in yellow.  If you have a check-in with a net reduction in code, it's a yellow diff.  If you yellow-diff a green bar, you've managed to make code smaller without losing any fuctionality.  Obviously, you never want someone else to yellow-diff your green bar, so once you get to a green bar, you immediately look to refactor your code.

        In the old days of line printers and continuous pin-feed (that is IBM mainframes and the like), the paper had alternating green and white horizontal sections, and was referred to as <a href="GreenBar.html">GreenBar</a> paper. Typical size was 14 1/2 inches wide, 11 inches high.

        It is still available, for example:
