        Optimizing Compilers
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>If you are working in an area with a lot of deep theory (</em><a href="OptimizingCompilers.html">OptimizingCompilers</a>, for example) then XP needs to be modified, at the very least.  YAGNI assumes that you know the theory, and that you use it to tell whether you are going to need it.  --<a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a><em></em>

        I have all these math and computer science degrees, and I'm glad of it. But it seems like the only thing I actually use is my ability to think. OTOH, I don't write many optimizing compilers any more.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I was wondering: when we look at the average large C program, and we test it with compiler optimization off and with it on, how much of the improvement comes from the <strong>deep theoretical optimizations</strong>
        , and how much from the <strong>obvious and easy</strong> temp-caching, local register optimization ones that we can all see how to do?

        I was at a talk last month by James Gosling, in which he ticked off the 
        compiler optimizations going into <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a>. He wound up listing 17 or 
        so recent PhD theses (on things like how locality of reference affects
        garbage collection algorithms etcetera) and concluded "It's pretty far 
        along on the rocket-science scale."
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, I haven't seen the hot spot code. But if we take
        Sun's numbers as somewhat real AND we assume that the Symantec JIT
        is mostly doing the obvious stuff listed above (both reasonable 
        assumptions, imho) then deep theoretical optimizations can give you 
        orders of magnitude improvement.

        According to Sun's whitepaper on <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a>, a lot of the difference between 
        <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a> and traditional JIT compilers is due to the fact that the traditional 
        approaches don't get you that much in Java. With many of the traditional 
        approaches, the more code you can work with, the more you can optimize it. But 
        methods are typically small in Java. Moreover, most methods are dynamically 
        linked, making inlining problematic. One of the <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a> tricks is to use 
        inlining anyway. The trick is that the compiler will undo and redo inlining 
        when needed.

        I'd like to see some apples and apples comparisons, like what does <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a> do with optimizations on vs off. Comparing one compiler to another has too many other variables.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that so far the comparisons are apples to <em>theoretical</em> oranges! Does anyone know about any hard numbers on <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a>? --<a href="KielHodges.html">KielHodges</a>

        There are no apples to apples comparisons. See

        IBM has the best virtual machines. That's not because they read theses on how to write them: they write the theses. They have several expert teams around the world. Sun's advantage is that they own Java. IBM just does it better. So, what does that say? And what does it say that the same virtual machine maestros got sideswiped by <a href="PocketSmalltalk.html">PocketSmalltalk</a>? (I zinged them with <em>that</em> in the interview. ;) -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

        What I know relies on transitive trust.  When <a href="EliotMiranda.html">EliotMiranda</a>, head VM guy at (then) Parcplace-Digitalk, saw <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a> at Oopsla97, his jaw dropped.  He came back saying "Buy this, it's brilliant."

      <p>
        Compiler optimization is deep magic; I don't know enough to have an informed opinion.  If Eliot (and the other compiler experts I know) thinks it's worthwhile, that's good enough for me.  Your mileage may vary. --<a href="BetsyHanesPerry.html">BetsyHanesPerry</a>

        I don't think Eliot would be fond of <a href="XpForOptimizingCompilers.html">XpForOptimizingCompilers</a>.

        Everyone who does is under an NDA-- <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a> is in deep alpha right now and, AFAIK, in very limited distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem is: <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a> is unlikely to have lots of configurability options-- 
        Gosling stressed that programmers are really bad at spotting the bottlenecks
        beforehand (or knowing what optimizations are likely to provide a substantial
        performance boost). In which case, how do we answer <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>'s question ? -- <a href="WilliamGrosso.html">WilliamGrosso</a>

        Are you serious? It seems that Java's entire premise is that <a href="JamesGosling.html">JamesGosling</a> is smarter than everyone else.

        If you are seriously interested in bleeding edge optimizing compilers, and you want some real numbers to back up what you're seeing, check out the work going on at The University of Washington. Craig Chambers, Jeffrey Dean, David Grove (and others, probably).

        The <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> Project is also worth a look, at <a href="http://self.smli.com/.">http://self.smli.com/.</a> There's a continuing stream of development that starts with Smalltalk, goes through Self and ends up at Cecil/Vortex. <a href="HotSpot.html">HotSpot</a> is another offshoot. For sure, the Sun guys knew about this stuff before they designed Java. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        <em>There seems to be an implicit assumption here that Java was </em>
        <strong>designed. </strong>
        <em>Is there independent evidence of that? And what version of the Java spec is the one that was designed, and what are the others?  ;-></em>

        IIRC, Java was originally meant to be a compiled language for consumer applicances. They first considered <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, but thought it too complex.

        Java doesn't exist on computer appliances yet (after eight years). All the Java cellphones have been recalled or have died at market. What does that say?

        Is this an argument against casting things in stone and code ownership? I gather a small change of language syntax or implementation can have profound effects on how efficient it can be made, and that these effects are hard to foretell. This is when we need XP most. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
