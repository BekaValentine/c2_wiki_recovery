        Nabokovs Lolita
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Lolita</em> Nabokov, V. ISBN: 0679723161 
      </p>
      <p>
        A true masterpiece of English prose writing. One of the best books you will ever read (if you ever do). Witty, stylish without being mannered, challenging, provocative, moving. Some people believe that Nabokov hid within Lolita a complete course on <em>how to write a great novel in English</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A book widely feared an loathed by those who have never read a single word of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        The principal events of the story seem to be a metaphor for Nabokov's relationship with the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a>, his adopted homeland.
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree with all the praise here, fantastic book.  I don't immediately see the connection between Humbert and the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a>, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Humbert represents Vladimir, the other characters represent (aspects of) the US.
