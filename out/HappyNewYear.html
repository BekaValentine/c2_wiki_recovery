        It's just turned 2000 in London (GMT). What a fireworks show (on CNN)! Happy New Year! Remember its bad form to wear 1900s style clothing tomorrow unless you are a COBOL programmer. -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        Wiki seems to be Y2K compliant then :-) I'm amazed that so many people were WikiWatching on the eve of the millennium :-) I thought I was the only one sad enough to be logging in. Obviously a good few <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>(s) out there :-) -- <a href="AlanFrancis.html">AlanFrancis</a>

        Hmm, another unique digital moment that I missed there Dave. As long as you ignore the leading 20. Which reminds me, we're now in HAL territory. Who would have thought that Clarke's IBM-- joke would already feel so out of date? Yet most computer users' experience of "artificial intelligence" still be the doggedly primitive Wintelligence? Miniaturization and money rule as planned, but those "minds not made of meat" that we were promised have done a clever job of disguising themselves as the same old dumb machines, don't you think?
