        Subtitled <em>Liberal Treachery from the Cold War to the War on Terrorism</em>.

        Argues that on foreign policy issues, "liberals" have a tendency to take positions detrimental to the safety and security of the United States (to the point of treason). Has been predictably slammed by literary critics (which will likely be used as evidence of more LeftWingMediaBias). Will be interesting to see the conservative reaction to this one, as Coulter attempts to slaughter a few sacred truths (hey, a <a href="MixedMetaphor.html">MixedMetaphor</a>) - including a spirited defense of SenatorJosephMcCarthy.

        <em>This book seems to be good news for the left - if Coulter's chest-thumping playground taunts are any indication of the current state of conservative political thought. In a recent interview with </em>TimeMagazine, Coulter compared the Democratic Party with the Whigs (an early US political party which collapsed in the 1840s or so), suggesting that they ought to realize that they were no longer relevant (her opinion, not mine) and ought to "go away". I seem to recall that after the 1992 election, in which the Democrats won the White House in a rout over the sitting president (and maintained control of Congress) in an election season that saw the likes of Pat Buchanan spitting his bigoted venom all over the Republican convention, many "liberals" were similarly full of themselves; convinced that conservatism had been discredited.  And we (in the US) all know what happened in 1994.<em></em>

        <em>Despite holding the White House and both houses of Congress; the Republican Party holds a tenuous lead; all three are held by the slimmest of margins. Lots of things - including the economy, the situation in Iraq, various intelligence scandals, the return of significant number of Naderites to the Democratic tent, or even a schism among the Republican coalition - could give power back to the Democrats in 2004.</em>

        Your mouth to God's ear, Scott. And as far as that foaming-at-the-mouth, liberal bashing, hate spewing Coulter discrediting her own bad self, well - you go, girl!
