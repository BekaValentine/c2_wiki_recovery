        Chrysler And Steady State
      </h1>
      <p>
        One suggestion I venture to make is that C3 went into steady state, as defined in <a href="ImpactModelling.html">ImpactModelling</a>, soon after <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> and <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>' arrival. This was a great achievement in six weeks. In other kinds of project though - front office trading room systems and internet product development for example - one can have a harder time getting to steady state, for the positive reason that the business value side is richer and more unpredictable. -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

      <p>
        <em>Anyone done both? Everything looks simple when you've never done it. Getting into steady state is probably more a matter of choice than anything about the domain. -- </em><a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a><em></em>
      </p>

      <p>
        I'd say that yes, Objective has been involved in both kinds of project using <a href="EvolutionaryDelivery.html">EvolutionaryDelivery</a>. Really honest case studies are difficult though, for reasons of commercial sensitivity as well as personal embarrassment! You and Wiki have done a great service in opening up so much of C3.
      </p>
      <p>
        I didn't say it was simple to get into steady state and succeed with C3 by the way. I don't buy this, I never have. 18 months of non delivery prior to the adoption (and invention) of XP would suggest otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am saying that in some projects the <a href="SuccessStatement.html">SuccessStatement</a>'s (objectives) are better understood and more bounded than in others and I assume that C3, being a Y2K replacement system, was the better understood end of the spectrum. Such projects are often <em>more</em> difficult to succeed in, in our experience, because you have less room to manoeuver on scope when another variable goes AWOL.
      </p>
      <p>
        I fully agree that getting to steady state has a great deal to do with choice, determination and the belief that it <em>can</em> be done.

        On the other hand I was part of a team of five working in a fund manager running an innovative equity hedge fund at the time of the Russian/Long Term Capital hedge fund crisis in autumn 1998. All the <a href="SuccessStatement.html">SuccessStatement</a>'s for the project changed dramatically in a few days. The key question was: could the software cope?

        I don't want to talk about it. -- rd
