        Creating a large windows application to support a multinational client. (.NET)
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a <a href="SharePoint.html">SharePoint</a> survey for a client along with some fairly hefty analysis of the results.  This is quite an interesting project because it's giving me a chance to explore the various types of connectivity that MS put into the suite this time around.

        Large Windows application with a full team size of 30+ people, of which around 16 are full-time developers, the rest comprising management, test persons, and systems engineers located at our client.

        We're facing issues with having the team distributed across three sites, one of which is over an hour's travel from the other two. We are currently attempting to push aspects of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> into our project, but are facing a great deal of "This is too different, it sounds like a schedule risk" from management. We've managed to get limited <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> to occur, especially for training, and are trying to push for <a href="UnitTesting.html">UnitTesting</a> as our next goal. Too bad the process is about the only thing not covered by the ConfidentialityAgreement.

        This project continues although I've moved on.  It has cleaned up since three of the afore-mentioned managers have been "released".
