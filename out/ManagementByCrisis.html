        Management By Crisis
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ManagementByCrisis.html">ManagementByCrisis</a> is a disease where a manager (intentionally or not) seems to create crisis around them.  This can be done in many ways; the most common of them is to set too aggressive a schedule or an <a href="ArtificialDeadline.html">ArtificialDeadline</a>, but it can be done by shuffling staff and other such things.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The result is that this manager's team is always in a crisis, and they are always saving the team from the crisis, or asking for super-human effort from the team, when really, they knew all along that what they were asking was impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Either way, the manager gets more power, and more resources to get  the job done, and in the end, gets the glory from having, "pulled the project out of the fire."

        I've seen plenty of <a href="FireFighting.html">FireFighting</a>Mode, which is related but not quite the same. Good managers can be forced into <a href="FireFighting.html">FireFighting</a>. That is usually a sign a company is messed up. Last time I ended up in <a href="FireFighting.html">FireFighting</a>Mode I changed employers.

        Don't forget the classic way to create a crisis: claim there's no time to do things the right way.  Pretty soon, there will be even less time, until voila: crisis!  <em>--</em><a href="GeorgePaci.html">GeorgePaci</a><em></em>

        It's also easy for a manager to feel like everything is in a major crisis, since every small crisis might end up on their table. The inexperienced leader may then panic, throwing the whole organization into <a href="FireFighting.html">FireFighting</a>Mode and ruining every chance to handle the everyday problems as they appear.
      </p>

        Another way to create crisis is to not have a schedule, other than a customer delivery "go live" date, and to have no measurements and no checkpoints in place to determine at any point whether or not the project is on schedule.    The manager can then declare the project "running late" at any point, creating crisis, or perhaps more commonly, to not know the project is late or not until it is clear to even the most junior coder that the project is behind.  At this point of course, the project will never be able to make the original delivery date, even if that date was achievable. Instant crisis, don't even have to add water.  -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        I <a href="HaveThisPattern.html">HaveThisPattern</a>, except without even a customer ship date any better than "around Q4." Often, the end result is months of talk-talk followed by massive panic because Q4 is almost over and the thing's not working and we don't know when it will be. Fortunately, <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopment.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopment</a> gives me some tools I can use at least within my own domain, to ground me and keep me sane.

        Let me pose a question. Is our reward system in the corporate world set up to
        inspire any other mode of behavior? Has anyone ever received a bonus or an 
        award for quietly planning and then meeting the plan precisely with no fanfare
        and no sudden explosion of activity visible to all? Let's face it - heroism
        is rewarded, and you can't be a hero if you don't have a crisis. For all the
        lip service given to careful planning and scheduling and methodical success, if
        you can't frame your silhouette against the flames of a crisis fire, you
        won't get noticed. Until the incentives change, habits won't change. Besides,
        I think it's probably easier to do it this way...in the beginning.

        It's sometimes thought that a team that consistently delivers on time and within budget isn't trying hard enough:
        If they were really challenging themselves with aggressive schedules and promised features, they'd sometimes fail.
        So apparently "easy success" can be some as evidence that you're sluffing off.

        And, as we in the corporate world know, sometimes failing is okey-dokey with
        our sales and marketing people, so long as we're pushing the envelope, right?
        To add to Jeff's point, I can remember being told that any organization having
        enough people and time to do a job safely was running too fat to survive.
        Therefore, it appears that courting disaster is the only recipe for survival.
        Also essential, it appears, is the necessity of holding two conflicting
        ideas in one's mind simultaneously, at least for psychic survival.

        In a strange reversal though, has anyone else noticed that the people most valued during a crisis are those who act as if there is no crisis?  We tend to value those who are calm, cool, and collected.  On one side we want to scream "Orange Threat Level" but then we want everyone to go about business as usual.
