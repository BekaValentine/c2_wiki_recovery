        Confusing The Means With The End
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s wherein a) some desirable end result <strong>E</strong> is identified; b) some particular means <strong>M</strong> is identified, along with a claim that <strong>M -> E</strong>; c) therefore <strong>M</strong> is advocated as an end in itself--without giving much further consideration (beyond lip service) to <strong>E</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a fallacy because:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>M -> E</strong> may not be true (or only true under certain circumstances) 
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>M</strong> might have other undesirable ends which counteract its promition of <strong>E</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           There may be other means besides <strong>M</strong> to achieve <strong>E</strong>, which may or may not be better.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Often times (not always), the advocate of <strong>M</strong> has other motives (ulterior or otherwise) for his support of <strong>M</strong>, and may actively campaign against other means which might lead to <strong>E</strong>.  This could be something simple as a personal preference for <strong>M</strong>, or a financial (or other) interest in <strong>M</strong>, or he may otherwise be identified with <strong>M</strong>.  Other times, someone just decides that <strong>M->E</strong> means <strong>M</strong> is good, and forgets about <strong>E</strong>.
