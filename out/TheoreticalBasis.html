        Theoretical Basis
      </h1>
      <p>
        Bertrand Meyer states the <a href="TheoreticalBasis.html">TheoreticalBasis</a> methodology principle this way:
      </p>
      <p>
        "Software methodology rules must be based on a theory of the underlying subject."
      </p>
      <p>
        "Dijkstra... did not just attack the Goto instruction for reasons of taste or opinion, but supported his suggested ban by a carefully woven chain of reasoning. One may disagree with some of that argument, but not deny that the conclusion is backed by a well thought-out view of the software development process. To counter Dijkstra's view you must find a flaw in his theory and provide your own replacement for that theory."
