        <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> refers to the above as belonging to a <a href="SystemsOfNames.html">SystemsOfNames</a> in his presentation at <a href="OopslaOhFour.html">OopslaOhFour</a>. A <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>, a stack of <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>s and <a href="DesignPattern.html">DesignPattern</a>s are also referred to as <a href="ArtfullyIncompleteSpecification.html">ArtfullyIncompleteSpecification</a>s.

           No - Four items listed in the second line of the page are separate and distinct systems, They are Systems (plural) of Names (plural).
