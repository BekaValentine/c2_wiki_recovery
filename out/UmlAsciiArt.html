        Wiki pages might often benefit from illustrating a design using
        <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a>. Unfortunately, it's hard to include graphical diagrams
        in Wiki: you can make a GIF and embed a link to it, but the next person
        can't easily edit it, so you lose some of the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>.

        Check out jave.de. He has some diagram clipart that could be used for UML. We need to come to an agreement on standards though.

        Wiki best supports ASCII text. Therefore, a good <a href="UmlAsciiArt.html">UmlAsciiArt</a> convention might
        be useful. Especially if the diagrams are already vector, for example SVG.

        Limiting ourselves initially to class diagrams, the biggest problem is the
        arrowheads. Trying to represent the official glyphs is unworkable (show me a
        good upwards-pointing inheritance arrow!). So instead, we must choose our
        own arrowheads. Here's one possibility:

        This makes me think that an Emacs interface to Wiki would be nice, so that you could use things like picture-mode. Wiki's formatting is simple enough that you don't really need Netscape to get around. But I suppose copy-and-paste is ok. -- <a href="LukeGorrie.html">LukeGorrie</a>

        A good UML drawing tool is needed first. There might be hope with DIA.

        Why not a white-board that you (and everyone) can scribble on?

      <p>
        What it really means is extending Wiki to allow drawings. Give me a piece of chalk and an eraser - make it impossible to make the lines straight or to spend any time making it pretty. Maybe it should allow me to type text instead of having to hand-draw every letter, but that's about as fancy as it should get.

        It's fun having a COM booster around. How are you going to make it work when I use the Wiki pages from my Linux box? I lean towards applets as maybe sorta kinda having a better chance of working on more browsers. The only problem is that applets are so... well... applety.

      </p>
      <p>
        COM is ported, but is ActiveX/OLE? Don't embedding interfaces rely on
        definitions from the Win32 API?
        Ie: embedding is implemented by passing an HWND (window handle) to the embedded component.
        Also, the problem with using Automation (on any platform) to launch a diagramming tool is that there are no standardized interfaces for displaying diagrams, so wiki users would be tied in to one diagramming application.

        Ideally, Wiki would use XML as its markup, and allow SVG to be embedded with wiki pages, and browsers would recognize the SVG namespace and render it appropriately.  However, I think we may have to wait a few years before browsers that can handle XML in this way are in common use.

        My two cents: Someone out there should create a UML font (I do not have a good font editor) and then have wiki change uml:inherit_up to that font and make the font publicly available (this enables anyone then with a font-selectable notepad to create UML diagrams. This could include such characters as uml:inherit_down uml:vert_bar, uml:horz_bar, uml:compose_up, uml:compose_down, uml:thin_whitespace, uml:med_whitespace, uml:wide_whitespace, .... Where the whitespace characters are used to clean up the alignment.

        There should be an <a href="AbbreviatedUmlAscii.html">AbbreviatedUmlAscii</a> format that allows "diagrams" to be made, sent discussed more easily

        [attrib_i21,attrib_i22,....method_i21(),method_i22()...]*i1<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Where "*ij(sym)" denotes lines/arrow between classes ie ">" for association, "#" for inheritance, "@" for composition etc as above. The class with no (sym) means start of line, the one with (sym) means end of line/arrow. Just a very simple tree even leave out types and parameters in the [attrib...method] list but enough to give the essence of the diagram in ascii, but more than just a plain tree. This is for the <a href="ClassDiagram.html">ClassDiagram</a> perhaps a similar convention would work for <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a> that should be enough to communicate uml with ascii quickly over a wiki, for instance.
