        Dilbert On Extreme Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        The 2003/01/09 <a href="DilBert.html">DilBert</a> strip is about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>:

        Short Deconstruction: It's a cartoon. It's funny, even to people who don't know what XP is. Get a life.
      </p>
      <p>
        Long Deconstruction: XP usually promotes from the team up - that's why the literature targets programmers. So if a boss promotes it, they'll probably get it wrong. Nobody pairs with the same partner all week, and nobody pairs constantly for all those 40 hours - that would be exhausting.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, XP is already showing its merits. Nobody wants to pair with the depressing slacker Wally - everyone wants the naive but consensus-building intern Asok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, Wally <em>already</em> hates everyone.

        <em>The rumor is that there will be a new </em><a href="DilBert.html">DilBert</a> character, KentBert, introduced on Friday to coach the team about where they have been deviating from the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingPractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingPractices</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        And another one: Dilbert trying to write a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> :)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I wonder if </em><a href="ScottAdams.html">ScottAdams</a> is specifically drawing these hoping they will be licensed for use in <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> books? I've thought about this more and I think it makes sense. If the story line continues on XP for a few more strips I think this might be the case. I can just imagine these being placed in a book somewhere, although I hope that no XP author would want to do that. Maybe I'm just too cynical?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        BTW, I have already written regarding permission to use them on my site and in a book. Why do you feel that to be inappropriate? I feel they'd be great leadins for discussions on how to really do it. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        <em>Ron, see </em><a href="DilbertCritique.html">DilbertCritique</a> for what I thought was a surprising look at <a href="ScottAdams.html">ScottAdams</a>.<em></em>

        No one here will make this mistake but I bet a lot of inDUHviduals out there won't know that the female character in this strip is supposed to be the customer. -- <a href="HillelGlazer.html">HillelGlazer</a>

        I think this cartoon points out what is most misunderstood with XP: it should be called PeerProgramming and not <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>. Wally isn't really a peer for Dilbert! (see also <a href="PairProgrammingIsDoneByPeers.html">PairProgrammingIsDoneByPeers</a>) -- <a href="RalfMueller.html">RalfMueller</a>
