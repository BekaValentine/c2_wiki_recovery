        I'd be interested in seeing what the compiler has done to this under the covers. It seems likely to me that the optimizer has stripped out lines 2 and 4, as the variable is never used.

        I think maybe the GetAvailMemory() function isn't returning what I want it to.  Is there any function in windows that returns the amount of memory used by a process?

        You're on the right track.  I don't think it's guaranteed that GetAvailMemory() is granular to the degree you expect.  Just for fun and games, consider the change I suggest in your test() function above. Betcha that shows some change.

        In classic MS-DOS, the system doles out memory in multiples of 16 bytes, but I don't know how Win98 does it.  Note that "new char" doesn't hit the OS directly; it uses the compiler-supplied runtime library to buffer that request. You probably made a request that happened to be satisfied from the buffers managed by that runtime library.  --<a href="MarkSchumann.html">MarkSchumann</a>

        <em>(Someone, perhaps the original poster, wrote:) comments, i put in new char[5000] and this causes some new memory to be allocated</em>

        Okay then, I think that answers it.  When you allocate about 5 Kbytes in this circumstance, the runtime library has to make a call to the operating system to get that memory, thereby decrementing the counter returned by GetAvailMemory().  When you allocate merely 5 bytes, that O/S call is (usually) unneeded, hence no change in GetAvailMemory().
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are using GetAvailMemory() as a way to count every single byte your application is using via new, it won't work.  For that purpose you might prefer a custom "new" handler.  --<a href="MarkSchumann.html">MarkSchumann</a>

        Alternately, one could just overload the malloc,free, new, and delete functions - Then track each call either with a running counter, or per pointer(it helps if you record the caller's __FILE__ and ___LINE__)
      </p>

        The MSVCRT (MiscroSoft Visual C runtime), if you're using visual studio, has great memory leak detection support, including dumping leaks, inspecting the heap, and (niftily) breaking into the debugger on specific allocations. This technique can help you detect a memory leak but is not especially usefull for figuring out where the leak is. --ChrisMellon.
