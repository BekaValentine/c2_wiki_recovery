        Subject Oriented Programming

        This is an approach building <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> software systems by <em>composing</em> several sub-systems (known as <em>subjects</em>) according to a <em>composition expression</em> which describes the rules for what parts of the subjects correspond and how they, in turn, should be merged. The idea is that this supports <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a>: each subject encodes the important aspects of the system as perceived from a particular perspective.

        Lately this work has been generalized into the notion of <a href="HyperSpace.html">HyperSpace</a>s.

      <p>
        Subjects <em>might</em> be good for encoding the structure of patterns separately and using composition to deploy them in a project. (I'm saying this here mainly because I hope someone will take the bait and disagree with me)

        This dangerous viewpoint will inevitably lead to eXtreme Design!
