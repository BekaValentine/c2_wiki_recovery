        Hi!
      </p>
      <p>
        I thought about changing references to myself elsewhere on the wiki but decided against at least at this point. Anyone watching <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> have any opinions on whether that would be necessary and/or okay?
      </p>
      <p>
        ;)
      </p>
      <p>
        shrug
      </p>
      <p>
        You can look at <a href="DaveHoehn.html">DaveHoehn</a> for my original page at least for now.

        It's been awhile since I was active here but I do check back from time to time. Today I wanted to show someone <a href="TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.html">TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign</a>, and after a few more years of experience than last write (wow, 7 more years it looks like) it just occurred to me that really <a href="TheSourceCodeIsTheDetailedDesign.html">TheSourceCodeIsTheDetailedDesign</a> would be a more appropriate statement, so I typed it into the address bar and it came up! :D
      </p>
      <p>
        I love it here.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm an open book, happy to answer any questions.
      </p>

           Debian Linux w/ Xenomai RT co-kernel
          <ul>
            <li>
               C++ for real-time stuff, POSIX Xenomai skin
            </li>
            <li>
               Mono/C# for non real-time tasks

            <li>
               Visual Studio .NET/C# -- Still my favorite!
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="MicrosoftDotNetDiscussions.html">MicrosoftDotNetDiscussions</a> still pretty much describes my opinion of Microsoft and .NET/C# in general. :) Did I mention Microsoft rules? Yay Microsoft!
