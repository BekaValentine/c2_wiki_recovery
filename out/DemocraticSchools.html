        The first school of this kind was Summerhill, founded by A S Neill in 1921. (Sudbury Valley was founded in 1968.) See <a href="http://www.first-ask.de/summerhill2000/index.html.">http://www.first-ask.de/summerhill2000/index.html.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        SummerHill and <a href="SudburyValleySchool.html">SudburyValleySchool</a> are related but somewhat different:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"There is no question that Summerhill was a book which greatly influenced and inspired the founding staff at Sudbury Valley.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There are several differences, that I can see. The most significant is that Summerhill is organized around Freudian psychology, and the premise that children need parental figures taking charge of them.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This has led to several things in Summerhill that one would not see at Sudbury Valley, and vice versa. ..."</em> continued at: <a href="http://www.sudval.org/~sdg/archives/dsm2/0003.html">http://www.sudval.org/~sdg/archives/dsm2/0003.html</a>
