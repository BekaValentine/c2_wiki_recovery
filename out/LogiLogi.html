      <p>
        <a href="LogiLogi.html">LogiLogi</a> is a PHP-based wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Its newest features are Sections and Multilanguage. Also TailPages and a Yearparser are included. Last but not least there's also a user editable MenuList, NewsPage, and a WhiteBoard for each section.
      </p>
      <p>
        Have a look at <a href="http://www.logilogi.org">http://www.logilogi.org</a> to see it in action.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sections means:</strong> A page called "<strong></strong>SectioN/SomePage<strong>" looking like </strong>
      </p>
      <code>
        ---<br/>
        <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a><br/>
        ---<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        will result in <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> linking to <strong></strong>SectioN/<a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a><strong>.  If that page does not exist however, but </strong>OtherSection/<a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a><strong> does, it will link there automatically until a page called </strong>SectioN/<a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a><strong> is created.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Another feature of Sections is that inside (that is in <strong></strong>SectioN/<strong> itself or in </strong>Section/AnySubPage<strong>) each Section/ will show the links that appear in a page called </strong>SectioN/MenuList<strong> as a menu at the left side of the page.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Each section also has a NewsPage, and a WhiteBoard, that are parsed into the SectioN/ page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Multilanguage means:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If a page called <strong></strong>SomePage<strong> exists in German but not in English, then a user will automatically see the German version, even if visiting </strong><a href="http://en.logilogi.org.">http://en.logilogi.org.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Navigation between language-versions of pages can be done by pressing the language icons above and below each page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Implementation:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is implemented using an alias-table, a pages-table, and pages_LanguageCode tables for the different language-versions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The other aspects of the implementation can be best explored by downloading and experimenting with the source-code of logilogi 0.28 plankton available at <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/logilogi/.">http://sourceforge.net/projects/logilogi/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Future:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The next main item on the "to do" list for <a href="LogiLogi.html">LogiLogi</a> is the separation of the parsing and viewing-parts to allow caching of Incoming Links, Ten recentchanges, and maybe even the body of the wikipages.
      </p>
      <p>
        For this I was thinking about using XML inside a MySQL-table, to enjoy the advantages of both. Adding and removing items for each page touched by these changes at the moment a new page is saved, or links are added to an existing one (this is some sort of object oriented approach).
