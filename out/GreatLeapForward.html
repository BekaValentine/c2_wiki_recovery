        <a href="MaoZedong.html">MaoZedong</a>'s 1958-1960 initiative to jump start the Chinese economy and modernize agriculture and industry.  It emphasized <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> by asking peasants to build backyard steel furnaces in place of large steel mills.
