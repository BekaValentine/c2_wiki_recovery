        Fsharp Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        F# is a variant of the ML family of programming languages, and began as implementation of the core of the <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> programming language by <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> for <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a>. <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx">http://research.microsoft.com/fsharp/fsharp.aspx</a> is the official website.
      </p>
      <p>
        F# is an attempt by Microsoft to adapt functional languages to the .NET virtual machine. It is based on Caml, an older version of <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a>, without the OO system (which is not a good fit with that of the .NET platform).  It is compiled to .NET bytecode, which is then compiled to native code by an implementation of the .NET <a href="CommonLanguageRuntime.html">CommonLanguageRuntime</a>.  The performance does not on the whole match that of OCaml native code, but is often close.  F# supports a <a href="VisualStudio.html">VisualStudio</a> mode for development and debugging, as well as the .NET libraries for network, graphics, text, XML manipulation and database access.
      </p>
      <p>
        F# is now an official .NET language, and will soon be releasing it's CTP.

                   <em>One of the things I like most about F# is how it allows typed </em><a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> to be applied to data-rich domains such as MachineLearning, ComputerAidedDesign (CAD) and GeographicalInformationSystems (GIS). GIS is of particular interest to me as I learned a lot about this area back in my undergraduate days, and because of the ever-enduring appeal of maps and simulation. Like Kean Wamsley's F# and AutoCAD examples, it's just amazing how easy it is to get going with F# and ArcInfo.<em> </em>
