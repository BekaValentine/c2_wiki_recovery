        Hacker Methodology
      </h1>
      <p>
        In contrast to the good points made by the <a href="AgileManifesto.html">AgileManifesto</a>, the following is offered, in jest, on behalf of those who don't wear ties or khakis.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tools should be superior to individuals as they are more reliable, and processes must be <strong>superfluid</strong> because you don't have the time to wait for <em>les incompetents</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Working software <em>is</em> self-documenting (...because you're the best).
        </li>
        <li>
           Customer "training" over "collaboration", with air-tight contracts to lock-in your strategy.
        </li>
        <li>
           As your knowledge >> corporate knowledge,  your plan includes overthrowing their nebulous "needs requirements" sheet.
        </li>
        <li>
           Overtake corporate customer because with all the dialog (<a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>) you've been having, you know they're completely wrong-headed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Take over world.
        </li>
      </ul>
