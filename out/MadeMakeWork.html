        Made Make Work
      </h1>
      <p>
        Make does more work than I could ever wrap my head around,
        it can understand prpblems much larger than any human can,
        so I still write recipies for it.

        <a href="StuFeldman.html">StuFeldman</a> invented its algorithm, and it is still a robust thing to do all the time.  Maybe your <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s rely on running <strong>make</strong> in a certain directory or against a certain target (<em>i.e. </em><strong>make tests</strong>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The original MakeAlgorithm appears in a one page AwkScript in the AwkBook (Not at hand tonight, page numbers later ~~ 188 )
