        The Best Of Both Worlds 
      </p>
      <p>
        AKA <em>The Best of [n] Worlds</em>, where n represents both, three, five, six, etc.
        <em>Worlds</em> in the phrase represents 'methods', 'ways', 'options', ...,
        i.e. we are <em>not</em> literally discussing planets, aliens, or worlds.
      </p>
      <p>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        Advantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          More than likely to succeed in the long term with more 'ways' or methods available.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Example: Many programming languages are available, not just one. A programmer can pick which language may suite his best needs, not just 'one'. A programmer can also combine languages inside other languages (using Perl regexes inside PHP, C++, Pascal, Python,..). This offers the best of both languages(worlds), rather than 'one' limited language.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Different strokes for different folks. One way is not best for one thing or person. 
          <ul>
            <li>
              Crude Example: Too often software programmers do not think in terms creating software for both the technical and non-techincal user, and in terms of both the 'developer-user' and the pure grandma-like 'user'. Microsoft for example offers Tools like Visual Studio for developers, but also tools like Excel for users who don't have time to <em>program</em> their accounting or bookeeping routines.   
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>Speaking of Microsoft... "The Best of Both Worlds" is the name of the (2-part) ST:TNG episode wherein </em><a href="CaptainHornHair.html">CaptainHornHair</a> gets assimilated by <a href="TheBorg.html">TheBorg</a>.  "<a href="ResistanceIsFutile.html">ResistanceIsFutile</a>"<em></em>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                      Laughing Out Loud...
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Disadvantages:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          takes longer than offering just one way. Short term projects that need to get done right away don't have time for 'offerring all the best of everything'.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Example: You offer a lightweight version of software, a featuresome version of software, and even a plug-in version of software. Creating separate versions took longer to write than if you had just picked one.
