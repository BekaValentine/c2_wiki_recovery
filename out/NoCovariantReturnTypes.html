        No Covariant Return Types
      </h1>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        This design flaw is described in the <a href="JavaBugDatabase.html">JavaBugDatabase</a> in the entry 4144488.
        The problem is that a method may not be overridden with a different return type, even if the new return type is assignable to the original one.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an example, the following code is invalid:
      </p>
      <code>
        public ThisClass clone(){<br/>
        return (ThisClass)super.clone();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course, there is no inherent reason for this code to be invalid, as clone() still returns an Object.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The </em><a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> now has support for <a href="CovariantReturnTypes.html">CovariantReturnTypes</a> as of the 1.5 JDK, which is currently in beta.  It was introduced as part of generics support, JSR-014.<em></em>

        Interesting that if Java were to change to have covariant return types (a possible change I am open to), then <a href="ChoiceOperatorDoesNotConsiderInheritance.html">ChoiceOperatorDoesNotConsiderInheritance</a> is a non-issue, you can just do the following:
      </p>
      <code>
        SerialLink createLink() {<br/>
        return new SerialLink();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        TcpLink createLink() {<br/>
        return new TcpLink();<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        because the two classes are both CommsLink.

      <p>
        Covariant return types would have no effect on <a href="ChoiceOperatorDoesNotConsiderInheritance.html">ChoiceOperatorDoesNotConsiderInheritance</a>, as the semantics of the choice operator is currently defined.

        How many languages with <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> do have <a href="CovariantReturnTypes.html">CovariantReturnTypes</a>? This is only fairly recent in C++ and not supported by many compilers. So it can't be a frequently used technique in that language. <em>It's not recent in C++, because it was in the Standard when it was technically finished in 1997, before publication in 1998.  It's supported by all compilers I've used except MSVC++6.  IIRC Eiffel also has covariant return types. --</em><a href="JamesDennett.html">JamesDennett</a><em></em>

        Sidenote.  This problem is solved in GJ: one of the proposals to add generics to Java.  The way they handled it makes it seem that it would not be too hard to fix.

        <em>Return types are a hack anyway. Is there a problem using OUT style parameters? They make more sense than overloading the 'C' status return with yet more functionality.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've always viewed OUT style parameters as a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> - and you can bet your bottom dollar that they soon morph into IN/OUT parameters, which are of course the SpawnOfTheDevil. Parameters should go in one side and come out the other. A lot of languages lack tuples, and so people grow up not knowing any better.

        <em>What about return values for overloaded operators?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I agree you lose a lot of desirable syntactic sugar. I may well be completely missing the point, plus there may be an issue of multiple dispatch; but if we assume that returns are handled by passing a reference parameter, can't we do the same thing using standard overloading, but ugly? Or is there a fundamental problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I was just worried about ugliness myself. It's nice to be able to write x = y + z instead of add(&x, y, z).</em>
