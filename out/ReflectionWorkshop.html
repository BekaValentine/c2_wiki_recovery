        A core practice of the <a href="CrystalClearMethodology.html">CrystalClearMethodology</a> and, over time, becoming core to <a href="AgileMethodologies.html">AgileMethodologies</a> in general. (Well, actually, essential part of all the <a href="CrystalMethodologies.html">CrystalMethodologies</a> since the mid 1990s)

        Involves sitting down together, after any given milestone (e.g. after each iteration) or after critical events (key person leaving) and asking fundamentally 3 questions:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What did we like about what we were doing? (I.e., if we make changes, we should protect these)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What did we not like? (I.e., we'll nominate ways to avoid these)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What do we want to try differently this next time?
        </li>
      </ul>

        Safari has a small excerpt on this:

        They can be done after the project, but they are more effective when done monthly or quarterly. --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Some people refer to them as "MilestoneRetrospective" (done after each milestone), <a href="IterationRetrospective.html">IterationRetrospective</a>, or AdaptiveRetrospective. I heard one group talking about doing a PrePerspective <strong>before</strong> a project (a retrospective of previous projects, extracting lessons learned and applying to the forthcoming project).  In <a href="CrystalMethodologies.html">CrystalMethodologies</a>, that particular session is called a MethodologyTuningWorkshop.

        <a href="JoshuaKerievsky.html">JoshuaKerievsky</a> has retrospectives in IndustrialXP too... Very nice idea - works like a charm.
