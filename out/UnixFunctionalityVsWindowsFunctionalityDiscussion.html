        <li>
            On this page we shouldn't try to say that one of these operating systems is <em>generally</em> better than the other. Let's compare features and find arguments for the importance of discriminating features.

            Windows is <strong>2000</strong> or <strong>XP</strong> for the purposes of this page. The comparison of Unix with Windows versions which aren't NT-based doesn't make much sense.

      <ul>
        <li>
           following properties of named pipes:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Named pipes can be created and used from the user inferface of the OS (Windows: Windows Explorer, Unix: shell?)
            </li>
            <li>
               Named pipes can be created and used by scripts using the scripting technology which is typical for the OS (Windows: Windows Scripting Host, Unix: shell, tcl, ...). (See mkpipe, mknode -p, mkfifo)
            </li>
            <li>
               The name of a pipe can be any path which could be the name of a normal file in the file system.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <dl>

        <dd>Explanation why named pipes are important:</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>There are some significant products (like database engines in case of an export/dump) that generate tons of data, and can't throw it to the stdout, they have a filename in a config somewhere and they write it sequentially to that filer. And you want to take that data and feed it to another program by using a <em>pipe</em>, for example (gzip, bzip, tar). Because you can't modify the source program you have to create a named pipe in the file system, and let the source program write to that pipe and the destination program can read from there (you can't use the | redirector because the source program does not write to stdout). Unless I am mistaken (and I am very curious to know if there's a solution), you effectively cannot do that on Windows, so if you have for example to export some GBs of data from a database in compressed format, you effectively have to use a temporary file in the file system thus ruining performance.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>In Windows, pipes live in the global namespace, under the directory \\<server-name>\pipe\.  To open a pipe on the local machine, pass a filename like "\\.\pipe\my_pipe" to the </em>CreateFile or CreateFileEx function.  You can also open pipes on another machine and send data across the network.  This is all described in the API documentation.<em></em></dd>

      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Windows doesn't have a reasonable way to delete a file that is currently in use. This is the primary cause of the needless reboot plague. And since this one is a kernel-level limitation, there is no way to write a library that gets around it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Windows doesn't have a select()-like system call <em>that can take 1000 handles</em>, leading to lots of complicated design patterns involving many threads that are completely unnecessary on a UNIX system.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Windows suffers from : 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           swapping algorithm that takes bad decisions which processes to be swapped and when and whether to be swapped at all. I've seen the bloody OS swapping completely unnecessarily (i.e. there was plenty of free memory around). What is more funny is that it refuses to let go of the enormous amount of memory it uses for caching , in order to avoid swapping, insofar that it's swapping because of caching (and probably it's doing caching on the swap file).

            Security could be improved

      </ul>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>Windows NT and 2000 has an excellent security model -- much better than that of Unix. <em>Explain.</em>  However, what Windows suffers from is a dreadful user interface to security management.  In Unix you can work in an unprivileged account and easily launch programs with higher privileges.  In Windows, you have to log out and log in as another user to get higher privileges.  This is so inconvenient that many people work with higher privileges than necessary to avoid constant logging in and out.  Windows 2000 has a "runas" command and an Explorer menu item for running programs from the command line under a different user id.  However, this functionality is disabled in Explorer by default and can only be enabled by changing undocumented registry entries!  Also, a lot of functionality that you'd want to run with different privileges is implemented by DLLs (e.g. control panels) or as explorer plugins and so cannot be run as another user. <em>Also, their much-vaunted UAC dialog, which is basically </em>gksu<em> or </em>kdesudo<em> MS-style</em>.</dd>

            Unstable user interface. From 2003 to 2013 Mac OS X has barely undergone through any significant GUI changes, Linux's GNOME and KDE only did one... and Windows went from Windows 98 with a fancy blue plastic-like skin (Windows XP), to a spiffy glassy GUI with tons and tons of interface overhauls (Windows Vista and 7), to making your PC look and feel like a Windows Phone smartphone/tablet (Windows 8).

        I find the arguments at the top of this page somewhat unbelievable. They either come from someone who has not used many unix systems, or is simply trolling. We're all grown ups here and we know there are horses for courses - so don't argue here about which is better. Instead,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           think about what features you want in your operating system and choose the one <em>you need</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you think 'my system needs something your system has', then beg, borrow, create or steal the feature. Be our guest.

        <em> I often hear that Unix is better for the Enterprise because it has stuff that Windows doesn't. I often get the impression that the person saying it has only used Windows 98. They often say Windows falls over easily which is also crap.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Having said that the page is supposed to be a comparison rather than a discussion. Admittedly my title could be better.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        My critical comment on the start of the page was aimed at the way the initial 'Windows has' list lists things as if 'unix' (which one) didn't (for example) - 'a gui' (so X doesn't count?), gui+context-sensitive help (xman, and context sensitive help requires per-app support in both environments), a shorter <a href="LearningCurve.html">LearningCurve</a> <em>for what</em> (again its a horses for courses thing.), and cygwin(!!!) (this is why I thought you were trolling) - an imitation of a posix environment put there to work around the poor windows CLI, which is missing lots of the tools you would expect on a unix box (eg most of the networking support), and which adds the <a href="LearningCurve.html">LearningCurve</a> of unix to that of windows??? What's your point? Also, you then go on to arguments for a desktop OS with arguments for an enterprise OS.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to do a direct comparison, fair enough; provide a table of things in the Windows world you want comparisons for and space beside each for someone to fill in a unix equivalent. And to avoid the inflammatory title, and inevitable pissing match, you could call it <a href="EquivalentFeaturesOnWindowsAndUnix.html">EquivalentFeaturesOnWindowsAndUnix</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I stand by my argument that you shouldn't, err... argue. Did that sentence make sense? ;o)

        <strong>As a long time Windows developer with some, lesser experience with Unix, I will provide the following observations.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unix provides better remote management, expecially over low speed connections.  Command lines stay responsive under 56 KBaud and slower links; remote GUI displays become almost unusable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unix shell scripts are often an easy way to automate a repetitive task.  The closest Windows equivalent often requires a Visual Basic program.  <em>Or a port of a UNIX tool, such as perl</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Windows GUIs are often more efficient for batch operations than Unix command lines.  Copying or moving a set of files is tedious and mistake prone under command line FTP, but straight forward under Windows Explorer. (<em>This depends on whether you can get the GUI to select the right set of files, and how non-fatal errors are handled. "Sorry, can't copy file 3 of 13657 because it's in use! Aborting." When it's easy, yes, it's real easy, when it's hard, sometimes you end up dragging files over one by one. That said, Unix isn't devoid of GUI file managers and FTP clients.</em>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Windows program installers (<a href="InstallShield.html">InstallShield</a>, etc.) have less room for user error than Unix archive files.  Both can be equally as fatal when an error occurs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Windows copy/paste buffer is extremely powerful.  I don't know of a Unix equivalent.  <em>X on UNIX has a copy/paste buffer</em>  Windows copy/paste/drag/drop mediation has a <strong>lot</strong> more to it than just a text buffer.  On a copy/drag, one can make a promise to deliver various standard or custom formats of data in a variety of delivery mechanisms.  No data need actually be copied until the user pastes/drops, at which point the receiver can negotiate for the type (text, picture, file. etc.) and form (handle, file, stream, COM object, etc.) of the data it wants.  Very very flexible.  Does KDE or Gnome have a model closer to this?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Yep, it sure does. There is a 1980s version of X11 copy/paste that does not do that, and which in fact has a strict small limit on how much text can be copied/pasted, but that has been obsolete for years (although unfortunately some apps still insist on using that one). The 1990s copy/paste, and the drag n' drop standard protocol (the latter admittedly took a long time to become standard) does exactly what you describe. See QT documentation, for instance, for clear description.

           Early Windows and MS-DOS could be managed by an informed user.  Unix and Windows NT and beyond really require a dedicated system administrator.

           Unix provides a great deal of backwards compatibility.  I can often take scripts and programs from 10 years ago and run them almost unmodified on new systems.  Windows is always jumping to the next big thing and obsoleting its past. (<em>Windows actually goes to a lot of trouble to retain compatibility with older apps. Windows XP should still run most 16-bit apps designed for Windows 3.x.</em>)

        I hope this can serve as a strawman for discussion and I am curious to see the viewpoints of those more Unix savvy than I.

        Hmmm, last comment sometime in 2007 suggests this is a dead horse. Too bad - as a Windows jockey looking to port a unix app that used pipes as noted near the top of this I immediately learned something useful. Anyway, my contribution:

        Windows has IOCPs. Not only does this make for efficient multithreaded i/o processing (the usual use), an MS extension to the concept allows the IOCP mechanism to be used "internally" for inter-thread messaging. Thus a worker thread sleeps at an IOCP that may or may not also be tied to some hardware I/O, but in any case I can post a token to it (along with quite a lot of associated information, as required) from another thread, at which point the IOCP wakes up and my selectcase switches on the token (which may be a completed read or write, or a "do this" message), does what I need the thread to do at that instant, and loops to wait at the IOCP. The ultimate semaphore or event wait because I can send it more information than just "hi, wake up", put a whole bunch of related actions in one place to share commonalities, etc.

        OT someone pointed out that the architect of NT had previously designed VAX/VMS. Might make a few people give it a tiny bit more respect, assuming it's true.
