        Amiable drunks. Not, I suspect, as geeky as they are reputed to be. Their homepage is <a href="http://www.camra.org.uk.">http://www.camra.org.uk.</a> Every year, usually the first week in August (Tuesday - Saturday) they stage the Great British Beer Festival at Kensington Olympia (London). Entry costs about 2-4 quid/day. This is the largest (and friendliest) temporary pub in the world. Unlike 'lager louts', who often get obnoxious when they've had a few (I wasn't too impressed with the Holsten Beer Fest when I went), the Camra bods just get mellow. You could take your gran to the GBBF, if she was the sort who liked the odd half. Highly recommended for
        anyone (male or female) who likes good beer.
