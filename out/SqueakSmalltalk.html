        Squeak Smalltalk
      </h1>
      <p>
        Squeak is a free, <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> version of the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        See <a href="http://www.squeak.org">http://www.squeak.org</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Although Squeak was led by <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a>, it isn't the definitive <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>. The goal of Squeak is not to recreate Smalltalk-80, but to start with Smalltalk-80 and then move to the next level. Squeak supports the <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> (MVC) model, but the preferred UI framework is called "Morphic" (<a href="MorphicInterface.html">MorphicInterface</a>), and is based upon the framework of the same name developed for the <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        (It's important to note that Squeak's use of Morphic hasn't the slightest resemblance to Self's. As far as look and feel go, they might as well be radioactive napalm and life-giving water. Given Squeak's misuse of direct manipulation and the sheer ugliness of its default look, UI design can't possibly have been a consideration. In fact, the radically different UIs in Self and Squeak prove just how little importance using a particular framework makes to the end user. -- <a href="RichardKulisz.html">RichardKulisz</a>)

        The license is at: <a href="http://www.squeak.org/license.html.">http://www.squeak.org/license.html.</a> It looks like an open-source license, in that you are free to use and modify it in commercial and non-commercial settings, but if you release modifications to the virtual machine or the base classes, you must make them available in source form over the internet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Plain English Examples of License Terms</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Our license agreement contains conditions intended to keep
        Squeak open and available to the user community, while allowing
        users to do useful things with Squeak. You will see the license
        once you begin installing Squeak. These following examples are
        provided as illustrations and are not legally binding. See the
        license for the real terms. To the extent that the examples and
        the license conflict, the license will govern.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are allowed to change Squeak, write extensions to Squeak,
        build an application in Squeak, and include some or all of Squeak
        with your products. You may distribute all of these things along
        with Squeak, or portions of Squeak, for free or for money.
        However, you must distribute these things under a license that
        protects Apple in the way described in our license to you.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you modify any of the methods of class objects (or their
        relationships) that come with Squeak (as opposed to building on
        top of what we provide), you must post the modifications on a
        web site or otherwise make them available for free to others,
        just as we have done with Squeak. Our license to you explains
        how you must do this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The same is true if you port Squeak to another machine or
        operating system - you must post your port on a web site or
        otherwise make it available for free to others under the terms
        described in our license to you.

        Now that I'm finally getting used to Smalltalk from working in <a href="PocketSmalltalk.html">PocketSmalltalk</a>, I decided to come back and give Squeak a try. It is still ugly, but I'm more forgiving now (and I'm trying to figure out how to for the Xserver to run in an 8bit grayscale mode). Now, I think, this thing could almost be an OS by itself. Which of course was the original <a href="DynaBook.html">DynaBook</a> idea. So, who wants to help me port squeak to run on linux's frame buffer console, and make it so that it can use raw partitions for data storage?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>raw partitions for data storage</em>'??? Maybe a filesystem optimized for small files like </strong>ReiserFS, on Linux, would be more appropriate, so you do not have to implement (reinvent) your date storage mechanism.<em></em>

        I just downloaded it. It is very cool. I like the fact that it does MIDI. I used to write a lot of fun little C++ programs to read and write MIDI to my keyboard.., automatic composers, harmonizers, software delays that with periods of about an hour which frighten the dog and houseguests. C++ never seemed liquid enough for some of what I wanted to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Very cool. I haven't sat this close to Smalltalk and known what it is before. It feels like an operating system. I got the book <a href="SmalltalkTheLanguageAndItsImplementation.html">SmalltalkTheLanguageAndItsImplementation</a> to get started. I like the fact that Squeak is starting at Smalltalk-80 but there are plans to move on to new things.

        Has anyone thought about the effects of Squeak's "different" looking GUI has on its chances of becoming more popular? It's a really cool language and environment, but it must be the ugliest GUI I have seen, <em>ever</em>. How many people download Squeak, start it up, look at the graphics, and then shut it down directly? I enjoyed a few hours playing with it, but if I hadn't known Smalltalk before I surely wouldn't have given it a chance. Sadly, first impressions <em>do</em> matter. -- <a href="AndersBengtsson.html">AndersBengtsson</a>

Thankfully, there is a lot of support for themes, but that still doesn't help with the first impression, it just makes it easier on the eyes of us who decide to stick it out.

        I like the spartan quality of the Squeak 3.0 user interface. And all the source code is there, so if you want to make it fancy, it shouldn't be too difficult.

        Here is an example of a standalone application <a href="http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/1976">http://wiki.squeak.org/squeak/1976</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's a pretty weak example.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How so? I think the idea was to demonstrate that you can use <a href="SqueakSmalltalk.html">SqueakSmalltalk</a> to produce standalone applications. I grabbed the tarball for my system, and, sure enough, it worked.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's not exactly what I would call an 'application'. The real question is whether the average organization could make money developing software with it.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I do not see why not. I cannot cite any 'applications' out there that are making money based on Squeak, but I gotta wonder, and maybe you can enlighten me, why not? As far as I can tell, it seems to have everything any other general purpose programming language has, and then some.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Your real question is "Can <em>I</em> make more money developing software with Squeak than with whatever tools I'm using now.". The answer is probably "no". But Disney has supposedly been using it for real-world applications. Check the link on the <a href="AlanKay.html">AlanKay</a> page. -- <a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a>

        In short, there are not a <strong>lot</strong> of people developing standalone applications in Squeak right now (more people use it for research, teaching, and learning), but there are some people doing this. The number of people developing standalone apps should increase further as Squeak proceeds in its modularization/partitioning effort, and new applications appear on the <a href="SqueakMap.html">SqueakMap</a> registry. --<a href="DougWay.html">DougWay</a>

        In the moment I saw the Squeak webpages and the interface I really squeaked out ("Argh, my eyes!" most of the time). I mean what is this for instance: <a href="http://www.squeakland.org/">http://www.squeakland.org/</a> ? 
        They should either get a good designer to brush up these designs - or just switch to a google-like approach of simple design. Well I know that design is not everything, but people who see those pages will just run away. -- Thomas Veil

           Interestingly enough, when going to that page (which appears to have been designed to appeal to children), I had to browse around for quite a while before encountering any mention of "Smalltalk" (and that's on the "squeak" site, not the "squeakland" site. Squeak is being billed as a "media authoring tool" (a claim I won't dispute), rather than a <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>. (One could easily argue that it is both). Given that most folks here on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> treat Squeak as YetAnotherSmalltalkImplementation as opposed to a content creation environment (look at the title and discussion found on <em>this</em> page, for instance), the disconnect is glaring.

        I think generally, the hyper-colourful Morphic <em>looks</em> beautiful. I'd love to work there. But why the hell can't they accept that 
      </p>
      <p>
        a) 99.9% of the population <em>don't</em> have a three-button mouse and don't want to learn how to map Red / Yellow and Blue onto combinations of keys and mouse buttons. (Nor, are they likely to be impressed by the helpful suggestion of the intro tutorial to <em>buy</em> a new, 3-button mouse.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Basically <a href="LateBinding.html">LateBinding</a> is a wonderful thing ... when the computer does it. But the Squeak interface wants the benefit of late-binding your hardware to an abstract interface model, where the <em>user</em> has to remember the transformation between the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        b) there are symbols which have become conventions for "open", "maximize", "minimize" windows. Windows uses them, Linux uses them, I'm pretty sure Mac has something not too unintuitively disimilar. My suspicion is that Squeak loses 50% of it's audience the first time people actually try to maximize and then minimize the windows and find they don't work "normally". Of course, we can learn to get over this, but it screams that this is going to be complicated and difficult to use - if even the windows are difficult, what about the rest of it?
