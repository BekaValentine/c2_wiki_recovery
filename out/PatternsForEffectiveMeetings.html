        Here are patterns that facilitate running effective meetings:

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <a href="TheTeamHandbook.html">TheTeamHandbook</a> lists a couple others:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="MultiVoting.html">MultiVoting</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           NominalGroupingTechnique
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        (there are literally hundreds of these if you wish to include creativity techniques for problem definition, possible solution discovery and implementation planning. There's a book by Van Gundy that has about 180+ of them).

        How about not having so many meetings? Some sort of wiki-like discussion system may be more effective. But managers don't seem to like those kind of things. Meetings are huge <a href="TimeSink.html">TimeSink</a>s. You cannot stop and ponder key issues, but have to deliver instant sound-byte solutions.

        I think the nature of meetings is often misunderstood. People use them as methods for decision-making, in which they suck deeply. The only good purposes of meetings I know of are quickly informing a group of people about others' activities, and quickly gathering ideas / opinions about some questions. If it gets much outside that, there will be somebody who'll get frustrated. -- <a href="PanuKalliokoski.html">PanuKalliokoski</a>
