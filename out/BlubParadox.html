        Blub Paradox
      </h1>
      <p>
        An idea developed in an article <a href="BeatingTheAverages.html">BeatingTheAverages</a> by <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> (<a href="http://paulgraham.com/avg.html).">http://paulgraham.com/avg.html).</a> He argues that some languages are more powerful than others and posits a hypothetical middle of the road language called Blub. He describes the gist of the paradox thus:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>As long as our hypothetical Blub programmer is looking down the power continuum, he knows he's looking down. Languages less powerful than Blub are obviously less powerful, because they're missing some feature he's used to. But when our hypothetical Blub programmer looks in the other direction, up the power continuum, he doesn't realize he's looking up. What he sees are merely weird languages. He probably considers them about equivalent in power to Blub, but with all this other hairy stuff thrown in as well. Blub is good enough for him, because he thinks in Blub.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Most people without the experience of them can't see language features as really useful things. I know an otherwise extremely talented programmer who can't see the value of garbage collection and thinks it simply encourages "lazy programming" even as he struggles to find the right location to delete objects shared and referenced by many others.  Are you claiming to be such a renaissance person as to be able instantly to recognize the value and worth of every new programming feature to which you are exposed?

        A few problems with the <a href="BlubParadox.html">BlubParadox</a>:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
            It treats the notion of programming language "power" as a continuum, with assembly language at the bottom, and some other language (which is often asserted to be <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>) at the top. All other languages can be be placed somewhere on the scale, and the scale is well-ordered; for any two languages A and B, either one is "more powerful" than the other, or else they are of equal power. I fundamentally disagree; one must consider the problem domain. I wouldn't want to write a lot of text processing in C. I wouldn't want to write a GUI-intensive business application in Perl. I wouldn't want to write a device driver in Java. And so on.  
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Note: In footnote 4 of the essay in which he defined <a href="BlubParadox.html">BlubParadox</a>, PG clarifies the 'continuum' to be <em>"possibly a lattice, narrowing toward the top"</em>, and that it's <em>"at least a partial order"</em>. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ol>
        <li>
            There seems be an implied correspondence between a language's power and the "features" that it has; that if language X has feature Z and language Y does not, than X > Y. The fallacy of this should be self apparent. ("How can you program in Smalltalk? It doesn't even have multiple inheritance!?!?!"  Or: "How can you get any work done in Java? It doesn't have pointer arithmetic!"). Some features are rightly <a href="ConsideredHarmful.html">ConsideredHarmful</a>; others are better implemented in another way; others are <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a>. Some are simply inappropriate for certain problem domains. And others are simply clutter.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It's possibly <strong>anti-scientific</strong> - Things must be measurable and measured to be objectively verifiable by the scientific process. <a href="GoodMetricsProduceNumbers.html">GoodMetricsProduceNumbers</a>. Some fuzzy notion in your head that is not externally measurable cannot be dissected, compared, contrasted, analyzed, tested, etc. It's a rejection of western thought and leans towards eastern thinking and "holistic" philosophy. It's not necessarily that the eastern approach is "bad", but I do believe the western approach is far easier/quicker to <strong>communicate across minds</strong>. 20-year 24/7 mentoring doesn't scale. Western science formalized the scientific process, not necessarily invented wisdom and smarts by itself.  Further, the western approach has produced improvements in technology far faster than the eastern approach. It's a better bet if you want a medium-term return on your investment. -t
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Team factors - Programming is generally a social activity such that others must be able to read and change our code with relative ease. AKA, "maintenance". An individual may be able to shape the tool to their own head to speed up conversion of their head models to software models, but this may also make it harder for current or future maintainers to work with the code because their own head models may not match that of the author. -t
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        But the fundamental issue is just about how programmers tend to see individual <em>language features</em> that they don't understand as "weird."  Overall <em>language power</em> is not pivotal to his argument - or at least not <em>this</em> one, particularly involving the <a href="BlubParadox.html">BlubParadox</a>.  In any case, features alone would never put a total ordering on languages, since any pair of languages can each possess 'features' that the programmers consider important that the other lacks.  Where you might find a total order is when working with later versions of the same language - i.e. Perl 4 offers no features that Perl 5 does not also offer, but Perl 5 offers features that Perl 4 does not, so according to <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> we could readily say that Perl 5 is 'more powerful' than Perl 4.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Of greatest interest are largely domain-independent features that cannot readily be implemented in another language without 'writing an interpreter' or performing the <a href="GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming.html">GreenspunsTenthRuleOfProgramming</a>-style informally specified, buggy, slow, 80% solution (leaving 'Lisp' out of it).  With sufficient <a href="DuctTape.html">DuctTape</a>, string, and bailing wire; any feature in one reasonable language can be duplicated any any other reasonable language. It may be ugly, full of violations of <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>, and impossible to maintain, but it can be done. And for this argument, for <a href="BlubParadox.html">BlubParadox</a> and these '<a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>s', it <em>really</em> wouldn't count. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The article makes no claim that languages are totally ordered, merely that there is at least a partial order. C++ and Scheme are examples of (near) parity, in Graham's terms, anyway because of C++ templates and Scheme macros doing nearly the same things (albeit different ways and at different times). Now try comparing Scheme, or C++, with Fortran 77.
      </p>
      <p>
        To expand the Scheme/C++ comparison; let's split C++ into two versions - ANSI C++, and "C++ 2.0", a very early, pre-AnnotatedReferenceManual dialect of C++ which excludes both templates and exception handling. Clearly, ANSI C++ <strong>></strong> pre-ARM C++. (Graham himself compares Perl 4 and Perl 5; so comparing two different versions of the same language is fair). One can fake templates with macros (but it's horrible); one can fake exceptions with setjmp/longjmp (but that's nasty). Yet, no ordering relationship (<strong><</strong> or <strong>></strong>) can be established between either C++ dialect and Scheme. Both have OO as a core part of the language, neither have lazy evaluation.
      </p>
      <p>
        And of course, there is the question of what lies at the top. Graham claims it's <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> (and I assume <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>; other Lisp dialects like Scheme lack key things found in other languages). <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> is likely close to the top; and perhaps even shares the top spot with a couple of other languages. I do find the suggestion that for any computer language X, X <strong><=</strong> <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, to be severely lacking in proof. I haven't seen any language X for which X <strong>></strong> <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a> is clearly true; but I think more than a few which can claim incomparability (in the technical sense of neither greater nor lesser in the <a href="PartialOrder.html">PartialOrder</a>). And I know lots of <a href="SmugSmalltalkWeenie.html">SmugSmalltalkWeenie</a>s who would agree with me on this one.

        If only Lisp was powerful enough to redefine its syntax and notation to be like infix or Algol languages so I wouldn't have to use Lisp when I need formal Algol style syntax. I guess Lisp just isn't powerful enough. Darn.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So isn't this what </em>ReaderMacros are supposed to be for?  They allow you to embed other syntaxes within Lisp code by calling a different parser.  You could probably even remake Lisp into Algol if you wanted to, but why?  Are you just <a href="LostInaSeaofParentheses.html">LostInaSeaofParentheses</a>? -- <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You might also want to look at <a href="SweetExpressions.html">SweetExpressions</a>, an effort to add a form of infix compatible with macros (trying to add precedence really makes a mess of things), calling functions as f(x) rather than (f x), providing syntax for arrays of all types (saying *hash*["this"] instead of (gethash *hash* "this"), and providing significant whitespace--and doing all this, in a way compatible with the original s-expression syntax.  For most languages, such an effort is impossible--for Lisp languages, like Common Lisp and Scheme, most <a href="SmugLispWeenies.html">SmugLispWeenies</a> will merely complain that this effort is very misguided, and a horrible waste of time!
      </p>
      <p>
        (For the record, I have tried to implement some of these things.  Infix notation for Common Lisp is done; I think f(x) notation is done, but I may be wrong; array notation hasn't been done, but I have some ideas on how to do it; I've done *some* work on parsing whitespace, but I don't know how to plug it into Common Lisp's reader for experimentation--the documenation on this is just arcane enough, I haven't been able to figure it out.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and if you haven't checked it out already, look at Lisp's LOOP macro.  One common complaint about it, is that it's too "Algolish", and not really "Lispy".
      </p>
      <p>
        So, to answer your question:  Lisp *really is* that powerful.  --Alpheus
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides, Racket has a full ALGOL 60 implementation done completely using reader macros. So, yeah, you can have literally Algol style syntax. But why would you use it? --Denommus

        Experienced programmers carry quite a number of patterns around in their heads. They may have learned these patterns from books or by hard won experience. The patterns enable a fluid style of programming where attention can be maintained on the unknown parts of the task at hand and work feels productive. Programmers tend to like programming languages that have good support for the patterns they use. Programmers don't like languages that disallow or inconvenience the patterns they use. They are also rarely impressed by language features that support patterns they don't know or use. This much holds whether languages can be ordered or not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> likes the patterns he has now and considers them better than those he sees employed by others. Paul also writes eloquently about his patterns (though he may not use pattern terminology). Thankfully, he avoids many of the affectations that remind us <a href="WhyWeHateLisp.html">WhyWeHateLisp</a>. Still, I find it far easier to read what Paul writes when I remind myself that there are very fine patterns that he doesn't have or use, and that those patterns will often lead programmers to make language choices unlike his. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ward, I'm curious what "the fine patterns that he doesn't have or use" are? I'm assuming you don't happen to know Mr. Graham personally and that you are working backwards from his language choice (Lisp) to some patterns that he must not have or use since they are ill-supported by Lisp. As a Lisp programmer I'm curious what I'm missing.

        OO is one.  There's a discussion in the LL1 archives where he's criticized for "not having done his homework" when deciding not to include objects in Arc.  And while he's right in that <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s provide all the power of C++/Java-style OO with less bloat, he's completely overlooked the more powerful <a href="GenericFunction.html">GenericFunction</a>-style OO.  <a href="BlubParadox.html">BlubParadox</a> applies to programmers as well as languages: if someone makes up their mind that "OO is nothing new under the sun", then they'll look at anything labeled as "OO" as strange and unnecessary without bothering to think of how it can make their job easier.  -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> has a very (very) low opinion of OO, mostly because he does a lot of stuff that most people haven't been able to do, and he says he almost never "resorts" to it. However, more recent posts on LL1 suggest <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> is coming around. He's starting to be less derogatory to OO (and seems to have done a 180 on continuations).  No one, not even <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> himself, ever said that <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> was immune to the <a href="BlubParadox.html">BlubParadox</a>. ;)

      <p>
        Not that I think it matters. If <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> doesn't put OO directly into Arc, then someone else will make a solution like CLOS and that'll be the end of it. :) -- <a href="DaveFayram.html">DaveFayram</a>

        Can some computational psychometrician somewhere use a programming test or a PET-scan to tell us what patterns and understandings we each lack individually?

Joel Spolsky writes that some people never 'Get' C pointers-and-arrays.

        This doesnt make it a paradox though, there is no apparent contradiction. There is nothing to suggest that looking in both directions should be equal in this case, in fact quite the opposite as you are comparing knowledge of thing you understand to knowledge of things you don't (yet). surely this is similar to knowing the past but not the future, which doesnt appear to be a paradox. it is an interesting observation though. -- <a href="JamesKeogh.html">JamesKeogh</a>

        I think it's fair to say that, just as "Greenspun's Tenth Rule" has no preceding rules, but is just a catchy name, the "Blub Paradox" is a catchy name as well.  If there's any paradox involved, it would be this:  that a programmer can appreciate power, but unless they understands that power, they're not always going to appreciate it.  I remember the first time I encountered C++, and was blown away by the idea of putting things into "if" and "while" blocks, as well as having libraries for I/O rather than a "PRINT" statement--having come from BASIC as my first language.  Sometimes it's easy to see when a feature will give you power; sometimes, it's not, until you've done a thing or few with that feature.  --Alpheus.

        <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> has the same problem. He never had to face a real business application beyond his E-stores. Thus, he does not have enough experience to know the power of relational databases, which he generally rejects. (I exchanged personal emails with him on this topic.) See <a href="WebStoresDiscussion.html">WebStoresDiscussion</a>. He extrapolates the experience with one application to assume that <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a> can replace a RDBMS.

Paul's a smart guy, and made a fortune off that program, I'm sure he had very good reasons for doing what he did, the way he did it.

      </p>
      <p>
        Possibly. I was in fact startled by his attitude, but on the other hand, at least for his <strong>particular application</strong>, his choice was quite defensible. That's different from rejecting RDBMS altogether, of course, but there are extremists on every topic. Obviously most people believe that relational databases are important for some purposes. Perhaps his secret was finding a niche where his shortcuts could be leveraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of his works suggest that he has rejected them altogether, although I have never seen a formal rejection from him. But I do agree that for his e-stores project, his approach was an acceptable choice.

        I can see how they make sense for lots of small store-lets or portal-lets where Bob's store or portal is not going to interact much with Lisa's store/portal, etc. However, this does not extrapolate into the kinds of apps I see to run a medium-sized or large organization.

It is still my opinion that <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> is a bit naive on a wider view of what apps need in the real world when data MUST inter-relate. Or, perhaps he's suggesting that people find areas where they <em>can</em> leverage flat-file short-cuts. At this point, I cannot tell without asking again. He generally rejects OOP, by the way, so if he is a God of Programming, then you cannot pick and choose which doctrines of his you follow. --top

        Yes, but that opens you up to accusations of cherry-picking evidence. If you like FP and OOP, and Graham dislikes OOP, using his millionare status gained via FP is going hit a sour note because one can use the same anecdote to deflate OOP.

As with paradigms, you can make various claims on each of them regarding ease-of-use, energy requirements, and the general rigidity and stability of the final structure.

        <em>{So you're claiming that metrics of productivity and strength aren't effective unless we understand why they make people more productive?  Hmmm.  Well, I'm fairly certain that people could provide theories as to why screws or nails are better at productivity or strength, and I'm quite certain that people would do the same for paradigms.  And we ARE talking about paradigms, here, not production development environments (e.g. Visual Dot Net vs. </em>EclipseIDE) or particular languages (<a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> vs. <a href="BrainfuckLanguage.html">BrainfuckLanguage</a>).

        I am saying that it is difficult to factor out other issues with such studies without careful control groups, etc. And, its not realistic to expect that on C2. Instead, we should strive for code-to-code comparisons along with mental and physical steps needed to make changes, etc. As far as paradigms versus languages, I do not wish to commit to a hard distinction of categories for language features, I'm not sure there is one.  Closures and OOP are features just like nested functions, types, Eval(string), etc.

        The bottom line for this topic is that <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> is being like you: lots of claims of superiority of tool with very little inspectable code evidence from real-world-like projects. I label that as elitism. <strong>Truly smart people can show, not just talk.</strong> Paul is not following <a href="HowToSellGoldenHammers.html">HowToSellGoldenHammers</a>.

        <em>{Why would you want a golden hammer when you can have a silver screwdriver? ;-)  I agree that the focus should be on features, but I'd also note that it is </em>'combinations<em>' of features that are most relevant, and it is these feature-packages, or 'ways' of writing code, that are most closely associated with the looser understanding of 'paradigm'.  No single feature ever solves all the problems.  Closures, in a vacuum, have nothing over which to 'close'.}</em>

        Agree - the first thing I did when I started reading about how Lisp was so powerful (several years go) - was download some source code from <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a>. Unfortunately, my attempt failed. I thought maybe he had to offer some tricks in Lisp that I could see in action.. and some inline source snippets of his web store, and maybe even a web framework from him. After all, we'd like to truly see Lisp in practice by the <a href="GoldenHammer.html">GoldenHammer</a> owner - just like those late night As Seen On Tv commercials. Maybe even a flash video proving <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> can code the way he does.
      </p>
      <p>
        One thing we have to consider, is that maybe <a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> is not a hero at all. He's just some person who wrote a web store (<a href="TheBoyNextDoor.html">TheBoyNextDoor</a>). If you think about it - a web store is just a program that totals up t-shirt prices with pants prices. It isn't the most complicated application in the world. He acts, talks, and writes as if he (and Lisp) is some huge hero who has saved the world. Did we need macros, to redefine our shopping carts at run time in order to satisfy our customer who needs a run time definable shopping cart (a customer checking out and using <em>add to cart</em> button, these really should be  macros, folks - and a custom Lisp shopping cart language could be handy).
      </p>
      <p>
        Really, all he did, was write a trivial (but interesting) web store - which probably got torn apart by C++ programmers and put into a typical database application later.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I disagree it's probably trivial. I've built a roll-your-own-auction-website gizmo that's kind of the auction-site equivalent of Paul's e-stores. The concepts may be trivial, but usually there's a lot of subtleties discovered during implementation. For example, there may be one long custom product title that throws off the formatting of the page of a given user-defined store. If detected, one can perhaps change the font size of all the items, or choose a different layout more conducive to long titles. To be competitive you have to pay attention to lots of details. -t

        He's done other things, like help and fund startup companies. He's probably done more things too, just as <strong>many other people</strong> on the internet have done <em>things</em>. But really - he is a lot of talk. He may have created the <em>first</em> web store - just as someone probably created the <em>first</em> trivial (but successful) SNAKE video game in BASIC, once upon a time (see below). If <strong></strong><a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a><strong> had created the first </strong>SNAKE<strong> video game in </strong>Lisp<strong>, we're sure he'd be claiming Lisp was superior and was <em>the real</em> reason he got the </strong>SNAKE<strong> video game completed in </strong>record time<strong>. --</strong><a href="NonTopAnonymousDonor.html">NonTopAnonymousDonor</a>

        In the book "Founders at Work", Paul attributes much of the success of his store system to both luck (timing) and fancy graphics. He said he found a good web graphics expert that knew how to make good but small graphics, including their own logos & buttons, and customer product images. Not much was said about programming language.

        <strong>Code Size and Demonstrations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Somewhere on Paul's website (I couldn't re-find it), he stated that the <strong>primary advantage of Lisp</strong> was brevity: more can be done with less code. He didn't talk about some lofty mathematical elegancy or purity, but pretty much code size. If that's the case, then demonstrating how great Lisp allegedly is, is mostly a matter of demonstrating how it can do the same job with less code. I don't necessarily agree code size (such as <a href="LinesOfCode.html">LinesOfCode</a>) as a primary metric, but am merely pointing out that demonstrating its benefits according to Paul's description should be straightforward and is NOT a matter of <a href="YouJustDontGetIt.html">YouJustDontGetIt</a>, as some imply. In other words, show how Lisp can do more (realistic) stuff with less code. -t

        I'm just repeating what I read. If you are questioning my interpretation, I'll try harder to find it. My point is that using the stated metric, a demonstration would be rather simple and wouldn't require deep Lisp knowledge. And I'm not even attacking Lisp here. I'm a "conceptual admirer" of Lisp.

        <em>I'm not questioning your interpretation.  </em><a href="PaulGraham.html">PaulGraham</a> may well have written it, and he may well believe LOC is a sound rationale for using LISP -- I suppose some example can almost always be found to show language <x> takes fewer lines to do <p> than language <y> -- but I seriously doubt that's why he chose LISP in the first place.  LISP programmers choose LISP for the same reason that Smalltalk programmers choose Smalltalk -- all post-hoc rationale aside, programming in these languages simply <strong>feels good</strong>.  They turn coding into something akin to sex.<em></em>

        That may be, but it's not very objective. It doesn't tell us how to distinguish <a href="MentalMasturbation.html">MentalMasturbation</a> from practical productivity and quality improvements.

        <em>You're right, it's not very objective.  So?</em>

        Paul implies it is mostly objective. But since he's not here, I cannot ask him why he doesn't create size demos to evangelize Lisp.

        <em>I cannot see the value of </em><a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> (however I'm used to rely on reference counting and automatic destruction for in-core objects).

        Reference counting GC is still one of two canonical forms of GC (the other being tracing GC; most automatic GC is a hybrid of the two). The primary objection to naive forms of reference counting is high expense for tracking short-lived references (e.g. references on the stack) and limitations for collecting cycles. For manual reference counting, mistakes aren't uncommon. Good programs can be written without GC, but it becomes very difficult to determine <em>when</em> to destroy objects once you start using features such as callback frameworks, plugins, concurrency. Library based smart pointers have a difficult time working across independently developed libraries or frameworks.
