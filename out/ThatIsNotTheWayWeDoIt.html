        This is a complaint we here for the folks who are usually satisfies and who say such things as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If it aint broke, don't fix it
        </li>
        <li>
           We've always done it like this
        </li>
        <li>
           You're just reinventing the wheel
        </li>
        <li>
           How is this better?
        </li>
        <li>
           ... add more here
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It is a statement which one must consider as a potential argument against whatever needs to be done better and in a different way.
      </p>

      <p>
        <em>How is this better?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, that's a very reasonable and prudent question. Exactly how <em>is</em> this better than what we're doing now? Different isn't better because it's different.
