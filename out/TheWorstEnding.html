        The Worst Ending
      </h1>
      <p>
        Ever like a movie, only to have it ruined by a bad ending? Here are some candidates...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>BEWARE OF SPOILERS</strong>  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="InTheBedroom.html">InTheBedroom</a> -- actually, I didn't like any part of this movie, but the ending was worse
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>disagree, I liked the ending -- not that I liked what happened, but I thought it was a good way to end the movie (can't figure out how to be more specific without generating a spoiler)</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="AiTheMovie.html">AiTheMovie</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>disagree, I loved the ending: it was bold and touching</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>also disagree, horror movies never creeped me out as bad as this one.</em>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   I agree that there was something really creepy and twisted about it. It certainly stepped up the genre of android torture and trauma, if not creating it outright. It's a movie that you cannot get out of your head.  
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>well actually, the first ending was pretty cool. The second ending just made no sense; by the third ending it started getting pretty wussy though.</em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The Abyss -- agree.  ending sucked bad. --<a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>disagree, thought it was awesome</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>hmm, there are two versions with distinctly different endings, one of them I like, the other I don't!</em>

           Sphere <em>The whole movie sucked. The ending was great, but poorly done. READ THE BOOK.</em>  (The book sucked too.)

            <li>
               <em>Sphere is the only book I have ever chucked across a room.</em>

               <em>The first one? I and a lot of my friends really liked the first </em>MortalKombatMovie. What about the ending puts it on this list?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>The movie itself was fun, it was the ending that was a groaner. "Yay, we saved the world!" <Giant demon pops out of nowhere> "NOT SO FAST! HA HA HA!" (Yes but you forgot to mention that just after that all the heroes jump and make cool karate poses and the theme music pops up and it actually looks cool! hmm no.)</em>

           TheLittleMermaid - Of course Disney couldn't bring the fairy tale by HansChristianAndersen to the movies without making a HappyEnd. :-(
        </li>
        <li>
           BattlefieldEarth (worst beginning, middle and end)
        </li>
        <li>
           FinalFantasyVII It's one of the most popular videogames in history. And the ending takes half a CD-ROM (it is a CG movie), and royally sucks. Which is a shame, because the story is very good.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        As opposed to a good ending:
      </p>
      <code>
        Let four captains <br/>
        Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage,<br/>
        For he was likely, had he been put on,<br/>
        To have prov'd most royal; and for his passage,<br/>
        The soldier's music and the rite of war<br/>
        Speak loudly for him.<br/>
