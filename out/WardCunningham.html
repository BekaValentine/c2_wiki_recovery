        I also edit a lot of pages. The single most common edit I do is to place related comments together. The second most common edit is to delete the duplication that becomes obvious once comments are adjacent. This works because I, as editor, can rely on context that wasn't present when the contributions were made. My third most common edit is to remove "protocol words" that may be required in conversation but are not important to the future reader. For example, someone might start a post by explaining that they don't mean to offend. I would remove such an introduction and then edit the remaining comment so that it simply does not offend.

        <em>When Wiki was new, I wrote a page about myself that sprawled over half a dozen page names describing various places I've worked. While editors have been kind enough to let those pages persist, authors have been wise enough to not follow that example. I've now brought all that content home:</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years I've learned a few things...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Highland High School</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I learned to program while in high school in the middle sixties. My buddy JerryDijak was learning to program in IITRAN using the teletype that had recently been installed in Mr Clark's math room. He explained that you wrote <em>instructions</em> for the computer to follow. Then he showed me the program he was working on. It was mostly incomprehensible, except for the occasional instruction like...
      </p>
      <code>
        go to town<br/>
        go to bed<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I was fascinated that such instructions might make sense to a computer. I now know that they meant nothing, that Jerry had missed an opportunity to make meaningful labels, and that goto's are bad on principle. Still, I have a certain fondness for goto's since they got me started in computing.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hi Ward, just wanted to say that it has always amazed me that programmers (and I am one of them), seem to universally condemn GOTO, yet it is in most languages I have used. If it is so horrendous why do we not just remove it from the syntax, or do we still find a guilty pleasure in finding uses for it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Thanks for these pages; they are a pleasure to read. -- jss</em>

He had better abstractions. He'd been studying <a href="IvanSutherland.html">IvanSutherland</a>.

        <strong>Tektronix</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I joined <a href="TekLabs.html">TekLabs</a> out of school. I liked the name. It reminded me of <a href="BellLabs.html">BellLabs</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tektronix did a lot of early microprocessor work in a system affectionately called a <a href="BoardBucket.html">BoardBucket</a>. Hardware guys would whip up all kinds of neat boards. There was even a MicroprocessorFair where some were shown off.
      </p>
      <p>
        But the board bucket wasn't going to scale to 16-bit processors. So <a href="JohnProvidenza.html">JohnProvidenza</a> built a few systems for us on the then emerging MultiBus backplane. They were shared-memory multi-processors. John did excellent work. But a system's only as good as its components...

           MicroProcessorHadBugs
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I wrote the operating system and most of the applications for this system. I was very good at debugging. A few lost souls would try to use an InCircuitEmulator in this environment. They spent most of their time debugging the ICE. I used a handful of homemade tools...

        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some were my own design. Others were by JeffBradford. All were specially designed to work in the multi-processor environment. They were particularly good for hunting problems that weren't easily identified as hardware or software.
      </p>
      <p>
        I got tired of working on small machines. I moved into integrated circuit design when that field started showing some respect for software guys. They were at least buying them big computers. I found designing with bare transistors to be much easier than prepackaged ICs. I studied chip architecture. I particularly liked the SystolicPriorityQueue which I thought of while designing the PictureModelChip.
      </p>
      <p>
        I used Smalltalk to build a silicon compiler. I got more points for making something out of Smalltalk than I ever got for making anything out of silicon.

      <p>
        I left Tektronix convinced that I knew how to organize large programs as objects. I underestimated how distracting schedule pressure would be. Still, I managed to keep our development flexible enough to respond to unanticipated change. I used a process that we would now call refactoring. Over time I adjusted how we scheduled and explained that schedule to management. Here are a couple of documents written as the impact of what I was doing was starting to emerge in my thoughts.

        I'm interested in large scale systems with distributed control.
        I take my inspiration from economics, politics, language, learning, culture and, of course, life itself. I'm most satisfied when I write software that borrows from such systems. I'm working on a distributed architecture that favors robustness over correctness. If you think you will miss correctness, consider these questions from the fields I mention:

        A few elections ago a fellow I knew put up a web site with his own platform as if he were running for president. Of course some of his ideas were outside the reach of the office. But who cares? It was fun. Here is my version. Were I to run for president, this would be my platform.

           The combination of an aging population and a blossoming of biotechnology means that we will spend more on health care.

           The relentless growth in population and corresponding consumption of resources means less for everyone, even us. My administration will attack the consumption spiral by redefining want. We will start by replacing the advertising industry with an information industry, first by nationalizing Google, and then by rewriting trademark, copyright and patent law to favor distribution of that which is easily duplicated, and conservation of that which is not.

If the smart kids want to compete for validictorian, let their parents form a booster club and host bake sales to pay for the examinations.

        Hi Ward,
        It would be helpful if the name S_Expressions were allowable/interpreted as a link to a page title; i.e. if "_" counted as a lower case letter. There is some discussion on the page <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a>, which no one considers to be a good name for Lisp "S-Expressions", and which someone recently renamed "<a href="SymbolicExpressions.html">SymbolicExpressions</a>", but that name means many, many things beyond just Lisp S-Expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        And over the years when coding and using <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a>, I've run across many instances similar to this where an underscore was really the way to go, to separate otherwise adjacent capital letters.
      </p>
      <p>
        So what do you say, would it harm anything for underscore to count as lower case, thus allowing "S_Expressions"?
        thanks,

        Doug - wouldn't people then start using underscores to separate words? I mean, it would be tempting. Also, aren't <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s <a href="TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">TheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>? -- EarleMartin

        Good points. As for simplest, sure, things have worked without this change until now. On the other hand, there <strong>are</strong> these occasional troublesome cases. I have no problem with "<a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>", but "<a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a>" just doesn't look right, it <strong>always</strong> looks like a kludged hack workaround. I think it's because it doesn't begin with "S", whereas "<a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>" does begin with "C". There are other cases that don't work well (not that I've kept a list). <em>Is Ses instead of Ess too much of a perversion?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As for misuse of the proposed feature, it would be fairly trivial to limit its use to only the situation where underscore follows a single capital letter, so that e.g. Lisp_Language would fail the rule and not be recognized as a <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>, removing the temptation to start using this with abandon. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>

        It bugged me when I first started lurking too, but now that I've gotten used to the <a href="WikiAlphabet.html">WikiAlphabet</a>, Ess looks more natural than S_. Besides, you could argue that

      <code>
        (let ((S_Expressions <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a>))<br/>
        (read-page S_Expressions)<br/>
        (edit-page S_Expressions))<br/>

        For your goals, perhaps. For Ward's goals, this may be the perfect way to do it. Who knows? He certainly could do any kind of manual or automatic intervention he pleases. Since he mostly doesn't, you shouldn't be so sure you can guess what he is really up to.
      </p>
      <p>
        Originally, he participated himself. Now he barely does. His old friends (first the patterns community, later XP folks) are long gone; the current crowd (like me) are basically squatters. The topical direction of the wiki is all over the map. There are any number of possible goals he has these days that might be quite different than what you'd guess.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, maybe it's a long-running science experiment, and it would invalidate the results to do things differently prior to a pre-designated end. Who knows?

        I was using <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiWikiWeb">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?WikiWikiWeb</a> page as a means to discuss with others who are concerned with the future of wiki, while C2 is locked out from edits. A week later there have not been much activity on that page.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some locked out people have started to use </em><a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ShortMessagesWikiWikiWeb">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?ShortMessagesWikiWikiWeb</a> for key requests, etc. Do you have another edit key that can be passed out by existing key holders?<em></em>

        <li>
           A secondary key is useful in case the key is passed out to the wrong party.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Meanwhile if you can make sandbox exempt from your edit lock out scheme then new users can still experiment with concept of wiki. Also consider a note on FrontPage and WelcomeVisitors to inform occasional visitors of temporary changes, not many people know about WikiWikiSystemNotice (I first learned about it in 8 months or so earlier) -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a>

I was looking for EDGE (GPRS) material and can no longer rely on <a href="GoogleSearch.html">GoogleSearch</a> on C2 site to locate such information.

        I would also like to have AutoPcn permitted to be run again, if the original owner is willing to operate it. It would be good to have a watchlist similar to <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> in action.

        Ward - I'm a wiki/blog/RSS geek, and have implemented a company-wide pedia-like wiki at Intel with great success. People love it, and it's quickly supplanting the more complex and clunky tools for collaboration. I'm also a podcaster/videoblogger, both personally (<a href="http://www.tinyscreenfuls.com)">http://www.tinyscreenfuls.com)</a> and at Intel. Would you be interested in coming in to Intel to talk about wikis, open source, or another topic of your choosing? I was thrilled to learn that the inventor of the wiki lives almost literally in my backyard, and I'd love to meet you, and start some conversation at Intel.

        Hi Ward
      </p>
      <p>
        At work we're running a really old version of <a href="DevWiki.html">DevWiki</a>. I was wondering how difficult it is to migrate from this to your latest version (supplied with the book if I understand it correctly)?
      </p>
      <p>
        The truth is that the existing version works for us but would work so much better if we could manage versions and create some pages as Read-Only.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks for the years of useful Wikiing we've had.
      </p>
      <p>

        <em>FYI Ward responds on this page extremely rarely (approximately never), although he sometimes responds to email. He's a busy guy, what can I say.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The wiki supplied with the book is the latest </em>'available<em>', but is by no means the current running version, which is not available for a variety of reasons. I believe the book's wiki is considered interesting if you plan to hack the code, otherwise an actively supported wiki code base is probably preferable.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For a starting point on which wikis to consider using, see </em><a href="ChoosingaWiki.html">ChoosingaWiki</a> - but be aware that such discussions are not particularly kept up to date; there are a truly bewildering number of wiki flavors these days.<em></em>

        I have only just found out that Mr. Cunningham has joined <a href="AboutUs.html">AboutUs</a>. It is a terrible shame that a man with such ingenuity has turned his back on real Wiki development and joined an organisation which could simply be described as a 'Web Scraper' (see Wikipedia for the definition). They are not a real Wiki as their contents are built from the automated harvesting of other peoples hard work.
