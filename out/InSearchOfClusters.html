        In Search Of Clusters

        <em>In Search of Clusters (The Ongoing Battle in Lowly Parallel Computing (2nd Edition)</em>
        by Gregory Pfister, Prentice Hall, 1997
        [ISBN 0138997098]  or try [ISBN 0134376250]

        This is an easy-on-the-brain introduction to the 
        notion of clustering computers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Traditionally, parallel processing (or even distributed 
        processing, or even dealing with concurrency issues) is 
        an arcane subject, full of tricky side-passages and 
        the occasional assertion that, in order to correctly
        design code, you must use the correct modal logic 
        and thrice ask for the god's blessing (If memory serves, 
        the appropriate logic is S5).
      </p>
      <p>
        Clusters are a recent notion in parallelism. The
        basic notion is that there are two dominant trends 
        in computing: the ever-faster single processor, and
        the ever-increasing need for reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faster processors means that we don't need 65,536 
        processors wired together in a liquid-nitrogen cooled
        box to solve difficult problems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And the need for reliability means that we do need
        at least one more processor, preferably in a different 
        box. And that this better be easy to set up / use
        (because the need is widespread and there ain't but
        a few people who can hang with the earlier notions
        of parallelism). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Which is, sorta, what clusters are all about. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The book is interesting, funny, and manages to cover an 
        awful lot of information without either becoming overly 
        technical *or* glossing over difficult issues. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not saying it'll be the last book you'll ever buy
        on clustering or parallel programming. But it probably 
        ought to be the first.

        If I'm understanding what "clusters" means correctly, for a 
        real-world example of clusters at work, take a look at
        <a href="http://www.distributed.net/">http://www.distributed.net/</a> which uses idle time on Internet-connected 
        computers to solve DES/RC5 keys. --<a href="KatyMulvey.html">KatyMulvey</a>

        Oh, there are billions of examples. Many in the real world and
        many announced. That's part of the point of the book (which,
        alas, I neglected to mentioned). While academics and other
        researchers mostly focused on the "crunch a hard problem"
        notion of parallelism (things of the form "simulate the world's
        weather in real time"), out in the world of everyday computing
        different notions of parallelism arose. Clusters being one
        of them.
      </p>

        The book starts with a genial introduction and then, in chapter
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          , has an extensive list and discussion of examples. The idea

      </ol>
      <p>
        being that a long list of specific instances helps to ground
        the rest of the discussion.

        Pfisters book is very enjoyable if you are into this stuff. He
        is obviously a man of great experience, which he seems to enjoy
        passing on to others.

        He explains well how cluster systems are both similar to, and 
        different from, both parallel systems and distributed systems.
