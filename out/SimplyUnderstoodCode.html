        Pattern: <strong>Simply Understood Code</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        ...at the lowest levels of a program are chunks of code. These are the places that need to be understood to
        confidently make changes to a program, and ultimately
        understanding a program thoroughly requires understanding
        these chunks.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           * * 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In many pieces of code the problem of disorientation
        is acute. People have no idea what each component of the
        code is for and they experience considerable mental stress
        as a result.
      </p>
      <p>
        Suppose you are writing a chunk of code that is not so
        complex that it requires extensive documentation or else it
        is not central enough that the bother of writing such
        documentation is worth the effort, especially if the code
        is clear enough on its own. How should you approach writing
        this code?
      </p>
      <p>
        People need to stare at code in order to understand it
        well enough to feel secure making changes to it. Spending
        time switching from window to window or scrolling up and
        down to see all the relevant portions of a code fragment
        takes attention away from understanding the code and
        gaining confidence to modify it.
      </p>
      <p>
        People can more readily understand things that they
        can read in their natural text reading order; for Western
        culture this is generally left to right, top to bottom.
      </p>
      <p>
        If code cannot be confidently understood, it will be
        accidentally broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore,</em>
        Arrange the important parts of the code so
        it fits on one page. Make that code understandable to a
        person reading it from top to bottom. Do not require the
        code to be repeatedly scanned in order to understand how
        data is used and how control moves about.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           * * 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This pattern can be achieved by using the following
        patterns: <a href="LocalVariablesDefinedAndUsedOnOnePage.html">LocalVariablesDefinedAndUsedOnOnePage</a>,
        which tries to keep local variables on one page; <a href="AssignVariablesOnce.html">AssignVariablesOnce</a>, which tries to minimize code
        scanning by
        having variables changed just once; <a href="LocalVariablesReassignedAboveTheirUses.html">LocalVariablesReassignedAboveTheirUses</a>, which tries to make a
        variable's value apparent before its value is used while
        scanning from top to bottom; <a href="MakeLoopsApparent.html">MakeLoopsApparent</a>, which
        helps people understand parts of a program that are
        non-linear while retaining the ability to scan them
        linearly; and Use <a href="FunctionsForLoops.html">FunctionsForLoops</a>, which packages
        complex loop structure involving several state variables
        into chunks, each of which can be easily understood.
