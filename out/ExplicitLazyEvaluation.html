        Explicit Lazy Evaluation
      </h1>
      <p>
        Use of existing language features to emulate <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a> in an eager programming language.  (Most mainstream programming languages, other than the Haskell family, are eager by default. Note that strict evaluation refers to completely evaluating a function's arguments before execution, while eager evaluation refers to evaluation of an expression as soon as it is bound).
      </p>
      <p>
        The usual technique is to create a function/object which when called (or has a well-known method invoked on it), yields the desired result.  The function/object should then save the result away, so that subsequent calls yield the same result.  (Otherwise, you have <a href="NormalOrderEvaluation.html">NormalOrderEvaluation</a>).  Note that the state transitions required are monotonic, so that this isn't considered too offensive in a <a href="SideEffect.html">SideEffect</a>-free context.  (<a href="ConceptsTechniquesAndModelsOfComputerProgramming.html">ConceptsTechniquesAndModelsOfComputerProgramming</a> discusses this in great depth).
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that the function/object <em>must</em> have some state, to record whether or not the result has been evaluated, and to store the result if it has.  A standard <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a> function won't work; a <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a> will (or an "emulated closure", which consists of a function and a pointer to some state).  Objects will work fine.
      </p>

        Some languages make this easier than others:

      <ul>
        <li>
           In C, it's a royal pain.
        </li>
        <li>
           In C++, it's easily doable with <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s, though C++'s lack of <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a> makes dealing with <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s a bit more difficult.  (<a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>s are often used in ways that make explicit allocation/deallocation difficult).  The <a href="BoostLibraries.html">BoostLibraries</a> have lots of goodies to help with this.
        </li>

           Another approach you could do in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> (I can't think of any examples however) is with a lazy <a href="SmartPointer.html">SmartPointer</a>.  By overloading the various dereferencing forms in C++ (operator *, operator ->, operator []) one is provided with a "hook" where one can attach the test-and-evaluate step.  Unlike other forms, this one is <em>almost</em> transparent.  If you provide such a beastie with a (non-explicit) copy constructor which takes a pointer on the RHS, then you can use real pointers and these things interchangeable FTMP.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> does this (sort of) with blocks.  However, <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> blocks by default implement <a href="NormalOrderEvaluation.html">NormalOrderEvaluation</a> (if you send the value message to a block twice, the block is executed twice), additional work is needed to make Smalltalk blocks implement true <a href="LazyEvaluation.html">LazyEvaluation</a>.  (In many lazy Smalltalk idioms, such as ifTrue: ifFalse:, the block is never evaluated more than once, so this is not necessary for those forms).
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> has delay and force, which essentially create and call the necessary lambda forms.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="OcamlLanguage.html">OcamlLanguage</a> has lazy and Lazy.force, which create and force delayed expressions. Delayed expressions have the type Lazy.t . See <a href="ExplicitLazyProgramming.html">ExplicitLazyProgramming</a>
