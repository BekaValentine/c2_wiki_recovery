      <p>
        <a href="GoogleTagCombinations.html">GoogleTagCombinations</a> are blank- or "+"-sign- deliminated sequences of <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> words.
      </p>
      <p>
        They are used for Google queries, which lead with a higher probability to resulting Wiki Pages,
        thus fostering IncidentalCollaboration.

      <p>
        A <a href="GoogleTagWiki.html">GoogleTagWiki</a> engine is needed to support them.

        <em>Fridemar - quite possibly you actually have something interesting to say, but your continual use of buzzwords, and your overly succinct expression, makes it really, really hard to work out what the hell you're on about.  Why don't you try actually writing prose.  Try writing an explanation of what you're doing, and what you're talking about.  As it is, the things you've written leave me with a vague disquiet that there's something going on, but I can't work out what it is.  Maybe I'm alone, and perhaps if someone can't work out what you're saying then you don't actually want them anyway, but I just thought I'd let you know that with at least some people, you're not communicating successfully.</em>

I invite you to visit <a href="http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CMapsSandbox">http://www.usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?CMapsSandbox</a> and the pages, bilinked from there, hoping that I can convince you to appreciate the rationale behind it. -- <a href="FridemarPache.html">FridemarPache</a>
