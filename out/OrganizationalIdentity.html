        Organizational Identity
      </h1>
      <p>
        There have been a number of discussions running together to form an idea of what identity is for people and for <a href="SystemsAsLivingThings.html">SystemsAsLivingThings</a>: organizations.  See <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a> and <a href="ConstructiveInterference.html">ConstructiveInterference</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've heard it said that there are two roles in an organization: manager and leader.  They are fluid and they have little to do with title.  The anecdote that I heard had a bunch of people cutting through the forest.  A manager is someone who makes sure that everyone is getting fed, that there aren't many squabbles and that everyone's axe is sharp.  A leader is someone who climbs to the top of a tree and yells "wrong forest!"
      </p>
      <p>
        For organizations, I would say that a manager is someone who is the custodian of <a href="OrganizationalIdentity.html">OrganizationalIdentity</a>.  He/she does this to ensure the organization's survival.  A leader is someone who provokes identity crises at times to ensure the organization's survival.  The latter is a risky role.

      <p>
        In <a href="ConstructiveInterference.html">ConstructiveInterference</a>, <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> relates an example where he shakes up the pecking order in a team to make sure that the best ideas come forth regardless of politics and loudmouthery.  Could this be a form of IdentitySurgery?  Regarding <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>'s comments in <a href="DramaticIdentity.html">DramaticIdentity</a>, it seems that this type of intervention which provides more freedom for the disenfranchised is part of the increasing the health of <a href="SystemsAsLivingThings.html">SystemsAsLivingThings</a> (the <a href="LaoTse.html">LaoTse</a> notion, democracy winning over totalitarianism).

        But my <a href="OrganizationalIdentity.html">OrganizationalIdentity</a> doesn't listen to me, or seem to care whether I exist!  <em>You need help -- See </em><a href="DrWiki.html">DrWiki</a><em></em>
