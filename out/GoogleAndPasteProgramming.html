        <em>If someone else </em>'on this project<strong> has already solved this problem </strong>in this code base<em>', then we should reuse the code.</em>

        <em>Also, while a good example can be very helpful to the learning experience, tweaking code you don't understand until it's so confused that you can no longer see where it might fail isn't a very good approach for producing reliable solutions.</em>

        This backfired on me once. I had a web-based app with a typical CRUD form. It had a spot to enter a date range. I had server-side validation for these dates and it was simple because the app language provided a date validation routine out-of-the-box. However, the customer wanted client-side validation also. I couldn't find a reliable built-in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> function, so instead combed the web for one, and found such a critter. It seemed to work upon testing, and it looked okay upon code inspection, so I put it in. Low-and-behold about 4 months later it stopped working. It turns out the default value evaluator assumed any value entered was <strong>octal</strong> if it had a leading zero. Thus, "8/1/2007" would pass, but not "08/01/2007". Since octal allows the digits 0 through 7, it passed fine earlier in the year. (I think newer versions of JS have a date validation function, but at the time it was too new to assume every browser had the newer JS.)
