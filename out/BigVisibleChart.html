        Big Visible Chart
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes a behavior is learnable, but not yet learned. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> may create a chart that shows the status (usually over time). By putting this chart in the public area, everybody gets a reminder of where the team is on this, and visual feedback of the team's progress.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, many teams have a graph showing the progress of <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s over time - how many tests passed, how many failed. Or the team may have a chart showing status for each test.
      </p>
      <p>
        As another example, <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> once created a matrix with developers listed on both axes, and asked people to put a check in the box for each person they paired with during the iteration.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the behavior is internalized, the team will often remove the chart.

        <strong>Single Person Projects (</strong><a href="MicroIsv.html">MicroIsv</a>-s)<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Big Visible Charts aren't just beneficial to teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        For a single person project, the priority is on:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           accountability to my stakeholders (family) 
        </li>
        <li>
           focus (to keep me working on the right things)
        </li>
        <li>
           urgency (to constantly remind me how much work still needs to be done)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        To satisfy these purposes my BVC has:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Work Breakdown Structure (printed by MS Project)
        </li>
        <li>
           Schedule (a linear calendar of 4 weeks)
        </li>
        <li>
           Backlog Tasks cards (taken from WBS to show what is coming up)
        </li>
        <li>
           Current Scheduled Tasks cards (taken from WBS to show what is currently being done)
        </li>
        <li>
           Recently Completed Tasks cards (to show stakeholders what has been accomplished)
        </li>
      </ul>
