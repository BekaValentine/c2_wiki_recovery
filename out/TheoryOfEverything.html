        Theory Of Everything
      </h1>
      <p>
        Physicists in their attempt to unify and simplify are on the verge of discovering a <a href="TheoryOfEverything.html">TheoryOfEverything</a>. How they will do this is explained below:
      </p>
      <p>
        First assume that it is possible to construct such a theory if enough background assumptions are not introduced.
      </p>
      <p>
        Second assume that some undiscovered force is responsible for gravity, light, matter, and energy. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Third assign this force to be the work of very small particles of great mass.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fourth gather several of these particles and demonstrate that the force relates gravity, light matter and energy with a single equation. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then explain why.
