      <p>
        Steve Willoughby is a software developer, who, in his tender, impressionable teenage years encountered UNIX and a mentor named <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>. He's never been quite the same since. [0]

      <p>
        (He did get revenge, however, by hiring a traveling magician to practice his art on Ward's kids during his (Steve's) wedding reception. :) It's okay, they've recovered by now, we're sure.)

        Here's his standard research paper bio line: [2]
      </p>
      <p>
        Steve Willoughby is a Senior Application Developer for Intel's ISTG (i.e., IT) Engineering Computing group (which serves the DPG Engineering group, the chip design team which is responsible for the Pentium4(R)/Willamette/Northwood/etc. line of processors). He's been there for the past eleven years playing (at various times) Auspex Administrator, Postmaster, local Security Czar, Perl Programming Teacher, maker of software applications, and Manager of makers of software applications.

      <p>
        He discovered Version 7 Unix while in high school (ca. 1980) and, apart from brief forays into VMS in college and failed attempts to hide from other operating systems, he's been spending most waking hours tinkering on UNIX in one form or another, either writing software or administering systems.

      <p>
        He lives in the Portland, Oregon area with his wife, kids and assorted small furry creatures. He keeps a vintage Altair 8800 as a pet. In his spare time, he tries to avoid running a MUD game (<a href="http://www.rag.com).">http://www.rag.com).</a> He can be reached by E-mail at <steve@alchemy.com>.

        [1] Although, why he insists on speaking of himself in the third person is still a mystery.

        [2] Cool... that actually makes it sound like there have actually been a number of papers! Other than scores of internal documents, there's really only been one real, honest, published paper to date: <a href="http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/lisa99/willoughby.html">http://www.usenix.org/publications/library/proceedings/lisa99/willoughby.html</a>
