        What is the reality of global warming? What a silly question, it's the one you create of course! Whenever you find yourself faced with conflicting data in your daily experience, it's because you are choosing between probabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        To understand the reality of global warming, you must first understand a little of the reality of the Earth itself. This will be the briefest of summaries, and I am generalizing here for the sake of convienience so do not take what is written here as being etched in stone.

      </p>
      <p>
        The Earth, like you is a conscious entity, one who is well aware of all
        the life forms on its surface, and it regularly shifts its energy in
        an effort to balance all those forms. The Earth has a much greater
        multidimensional awareness of itself, and will often move water, land
        and even species across probable divides as it balances various aspects
        of itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Trees, for example, don't experience linear time as you do. This is true for the Earth as well,
        and it easily perceives the long term results of mankind's activities,
        and makes its own choices and adjustments accordingly. The knowledge of
        these adjustments is shared telepathically with all creatures on the
        planet, including man. Every event, from the largest earthquake to the
        smallest April shower, is known about in advance, and is participated in
        willingly by those who experience it. You already know this consciously of course, but when 'tragedy strikes' you tend to jump into the drama emotionally and sacrifice that level of awareness.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who carry the belief that mankind is only harming the Earth
        every minute of every day, they are sorely limited in their
        viewpoints, and are deliberately blinding themselves to a more balanced
        perspective. Most often, it is because they do not understand either
        their own natural creativity or that of the planet itself. They will
        argue that the planet would be best if we left it undisturbed, however
        if that was what the Earth wanted, you would have disappeared from its
        surface centuries ago.
      </p>
      <p>
        For those who believe that mankind is only harmful, they should be
        grateful that the consciousness of the Earth is not the precocious,
        childish sort of personality which was often placed on your gods. The
        Earth is of course far more rich and complex, and well beyond the
        duality of male/female, and the role of Mother (or father). These are
        common anthropomorphisms and misinterpretations by those who try to
        understand this great being in a more familiar way.
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, it senses, as your own statisticians do that the world
        population is growing; and in response to this growth the Earth expands
        its girth and raises its temperature ever so slightly. In most
        probabilities, there will in fact be more and greener farmland on the
        planet than there is right now. In these probabilities, Arctic ice will
        retreat, but not completely disappear, nor will the Antarctic ice sheets
        fully melt.
      </p>
      <p>
        The polar ice caps have never been static, and you are only just
        starting to become aware of their natural mini-cycles. Human beings are
        not the only animals who create pollution, and the process of freezing
        and melting over the centuries helps in the filtering and cleansing of
        the planetary water. You might be surprised to learn that even during
        the most intense Ice Ages on your planet, there have been times where
        open water has flowed at or near the poles for several years at a time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will tell you now, to satisfy your own curiosity that concerning the
        global climate, there are three major paths of probability which you are
        currently on. On two of these paths, you will experience a slight rise
        in the global mean temperature, however it will never come near the
        hysteria that is being promoted even by your more 'respectable'
        scientists. On the third path, the temperature will spike more quickly,
        due to the influence of several naturally occurring events, but then
        there will be a rather sharp correction as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Some Warming</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        On the most likely probable path, the one that you (John) are guided
        towards right now, nothing in the way of 'major earth changes' happens
        over the next century on your planet. There will be some warming, and the benefits of
        this will be realized when mankind adapts. Coastlines will erode as they
        always have, and in some areas people will need to move away, but they
        will not be washed away unless they are too stubborn to acknowledge when
        the water is washing over their feet!
      </p>
      <p>
        There will still be hurricanes, tornadoes, earthquakes, volcanoes and
        low lying areas will periodically be flooded, and people will continue
        to die when they live in these areas. And people will continue to choose
        to live in these areas, as they always have, and their inner selves
        will know with certainty when storms and tsunamis are coming, and some
        will step aside to drier ground, while others will rush headlong to be
        in their path.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there will be no major re-structuring of the continents, all
        the various maps that are being produced are metaphorical in nature and
        not physical. You are at a crux of many probable paths, a rather intense
        one similar in nature to the early 20th century in your history. Imagine
        yourself poised at the edge of a diving board ready to jump. There are
        those in the mass consciousness who are so afraid to jump that they want
        to turn around and go back down the ladder. Many will eventually
        overcome this fear, but this process will take 'time' from your waking
        perspective. In the grand drama of your daily lives, it seems as if the
        events of the world are grinding too slowly or even backwards at times.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Dramatic Melting</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the second, less likely path you will experience some of the drama of
        global warming, including a dramatic melting of the ice caps and a loss
        of some coastline areas. Even in this scenario, nothing is as dire as
        many are making it out to be. For example, the North American continent
        will still look essentially the same from space.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are considerably more storms on this path, and physical wars on
        your planet to match. In the United States, there is a near-civil war as
        religious vs. secular forces reach a crisis point. There are pockets of
        violence, but not all out war because in this reality it suddenly
        becomes abundantly clear that there are far fewer religious zealots in
        the United States than more rationally minded people.
      </p>
      <p>
        In Europe, there is a split between old Europe, those countries which
        have existed for centuries, and the 'new.' Those countries which have
        been emerging since the end of the Soviet empire. Some of this split is
        along religious lines, mirroring the secular vs. zealotism the United
        States experiences. A second Union is attempted by these newer states,
        however it does not hold together very long.
      </p>
      <p>
        In both these paths, you will see the ultimate demise of religious
        zealotism as a political power in your reality. In the second scenario,
        it goes kicking and screaming into that good night, creating the weather
        events as well. By 2030, more moderate minds are in control of all the
        major governments on your planet. It is far from perfect, but the
        beginnings of a unified vision for a healthy future develops.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Sudden Ice Age</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the third and least likely probable future, you experience a very
        sudden ice age, as a handful of researchers have indicated. In some
        cities around the world, entire populations are lost, literally frozen
        over in a matter of hours. A full third of the human population is
        killed within weeks, and there will be a continued die off for several
        years to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this new world, most governments have collapsed. The onset will be
        far too fast for the infrastructures to adapt. Even those in tropical
        areas are so dependent on global support, that once the full effects of
        the new Ice Age are felt, their economies fall apart. It shouldn't be
        too hard to see what beliefs lead to this extreme, here's a hint, you
        can't spell frigid without 'rigid.' Rigid, unyielding beliefs lead one
        down to survival modes, in which only the most limited thought patterns
        are given creative power. In this world, survival is the only issue, and
        this portion of human energy takes a step backward to re-evaluate itself
        as it slowly grows to repopulate the Earth again.
      </p>
      <p>
        In case you're wondering how likely these probabilities are, the first
        one is 90% likely to occur in your current experience, the second 9.99%
        and the final scenario .01%. There are of course many variations of
        events within these scenarios, particularly the first one which has the
        most potential for positive growth in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Remember that you specifically asked about <a href="GlobalWarming.html">GlobalWarming</a> for this
        session, thus I did not touch on your technological or spiritual
        futures, there are of course some interesting paths ahead and I will
        gladly comment on those in future sessions.
      </p>
      <p>
        The easiest way to navigate probabilities is to maintain an open and
        flexible perspective in all situations. When fear and doubt dominate
        your thought patterns, you automatically close down those unseen paths
        that might offer solutions. You must let yourself feel that a solution
        exists, even if there's no indication of it. If you can say with
        certainty about any situation, that you believe a 'solution will come
        up' then you have already opened that door for a better opportunity to
        manifest.

        It is interesting to note that global temperatures were 10-15 degrees warmer in the age of the Dinosoars. If they’d evolved intelligence they’d want to keep it that way. On the other hand we need to stabilize the environment for ourselves. It is estimated that a 5% allocation of defense spending would significantly improve things. Regardless of our ideological beliefs, an stable environment would reduce SocialUnrest hence the need for defense spending, this would create a PositiveFeedbackLoop.
