        Wiki At Twenty Thousand
      </h1>
      <p>
        Yippee - Wiki's 20,000th (and my first)... 13.45 GMT (I know) March 18th, 2002. -- <a href="MartinCooper.html">MartinCooper</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For the record, <a href="JoeOtten.html">JoeOtten</a> created <a href="DelphiPatterns.html">DelphiPatterns</a>, number 19,999, about a half hour before the threshold number was noticed and this page created. 
      </p>
      <p>
        After that the <a href="WikiSpringCleaning.html">WikiSpringCleaning</a> came in and the number dropped again. At March 21st, 06:39 AM (Eastern) <a href="BorlandButtons.html">BorlandButtons</a> had the honor to be the 20,000th page, but was the third such page, since <a href="ParaDox.html">ParaDox</a> got there first by several hours - I didn't note the exact time.
      </p>
      <p>
        {According to the history on my browser, I started editing <a href="BorlandButtons.html">BorlandButtons</a> on 21/03/01, at about 12:24 GMT. <a href="ParaDox.html">ParaDox</a> I did a bit earlier, but not several hours... it was an immediate predecessor, I'm sure. But I've been back since and it shows a later "last-visit" time in the history. Whups. <grin> -- <a href="KatieLucas.html">KatieLucas</a>}

      <p>
        Hold on a second here ... There's a search on <a href="PageTwentyThousandHistory.html">PageTwentyThousandHistory</a> that still states: <strong>No pages found out of 19965 titles searched.</strong> Is it too early to pop the cork? -- Eric Herman <em>It has been popped three times now 21stMarch</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some empty and abandoned home pages and other non-useful pages were deleted soon after this, our 20,000th page, was created. That means we now get to watch for our second 20,000th page. [Which turned out to be <a href="ParaDox.html">ParaDox</a>.]

      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Full text search uses an index that is only updated daily. The search above is a title only search that queries the active database and therefore gives an accurate count. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> (slightly paraphrased)

        It sure would be interesting to see what would happen if wiki had a hard technological limit of 20,000 pages and that was that.  End of the frontier mindset, in other words.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well that might go some way towards solving the </em><a href="TooMuchToRead.html">TooMuchToRead</a> problem.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It appears that the count is moving backward with good effect. We are finding out something new at this frontier! It would be a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a> if periodically the Wiki Community would do the Housekeeping required to improve the quality of existing pages before moving on to the creation of new and perhaps non-contiguous pages. The linking together of pages into a network of useful and provocative information is perhaps one of the things that keeps this wiki going. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In this dynamic community, it is impossible to identify the 20,000 page as a single page, since the wiki exists in the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a>. The mark has been reached and will be reached again and again as a long overdue refactoring has hopefully begun.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, do we party because of 20k, or do we party because we've (re-)established something important?  Do we even need a reason to party? <em>Party if you want, I'm partying for both reasons!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do we even need a reason to party?</em> - It's not quite as clear as I intended. I meant yes - PARTY.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe we should be saddened. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Tonight we're going to party like it's 19,999?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I propose that <a href="MarchEighteenth.html">MarchEighteenth</a> mark the beginning of the annual <a href="WikiSpringCleaning.html">WikiSpringCleaning</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        <strong>A mix of deletions and creations improve the wiki</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's see how long we can keep Wiki <em>below</em> 20,000 without deleting any good content.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Let's see how long we can keep the Wiki vital and relevant by creating good content.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        How much good content is already here, and too hard to find behind all the so-so content?
      </p>
      <p>
        A mechanism called a <a href="RoadMap.html">RoadMap</a> can expose the existing good content by focusing on it and making it more visible.
      </p>
      <p>
        see: <a href="AdaptiveProcess.html">AdaptiveProcess</a> <a href="AgileProcess.html">AgileProcess</a> <a href="CategoryCategory.html">CategoryCategory</a> <a href="CategoryRoadMap.html">CategoryRoadMap</a> <a href="EjbRoadmap.html">EjbRoadmap</a> <a href="ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap.html">ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap</a> <a href="SelfDocumentingCode.html">SelfDocumentingCode</a> <a href="XpVersionControlRoadmap.html">XpVersionControlRoadmap</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Much of the so-so content has already been deleted, and continues to be deleted at a rate of from 5 to 15 pages a day. The emphasis is that vitality and good content come from the exposure of newly created pages. (which will be a mix of many so-so pages and a few outstanding pages). 
        [ update: for the period from April 9, 2002 through March 10, 2003, over 3400 pages were added to the Repository, that averages 10 pages per day) At this years end (February 2004, we can expect the total to be somewhere between 25500-27500.)]
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps effort toward creating new <a href="RoadMaps.html">RoadMaps</a> would not be a waste.

        As the person originally described as having the "enthusiasm of a relative newcomer", I'm now starting to worry about what's happening here, and if I caused it. I'm thinking now perhaps numbers aren't that important (Sorry Vicki). Although I was so pleased to put up the first 20,000 page, with hindsight when we now get back down to 20,000 perhaps it's time for another celebration - but then to move on.
