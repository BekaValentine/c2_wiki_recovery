        Resource Fork
      </h1>
      <p>
        On <a href="MacOsClassic.html">MacOsClassic</a>, files consisted of a data fork, a resource fork, or both.  The data fork was unstructured data, addressed by byte offset, like files on other operating systems.  The resource fork was structured in a manner similar to IFF (which was popularized on the Amiga), except not with quite as much versatility: resources can't be nested the way IFF hunks can.
      </p>
      <p>
        The trouble is that you tend to lose the <a href="ResourceFork.html">ResourceFork</a> and other metadata when transferring files between operating systems... Since the <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> -> <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> transition the resource fork is being phased out in favor of bundles, specially structured directories in which resources are stored as standalone files.
