        I've been hearing more on a push for concurrency and parallelism in software development, driven largely by the expecting coming of mass quantities of CPU cores. In my opinion, most of the "problems" they tout are answered by good use of databases (surprise surprise). Is this another DB-versus-RAM-structures <a href="HolyWar.html">HolyWar</a>? Will mass cores change the landscape of development? For all niches or just some? --top

        <em>Do you mean a push for concurrency and parallelism in the outcome of software development, i.e., the software products themselves?  Or do you mean more concurrency and parallelism in the software development process itself?</em>
