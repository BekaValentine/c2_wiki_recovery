        Rats! I was hoping that someone had rewritten EMACS using java instead of lisp. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a> <em>Have you looked at jEdit? It's a java-extensible editor. </em><a href="http://jedit.sourceforge.net/''">http://jedit.sourceforge.net/''</a>

        J (<a href="http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/)">http://armedbear-j.sourceforge.net/)</a> is a (Emacs-like) text editor written entirely in Java and distributed under the GNU General Public License.

        Yes, the project is called JEmacs, at <a href="http://jemacs.net/.">http://jemacs.net/.</a> Work is underway to implement an <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> interpreter, so that standard emacs modules can be used. -- <a href="EricMarsden.html">EricMarsden</a>

        The <a href="EmacsWiki.html">EmacsWiki</a> has a page devoted to alternative extension languages for Emacs (<a href="http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CategoryExtensionLanguage).">http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki.pl?CategoryExtensionLanguage).</a>

        I'm curious: what would the advantage be of using Java instead of C as
        the substrate to write emacs and the elisp interpreter?  I can't see how
        this would be a win.  Now, rewriting emacs in a compiled lisp environment, <em>that</em> would make sense...   --<a href="AlainPicard.html">AlainPicard</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's more about the advantage of using </em><a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> instead of <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> in the libraries.  The <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> interpreter is there only so as not to lose existing libraries.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Those are dubious and questionable, and besides the point: what does
        <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> vs <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> have to do with a <strong>Java</strong> emacs? Why
        wouldnt one simply rewrite a <strong>C</strong> emacs to embed scheme, if that
        was so desired?--ap
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's what the Emacs-on-Guile project is trying to do.</em>
        (<a href="http://gemacs.sourceforge.net/)">http://gemacs.sourceforge.net/)</a>  For Emacs-on-<a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>, look at Hemlock.  (<a href="http://www.cliki.net/Hemlock)">http://www.cliki.net/Hemlock)</a>  Regarding the Why-Java-over-C?", question, I'd guess you can leverage the improved run-time support (GC, type identification) to get something out faster.  That wouldn't hold for "Why-Java-over-CL", though.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If Emacs were implemented in Java, would that supposedly allow one to run it anywhere that has a Java VM?  That probably would be a win over the need to compile a C program or find a <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>/Scheme/Guile implementation for every platform.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I doubt it.  Emacs is already available on a large number of platforms, perhaps more than you can find a JVM for. See the official list at </em><a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#TOCPlatforms''">http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/#TOCPlatforms''</a>
