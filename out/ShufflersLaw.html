        <em>The more bandwidth we have available, the more we download. Download times remain constant.</em>

        This is most emphatically <strong>false</strong>. The entire reason why people get broadband (and then don't use 99% of the capacity) is to reduce latency in the critical few minutes that they're actually downloading something.

        Shuffler's "law" comes from comparing downloading a text document or Usenet article in the past to an MP3 or short video today. If you compare text with text and video with video, you can see that download times for video dropped from infinite (consumers simply couldn't) to something approaching reasonable (a couple days with eMule for an entire movie).
