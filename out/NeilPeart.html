        Neil Peart
      </h1>
      <p>
        Neil Peart is the brilliant drummer and wordsmith of the Canadian band Rush. Rush is considered to be a cornerstone of progressive music (by Rush fans) and has reached a very respectable age.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Neil's brilliant drumming relies on a simple trick, that other drummers might someday learn. Before he drums he writes down everything he's going to do on paper. This </em><a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> represents a radical departure from much of drumming theory.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Composing on paper is not an innovation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>it was a joke</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It was?
      </p>
      <p>
        The use of electronics, processing, and computer-aided music generation have put Rush into a rather small crowd of truly progressive musicians; is it possible they create some of their own music processing software? Other artists have done this.
