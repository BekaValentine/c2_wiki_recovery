        Improving Collaboration
      </h1>

        Here are some steps for <a href="ImprovingCollaboration.html">ImprovingCollaboration</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be people-centric. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               This applies to how we design and present our work     
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Be willing to collaborate. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Belong to a community of like-minded people, 
            </li>
            <li>
               Decide that working together will both strengthen this community and improve the product of collaboration.     
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Create shared language. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Our work shares more similarities than we may think. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Conversing with others with like minds will help reveal those similarities
            </li>
            <li>
               Will in the process create a shared language that will make similarities apparent to all. 
            </li>
            <li>
               As a sharing evolves, a conceptual framework for collaborative work will emerge, revealing opportunities for improvments.     
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Keep improving. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Improvement is an ongoing process. 
            </li>
            <li>
               Introduction of new methods will change the way we collaborate, which in turn will create new opportunities to improve.    
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
          Finally, never forget Doug Engelbart's fundamental tenet
          <ul>
            <li>
               Computers should help us become smarter and work together better
            </li>
            <li>
               Remembering this will keep us on the right track.    
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
