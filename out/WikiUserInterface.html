        Wiki User Interface
      </h1>
      <p>
        Wiki is a great collaboration system, but its <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a> is primarily text mark-up, which is quick to evolve but slow to learn.  Is the <a href="WikiEssence.html">WikiEssence</a> to evolve or is it to create a great system for collaboration?  
      </p>
      <p>
        If effective collaboration is the goal, then it is worthwhile to explore alternate user interfaces.  Anything can be accomplished with a simple text editor, a powerful markup language, and a dedicated community, but what about the newbies?  More interested in the subject matter than the process, perhaps <a href="AlternateWikiInterfaces.html">AlternateWikiInterfaces</a> are a good idea.
