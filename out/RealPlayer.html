        Despite the fact that a great deal of desirable content is only available in proprietary Real formats, I would never consider installing software from a company whose disregard for privacy is so blatantly criminal.  Stick to companies whose true customers are the users -- software funded by advertisement and marketing schemes is dangerous and shady.  Unless you want them to consider it a date, DontLetOthersPayForYourDinner.
