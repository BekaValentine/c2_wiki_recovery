        When all choices are bad and you don't want to attempt to find the lesser of multiple evils, you can exit the issue orthogonally by choosing <a href="NoneOfTheAbove.html">NoneOfTheAbove</a>.  In some voting systems, <a href="NoneOfTheAbove.html">NoneOfTheAbove</a> is a legitimate candidate and if <a href="NoneOfTheAbove.html">NoneOfTheAbove</a> wins the vote, all previous candidates (with the exception of <a href="NoneOfTheAbove.html">NoneOfTheAbove</a>) are disqualified and the election is rerun with different candidates. <a href="NoneOfTheAbove.html">NoneOfTheAbove</a> is a form of <a href="ProtestVote.html">ProtestVote</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NoneOfTheAbove.html">NoneOfTheAbove</a> is apparently an option in some elections in Nevada, USA.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NoneOfTheAbove.html">NoneOfTheAbove</a> is essentially the same as the ReOpenNominations (RON) option. This is typically an option in student elections in OxfordUniversity, and may well be in use elsewhere. In Oxford, RON is particularly useful when there is only one candidate - it is still possible to reject them.
