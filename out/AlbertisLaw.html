        Albertis Law
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here is another liability: beautiful drawings can become ends in themselves. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Often, if the drawing deceives, it is not only the viewer who is enchanged but also the maker, who is the victim of his own artifice. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Alberti understood 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           this danger and pointed out that architects should not try to imitate painters and produce lifelike drawings. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The purpose of architectural drawings was merely to illustrate the relationship of various parts... 
        </li>
        <li>
           as many architects of today do not, that the rules of drawing and the rules of building are not one and the same
        </li>
        <li>
           mastery of drawing does not ensure success in building.
        </li>
      </ul>
