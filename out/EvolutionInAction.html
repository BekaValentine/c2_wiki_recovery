        Evolution In Action
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's true that you can't save people from themselves. But then again <a href="EvolutionInAction.html">EvolutionInAction</a> is no argument against medical intervention ...

      <p>
        When I see people (often teenagers, but not always) doing things which can only be described as stupid and dangerous, I just remember a line a friend used once: <strong><em>Just think of it as evolution in action.</em></strong> -- <a href="KeithDerrick.html">KeithDerrick</a>

        I suspect the correct attribution for the quote is <a href="LarryNiven.html">LarryNiven</a> and <a href="JerryPournelle.html">JerryPournelle</a>'s <em></em><a href="OathOfFealty.html">OathOfFealty</a><em>. -- </em><a href="KenMeltsner.html">KenMeltsner</a>

        The phrase was in common use at Caltech in the early 80's, certainly before Niven's book was published. -- <a href="PaulSteMarie.html">PaulSteMarie</a>

        <li>
           First published 1981, which possibly predates the usage to which you refer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The book was published before "the early 80's". <a href="JerryPournelle.html">JerryPournelle</a> certainly thinks they coined the phrase (see the Amazon page).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Jerry Pournelle is well known to take credit for everything that isn't nailed down (and has also been known to carry a pry bar for the rest). He is <strong>never</strong> a reliable source for such things.
        </li>
        <li>
           There is in print "proof" that this line came from Pournelle or Niven.. No in print evidence I have ever seen to the contrary.

        "Darwin got him" and the retort "It only counts if he gets them before they breed" were common when I was in college in the late '70s. -- <a href="DaveSmith.html">DaveSmith</a>

        A friend of mine did <em>line of duty</em> cases for the army. He showed me the standard casebook of prior judgements he was issued. Most deaths occurred in bar fights of one form or another. Others were a real hoot. I particularly remember the fellow who tried to open a 55 gal drum, clearly marked flammable, with a cutting torch. The judgement: <em>In the line of duty.</em> -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        <em>This really sounds more like </em><a href="NaturalSelection.html">NaturalSelection</a> in action. A major component of evolution, to be sure, but only half the story. To be <a href="EvolutionInAction.html">EvolutionInAction</a>, you need enormously large numbers of mutations for <a href="NaturalSelection.html">NaturalSelection</a> to act upon.<em></em>

        I had an uncle who liked to ride motorcycles in a dangerous fashion. Relatives referred to him as MayhemInMotion.

        Could it be that that which survives "pays attention"? -- <a href="MarkRogers.html">MarkRogers</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Doubtless. It's a rite of passage to do unnecessarily dangerous things. I survived uncounted such things as a teenager by paying very close attention to what I was doing, which did in fact compensate for doing such dumb things in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are evolutionary psychology roots in why teenagers do such things; Darwin rewards not just those who are prudent, but also those who pay attention.
