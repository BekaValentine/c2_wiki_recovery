        I can't stop learning/asking questions anymore than I can stop breathing or eating (though if I cut down on the eating, the weight reduction would reduce my autocross racing times

        I am currently the Team Lead for <a href="GlobalRoots.html">GlobalRoots</a>

        My simple Half+ is the type with a home page like this <a href="http://Winchell.org.">http://Winchell.org.</a>
      </p>

        The other part tries to assert control by taking on things like <a href="http://Winchell.org/PCDatabaseSummit95,">http://Winchell.org/PCDatabaseSummit95,</a> trying to figure out how XP can be applied to existing database systems, or racing this <a href="http://Winchell.org/PonyCar.Net/Kenny">http://Winchell.org/PonyCar.Net/Kenny</a>

        But that's all pretty left brain. My right brain enjoys watching and performing slam poetry, listening to/playing music, hiking, travelling, comedy and romance.
