        American Gods

      <p>
        Contemporary ('contemporary' as opposed to Swords & Magic) fantasy novel written by <a href="NeilGaiman.html">NeilGaiman</a> (<a href="http://www.neilgaiman.com).">http://www.neilgaiman.com).</a>
        If you're into fiction of any kind, this is well worth a read.
