        we use a variant of the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> with great success.  One thing that led us to it is that for us, <em>Business</em> is actually lots of independent Players with conflicting priorities.  We always use <a href="DateDriveCommitment.html">DateDriveCommitment</a>, allocate each player some ideal time, and then invite them to negotiate with each other.  Getting out of this crossfire is valuable to us poor developers. --<a href="DaveCleal.html">DaveCleal</a>

        Great idea and good way of putting it.  I have come to standardly recommend "fix the date, change the scope" as a basic survival strategy, but hadn't seen it from this perspective.  I'll strengthen my recommendation on this from now on (5/99). --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>
