        Walks Likea Duck

        A crude, but often effective, rule for eliminating unlikely possibilities and identifying a most likely or most correct assessment.
      </p>
      <p>
        Taken from the saying, "If it walks like a duck, swims like a duck, and quacks like a duck, then it probably is a duck."
      </p>

        "Swims like a duck" is less frequently heard than "looks like a duck," but it hardly matters.

        "Smoking duck" is a reference to the metaphorical "smoking gun."  However Smoking Duck is also a breed of duck.

        There is an interesting TV adaptation of this saying in a Dexter's Laboratory episode ("Ultrajerk 2000").
        Dexter, the boy genius, builds a small sentient robot as a lab assistant to improve his home research facilities, then he takes a day off.
        In the meanwhile, the robot builds laser-equipped fixed terminals and upgrades himself into a huge tower.
        When Dexter comes back, the robot decides to terminate him as "inefficient" and his lasers start shooting at him. Dexter hides away and his sister, completely unaware of the tense situation, comes into the lab. She starts talking with the tower-robot as if it was Dexter in disguise: it looks (!), speaks and behaves like Dexter, so it must be her brother. The laser terminals, convinced by her words, dutifully destroy the tower and, without guidance, go offline themselves.
