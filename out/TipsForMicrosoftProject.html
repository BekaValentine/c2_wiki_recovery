        Tips For Microsoft Project
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some people like <a href="MicrosoftProject.html">MicrosoftProject</a>.  Others don't like it, but are told by the <a href="PointyHairedBoss.html">PointyHairedBoss</a> they have to use it because it's the corporate standard.  Others because any other scheduling tool either a) sucks worse, or b) is very expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        A few tips for those who use it.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't use automatic resource levelling.  Will break any schedule. <em>It can be made to work, but first you need to understand what "work" means for this. If you must use it, read a decent book on it first (it's not at all intuitive)</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Make all tasks "fixed duration", rather than "effort-based".   
        </li>
        <li>
           Enter the amount of work in the Work field (which you'll need to add to the tables) not Duration.
        </li>
        <li>
           Avoid any dependencies other than finish-to-start.  Absoulte lag (positive or negative) is OK; but avoid % lag.
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>Never</strong> put dependencies on summary tasks.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Decide--up front--whether you want to work with PERT or Gantt charts.  If PERT charts, forget about using summary tasks; they just won't work.  Switching between the two doesn't work well at all--if you enter your data in the Gantt screen, and look at it as a PERT, it will be spaghetti.  Likewise if you go in the opposite direction.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't change the start date of a started task (in Project parlance, a task that has "actuals").  If you do need to do this; then:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Change it's %complete to 0%, making it an unstarted task
            </li>
            <li>
               <strong>Then</strong> change the start date
            </li>
            <li>
               Then assign it an appropriate completion percentage.
            </li>
            <li>
               Otherwise, you risk "split tasks", a source of weirdities in Project.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Consider bringing in <a href="MicrosoftProject.html">MicrosoftProject</a> consultants/customizers.  Quite a few of them out there, and they make it more bearable.
        </li>
        <li>
           Avoid "no later than" constraints.  If the constraint is violated, Project treats this as a scheduling <em>error</em> (and does weird things while howling loudly) rather than a slipped task.  Instead, use the "deadline" feature to specify that a task has a deadline.  
        </li>
        <li>
           Keep a "scrub list" of tasks to do after schedule changes--it is still too easy to get
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>thanks.</em>

        General hints; not specific to <a href="MicrosoftProject.html">MicrosoftProject</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All tasks should have predecessors and successors.  If a task has no predecessor, and isn't able to begin immediately, it's a problem.  If a task has no successor (other than the end of the project), why are you doing it?

      </ul>
