        <em>Well, far from being "new", it's been invented quite a couple of times already; I've heard it most often referred to as "</em><a href="ComeFrom.html">ComeFrom</a>".  <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> and come from result in similar lack of readability: <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> makes an invisible point in program text to which the flow can jump from anywhere, come from makes an invisible point in program text from where the flow can jump to anywhere.  Contrary to popular beliefs, come from does <strong>not</strong> result in significantly less readable code than <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>.<em> -- </em><a href="PanuKalliokoski.html">PanuKalliokoski</a>

        Actually, <a href="GoHere.html">GoHere</a> on Exception, <a href="GoHere.html">GoHere</a> on Error could be useful constructs.  I've often thought it would be nice to have a global exception handler which invoked immediately on exception without unwinding the stack.  Potentially, the exception could be handled and the code could be restarted from some arbitrary point.  I understand that some <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> implementations allow this.

        <a href="GoHere.html">GoHere</a> for Test would be immensely useful.  When browsing through code, particularly in running code, I've wished for some way of knowing what unit tests are available to exercise some given routine.  <a href="UberReflectiveEnvironments.html">UberReflectiveEnvironments</a> might be used to automatically map backward from application code to the unit tests exercising it.

        Actually - this was quite popular in 1980's HomeComputerBasic's:

      <ol>
        <li>
           ON PEN GOSUB 500
        </li>

      <p>
        <em>QBasic (if not many other variations on BASIC) had a generic exception routine called ON ERROR:</em>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           ON ERROR GOTO ERRORHANDLER

        <li>

        <li>
           ON ERROR RESUME NEXT

      <p>
        <em>Line 10 popped out to an arbitrary position in the code which could use RESUME or RESUME NEXT, or continue executing until termination. Line 20 retried the statement that caused the exception (I don't remember if it would double-fault and abort the program on a second error.) and line 30 simply ignored the error and tried the following statement.</em>

        You could implement this using a <a href="MethodObject.html">MethodObject</a>, actually, with a little cooperation from the sources... 
      </p>
      <code>
        {<br/>
        <a href="MethodObject.html">MethodObject</a> errorMethod;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public void doOnError(MethodObject method){<br/>
        errorMethod = method;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        public void errorCausingMethod(){<br/>
        try{<br/>
        someOperation();<br/>
        }catch (SomeException error){<br/>
        errorMethod.invokeWith(error);<br/>
        }<br/>

        Perhaps this should really be called "ComeHere"; 'go' is usually said at the source of the movement, 'come' at the destination.

        An idea for <a href="GoHere.html">GoHere</a>--make it Go....Here, like
      </p>
      <code>
        if x == 0 then go<br/>
        (lots more code)<br/>
        here<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Way</em> more obfuscation possibilities--especially for nested things like 
      </p>
      <code>
        if (x) go;<br/>
        blah blah;<br/>
        blah blah blah;<br/>
        if (y) go;<br/>
        blah blah;<br/>
        here;<br/>
        blah;<br/>
        here;<br/>
        blah blah blah blah;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now which Go matches which Here?
