        For those of you who haven't figured it out from the above, and I salute you if you haven't, <a href="RedDwarf.html">RedDwarf</a> is a hilariously funny parody of the <a href="StarTrek.html">StarTrek</a> genre. It stars a cretinous peon, an anal-retentive hologram, and a mutated cat. And that's the good part...

        Through a bizarre set of circumstances, they're a grillion miles from Earth.
        They're trying to get back, even though it will probably take longer
        than many of them will live. There's also a main character who is a hologram,
        who in later seasons gets a fancy device that lets him wander around
        more freely. Does anyone else see a disturbing similarity to <a href="StarTrekVoyager.html">StarTrekVoyager</a>?

        <em>Yes, Voyager also ripped off </em>GallForce (see janeway's hairdo at the start of the series, and compare it to Captain Eluza's. The difference? One of them has pink hair)<em></em>

        There are also four books that are based on the series: Infinity Welcomes Careful Drivers, Better Than Life, Backwards and The Last Human.  They are not just novelizations of the show and are also very funny.  The first starts off:
      </p>
      <p>
        Explain, using diagrams where appropriate, the circumstances leading to your death.
