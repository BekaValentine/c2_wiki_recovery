        In programming parlance this is the poor developer that has to come behind the <a href="CowboyCoder.html">CowboyCoder</a> and clean up the CowboyCode, while surrounded by screaming management/marketing and other sundry hostiles.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can either lead to the cavalry riding in to save the day, or conversely a <em>Custer's Last Stand</em>.

      <p>
        In some respects the <a href="AnonymousCavalryman.html">AnonymousCavalryman</a> can be a <a href="CowboyCoder.html">CowboyCoder</a> in his own right - with the added ability to quickly grok the <a href="CowboyCoder.html">CowboyCoder</a>'s source, and patch the gaping holes in it.
