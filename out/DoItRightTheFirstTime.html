        ...but misunderstood. <a href="DoItRightTheFirstTime.html">DoItRightTheFirstTime</a> was not meant on an overall module or project level. It was meant to be applied on the single function interface: its name and its functionality. If this is done right, you will *never* have to change it again. You may change its implementation details, you may change the places where it it used, you may even correct errors that are found, but you will never change its prototype and its semantic content. So you have produced a building block that may be reused either on the module level, the project level or - if it is general enough - as a general library function. If you use Thelop it will be clear from its name, where it belongs. It will also be an incarnation of <a href="LanguageIndependentProgramming.html">LanguageIndependentProgramming</a>, so if you switch the programming language you will be able to transfer the API directly (and only change part of the implementation). This means a shift in the time horizon. You no longer program for the project at hand or for a time span of 3-10 years, you start to create code that's meant to last. That's what is called ProgrammingForEternity. -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>

        I get the best results by <em>trying</em> to do <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>, even though the reality is a fractal mess of back-tracking and fore-tracking.  This is similar to the argument that you can't ever achieve perfection, but you're not even going to come close if you don't kid yourself about it and really try.

        It turns out that the combination of <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>, testing, and refactoring allow you to start with anything -- even a very bad guess -- and get to something very good in not too much time.  There's no need in code to do it right the first time.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes you can't figure out how to refactor it, so you put it off and figure out how to do it right the second time.  That happens also, and doesn't prove to be much of a problem when you have tests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Understood, but there's a need to </em>try<em>.  Would you guess the square root of two to be one hundred and twenty-five?  In systems of closed feedback (like what you describe above), there is sometimes a convergeance on quality and sometimes not, and there is something that makes convergeance take place.  I can look at a first attempt and predict whether convergeance will ever occur.  Throw away the bathwater, throw away the baby.</em> -- WM

        The above is counter to my experience.  It's not that hard to make good code great, or bad code better.  It's a lot easier than trying to get it right the first time.  My experience is that I seldom <em>do</em> get it right the first time, so effort spent trying is a waste of time.  Smarter brains may do better.

      <p>
        <em>Beyond a certain threshold, trying to get a first effort to be perfect </em>is<em> a waste of time.  Beyond a different threshold, an effort with insufficient attention to excellence is also a waste of time (and why I take issue with "not that hard to make bad code better" -- oh, yes it is!).  It's probably futile to discuss only one of those thresholds at a time.  Your last statement is loaded with wisdom: "Smarter brains may do better."  From seeking perfection (but not going much beyond threshold number one), </em>your<em> brain is that very brain, poised to do better on the next effort.

        DIRTFT is a part of <a href="LanguageOrientedProgramming.html">LanguageOrientedProgramming</a> and is primarily used on the API because that's what really counts in the long run. The implementation of individual functions/method bodies seems relatively unimportant. There is no hard work and no large design necessary to achieve DIRTFT for an API within the framework of LOP because its automatic if you use your language correctly.--hl

        When considering "do it right the first time,"
        I think we need to separate "doing it all the first time" from "each thing you do must be 'right' (IE: without errors/bugs) before you go to the next thing."
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Doing it all the first time through is typical of <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a>, with <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a>.

        Thus, I think we have two different meanings for the same phrase.

           I'm not at all offended. Most people think like you. Nevertheless is seems desirable to me to invent a language (a set of rules) that reduces the infinite freedom of structuring code to a small set of possibilities. This makes the creation of interfaces and the reuse of code much simpler (just as natural languages makes understanding each other much simpler). It's not the code the never changes but the interface. If we have a "Screen" and want to know its "Width", why should we ever write anything else but width=ScreenRetWidth() or width=screen.RetWidth() ? I wouldn't mind if someone prefers "get" or want to drop the verb or use some other naming standard. But it is senseless to have things like  "GetSystemInfo(info_structure); width=info_structure.scr_x_dim; ". If this really exists, please wrap it, hide it in a single place in a library and don't burden zillions of programmers to follow this path. So if I want to capture a part of the screen into an image, I always write image=ScreenRectRetImage(rect);  writing it to a File might be ImageWriteFile(image,"test.jpg") while printing might be PrinterDrawImage(x,y,image) or PrinterRectDrawImage(rect,image). It's quite simple and these interfaces never have to change because they are identical to their semantic content. Most APIs are crap because they treat function names and semantical content as different and independent things. If you WalkYourTalk life becomes incredibly simple. -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>

        And then, next thing you know, somebody invents a pear-shaped screen... Have a lot of fun with that interface...

           What's the problem? region=PearScreenRetRegion(); width=RegionRetWidth(region); It just adds the word "Pear" to the vocabulary.  <em>[Why didn't you </em><a href="DoItRightTheFirstTime.html">DoItRightTheFirstTime</a> and foresee this condition?]<em></em>

        <em>But what is the meaning of screen width?  When I first started programming, the answer was often either 40 or 80 characters.  Today, screen width is measured in pixels (or some such unit) and characters do not have a fixed width and the font may be user selected.  In other cases, the screen width may refer to a physical measure of the dispay.  In other cases, such as server side web, you may not even know.  Sure there are lots of bad interface designs out there, but I don't believe there is one true way that you can define and lock down for all uses for all of time.  The world does not correspond to programming rules; we have to adjust our programming to fit the world.</em>

           You can have many languages to describe the world, but within one language there are only a few variations to describe given semantics. Programmers currently act as if there is no need for a common language and as if such a common language would deprive them of some kind of freedom. -- hl

        <em>What is the problem?  Per the previous statement "It's not the code the never changes but the interface."  After declaring that you can define a static interface, you keep coming back and changing the interface to meet the situation.  If you keep expanding the interface, then all it appears that you are advocating it that I am forced to implement unneeded functionality for my programming situation to meet your personal "common language."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to add new kinds of names, that represent kinds of objects that don't exist in your library, you'd better use another library (for example, don't try to add I/O handling to a graphics system). In this specific case you are correct, though. It was a poor design decision from the buddies that wrote the example initially not to think about units. However, it can be fixed, without changing the interface, only by adding new functions: bind ScreenRetWidth to ScreenRetWidthCurUnit (or however you abbreviate current). Create a function that changes the current units, and also make the other getters: ScreenRetWidthCm and others.
