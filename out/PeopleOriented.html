        People Oriented
      </h1>
      <p>
        A personality trait measured by certain psychological tests that shows the level of importance or intensity of focus an individual places on people. It is usually compared to the individual's measure of <a href="TaskOriented.html">TaskOriented</a> focus. One can be High-Task and High-People; High-Task and Low-People; Low-Task and High-People; or Low-Task and Low-People.

        Many of the LiberalMind'ed I know, seem to be <a href="PeopleOriented.html">PeopleOriented</a>.  That does not mean that all Liberals are <a href="PeopleOriented.html">PeopleOriented</a>, but I bet the majority are. -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>

        <em>This is an oversimplification in my observation. I see little if any correlation. I see more of a correlation between religious beliefs and political views.</em>

           Yes, I can see how a page titled "<a href="PeopleOriented.html">PeopleOriented</a>" would be <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> on a site dedicated to "<a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a>". -- <a href="BrucePennington.html">BrucePennington</a>

           However, whether LiberalMinded people are <a href="PeopleOriented.html">PeopleOriented</a> or not -- or whether psychological tests can identify whether they are <a href="PeopleOriented.html">PeopleOriented</a> or <a href="TaskOriented.html">TaskOriented</a> -- holds dubious relation to software development.  This Wiki isn't about <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in general, it's about <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a> in <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a>. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

           LOL!  Yes, Dave, and so the debate goes on.  What would happen to <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a> without People?  How can you analyze the most efficeint People functions without delving into People?  How can you seriously care about office function without caring about People?  <a href="ProgrammingMatters.html">ProgrammingMatters</a> only because People matter.  You can discuss issues on the surface, and sometimes that is all you need; like putting an antibiotic on a skin infection.  But sometimes treating the symptom isn't enough to cure the problem.  Sometimes one must go deeper and get at the source.

        <em>I see your point.  Personally, I'd be inclined to pitch the lot, but I can appreciate that there's a fuzzy line here between </em><a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> and <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> that ultimately comes down to personal preference.
