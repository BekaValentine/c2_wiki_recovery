        My name is Robert, but some people call me Bob. I also go by DiscoSnorlax on the internet. (Some people call me certain other things too, but that's an entirely different matter.)

        One of my interests is <a href="DumpsterDiving.html">DumpsterDiving</a> , and I plan to keep active on that page if it decides to stay here. I have a <a href="LiveJournal.html">LiveJournal</a> at <a href="http://www.livejournal.com/users/discosnorlax">http://www.livejournal.com/users/discosnorlax</a> if anyone is interested.
