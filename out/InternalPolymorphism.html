        Internal Polymorphism
      </h1>
      <p>
        Internal polymorphism is the kind of polymorphism that you see in most OO computer languages. When you call a method on an object the actual function called is based on the dynamic type of the object. In <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> this is implemented using a virtual function table or vtable. Only methods declared as "virtual" are polymorphic in C++. One key attribute of <a href="InternalPolymorphism.html">InternalPolymorphism</a> is that the function bindings are part of the class definition of the object -- about as tight a coupling as you can get. Contrast this with <a href="ExternalPolymorphism.html">ExternalPolymorphism</a> where the functions and their bindings are defined independently of the class.

        Usually <a href="InternalPolymorphism.html">InternalPolymorphism</a> is preferable to <a href="ExternalPolymorphism.html">ExternalPolymorphism</a> because it bundles type-specific information into one cohesive unit. However, there are times where the cohesion of domain specific information is more valuable than type-specific information. This is especially true when the objects in question will be playing a passive role in the methods in question. In these cases it is desirable to bundle the variances in type behavior into domain specific units using <a href="ExternalPolymorphism.html">ExternalPolymorphism</a>. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>
