        Proposed Plop Policies As Walled Garden

        Although pattern languages are of wide interest, the contents of this particular page appear to be of interest to very few; it seems that either the content should be rephrased to be of general interest, or else this page should be moved to a site owned by the <a href="HillsideGroup.html">HillsideGroup</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DisagreeByDeleting.html">DisagreeByDeleting</a> the above paragraph without otherwise commenting? Does the Hillside Group have special status here?

           <em>Sorry, Doug, I was just cleaning up in my role as a caretaker. I was going to put in a footnote pointing to a discussion of the issue on another page, but we overlapped in editing. I think the page is much less obscure and more relevant to present company than many other </em><a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>s. And, no, I don't think Hillside (however that may be defined) has any special stature here, but it would probably be good if the page reflected stakeholder input - which though an extended subset of Hillside, is smaller than WardWikidom. I don't think that's any more or less true for this page than any Wiki page. I also don't think this page is any more or less esoteric than other Wiki pages. It would be a good discussion to have. But can we move that discussion to PagesThatDontBelongHere? Thanks.<em></em>

        I don't know what that last sentence means, but go ahead and replace my comments with a statement of why this page doesn't resemble a <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a>. Thanks.

           <em>I hope to encourage </em><a href="AccidentalLinking.html">AccidentalLinking</a> here. I can make other links more explicit (like <a href="CommunityOfTrust.html">CommunityOfTrust</a>, <a href="PlopConference.html">PlopConference</a>) than I have; that will make it more useful to visitors - thanks! It is of broad and direct interest to the community (see how the <a href="PatternCommunity.html">PatternCommunity</a> page starts off). The number of contributors is about the same for a similar page of its age; there seem to be at least three or four, and a pointer to the page was just sent by yet a fourth or fifth to dozens of others for consideration at the next Hillside meeting. There is a precedent for this kind of thing here at Wiki already in the Oscar Nierstrasz's <a href="OopslaProgramChairPatterns.html">OopslaProgramChairPatterns</a>.<em></em>

        <dd><em>Given that Wiki pages are open I think the concept of a </em><a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> is somewhat of a myth, anyhow. As in England where anyone can climb over the nearest stone fence and hike across open farmland (as long as they aren't destructive), I view every Wiki page as fair ground for hiking. What would you have done as an alternative to starting a focused effort in a context where the entire community can join in? I am happy to move it to a more suitable venue, but setting up a Wiki seems like overkill.<em></em></dd>
