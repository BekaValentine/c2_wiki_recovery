        Palm Graffiti
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="HandHeld.html">HandHeld</a> computers running <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> (e.g. <a href="PalmPilot.html">PalmPilot</a>) do not have a keyboard.
        Instead they use an area of the touch-sensitive screen as an input device.
        Strokes made by a stylus are analysed and interpreted as characters, which
        are then sent to the active process.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Uppercase-L produces an 'l'
        </li>
        <li>
           Back-to-front uppercase-L produces a 'j'
        </li>
        <li>
           Upside-down uppercase-V produces an 'a'
        </li>
        <li>
           A big circle produces an 'o'
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>They do have an on-screen keyboard.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>How do you produce an Uppercase-L?</em>  (First shift, which is an upward stroke, then L.)
      </p>
      <p>
        There are also various shift-strokes which behave like <em>control</em> and
        <em>caps lock</em> on keyboards, giving access to special characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        To put the <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> into upper-case mode, you stroke once upwards.  To put it into Caps Lock, you stroke twice.  Third time puts it back into lower case.  The current mode is shown by a small graphic on the edge of the screen.  To enter punctuation, you simply tap once, followed by the stroke for the punctuation symbol.
      </p>
      <p>
        Letters are written in the left half of the recognition area, and numbers in the right half.  Presumably this greatly simplifies recognition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some undocumented strokes have been discovered and are in wide use:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You get a more reliable 'v' if you stroke it backwards (right to left)
        </li>
        <li>
           You can stroke 'x' in one move, as a backwards 'k'.
        </li>
        <li>
           You get a more reliable 'd' if you draw a triangle, starting at the lower left, moving up, down and then back (like a greek delta).  When I try a normal 'D' I often end up with a 'p', so the greek delta stroke works great for me.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Less essential are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A "3" in the letter area is a "b".
        </li>
        <li>
           A "6" in the letter area is a "g".
        </li>
        <li>
           A sideways Graffiti "K" is a "Y".
        </li>
        <li>
           A backwards Graffiti shortcut symbol is a "D". (Actually, a circle clockwise, started at the bottom does it too)
        </li>
        <li>
           A "C" in the number area is a "4".
        </li>
        <li>
           A "S" in the number area is a "5". (You may leave out the upper sidestroke too)
        </li>
        <li>
           A "h" in the number area is a "9".
        </li>
        <li>
           A dot, then "T" is a "?".
        </li>
        <li>
           A "L" is more easily recognized if you begin like a backslash.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can skip the initial downstroke on the "P" and the "R".
        </li>
      </ul>

        You can try Graffiti out with your mouse (which is, admittedly, nowhere near as natural as with a touch pen) at <a href="http://www.palmone.com/us/products/input/.">http://www.palmone.com/us/products/input/.</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can, with additional software, write your Graffiti characters outside of the Graffiti area.  Given how scratched-up the Graffiti area looks like after lots of use, though, some would recommend against it.

        Update (March 2003)  Xerox filed suit in 2002 against <a href="PalmSource.html">PalmSource</a> for patent infringement.  Palm has agreed to rework <a href="PalmGraffiti.html">PalmGraffiti</a> 1.0 into version 2.0 that will no longer support single stroke letters.  Expect to see <a href="PalmGraffiti.html">PalmGraffiti</a> 2.0 in <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> 5.1 and latter.  First units may be out in mid to late 2003.  -<a href="ScottElliott.html">ScottElliott</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What does "no longer support single stroke letters" mean?  For example, how would one enter a "c" or an "o" with more than one stroke?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        'f', 'i', 'k', 't', and 'x' require multiple strokes in Graffiti 2.0. Other letters do not.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Graffiti 2.0 disappointment</strong>  In addition to making simple things awkward, G2 adds another "feature" that makes me nuts:  a long (like a second or more) lag after the final stroke of certain multi-stroke characters, so that the gadget can tell you're not going to add another stroke, before it will render the character in question.  Man, that sucks!  I'm going over to <a href="TealScript.html">TealScript</a>.  -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

        Thanks <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>. I am suffering from G2 too. Now I have a better choice! -- Siu@Hongkong

        You can also replace a file on your palm device (on most palm devices, anyways) to restore the original graffiti version 1 character strokes.  There's a description of how to do it on the palminfocenter.com site.

        I swapped out graffiti 2 for graffiti 1 on my Zire71 a few years ago and it works fine.  - <a href="GaryKlaus.html">GaryKlaus</a>
