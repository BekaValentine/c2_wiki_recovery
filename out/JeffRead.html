        My current pet project is a virtual machine based on the concepts of <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> called Imari (<a href="http://i-0-i.com/parodycheck/software/imari/)">http://i-0-i.com/parodycheck/software/imari/)</a> and a simple Forth compiler for same.

        I also like games. Designing, programming, and playing them. These days, I find that a couple of rounds through <a href="RezGame.html">RezGame</a> gives me a mood and creativity boost conducive to better hacking.
