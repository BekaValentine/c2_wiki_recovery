        Off Shore Income Heat Sink
      </h1>

        A handy device used to keep your payroll from overheating.
      </p>
      <p>
        By moving some portion of your development or customer service to a region with a lower EntropyIndex (commonly found OffShore) you can dissipate the payroll heat normally generated by escalating salary requirements.
      </p>
      <p>
        The feedback loop from this connection can be used to control the tendency of local salaries to expand which, unchecked, can lead to Payroll Thermal Failure.
      </p>
      <p>
        Other methods of preventing overheating of payroll components include exclusionary practices that keep the number of competing enterprises in your domain to a minimum in your geographical area.

        Liquid cooling systems have been attempted, but these can lead to increased Workman's Comp and Health Benefit costs.  In some regions liquid cooling is actually prohibited by local ordinances, while in others such alternatives are acceptable.  Well-established public transportation infrastructure is advised if large-scale liquid cooling systems are contemplated.
      </p>
      <p>
        The study of payroll cooling is an evolving science, but an important one for today's corporate paradigm.

        One way I have seen in IT areas is to put technical people in a cooler. And hire NotSoInnocent youngs to be trained by them. Achieves circulation quicker because the technical old-hand paid handsomely will have to leave due to lack of real work, and the young can take over, at much cooler rates.
