           The testing group at <a href="DaimlerChrysler.html">DaimlerChrysler</a> just evaluated 3 potential tools for unit testing Java code. JUnit evaluated to be the leader and will be recommended to new projects. The feeling was that while the other two tools did much automated creation of unit tests, overall they were not as useful. That is, these two other tools could create a very simple suite of unit tests based on various boundary conditions and combinations of inputs. That is fine, but they did not generate any of the more difficult tests, tests that only a developer would know to create. These tests can be the hardest and most time consuming to create. However, JUnit though simple does allow you to use your Java IDE to develop and debug your unit tests. Depending on the IDE you can even integrate JUnit into the environment (e.g. <a href="VisualAge.html">VisualAge</a>). We also found certain types of tests were simply not possible in the other two tools. So overall you may have to code all your tests by hand, but when it comes to the really tough tests you will be glad you have it. -- <a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a>

           I started using JUnit recently and now wouldn't consider coding without it. It has helped me enormously in catching bugs, improving design (because I write tests before coding) and most importantly given me confidence in the code I write. On a recent project, the only bugs found in deployment were related to things I couldn't write tests for (<a href="JavaServerPages.html">JavaServerPages</a> mainly) but I'm thinking about how to extend JUnit to enable servlet testing. -- <a href="ChanningWalton.html">ChanningWalton</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           "Me too, me too!" I can conceive of programming without JUnit, but not happily. Regarding Don Wells' point of having to write all the tests myself, rather than having them automatically generated - I think that this is a feature, not a bug. It encourages me to refactor in such a way that I have fewer tests to write, which (so far) has always made the code under test better too. -- <a href="BrettNeumeier.html">BrettNeumeier</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               The thing is that I try to write tests before I've written the code that the test is for (XP way I guess) (which would make automatic tests impossible methinks). The reason I do this is that is forces me to think about the code and clarify what it is I'm going to do. -- <a href="ChanningWalton.html">ChanningWalton</a>

           At <a href="ChannelOneHamburg.html">ChannelOneHamburg</a>, we've found that classes, that we couldn't easily write tests for, often became a target for a larger refactoring. In fact, you really have to design your classes in such a way that you can easily write tests. Otherwise, testing becomes a hassle and bugs slip by. In our experience, the best way to do this is to actually write the unit tests before you start coding. -- <a href="FrankWestphal.html">FrankWestphal</a>

           I'm started using it about 1.5 years ago, and now I'm not programming Java without it. My only problem with JUnit is that I don't use it enough. "This can't go wrong, so I won't waste any time writing a test case for it." Guess what? It could go wrong. And it bites me when I least need it. Just a day before the next release, for example. (<a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> helps, so that someone else makes me write the test case.) -- Unknown?

           In a new project we at Baan started a couple of weeks ago, I had the opportunity of choosing JUnit as the testing framework, and currently I am in the process of coaching the other team members in using it, and using it effectively.

           I use JUnit in my personal development, and in my consulting projects. I recently used <a href="VbUnit.html">VbUnit</a> to test several sort implementations (including performance comparisons) while helping a fellow consultant on his project. Now I am using Nunit (a port of Junit to the Microsoft <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> platform) while I design and build a replacement enterprise system for my new employer. Nunit has some nice features that take advantage of the special abilities of <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>. -- <a href="RobWilliams.html">RobWilliams</a>

           I've infected the co-ops (interns) at work here (<a href="http://www.lachesis.com),">http://www.lachesis.com),</a> and managed to lobby the CTO into supporting it. The oldtimers here all seem to fall somewhere between cautious to quietly subversive, but the biggest problem seems to be testing database dependent objects. Does anyone have any advice on unit tests in conjunction with databases? -- <a href="KaelLizak.html">KaelLizak</a>

I wholeheartedly agree with an earlier orator - every COTS tool out there that tries to do test automation for you sucks. And this is how the notion of "test automation is too expensive" is propagated. Those things that help you program test automation like a proper software that it should be, are the winners.
