        Honorary User Stories

        Some people like to reserve the term <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> for positive-going requirements that are amenable to <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>s. They suggest, in <a href="LimitsOfUserStories.html">LimitsOfUserStories</a> and elsewhere, that there are <a href="UserAntiStories.html">UserAntiStories</a> that are somehow different from <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition to statements like "This program must be done in Java", or "The system must be secure", or "Don't crash", there are also statements like "The system reports all variances to the general ledger", which may be backed up by a large number of detailed stories at some future date.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is desirable, wherever possible, to handle such requirements with the same <em>mechanisms</em> as <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>. In XP, they are handled by writing them on cards and processing them in various ways during <a href="ReleasePlan.html">ReleasePlan</a>, <a href="IterationPlan.html">IterationPlan</a>, <a href="FunctionalTest.html">FunctionalTest</a>ing, coding, and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        We call these <a href="HonoraryUserStories.html">HonoraryUserStories</a>. They are conceptually polymorphic with <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, and are processed adaptively by the humans who process <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>. The guideline is to keep them in the normal flow of planning and implementation as much as possible, and no more.

        These sorts of stories remind me of the weaving of aspects into code in <a href="AspectOrientedProgramming.html">AspectOrientedProgramming</a>. Just my 2p worth. -- <a href="DavidMcNicol.html">DavidMcNicol</a>
