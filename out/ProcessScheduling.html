        Process Scheduling
      </h1>
      <p>
        Process scheduling is the act of assign CPU to different processes in a multiprogrammed OS.
        We can do it following two politics: preemptive and non-preemptive scheduling.
        The first means that a process in the system can be halted also if it could logically continue.
        Non-preemptive scheduling means that the only way the process can be halted is that it's logically stopped, in example for an I/O operation, because the process is terminated, because it's blocked by a semaphore that time it with other resources in the system ...
        The choice of one way or another in the scheduling system is made usually keeping these points in mind:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) throughput : is the number of processes that the OS can handle 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) CPU occupation
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) fairness : are we interested in different priority to handle the system or not ?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) turnaround : is the maximum time we want a process can be in our system
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          ) interaction : we usually want that all processes in our system will respond as soon as possible
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        We can have different ways to handle scheduling: round-robin, priority systems, event-driven systems, ...
