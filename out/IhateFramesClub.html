        Frames add nothing in the way of hyperness, muddle the page=document metaphor and are often very, very badly coded.
      </p>
      <p>
        Moreover they are ugly, browsers do not provide handy ways to navigate them, and they violate the concept that HTML describes the content, not the representation of a document. They should die.

        I don't like them, but I gave in and used them here: <a href="http://home.sprintmail.com/~wconrad/refactoring-live/junit/index.html.">http://home.sprintmail.com/~wconrad/refactoring-live/junit/index.html.</a> These are some of the slides for the <a href="RefactoringLive.html">RefactoringLive</a> presentation. The frame with an index of the slides seemed like a very natural way to navigate through the presentation. But I don't like frames. Sigh. So... How can I get rid of the frame and keep the easy navigation?  Suggestions, please.

        If I knew what iframes did then I could say yes or no. I'll check my <a href="AnimalBook.html">AnimalBook</a> for HTML and see what they do different. Thanks for the hint.

      </p>
      <p>
        If they are totally IE specific, then why does the <a href="http://www.w3.org/">http://www.w3.org/</a> site mention them? (I tried to figure out if they've been promoted to a standard...) 
      </p>
      <p>
        (But the problem with non-IFRAME transclusions is you must re-invent your page's frame system, proactively, depending on whether a given page will have frames or not. It's just very rough code to write.) -- PCP

        IFRAMEs are good. They add <strong>a lot</strong> in terms of hyperness: they are the only decent way to implement <a href="TransClusion.html">TransClusion</a>s on the web and they are extremely late in coming. Beforehand, the only things you could seriously transclude were graphics.
      </p>
      <p>
        As for the HTML describing the content not the style of a document, that has never been true. In fact, the web is so fluffy because HTML is such a style-centric standard. Compared to the <a href="http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GopherProtocol,">http://usemod.com/cgi-bin/mb.pl?GopherProtocol,</a> HTML is entirely style.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lately, HTML4 Strict has tried to separate content from style, I agree. However, a <a href="TransClusion.html">TransClusion</a> is non-stylistic; it is entirely content. So, your point is moot, especially since IFRAMEs were introduced in HTML4 despite the claim that they are <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> only. I mean, if you are using a non-compliant browser, that's your problem. 
      </p>
      <p>
        By the way, I don't use frames because they aren't <a href="LynxFriendly.html">LynxFriendly</a> (yet) and the existing browsers have terrible UIs. That doesn't mean frames are bad; it means the browsers are bad. There is a useful distinction there. (i.e. if frames were really bad independent of browsers, if you improve the browsers, frames would still suck. Which they don't.) -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
