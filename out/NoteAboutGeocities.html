        Note About Geocities
      </h1>
      <p>
        In a couple of places on this wiki, there are links to geocities.com. These are slowly dying off, but a site called reocities.com ("r" instead of "g") has copied much but not all of the geocities content. <strong>If a geocities link dies</strong>, try the reocities equivalent instead by changing the "g" to an "r".
      </p>
      <p>
        However, the <strong>formatting</strong> at reocities.com is often unfaithful to the original such that the <strong>text may be scrambled</strong> at places or truncated. As of writing, this problem has not been fixed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, "geocities" links are best IF they work. If not, then "reocities" equivalents are a consolation prize with formatting issues.
