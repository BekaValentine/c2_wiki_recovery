        Egg Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        An anonymous language devised by <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a> for the examples in his book <em>A Discipline of Computer Programming</em>. Dijkstra did not implement its language. The term <em>egg</em> refers to a recent Java implementation which is available at <a href="http://www.andrewcooke.free-online.co.uk/jara/egg/">http://www.andrewcooke.free-online.co.uk/jara/egg/</a> . 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It is a block-structured imperative language in the Algol tradition.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It has <a href="GuardClause.html">GuardClause</a>s and guarded command sets. A guarded statement only executes if its accompanying condition (guard) is true. A set of <a href="GuardClause.html">GuardClause</a>s can be written as part of an <strong>if</strong> or <strong>do</strong> statement, with the semantics described in <a href="GuardClause.html">GuardClause</a>. These constructs replace all flow-of-control constructs in procedural languages, but are easier to prove correct.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Variables are local or global, with special consideration given to uninitialized globals.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The only aggregate structure is one-dimensional arrays whose bounds can be adjusted at run time. (Essentially indexible dequeues.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Here is <a href="EuclidOfAlexandria.html">EuclidOfAlexandria</a>'s GCD algorithm, taken from the distribution:
      </p>
      <code>
        begin privar X, Y, x, y ;<br/>
        X vir int, Y vir int := 12345 * 9876, 12345 * 6789 ;<br/>
        if X > 0 and Y > 0 -><br/>
        x vir int, y vir int := X, Y ;<br/>
        do x > y -> x := x - y | y > x -> y := y - x od ;<br/>
        print( x ) { for 12345 * 9876, 12345 * 6789 answer is 37035 }<br/>
        fi<br/>
        end <br/>
      </code>

      <p>
        According to the <a href="LanguageList.html">LanguageList</a> Dijkstra "later (1972) referred to this language as DOVPA (Dijkstra's Own Version of Pidgin Algol)".
