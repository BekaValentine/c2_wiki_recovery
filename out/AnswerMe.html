           personal experience: sometimes I'm reading wiki, and I feel an impulse to contribute (out of a sense of community exuberance or maybe latent guilt) but the specific pages I look at don't interest me, and even if by banging on <a href="RandomPages.html">RandomPages</a> enough I may not find those specific. It would help if I could follow a link which provides a summarized list of pages which have specific questions which others also want to know the answer to. -- <a href="EricScheid.html">EricScheid</a>

        I've started to use <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> on <a href="WikiWikiWebFaq.html">WikiWikiWebFaq</a>, since there were a bunch of unanswered questions there. This seems like a good use for this tag.
      </p>
      <p>
        It seems like if too many people use <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> it might become less useful. <em>(There are currently - Apr 2, 03 - only 62 pages with </em><a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> on them. I don't think it's in danger of overuse.)<em></em>

        I can see how people might not like the tone of <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>. It sounds like a command, when really it's a request. You might consider the <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a> <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a>. I think it would be more universal and also more polite.
      </p>
      <p>
        I believe that <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> can be used in polite ways by polite people. So, for example, "Could you please be so kind as to <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> if you read this question?"
      </p>
      <p>
        I suspect that <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> is the same pattern that brought us the ubiquitous <a href="ReadMe.html">ReadMe</a> file. It has its roots in <a href="AlicesAdventuresInWonderland.html">AlicesAdventuresInWonderland</a> (DrinkMe, EatMe).
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps a better tag would be CouldSomeonePleaseExplainThisToMe ;) On first read, <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> seemed a bit too presumptuous or demanding to me although I imagine it wasn't meant so.  If the intent is to seek an explanation from one of the experts (something I find myself often wanting to do but reluctant to "impose"), I might have tried something like PleaseExplain.
      </p>
      <p>
        No, no. Please keep it <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>. I think practical users appreciate its small size. It would be best to inform people to disregard tone in <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a>s. Having long tags would be disruptive to the readibility of the page as you have to use a little more 'brain' to pick apart the words. I'm not saying using more 'brain' is bad, just saying that it's nice to avoid unnecessary disruptions to readibility and save 'brain' for comprehending the subject. -- <a href="LeeLouviere.html">LeeLouviere</a>.

        As a side-note: <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>! is also the name of a zine by Jim Goad, who gained a bit of renown in zineland with his highly confrontational - some say juvenile - writing style.

        FYI Tom, I have not had much luck with the <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> tag. I think it's a good idea, but I'm not sure how to implement it. Maybe put the questions temporarily there also? -- <a href="MarkDilley.html">MarkDilley</a>

      <p>
        Mark - haven't really used it much myself. Maybe the solution is to have a new role: AnswerMeWikiGnome, who checks all occurrences of that badge (?) and tries to answer. -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think that would run into the same problem. What do you think about putting the questions on the actual <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> page? -- md
      </p>
      <p>
        Not sure whether that would be appreciated by everybody, although it does seem like a possibility. But I would definitely recommend putting this issue on that page or on AnswerMeDiscussion if there is such a page or you want to create it. -- tr

      <p>
        I like the idea of having the questions included - having to click through page after page, grep for the <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a>, and find out it's something I know nothing about can really kill a random contributory impulse :) Would it be feasible to, for instance, extract everything between a pair of square brackets enclosing an <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> tag and a brief question summary? -- martindemello

        Within the currect reflexes, it would make sense to have AnswerCategory page with AnswerCategory[Category] (like AnswerCategoryPearl) pages so people can post their questions there, then place AnswerCategory and <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> at the top. That way people looking at the <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> tag, would see a category for the questions and know whether it's worth it to check the page. People could also check the backlinks for the AnswerCategory page or do a search, to see what categories of questions exist. Any conflicting pre-existing pages can be renamed or merged with another page. -- <a href="LeeLouviere.html">LeeLouviere</a>
