        Hello and welcome to Jacob Wodzy≈Ñski! 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yupp, that's what you get when you Google my name. So I made this little page only to help you find to my real web which can be found at <a href="http://www.interrail.st">http://www.interrail.st</a> That being said, it's not all I have. There's a blog at <a href="http://jacobsweb.wordpress.com">http://jacobsweb.wordpress.com</a> as well as a Flickr account on <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jacobwod/">http://www.flickr.com/photos/jacobwod/</a> . Hope this helps! /J
