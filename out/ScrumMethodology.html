        See <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a> for a good starting point about Scrum, including most of the former content of this page.

        See <a href="ScrumOverview.html">ScrumOverview</a> for a description of what goes on during Scrum.

        "Scrum Methodology" may refer to the formalized version of Scrum, available from ADM (<a href="AdvancedDevelopmentMethods.html">AdvancedDevelopmentMethods</a>), which makes Scrum look like a heavyweight process.
      </p>
      <p>
        So ScrumProcess is the thing you learn from the <a href="ScrumBook.html">ScrumBook</a>, and the thing that people usually mean when they say they're "doing Scrum."  ScrumMethodology is a formal product available from ADM.
