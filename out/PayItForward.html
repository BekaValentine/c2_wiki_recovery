      <p>
        To <a href="PayItForward.html">PayItForward</a>, do an action described as this:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It has to be something that really helps people.
        </li>
        <li>
           Something they can't do by themselves.

           I do it for them, they do it for three other people.

        <em>In the spirit of </em><a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s, I took down the broken link to cinephile, and replaced it with these. Perhaps it has something to do with the idea of <a href="PayItForward.html">PayItForward</a>...it may be utopian, but it's still working...<em></em>

        Isn't this a little bit utopian?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Any idea to change the world for the better will always seem utopian at first. But even if only a few people do it, it's still a big step towards making life easier for everyone, and improving our quality of life. Thinking about </em><a href="PayItForward.html">PayItForward</a> always makes me feel more optimistic about everything!<em></em>

        It would seem to me the that essence of a society is that you put into the pot even if you don't derive direct benefit from it simply because you are weaker on your own. Hence this is not a utopian ideal - it's a necessary behaviour for a well functioning society.

        I don't know if it's Utopian, but it's a concept truly simple that everybody can put it to work (even if not everybody does so, like in the movie).

      <ul>
        <li>
           It's also something that many folks are inclined to do at a specific time in their lives. e.g.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Successful people as they enter their retirement years, are quite inclined to become Mentors and Charitable donors.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>

        This phrase is often attributed to <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a>. I don't know if he said it first, but he apparently said it a lot.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a> used the phrase when helping out younger, less established authors. I don't remember whether he had it from his own mentors; anyway, the application to programming should be obvious.
