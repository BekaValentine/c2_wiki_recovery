        Included will be a VirtualIdeaSpace is which one can ask questions and hopefully receive answers about specifically targeted subjects, topics, programs, and ideas to be created and accessed via a thing called a TopicalArtiFactory.

        The page at which one enters the site will contain, among many other things an InformationDesk.
      </p>
      <p>
        At it one may find helpful information, such as "What is this place", "What is here" and "What do I do to participate", "Do you have", "Where can I find", "How can I", and other questions which we will attempt to answer, or to suggest sources, find structures or begin a project seeking a solution. Because they will be posted openly when asked, they will have a real possibility of being answered by participants which will include others, like yourself, 1InformationProviders1, groups, enterprises and Companies who choose to use a public, 1OpenEnvironment1.
      </p>
      <p>
        At <a href="SunflowerSynergies.html">SunflowerSynergies</a>, the product is Information. We will deal with enquiries within our capabilities, and within the capabilities of Participants. Responses will use an 1InformationTag1. This allows the Questions and Answers to have unique names. The information at <a href="SunflowerSynergies.html">SunflowerSynergies</a> can also be discovered via 1SearchAndRecoverEngines1 and found within a limited rather than large number of responses. The service is to provide a place where an 1InformationEnquiry1 can be entered, and where the query and the resulting responses posted will have passed through the filter of moderation. The Query can be entered via Email, 1PostalServiceMail1, 1TextMessage1, or other suitable media and then be found posted for all to see at the Information Desk. It will be processed by a Moderator before posting. This will make it less likely that 1InformationChaff1 or 1MalContention1 will be present, by making it more difficult to introduce.

        This was originally called the SynergyMall, but the name having already been used, the idea as presented was renamed here to "<a href="SunflowerSynergies.html">SunflowerSynergies</a>" -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> 20071127

        Date20101202, I secured the domain name "sunflowersynergies.com" and will begin some preliminary pages and processes to make some of what is described into an actual demonstration. The idea has been incubating for 3 years and will employ some ideas not in the original <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a> page. I will in the process of the site creation, modify nearly every thing said above that will make it a <a href="UsefulUsableUsed.html">UsefulUsableUsed</a> site.

        How does <a href="SunflowerSynergies.html">SunflowerSynergies</a> differ from, say, <em>Yahoo! Answers</em> at <a href="http://answers.yahoo.com/">http://answers.yahoo.com/</a> ?

        It is to include constructed Artifacts, employs established categories (eventually interactively). It will start out with limited scope, insignificant when compared with the mega-sites.  I hope to encourage InformationMatterExperts, who know about or have discovered and will choose to contribute satisfactory answers to problems likely to be encountered by hundreds, if not thousands of participants. It will be a emergent site, <a href="NotBuiltInOneDay.html">NotBuiltInOneDay</a>, with plans being revised as changes in technology occur. My plans are to construct this site using OpenInformation. As in an example where someone is having a problem with device and wants a solution to make sure that <a href="ItWorks.html">ItWorks</a>.
      </p>

        The interface I presently see employed is one which will use the simplest possible web page format which will work on all browsers, including one to be built using various programs and operating systems.

        It creating a Site Test Bed that will be, moderated. ( not publicly interactive in order to avoid trash and spam)this should make the site more useful.
