        Categorical Listing from the <a href="AntiPatternsBook.html">AntiPatternsBook</a>. These are definitive, according to the reference, please don't change.

        <em>Does this mean don't add new </em><a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>s to this list, or just don't alter/change the categories as listed?<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           I think the goal was to keep this in synch with the <a href="AntiPatternsBook.html">AntiPatternsBook</a>, but that seems silly. Let's just keep growing - that's what the Wiki is for?

        A couple of anti-patterns are mentioned in the following online article regarding Javascript of all things. Of particular interest might be: "AllWebDevelopmentIsNewDevelopment". There is also a link from the article to a listing of Riel's OO Heuristics; see <a href="http://www.devpapers.com/article/259/">http://www.devpapers.com/article/259/</a>

        <strong>Deduplication of listings and cleanup</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I did some cleanup in the <a href="ManagementAntiPattern.html">ManagementAntiPattern</a> area and category (<a href="CategoryManagementAntiPattern.html">CategoryManagementAntiPattern</a>). Try to deduplicate <a href="ManagementAntiPattern.html">ManagementAntiPattern</a>s and to sort them by type with an appropriate <a href="RoadMap.html">RoadMap</a> page (<a href="ManagementAntiPatternRoadMap.html">ManagementAntiPatternRoadMap</a>). I will try to catch the orphan pages also when I find them. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Did the same for <a href="DevelopmentAntiPattern.html">DevelopmentAntiPattern</a>s and associated categories and <a href="RoadMap.html">RoadMap</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           I removed <a href="NationalIsm.html">NationalIsm</a> from the <a href="AntiPatternsCatalog.html">AntiPatternsCatalog</a>. Obviouly, even if it is a <a href="BadThing.html">BadThing</a>, it is difficult to consider it as an <a href="AntiPattern.html">AntiPattern</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           I created backward links between categories and <a href="RoadMaps.html">RoadMaps</a> index.
        </li>
      </ul>
