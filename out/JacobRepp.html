        Writing code for most of my life.. went something like this:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           BASIC on Commodore Pet .. choose your own adventure using PRINT, GOTOs and single key reads in elementary. Everything I needed to know about computers I learned in 2nd grade ;)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wrote many stupid algos on those sweet Commodores until my grandfather gifted me his 8088 with external 10MB HD and CGA graphics + 300baud internal modem. It was starting to show age at that point but was my main development machine until much later when most of my friends had 386s. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Transitioned to Mac code around the end of my 8088 days. Fell in love with Hypercard for a few years thanks to a math teach by the name of Robert Kaneko. Spent ungodly amounts of time figuring out how to do sprite style animation with Hypercard buttons. Wrote a couple games during this period.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Was given a telnet account at University of Washington for my 16th birthday. Used a mac and 14.4baud modem to telnet into a small SunOS cluster. Convinced some unwitting CS students to teach me how to use PICO and cc to write socket programs.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Graduated from high school and worked for my uncle writing Java based screen scrapers of LOC data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wandered though various jobs until meeting two incredible systems/network engineers Bryn Moslow and Mike Smith who worked for a company called Northwest Link where I went from answering support calls to writing radius billing software and CGI applications in C for FreeBSD/MySQL
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Through conversations ended up talking to a wizard programmer named John Fawcett who brought me on to write cross platform networking code at electronic arts. And taught me that all great (old?) programmers are also great jugglers.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Met my future wife!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Had first baby
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Went to work for content management startup writing cross platform code, 3 years of hard labor till I could take it no longer.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Interviewed at many companies ended up going the place I least expected after receiving a last minute phone call. Now working on Xbox Live at Microsoft.
        </li>
      </ul>

        Interesting, I'm not too familiar with actual use of Wiki yet so I don't know if that was a person or an automated text processor that did that but neato. I will just be naive and pretend it was a person and say 'Thank you'! (<em>It was a </em><a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> and having everything you do being edited by others is just all part of the <a href="WikiExperience.html">WikiExperience</a> good and bad. Welcome to wiki!<em>)</em>

        So I'm currently working on two different games and have done some embedding of <a href="LuaLanguage.html">LuaLanguage</a> which is a very nice simple language but I have an old love of the <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> (Learned some <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> in HS). I'm looking at possibilities for embedding Lisp into the game. Lisp makes many problems trivial and I am already imagining some interesting capabilities.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of these scenarios would probably require writing my own interpreter/compiler. I found the sl3.c source but I find it a bit crude for my uses. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So let me see if I can do the proper <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> thing here and refer to <a href="LispForGames.html">LispForGames</a>.
