        Chronically Right
      </h1>
      <p>
        A while ago, someone on Wiki posted a thought which I believe totally summed up why it's fruitless to bother responding to the <a href="ChronicallyRight.html">ChronicallyRight</a>. Recent events might be illuminated by keeping the following in mind:

        <dd><em>I do thank you for teaching me something novel though. I've seen plenty of conventional vandals, something you are not. I think you are something far, far, far more dangerous - someone who believes they are infallibly right, even when on someone else's turf. I see it on politicians' and religious fanatics' faces, but I'd never had the chance to deal directly with that kind of fundamentalism before. I see why it is such a big and complex issue in our world. I also see why it is such a dangerous thing. It can't be reasoned with, it can't be moderated, it seeks to consume all those who wish to remain separate from it, and no amount of explaining will ever get a fundamentalist to realize their flaw.</em></dd>
