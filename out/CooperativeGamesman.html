        Cooperative Gamesman

      <p>
        It's tiring hearing all these arguments about "engineer" in our titles, when what we do is less engineering than "a cooperative game of invention and communication".  In the spirit of restructuring our speaking, I'd like to propose the alternative title called <a href="CooperativeGamesman.html">CooperativeGamesman</a>/Software. 
        Maybe I'll put that on my next business card. Think of the interesting conversations you'll spark with your new business card. --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Any other ideas along this line?

        Staying well off the subject, I liked the term ProfessorOfRotationalMedicine I heard the other day for certain political operators in the UK. For cooperative inventors of software I would go more for DreamWeaver (apologies to <a href="MacroMedia.html">MacroMedia</a>), BandMember or even simply <a href="TeamPlayer.html">TeamPlayer</a> (with tolkeinesque fantasy and musical harmony in mind as ever). -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        I've always preferred "Software Developer".
