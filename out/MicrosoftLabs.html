        Microsoft Labs

      <p>
        <em>Is </em><a href="MicrosoftLabs.html">MicrosoftLabs</a> one of the <a href="GreatResearchLabs.html">GreatResearchLabs</a> of all time, like <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a> or <a href="BellLabs.html">BellLabs</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hard to say, <a href="MicrosoftLabs.html">MicrosoftLabs</a> is fairly new. Unlike some of the other labs; MS labs seems more bottom-line focused. 
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand,  much of the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> technology has come out of these labs; as has Microsoft's multimedia codecs (WindowsMediaNine in particular). And then their's Palladium. :) 
      </p>

        Whether or not these things will "contribute mightily" remains to be seen. Things that don't contribute to MS's bottom line, I imagine, won't escape into the public domain --the folks that run MS are far better businesspersons than the folks that used to run Xerox.

        Part of what made <a href="XeroxParc.html">XeroxParc</a> such a technical success is what made it a commercial failure.  If every computer maker/programmer who built a mouse, used Ethernet, used windows and pointers, etc., had to pay royalties to Xerox,  these technologies may well have become technological footnotes.

      <p>
        At any rate, the collection of Ph. Ds that MS has amassed, including greats like <a href="CarHoare.html">CarHoare</a>, is quite impressive. Whether or not  <a href="MicrosoftLabs.html">MicrosoftLabs</a>? will one day be uttered with the same reverence as <a href="BellLabs.html">BellLabs</a>, I don't know.
