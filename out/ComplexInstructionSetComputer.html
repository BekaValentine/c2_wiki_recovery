        Interestingly enough, the term CISC was (I believe) coined by the RISC camp, and was frequently used as a pejorative for processors with such architectures, including the <a href="MotorolaSixtyEightKay.html">MotorolaSixtyEightKay</a> and the <a href="ExEightySix.html">ExEightySix</a> architecture. The term CISC was never used until there was a RISC architecture in opposition.

        Other examples of CISC architectures which were prominent at one point include the Vax.
