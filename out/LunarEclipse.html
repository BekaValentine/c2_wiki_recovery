      <p>
        A plugin for the <a href="EclipseIde.html">EclipseIde</a> which adds two major features.

           Nice, but I did get along fine without it

      <dl>
        <dt><strong>Lightweight completion</strong></dt>
        <dd>Immediate completion of token, subsequent invocations change token to next match.  matches are returned in the order last used, and then by the order they're found;  it'll match the long variable name you last used first, followed by the other long name in your current file before it matches ten others like it in other source files you happen to have open.</dd>
      </dl>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is what makes it essential for me (it was a sad couple months before it was updated to the latest breaking api changes in eclipse);  not that I have anything against the other completion forms given by eclipse, on the contrary, their structured and intelligent nature is exactly what I need half the time.  It's just that the other half of the time, I'm dealing with free flowing text, or new names which are similar to others I've already used.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that I consider this to be an essential plugin for eclipse, and hope that they add it to the official distribution at some point.
