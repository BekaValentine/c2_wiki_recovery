        River Flow Analogy
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is an analogy relating to <a href="MentalStateCalledFlow.html">MentalStateCalledFlow</a>, and to <a href="ListenToTheCode.html">ListenToTheCode</a>, <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, etc...
      </p>
      <p>
        Flow is what a river <em>does</em>.
        But water and a channel is what a river <em>is</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What is it about what it is that makes it so good at what it does?
      </p>
      <p>
        The channel <em>guides</em> the water.
        The water <em>shapes</em> the channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        You need to be like water flowing through the channel of your (software development/mainentance) work, being guided by it in your action, but ultimately shaping it through your action.

        The missing ingredient here is a source of <em>energy</em>.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Are you a stagnant pool going nowhere? 
        </li>
        <li>
           Are you a rushing chaotic torrent violently tossed about by your channel yet having little effect on it?
        </li>
        <li>
           Or are you a high pressure water jet cutting through the steel of your channel?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When is it appropriate to be what?
