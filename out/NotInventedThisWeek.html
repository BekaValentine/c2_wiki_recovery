        This an extreme form of <a href="NotInventedHere.html">NotInventedHere</a>. It occurs when the only code that is trusted is that which has been recently developed. Older code and components, no matter how fit for purpose they are, are rejected in favour of re-developing the same 'favorite' components over and over again.
