        I am one of the co-founders of <a href="ProductSight.html">ProductSight</a> a startup software company.  I am acting as <a href="TheCoach.html">TheCoach</a> for our XP team.

        After attending <a href="XpImmersionTwo.html">XpImmersionTwo</a> in March 2000, I resolved to change my career and get extreme.  At that time I wrote, "For me it seems that XP is a <a href="ConversationYouCantStayAwayFrom.html">ConversationYouCantStayAwayFrom</a>. Now that I have attended <a href="XpImmersionTwo.html">XpImmersionTwo</a> I want to figure out how to do more of it."  I'm glad to have acted on my yearnings, or was it <a href="PairLust.html">PairLust</a>?

        I previously worked for the world wide services group at SDRC with an emphasis on helping customers deploy Metaphase, a Product Data Management product.

        My job title was: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Principal Methodology Architect
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Truly grand? ;-)  I was intimidated by how XP people reacted to this concatenation of <a href="XpTabooWords.html">XpTabooWords</a>. I met <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> at OOPSLA '99 and was amazed that someone else actually used the term MethodologyArchitect?. His presentation "Designing a Light Methdology" was very useful for me to understand and accept how XP complemented conventional development wisdom.
