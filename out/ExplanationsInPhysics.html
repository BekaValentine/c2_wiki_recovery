        Is there a sensible explanation for everyday electromagnetic attraction?
        Why do repulsion and attraction have greatly different explanations? 
      </p>
      <p>
        To explain repulsion all you need to do is draw a Feynman diagram with two electrons swapping a photon. The photon conveys momentum between them. If you draw the same diagram for attraction, what's the photon supposed to convey ... <strong>negative</strong> momentum? Yeah right! (This could actually make sense except that 1) nobody has broken down and admitted that's what's happening, and 2) you'd need to explain why it conveys positive momentum in some cases and negative momentum in others.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Note also that the Casimir Effect <strong>in no way</strong> explains electromagnetic attraction. Electromagnetic attraction is a far more powerful force than the Casimir effect by many orders of magnitude and varies with the <strong>second</strong>, not the fourth power of distance. In fact, the calculations for the Casimir effect assume infinitely large parallel plates in order to get rid of edge effects. Those calculations simply don't apply when the two "plates" you're talking about are <strong>all edges</strong> (i.e., particles).
      </p>
      <p>
        By way of comparison, the explanations for electromagnetic repulsion and color attraction are simple and elegant. The explanation of color attraction is similar to the Casimir effect; the energy density inside nucleons is so high that it causes the vacuum to change, to become a <em>simple</em> vacuum (ie, different from the ordinary vacuum), which does not push against color-charged objects. Since the color force is extremely powerful, the inwards pressure on colored particles is extremely high. But that doesn't explain electromagnetic attraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        There simply isn't any good explanation for electromagnetic attraction. That's right, an everyday familiar phenomenon like electromagnetic attraction has no explanation that most people can understand. Do people care? No, they do not. They'd rather ooh and aah over an unfamiliar but perfectly trivial phenomenon like the Casimir effect rather than scratch their heads over something that's a trillion times more important.

        Gluons on the other hand are a good model that is part of the standard theory that has been very consistent between predictions and measurements, but we're only barely scratching the surface of the high energy regimes necessary to consider them to be quite as good an approximation to reality as are photons.

        Gravitons on the other hand have <strong>zero</strong> measurements, let alone ones that are consistent with theory.

        <em>Gravitons are necessary because they come out as a result of quantizing gravity. Quantizing gravity is necessary because Many-Worlds requires it.

        And Robert Walgate's skater analogy of how Boson exchange can mediate attraction <em>and</em> repulsion (gets around negative momentum issue):
        Page 4 of <a href="http://www.commonsensescience.org/pdf/process.pdf">http://www.commonsensescience.org/pdf/process.pdf</a> -
        "...in QM, which affects small-scale phenomena, there is a strange extension and delocalization of events
        that allows a seemingly impossible event: one skater throws the ball away from the other, in the opposite
        direction, but the other skater is still able to catch the ball. A little thought shows that if such events were possible, as they are in the world of elementary particles, they would cause an attractive force between the skaters."

        <dd>I skimmed the paper and there is no explanation. In many-histories, a photon that zig-zags across the entire universe suffers the consequences for doing so. Not only that, but these consequences and how they're triggered are precisely spelled out. Photons rotate in the complex plane and the longer their trip, the more they rotate and interfere with each other. Finally, it isn't that a photon <em>can</em> go across the universe and back, but that it DOES and every other path simultaneously. So everything that happens is spelled out in excruciating detail.</dd>

Was not able to find that quote directly so had to settle for that reference. Here is a bit more explanation from a different link and diagram also supporting attraction as a process involving bosons being generated "away" from the fermion (electron in this case) and being received from the opposite direction due to the uncertainty principle:

        <dd>Negative momentum isn't that absurd because all it requires is for photons to have negative energy, which is an already used as an explanation for black hole radiation. However, I still don't understand a photon, or any other particle, having negative energy. But a particle emitting a photon to the left and another particle absorbing it to the right of it, that's just absurd. This isn't a "topology" issue and it's not a question of the photon taking a strange path, this is a complete breakdown of the concept of dimension. When you completely break down one of the three fundamental concepts of physics (energy, dimension, information), you're done for.</dd>

I can say that photons are not spherically symmetrical (being vector bosons), and it's that degree of internal freedom that accounts for the different responses.

        <dd>You're right, I confused negative energy with negative mass. And negative mass has no relation to black holes, but to tachyons.</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Imaginary <em>mass relates to tachyons.  Negative mass and energy relate to virtual particles, which thinking about it is probably what the page was referring to.  If we take an ordinary electron-positron pair:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        ...   -   +   ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>...except draw in the virtual electrons, so we only have to worry about one kind of interaction:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        ...   -       ...  Real stuff (+ve energy levels)<br/>
        ...------- ---...  Virtual stuff (-ve energy levels)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>It should be clear that the electrons are all going to be pushed towards the hole, i.e. the positron, with the net result that the electron and positron are attracted.  The virtual photon mentioned above doesn't occur in this description, but that's ok, because the EM field also involves an infinite number of other interactions.  If you subtract the field without the real particles from the field with them, it's what you'd be left with.  In this context, it has negative momentum because it's not an interaction, it's a difference of interactions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course none of this actually works, since it has an infinite number of particles exerting forces in all directions, and these are just supposed to almost cancel.  Plus it really ignores the symmetry between electrons and positrons.  But real descriptions, in terms of quantum field theory and its successors, are either complex or presented poorly.  Maybe this is enough to give some idea as to what's going on?  Thinking about it, it's similar to your description of colour attraction - near positrons, the vacuum is changed so as to not push so hard against electrons.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've known about that explanation of EM attraction for a very long time. First, this is not an explanation that most people would understand. Second, there still lacks an explanation for why EM attraction is so very much more complicated than EM repulsion. Finally, not only is the gross asymmetry disturbing, but it's absolutely revolting how physicists and any books on physics gloss over the difference between the two. They're simply evil sons of bitches in my book.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the first, I don't think you're giving people enough credit.  This is the same explanation as why electrons and holes attract in semiconductors, which people have no trouble with in elementary school.  "A missing electron, with respect to the background, behaves like a particle with opposite properties to an electron - what repels electrons attracts it, and what attracts electrons repels it."  Actually thinking about it, that explanation will carry over to the field version.  A positron is negative one electrons, so should experience forces reversed, just like two electrons will experience forces doubled.  No gross asymmetries, but leaves out the tricky part of deciding such things exist.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'm not going to defend the approach taken by physics books, on this or much else.  They're mostly written with a calculation-is-what-counts attitude that makes them all but useless for anything else.  Unfortunately, such an approach is self-sustaining.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        On a different subject, I always got the impression that colour attraction was something more fundamental than just the vacuum getting polarized. The term 'simple vacuum' seemed to imply it was something very different from a normal vacuum. And I've never thought of QM as background independent ....
      </p>
      <p>
        And getting to tachyons, I recall an explanation for why negative mass is impossible based on classical mechanics. Any particle with negative mass would immediately accelerate to infinite velocity because its acceleration would make its energy go down to negative infinity, minimizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Negative mass can't be ruled out in a coherent relativistic theory.  In order to stop particles from accelerating infinitely, you have to assume all the higher velocity states are full.  That's where virtual particles come from.</em>

        At a quick glance that looks like a good refactoring, Richard, aside from your usual gratuitous vitriol, and aside from your religion about ManyWorlds. Check again; it is not a theory, it is a philosophical interpretation. This is a terminological issue, notice, because it is just a device for making intuitive sense of the actual theory of QM. It is not a theory because it makes no positive nor negative predictions even in principle, nor is there any way, even in principle, to distinguish it from the other 3 interpretations of QM.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wasn't going to get into it, but what the hell: I noticed a few weeks ago some stuff you wrote that indicates that you simultaneously believe in modern entanglement theories. This is a contradiction. Entanglement and its related issues are indeed a theory, and as such in fact <strong>replace</strong> the older 4 interpretations of QM. By <a href="OccamsRazor.html">OccamsRazor</a>, those interpretations are no longer necessary now that we've got a theory.

        <em>Many Worlds makes predictions that conflict with other theories. These include quantum computation, quantum erasure and gravitons. Many Worlds </em>requires<em> gravity be quantized, other theories do not. Many Worlds also predicts parallel universes, as does General Relativity, and this is yet another thing that makes sense. Many-Worlds is the only theory that actually predicts what happens at a quantum level. Many-Worlds is just chock-full of predictions, you just have to know what shape these predictions take.</em>

      <p>
        <em>Many Worlds isn't a philosophical interpretation, it's the only physical theory </em>consistent<em> with philosophy by virtue of </em>being<em> a physical theory (a theory of real physical objects). That's not quite the same thing.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In fact, it goes much deeper than that because QM without MW isn't a physical theory at all, just a bunch of meaningless math. MW is the theory, the thing that talks about the Real World, and QM is just its expression in mathematical language. The whole notion that an "interpretation" is superfluous, unnecessary or "philosophical" is idiotic. QM makes NO predictions, it's MW that makes ALL the predictions for it. It's not QM that's been experimentally verified to the 10th decimal place, it's MW. You can no more experimentally verify QM than you can experimentally verify that 2 + 2 = 4.</em>

      <p>
        <em>No update. The explanation for why there's always a brane handy to wrap around any discontinuity in spacetime is because one can warp there from across the universe in an instant, wrap the tear, then zoom back where it came from.

We don't see it because this all cancels out. And the same for FTL branes ... except around tears in spacetime.</em>

        Forgive my ignorance for a moment... Is there a known disbalence between electromagnetic attraction vs repulsion?  i.e., Two magnets, if appropriately aligned, will push away from each other with a force that is not equal to their attraction if their poles are reversed?  --<a href="WilliamUnderwood.html">WilliamUnderwood</a>

        No.  Why do you ask?

        I don't remember off hand;  I think it was an explanation of gravity I came across somewhere, but I don't remember the reference, or any of the specifics really.  --cwillu

        That sort of thing tends to be impossible for direct and simple reasons, such as that it would tend to imply a non-zero contour integral (usually "lines of force" terminate neatly in magnetic poles or electric charges), which is a contradiction in terms under most conditions. Contriving a space where it wasn't self contradictory, it would at minimum still be a non-conservative system. Perpetual motion and "free energy" might <strong>sound</strong> nice, but then you wouldn't have a stable universe. <a href="http://www.answers.com/topic/path-integral">http://www.answers.com/topic/path-integral</a> -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
