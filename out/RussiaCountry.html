        Russia is a huge piece of land straddling the EuroAsianContinent. It's the world's largest country, ahead of Canada and the USA.

        For most westerners, Russia is associated with its European cities - Moscow, St Petersburg and Murmansk. This is the heartland of Imperial Russia, and these great and ancient cities often become the focus for most tourists. However, there is much more to Russia, a country that spans eleven time zones and two continents, ending less than 50 miles from North America. Within this vast expanse lie the largest freshwater lake in the world, rivers and forests teeming with fish and wildlife, awe inspiring volcanos, and towering mountains. Russia is the largest country on earth, with enormous tracts of land that have been opened to travellers only in the last few years.

        While MoscowCity and some Siberian towns prosper, many parts of Russia are literally deserted.

        True enough, but it should also be pointed out that they both <em>left</em> the Soviet Union to come to the US.
