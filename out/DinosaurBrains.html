        "Using the metaphor of the dinosaur brain, the authors detail a whole range of human responses dictated by a part of the human brain sometimes beyond our control. They then show you what to expect from that part of the brain and how to be prepared for it, including such problems as turf battles, reflexive competitiveness, and office courtship. Outlines the rules of LizardLogic, and how to use them to your advantage."
