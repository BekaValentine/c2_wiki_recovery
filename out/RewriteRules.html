        Rewrite Rules
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's possible to model computation as carrying out a series of rewrite rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a database of rules and an input datum. Each rule says, basically, "If the input looks like THIS, rewrite it like THIS."
      </p>
      <p>
        You try to match the input datum against the rules. When you find the best match, the rule will specify a way to rewrite the input pattern. (Alternatively, all matching rules are followed, as is common in <a href="LogicProgramming.html">LogicProgramming</a> and <a href="AutomatedTheoremProving.html">AutomatedTheoremProving</a>.)
      </p>
      <p>
        The rewritten pattern becomes a new input pattern and the process repeats. If an input pattern doesn't match any rules, computation stops. Traditionally, one ensures that there are a variety of 'canonical forms' that are not matched by any rule; these correspond to 'values' in the language.

        This is the way most of us were taught to do algebra and calculus.

        Those for whom <a href="SchemeMacros.html">SchemeMacros</a> are just not twisted enough may be interested in sendmail configuration files; these are based on rewrite rules, and are famously Turing-complete.

        Rewrite systems are often able to perform computations bi-directionally, producing inputs from a source. Some rewrite systems distinguish between '=' and '=>', with the former allowing flow in both directions and the latter to be uni-directional.

        <a href="AutomatedTheoremProving.html">AutomatedTheoremProving</a> also can be done using <a href="RewriteRules.html">RewriteRules</a> using axioms and theorems from logic as the rules.

      <p>
        Every day actions are similar to <a href="RewriteRules.html">RewriteRules</a> (a ProductionSystem mapping from actions to actions):
      </p>
      <code>
        go to work -> drive to work, get coffee, go to office, check email<br/>
        drive to X -> get things for X, go to car, start car, take route to X, park<br/>
        get coffee -> order, pay, pour, add cream/sugar, stir<br/>
        go to office  -> take elevator, greet receptionist, say hello to people in hallway <br/>
        ...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Such rules are actually coded into robots and HomeAutomation systems where they have to perform the actions or accommodate a person's habits, eg car automatically set seat for driver D because this is the time she drives to work. See also <a href="EventDrivenProgramming.html">EventDrivenProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="RewriteRules.html">RewriteRules</a> are considerably more powerful than this example. For example, if you want to write a program to evaluate Scheme expressions, you can have a machine state that looks like one of these:
      </p>
      <code>
        (eval <expr> <env> <k>)<br/>
        (call <proc> <args> <k>)<br/>
        (return <k> <retval>)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The eval state means that the machine is about to evaluate the expression <expr> in the environment <env> and return the result to the continuation <k>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The call state means that the machine is about to call the procedure <proc> with arguments <args> and return the result to the continuation <k>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The return state means that the machine has already computed <retval> and is about to return it to the continuation <k>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To stop the machine, you need a final continuation FK. Then your first rule is the one that stops the machine.
      </p>
      <code>
        [Rule #1] (return FK <retval>) -> STOP (processing was successful; maybe display <retval> for the user)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then you can create other rules. Here's the rule that evaluates literals:
      </p>
      <code>
        [Rule #2] (eval <literal> <env> <k>) -> (return <k> <literal>)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This pattern has to be implemented in such a way that <literal> only matches a self-evaluating object. If the pattern does not match you have to use some other rule.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's four rules that handle begin. First the begin with only one expression in it:
      </p>
      <code>
        [Rule #3] (eval (begin <e1>) <env> <k>) -> (eval <e1> <env> <k>)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That's pretty simple, it just throws away the begin. Then the begin with multiple expressions:
      </p>
      <code>
        [Rule #4] (eval (begin <e1> <e2> ...) <env> <k>) -> (eval <e1> <env> (begin-continuation <env> <k> <e2> ...))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This rewrites the whole state so that the first expression of the begin will be evaluated, and the result will be returned to a new begin-continuation which will throw away the result and evaluate the subsequent expressions of the begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        To make the begin-continuation work we have to write rules to match it. Here's the case where the begin continuation contains only one more expression:
      </p>
      <code>
        [Rule #5] (return (begin-continuation <env> <k> <e2>) <retval>) -> (eval <e2> <env> <k>)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This evaluates the expression in the tail position. Then we handle the case where the begin continuation contains two or more subsequent expressions:
      </p>
      <code>
        [Rule #6] (return (begin-continuation <env> <k> <e2> <e3> ...) <retval>) -> (eval <e2> <env> (begin-continuation <env> <k> <e3> ...))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This starts the evaluation of the second subexpression and sets it up to return its value to a begin-continuation which will evaluate the remaining expressions of the begin.
      </p>
      <p>
        To evaluate (begin 1 2 3), you write an initial machine state and then apply the matching rules, as follows:
      </p>
      <code>
        (eval (begin 1 2 3) #f FK)<br/>
        [matches Rule #4]<br/>
        (eval 1 #f (begin-continuation #f FK 2 3))<br/>
        [matches Rule #2]<br/>
        (return (begin-continuation #f FK 2 3) 1)<br/>
        [matches Rule #6]<br/>
        (eval 2 #f (begin-continuation #f FK 3))<br/>
        [matches Rule #2]<br/>
        (return (begin-continuation #f FK 3) 2)<br/>
        [matches Rule #5]<br/>
        (eval 3 #f FK)<br/>
        [matches Rule #2]<br/>
        (return FK 3)<br/>
        [matches Rule #1 -- STOP! Final result is 3]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        To make call-with-current-continuation, you have to define a rule that matches the call state where call-with-current-continuation is about to be called...
