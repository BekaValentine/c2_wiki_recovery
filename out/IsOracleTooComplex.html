        Is Oracle Too Complex
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Oracle database system is quite complex relative to other database systems. This tends to create a few problems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It turns out more difficult to manage than many expect.
        </li>
        <li>
           Misinformed people purchase it because of its reputation for power in big companies even though they are not a big company or don't need so much scalability. However, they may be biting off more than they can chew. Sometimes you just need a <a href="NimbleDatabase.html">NimbleDatabase</a>, or something mid-sized like <a href="MySql.html">MySql</a>, <a href="PostgreSql.html">PostgreSql</a> or <a href="SqlServer.html">SqlServer</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Exposure to Oracle's complexity taints people's view of RDBMS as too cumbersome.
        </li>
        <li>
           Other DB products try to copy aspects of Oracle, but don't always copy the right aspects for their target market.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Now don't get me wrong, this topic is <strong>not Oracle-bashing</strong> necessarily. Oracle is a very powerful tool that has lots of options because it is used in a lot of large organizations with complex and large-scale needs. It serves this market well and it is difficult or impossible to compete with a well-tuned Oracle system on scalability. (Only IBM's DB2 seems to even try.)
