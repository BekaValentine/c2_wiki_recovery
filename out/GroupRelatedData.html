        <strong>Problem:</strong> An <a href="XmlLanguage.html">XmlLanguage</a> (or similar) document format is too hard to process.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong> Even though each datum is well-isolated (see <a href="IsolateEachDatum.html">IsolateEachDatum</a>), the data is still unwieldy.  Cumbersome and unnatural parsing must be performed and non-obvious conventions must be applied in order to make heads or tails of the data structure.  In particular, there are flat lists that contain data with implicit internal structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution:</strong> Make sure there are enclosures for all groups of logically connected data.  However, avoid multiple layers of unnecessary wrapping; once your data is well-structured, leave it at that.  The deeper you make it from that point on, the more annoying it will be to work with -- at little to no benefit.
      </p>
      <p>
        It may appear as though adding structure would just mean adding bloat/noise/weight or whatever.  Nevertheless, if in doubt, go with more structure.  It is easy to transform well-structured data to poorly-structured data; going the other way is harder.  If still in doubt, maybe you'll have to take other factors into account, such as expected amount of hand-editing and the effect on that, and whether or not size is absolutely critical (if you're using XML, now is a good time to reconsider).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Resulting Context:</strong> This is primarily from an XML point of view, but most of this applies to, e.g., <a href="EssExpressions.html">EssExpressions</a> as well:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           An XSLT stylesheet can now straightforwardly match all elements of a certain type and do whatever it needs to with those and their children.  This is the way XSLT was designed to work.  With poorly-enclosed data, the stylesheet was required to essentially do some nasty tree/list parsing to figure out where the data it needed was located.
        </li>
        <li>
           Writing readable and modular schemas to validate the data is now much easier.
        </li>
        <li>
           The data is much easier to read, since quickly scanning the left edge of the markup now reveals its overall structure in a glance.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Known Uses:</strong> This problem is very common and often occurs when people inexperienced with processing data is responsible for designing data formats.  It is relevant to XML as well as S-expressions, although it's more common in the XML world -- if only because the XML world is less mature.

      <p>
        Good -- easy to process <em>(has just the right amount of structure)</em>:
      </p>
      <code>

      <p>
        Also good (effectively equivalent):

      <p>
        <em>Wrong.  Here it is:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>(dictionary</em><br/>
        <em>  (entry :term "ROFL" "rolling on the floor laughing")</em><br/>
        <em>  (entry :term "LMAO" "laughing my ass off"))</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Right, but I think that one doesn't really make sense.  First, what purpose do the seemingly dead-weight copies of "entry" serve?  Second, why use ":term x" instead of the more obvious "(term x)"?  Third, why mention "term" at all?  It seems all those things are just there to create a literal translation of a piece of non-ideal XML, and that's kind of silly.  I mean, in that case, you might as well emulate the end tags as well, yielding
      </p>
      <code>
        <em>(dictionary</em><br/>
        <em>  (entry :term "ROFL" "rolling on the floor laughing" /entry)</em><br/>
        <em>  (entry :term "LMAO" "laughing my ass off" /entry) /dictionary)</em><br/>
      </code>

        Mind you, I certainly didn't intend this to be yet another XML vs. S-expressions page; rather, I wanted to show how to refactor XML, and while at it, also roughly corresponding S-expressions.  However, I can see that the "no S-expression equivalent" looks kind of provocative.  Maybe we should instead stick the alternative XML solutions right next to each other and show the single sane S-expression solution below them?  Thanks for your input.

        Bad -- hard to process <em>(uses an ungodly mix of both too much and too little structure)</em>:

        Also good (but note that this variant would not have been an option had I chosen to go with structured keys):

        </property><br/>
        </plist><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>How about:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        <plist version="1.0"><br/>
        <property key="AnimateSnapToGrid"><br/>
        <strong><boolean value="true" /></strong><br/>
        </property><br/>

        <point x="79" y="44" /><br/>
        </property><br/>
        <property key="FileViewer.LastWindowLocation"><br/>
        <rectangle x1="228" y1="140" x2="1091" y2="826" /><br/>
        </property><br/>
        </plist><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>Here, the boolean validation is according to type, type being 'boolean' element (meaning a property may contain 'boolean' element and not 'true' or 'false' element).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, you're absolutely right.  I like this better too.  In your version, ElementNamesAreTypeNames, which strikes me as highly intuitive.
