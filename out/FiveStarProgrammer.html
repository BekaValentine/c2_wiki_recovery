        No, a <a href="FiveStarProgrammer.html">FiveStarProgrammer</a> is not someone whose code contains five levels of indirection (see <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a>s).  Rather, a <a href="FiveStarProgrammer.html">FiveStarProgrammer</a> is someone who has reached the highest peaks of the programming craft - one who has reached programming "enlightenment".
