        <em>The City in History</em>, written by him in 1961, describes the evolution of the city from earliest times. In the early part of the book, he describes the accommodation between hunters and pastoralists, which starts as a coming together of equals and ends with one group, the hunters, claiming superiority and tribute from the other group. They set themselves up in a citadel near the emerging town.
