        Often times, meeting a party for negotiations is inconvenient.  Many car dealers, recruiters, etc. won't negotiate over the phone, seeking instead to <a href="NegotiateOnFriendlyGround.html">NegotiateOnFriendlyGround</a> (or even in the showroom--as one car salesman once told me, "out here, the price for this car is <MSRP>.  If you want to discuss a different price, step into my office.").
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to deal with this is to <a href="NeverComeBack.html">NeverComeBack</a>.  If you do come back, it likely means you couldn't find a better offer elsewhere, and the other party has you at an advantage.  So instead, give the other party only one chance (meaning one session, not one offer) to negotiate.

        Many salespeople will expect you to <a href="NeverComeBack.html">NeverComeBack</a>, and try to <a href="CloseTheDealQuickly.html">CloseTheDealQuickly</a>.
