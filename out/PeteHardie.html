          /30/2002 - in light of the recent purge of 'unused' home pages, I'm marking my territory here today.  Don't delete this page this year.

        <em>Pete, considering that you have signed contributions on more than 100 pages, you probably wouldn't get deleted by anybody. The deletions have been largely against recently unedited </em>orphaned<em> homepages.</em>

        I'm not sure I follow the humor. You mean because you think there was an implied page deletion in the absence of a date?

        <em>Ah, I see.  Again, quite welcome.  I tried to limit my work to the dross that was totally unnecessary to the debate, and not to delete things that were reasoned arguments, however much I might disagree with them.</em>
