        Thought As A System - by David Bohm ( ISBN 0-415-11030-0 )
      </p>
      <p>
        "The essential relevance of Bohm's redefinition of thought is the proposal that body, emotion, intellect, reflex and artifact are now understood as one unbroken field of mutually informing thought". It is the record of a dialog which took place between fifty participants in a seminar.  It is worth reading and informational on what a group finds interesting and pertinent in the process of thought and idea formation.
