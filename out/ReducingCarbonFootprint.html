        Question: What about Carbon Footprint? Non-realtime transports like <a href="FidoNet.html">FidoNet</a> or (the old) <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> not requiring always on connections could give power grids a break.

        Answer: This is but a very small amount of savings, particularly since neither of these are currently being utilized by a significant number of people or organizations. I know that if this represented a problem requiring a current solution, that an enterprising individual, group or company would be quick to fulfill this requirement.
