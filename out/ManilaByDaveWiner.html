        Manila is similar but more structured than <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> as implemented here
        by Ward Cunningham.  Manila has a number of bells and whistles that facilitate site management. Manila works with the <a href="UserlandFrontier.html">UserlandFrontier</a> server also by Dave Winer.
      </p>
      <p>
        Visitors to a Manila supported site may read and reply, that is append a message to a page. Visitors must register their email address and obtain a password.  Only "editors" with editor access may do more than append replies to an existing page.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pages are maintained in the order of creation like a Web message base for a discussion group. Page creation is handled like posting a message in a Web-based discussion group. HTML is implemented, but there are no simplified codes like <em> for italic and </em>' for bold nor any simplified conventions for lists.
      </p>
      <p>
        You are invited to drop by and use the editor access functions of a site
        maintained with Manila at: <a href="http://inetgroup.editthispage.com">http://inetgroup.editthispage.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        In the spirit of the <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> community, <em>where the inmates run the asylum,</em> you may use the "editor" account and password which is available via an email responder at: <a href="http://www.responders.net/form.asp?member=manila">http://www.responders.net/form.asp?member=manila</a>

        <strong>Well worth exploring</strong> By: <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>

        Manila is an interesting solution for more "controlled" groupware than Wiki.  Manila doesn't encourage linking nearly as much as Wiki, as shortcuts are automatically created only for stories (which only contributing editors can create).  Non-editors who wish to link to anything but a story apparently have to create a raw HTML link.
      </p>
      <p>
        The situation in most Wikis is that all visitors have nearly complete control over content, but changing the presentation usually requires changing the script.  In Manila, there is a multi-level system of people not logged in (view only), ordinary users (append-only), contributing editors (who can post new stories), and managing editors (who control access, can delete stories or even users, and can modify site presentation and parameters).
      </p>
      <p>
        The foregoing was posted on December 5, 1999 at <a href="http://inetgroup.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$9">http://inetgroup.editthispage.com/discuss/msgReader$9</a> and a copy
        sent to <a href="JohnDeBruyn.html">JohnDeBruyn</a> who is the "managing editor" for the inetgroup Manila
        site.

        Manila has some rather high barriers to editing compared to the simplicity and openness of Wiki.  Manila has many interesting features, but also some very annoying problems.  (The "click here and there might be replies" interface for discussion threads is... there aren't polite words.)  Some of the "managing editor" features (like email notification) need to be guarded carefully to avoid real-world problems.  Manila is a reasonably open solution for those who cannot or will not accept a completely open <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. -- <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>

        One of the problems with Manila and many other message based systems is that
        replies are buried rather than appended to the page.  A few years ago the reply or respond function in the context of the development of <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>s was discussed by <a href="JohnDeBruyn.html">JohnDeBruyn</a> and <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> in <a href="AppendOnly.html">AppendOnly</a>.  <a href="JohnDeBruyn.html">JohnDeBruyn</a> (December 11, 1999)

        Manila, especially Dave Winer's marketing and promotional ideas would be worth
        a quick look by those interested in taking <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> and <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>s, into
        prime time.  A bit more detail is over at: <a href="http://c2.com/w2/wiki/WikiForumMarketingAndPromotionForGroupWare">http://c2.com/w2/wiki/WikiForumMarketingAndPromotionForGroupWare</a> (<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>)  <a href="JohnDeBruyn.html">JohnDeBruyn</a> (
