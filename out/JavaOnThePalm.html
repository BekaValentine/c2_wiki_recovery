        Java On The Palm
      </h1>
      <p>
        Java can be run under <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a> using the KVM.
        I'm doing a feasibility study for a palm application at the moment, and I'd like to hear from anybody whose used the KVM for serious work.

        Please correct me if i'm wrong:
        It seems that the only way to get a Java program running on PalmOS is to compile it on some other machine, then copy the executable over. If you want to do <a href="ProgrammingOnHandHelds.html">ProgrammingOnHandHelds</a> / <a href="OoEnvironmentForPalm.html">OoEnvironmentForPalm</a>, you have to pick some other language.

        I've put the KVM on my Palm VII and I got the Handheld Express extension for JBuilder (<a href="http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/hhe/)">http://www.borland.com/jbuilder/hhe/)</a> which makes it <em>very</em> easy to build Palm apps.  Have I done any serious work? No, not yet, but I believe it's very feasible, particularly the VIIx, with 8MB, or any oher PalmOS handheld with a large memory.  The KVM itself reports its size as 273K.  A minimal application is a few K, a real one would be at least a couple of dozen K.  There's no AWT in the CLD or kjava, but at <a href="JavaOne.html">JavaOne</a> they talked about AWT for PalmOS.  Check out this presention from <a href="JavaOne.html">JavaOne</a>: <a href="http://jsp.java.sun.com/javaone/javaone2000/pdfs/TS-1024.pdf">http://jsp.java.sun.com/javaone/javaone2000/pdfs/TS-1024.pdf</a> In fact, check out all the J2ME stuff from <a href="JavaOne.html">JavaOne</a>. I don't think Swing is going to work any time before the end of 2000 :-).

        Recent Palms such as the Zire 72 can  use a downloaded IBM J2ME JVM
