        <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> was originally written at OneTree Corporation by Brian Harry and Kenny Felder and was purchased by Microsoft in 1994. Later, Brian Harry went on to lead the team developing the virtual machine technology behind .Net.

        Microsoft's own internally-written version control was a development of RCS called "SLM"; it was given a truly horrid GUI and released as <a href="MicrosoftDelta.html">MicrosoftDelta</a>... oh GOD it was bad it was so so SOOOOOO bad.... which is why they bought <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>, they were THAT humiliated by the reviews of Delta.

        If this is Microsoft's answer to source control, I'd *hate* to think what the question was....
      </p>
      <p>
        So far as I can tell, <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> is a really pretty GUI wrapped so tight around an RCS clone that you can hardly see the original. (Some of the tags are the same.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It's portable ... as long as your idea of "portable" means "Windows 95 and Windows NT". There's a Unix implementation by Mainsoft, which I've charitably heard described as "a disaster". (Its locking scheme is incompatible with the Windows version, for example.) At my last job, Unix programmers needed Windows systems to put Unix source files under control with Windows <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>. (It was too Windows-centric a place to provide a separate repository for Unix software, and too Microsoft-centric to move to a truly cross-platform system.) -- <a href="PaulChisholm.html">PaulChisholm</a>

        The above pretty much reflects my opinions of <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> 4.0, but 5.0, which I'm just trying out now, promises a project-oriented merging-model CVS kind of thing.

        We're using <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> 5.0 for about a year now, and it is still an RCS clone with multiple check-out ability (which is still a great improvement on 4.0). It don't even come close to CVS. For example, it is unable to do (or at least I wasn't able to find out how to do) file-level branching, and historic tagging (rtag), just to name a few things I miss. By the way, does anyone know of a CVS integration with DevStudio?

        I don't think so. Branching in <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> is needlessly complicated. In most systems, you just tag the files, and it sorts itself out. In <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>, you have to branch the project (which shares the files between the new project and the old project), and then break the link. Merging the branches back together is a pain. The main disadvantage (in my opinion) of working this way is that your repository ends up cluttered with versions of the project that you no longer need. And just for the record, I'm not an example of the <a href="AntiMicrosoftBiasOnWiki.html">AntiMicrosoftBiasOnWiki</a> - I'm currently using IE5, NT4 and VC6 (with CVS ;-) -- <a href="RogerLipscombe.html">RogerLipscombe</a>

        People complain <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> isn't CVS because it doesn't have an archaic CLI - except that it does. Or that it doesn't have file branching - except that it does.

      <p>
        Sam also took exception to Kristof's statement that <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> doesn't do tagging. Well, it doesn't. It has "labels" on files, but you can only ever have one label on any version of a file or project. That means you can't do a lot of the things you can with, say, CVS tags or Perforce labels. Does that indicate that Sam is prejudiced and is unable to see that there could be anything similar to <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>'s labels but enough better to make people complain about its absence? Let's assume not. So if making a mistake when comparing products is OK, what exactly justifies Sam's accusations against Kristof?

        It's doable. See <a href="http://www.jalindi.com/igloo/">http://www.jalindi.com/igloo/</a> for a good implementation. I used it briefly to take advantage of <a href="SlickEdit.html">SlickEdit</a>'s support for the API - made switching from <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> on the previous job to CVS on the current much easier.

      </p>
      <p>
        Ask yourself why you want the integration. Is it because developers are doing check-out-edit-check-in all day long? In our case we found it easier to ditch the integration thanks to CVS' non-exclusive checkouts. Developers checkout all files read-write and do a checkin/update with WinCVS when they come to a natural stopping point. The dev environment behaves as a simple single-user application (== happy developers). The bottom line: while IDE integration is essential for <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>, you may find it unnecessary with CVS. I know this does not fit with every company's culture. Jalindi, mentioned above, works fine if you still prefer IDE integration. -- NateSilva

        The programmer codes it up, tests it to death (or vice versa), and checks it in. Warning: Use a real versioning system like <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> and unlike CVS, or else the multiple checkins will kill you. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>

      <p>
        What is it that makes <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> real and CVS not? One of the anecdotal "old wives tales" about <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> is that it's really bad at merging difference check-ins of the same file. The behavior of CVS merge is said to be much better. Therefore the usual practice in <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> shops is to turn on exclusive check-outs, which prevents one programmer from checking out for write a file when another has it checked out. On the other hand, CVS shops tend to not worry about that and let the merge tool clean things up.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> provides consistent model of the managed content. It is simple and correct by default (because exclusive check-outs are transactional). Unlike CVS <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> doesn't force you to think how the system will accomplish what you need.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue of checkout/merge is mixed up with control and shop culture. <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a> appears to be more common on those shops where central control and strict procedure-following is more valued, whereas CVS appears more in shops where there is a distribution of power and more communication between programmers to solve problems. In my experience, in shops where there is a good team, two programmers rarely work on the same file, and when they do it is on non-overlapping sections, so that CVS can merge them automatically. When there is a case where CVS flags the merge for manual intervention, it's usually solved by the two programmers working out the differences. However I do know of shops where there is a senior programmer or other self-appointed superstar who wants to work on all the code all the time and "fix" whatever the other programmers have done that wasn't to his standards, or who simply feels the need to work on things nominally assigned to other programmers because he feels he can do it faster/better. In this situation it's very common for the prima donna to get crossed up with other programmers when the others are trying to complete their own tasks. In this case, it's probably better to have exclusive lock until the prima donna can be weaned from trying to run everything.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a theory that exclusive lock enforces the good practice of the programmer doing a refresh of his or her local repository before doing a check-in. I suppose if the team needs a tool to enforce that then it's probably a good idea to have it, but most likely there are other issues that the version-control system can't fix. -- <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>

        Source Safe's biggest weaknesses, in my experience:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Difficult to use from outside the local network. Requires a VPN tunnel, or a third party tool like Source Off Site. Even if all your developers are at one site, you'd still like to work from home or on the road.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           VC integration breaks down as soon as you branch. VSS poops in your project and workspace files, as well as leaving those .scc files all over the damn place. After you branch it takes major surgery (or a well written script) to get all of those things pointing back to the correct branch. Every once in a while someone checks in a .dsp into our 4.1 branch that still points sourcesafe back to the 3.4 branch.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It's really honking slow. We have a project for each of our dlls, of which we have about 50, and 3 major branches for each project for 3.4, 4.0, and 4.1 version releases. Just getting all the most recent code for all projects on one branch into an empty directory takes 3-4 times what it would take just to copy them from some directory on the server. Just opening VC and having it connect to the 50 projects in my workspace takes way too long.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These reasons were more than enough for us to switch to CVS. And there are plenty more annoyances and quibbles besides. Plus more big issues when you try more complicated branch and merge maneuvers. -- Keith Wright

            It is definitely slow - an order of magnitude slower than Perforce for instance. I have measured this personally.

        I spent about 3 years working on Sun's NSE, and about 1 year on Sun's Teamware, so I have very strong bias W/R/T source control. I'm using VSS now, and have used Perforce, CVS, and MKS previously. 
      </p>
      <p>
        To confirm what others have stated, VSS is very slow, especially compared with Perforce, and it makes branching and merging much more difficult than it should be. The GUI's are merely adequate, a surprise for an MS product, and the command line is less so, particularly w/r/t documentation. More fundamentally, it shares the same flaw as NSE, <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a>, and Perforce; it has a central repository, which is so 1990's. Aside from introducing a single point of failure, central repository systems don't scale well, and they don't model development in the Internet era which tends to be distributed.

        It is sometimes necessary to look at the history of a file and compare two old versions to each other. When I have a file checked out and I'm working on a particular part of the code, I might notice some other unrelated part that needs cleaning up, refactoring, or which could be made more efficient. But then I remember that later if I look back at the history, then the real purpose of my change will be lost because when I "Diff" two versions, the modifications I made to the unrelated areas will be highlighted along with my "real" change. This discourages good code maintenance. Anybody else have this experience?

        (Note that this issue isn't specific to <a href="SourceSafe.html">SourceSafe</a>.) I just make the unrelated changes in the same changeset, and note them separately in the checkin comments. This only becomes a problem if one change needs to be backed out, and not the other, and that occurrence is too rare to worry about much. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

        That has actually worked to my advantage on more than one occasion. If you have a boss or uncooperative team member who is biased against refactoring on the grounds of "introducing variables" or "why change it if it works", then combined commits are your friends. The only way to justify refactoring with these people is by saying that it was a necessary part of fixing a bug, or that is was the most natural course for fixing a bug. Then if they want to entertain the idea of removing the "extra" changes, just explain that you don't understand how it would be done another way. If they offer to explain another way, suggest that since they already know how it should be done, it would be quicker if they do it themself. -- <a href="MichaelSparks.html">MichaelSparks</a>

        My favorite "quirk" is what happens if you have the misfortune to run out of disk space when VSS wants to do a check in. Not only will it fail, you'll corrupt the file and lose the history. If you're lucky, you'll be able to recover the last version.

        I've just joined a team that uses VSS. I've come from a team where I used SVN and built an automated build and test system that was triggered off commits. I'd like to do the same with VSS so I checked MSDN to see how to do it...
