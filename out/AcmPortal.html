        A website with electronic access to articles published in ACM (<a href="AssociationForComputingMachinery.html">AssociationForComputingMachinery</a>) publications.  Requires a subscription.

        <em>I've been trying for over an hour to create an account, and now it's thrown an error. I'm now unconvinced that I should take advice from them about authoring software ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        They just keep papers. They aren't giving you advice on anything. Even if they were
        who knows who creates the web site.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I can't help but feel that if they've commissioned a web-site then they should verify that it works.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Certainly. But...you <strong>are</strong> aware of who ACM is, hopefully? Association for Computing Machines? The world's oldest and conceivably most prestigious computer science organization? Their banner journal CACM has turned into a pile of crud in recent years, but once upon a time, it was <strong>the</strong> number one place to publish cutting edge CS research.
      </p>
      <p>
        A crumby web site is always a bad idea, but in this case it is highly secondary to the point of the organization. That's a mistake on their part, of course; insisting that people pay $178 per year to be able to access important but <strong>old</strong> research papers on their site just means that they are rapidly fading from significance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Still, one shouldn't think that they are some new organization giving advice on how to do software; that's very far from the truth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, I am aware of who they are. This is just my frustration spilling over at trying to get something from them, paying for the privilege, and then being stuck for over 4 hours failing to get anywhere because of a completely crap web-site.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In that, I completely sympathize...what's more, I've been thinking about paying their extra fee for that privilege, and as a result of your comments, I'm seriously reconsidering. Someone should give them a wake up call before it's too late. Not that they seem to care about such, seeing how little they care about what happened to CACM.

        <em>They've sent me a receipt - it appears they have now charged me for something they are refusing, unable or incompetent to deliver. This goes to my CC company within hours now.</em>

      <p>
        Sigh. Well, please post followups of your experiences as events unwind.

        <em>I complained, they replied saying they were sorry, what did I want and they'd email it. I told them what I wanted, and they emailed it. So I now have the article. It took a week, three emails, and I still can't register on their web-site. Still, I have the article now, I only hope it proves worth the wait.</em>

        I'm curious. What went wrong when trying to get set up with them? I had no problems despite using a somewhat-minority browser (Mozilla) on a somewhat-minority platform (FreeBSD). I can't say I'm <em>impressed</em> by their web interface, but it does at least do its job for me. -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>

        I'm an ACM member and there is a lot of usefull and relevant stuff for members. Worth to try. Also, I have no problem to use the web site. -- <a href="RicardoRivaldo.html">RicardoRivaldo</a>
