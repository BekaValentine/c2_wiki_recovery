        Smells Like Java
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes, there are issues that seem to be strongly tied to a particular <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> and some particular <a href="ApplicationProgrammingInterface.html">ApplicationProgrammingInterface</a>s.

        I don't know what the original poster meant, but the phrase "smells like Java" makes sense to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        A lot of the time, I hear people talking about various techniques or patterns that exist solely because of limitations of the <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> they're using. I hear a lot of talk about "iterator objects" and "factory objects" and "accessor methods". Just the other day my father asked me, "So, do you think it's a good idea to always use factory methods?" In some languages, you'd never ask that question, because the problem that factory methods solve doesn't even exist. It only exists in Java because "new Something()" is always a hard-coded reference to the Something class.

        These kinds of smells appear in every language, but some languages have more of them than others. The <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> happens to be popular right now, and it also happens to be a very restrictive language, so I get this feeling more often with Java than with anything else these days.

        With a little bit of luck, some kind soul is going to put some words to that funny feeling I have about <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, but for now I'm just going to have to put up with the smell instead!

        <em>Describe this feeling? What kinds of Java experiences evoke this feeling?</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        Someobject someobject = (Someobject)someobjects.elementAt(i);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>What part of this </em><a href="SmellsLikeJava.html">SmellsLikeJava</a> to you? Casting? The lack of generics?  Plenty of languages meet either of those criteria.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not <a href="TypeSafe.html">TypeSafe</a>, it's hideously verbose, it's manually mucking about with list indices, and it doesn't even let you use the square-bracket syntax to do it. Yup, <a href="SmellsLikeJava.html">SmellsLikeJava</a> to me. <em>Smells like poorly written Java, to me.</em>

      <p>
        How much <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a> do you need? At least now, Java has generics [<a href="JavaGenerics.html">JavaGenerics</a>]:
      </p>
      <code>
        List<Someobject> someobjects; <br/>
        Someobject someobject = someobjects.get(i);<br/>

      </p>
      <p>
        The syntactic sugar isn't the problem.  I'm fairly certain that any statically-typed language using manifest typing will have similar issues.  However, Java code, professionally written and amateur alike, well-written and horridly written alike, <strong>all</strong> have code in it that follows the pattern <strong>XYZ xyz = (XYZ)xyzSource.acquire()</strong>, for any XYZ you care to mention.  Generics simply do not help with this; notice the generics example above is actually <strong>more</strong> verbose than the first line.
      </p>
      <p>
        What Java needs to not smell like Java is a touch of functional programming, where this kind of code simply <strong>never</strong> occurs, because the language is better equipped to handle construction or acquisition of values.  Another approach towards solving this rampant verbosity is to adapt Java to support some kind of destructor or finalizer mechanism, and use <a href="ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization.html">ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization</a>, so that <strong>some</strong> cases of the above pattern can be shortened: <strong>Timer timer = new Timer();</strong> simply becomes <strong>Timer timer;</strong>.  Or, we can take a page from the book of <a href="SatherLanguage.html">SatherLanguage</a>, and remove some of the manifest typing: <strong>Someobject someobject = (Someobject)someobjects.elementAt(i);</strong> becomes <strong>someobject ::= (Someobject)someobjects.elementAt(i);</strong>.  Note the "::=" operator -- it's a very small amount of syntactic sugar that truly can positively impact a programmer's experience with the language. -- Samuel A. Falvo II

        <em>When something </em><a href="SmellsLikeJava.html">SmellsLikeJava</a>, do we mean that it is a <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>-specific <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>, or simply a <a href="JavaIdiom.html">JavaIdiom</a>? The name implies the former, but I'm having trouble coming up with anything but the latter.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The way I think of it, it's sort of a cross between the two, in a specific kind of ugly way. A lot of the time, we use the word "idiom" or "pattern" to mean "smell that the language doesn't let me fix." I've put some examples on the <a href="LanguageSmell.html">LanguageSmell</a> page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't mean to say that these issues are entirely clear-cut - there are probably performance penalties to worry about, and some cultural things too. (I suspect that some <a href="JavaProgrammer.html">JavaProgrammer</a>s wouldn't want their co-workers to have this much power and flexibility.) But there are a lot of people out there spending time thinking and learning and arguing about these issues, and I wish that more of them realized that they're just working around the limitations of their <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like to get rid of this page altogether, and just use the <a href="LanguageSmell.html">LanguageSmell</a> page. It's fun to pick on <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> :), but this kind of thing really does happen in every language.

        <em>That last part is close to the point I was trying to get at. In my mind it's more useful to think about </em><a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> characteristics and the idioms they might imply. Something doesn't "smell like <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>", but it may "smell like <a href="MultipleInheritance.html">MultipleInheritance</a>", or better still, we have "multiple inheritance idioms". Very rarely will a language name be the most precise way of describing the "smell".<em></em>

        <em>The </em><a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> thought factory to be a useful idiom, and they were working with <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>. Clearly there are languages in which factory is a useful concept, and languages in which it isn't. What distinguishes the former from the latter? It's certainly not the letters j-a-v-a.<em></em>

        Good points. I've tried to refactor the above discussion into less of a <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> kind of thing, because I agree with most of what you've said. -- <a href="AdamSpitz.html">AdamSpitz</a>

        <a href="SmellsLikeJava.html">SmellsLikeJava</a> means that there is a problem which is not attached to any <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a> but the nature of the problem itself makes one think that it was made for <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> (in positive or negative).

        This issue is not specific to Java (or even to programming). For example <a href="FunctionalRequirements.html">FunctionalRequirements</a> for a program might not specify a certain database vendor but can include feature requirements that are only supported by a certain database. The person who made the requirements may have been prohibited from specifying vendors directly.
