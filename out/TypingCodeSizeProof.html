        Typing Code Size Proof
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is just an idea off the top of my head. Is it possible to mathematically prove that a type-heavy language can always express the same algorithm as a type-light or type-free (no type-tag) language with the same or less amount of code? Or vise-versa? If not a mathematical proof, then at least a compelling argument.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is related to the continuing argument over whether heavy typing increases "code bloat" or not.

        To start with, we need to clarify what is meant by type-heavy, type-light, and type-free.  Do you mean <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> vs <a href="DynamicTyping.html">DynamicTyping</a>, <a href="ManifestTyping.html">ManifestTyping</a> vs <a href="ImplicitTyping.html">ImplicitTyping</a> (aka <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a>), <a href="StronglyTyped.html">StronglyTyped</a> vs <a href="WeaklyTyped.html">WeaklyTyped</a>, some specific combination of these, or something else?

        <li>
           <strong>Type-free</strong> -- Languages such as BCPL or <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> lack either static or dynamic types.  Only bytes or natural machine words (generically referred to as <em>cells</em> in Forth, <em>words</em> in BCPL) are available to program with.  The burgeoning thought is that <em>types</em> are semantic constructs to be built by the user, either enforced by the language's module system or encouraged by the language's (or project's, as the case may be) module <em>convention.</em>
