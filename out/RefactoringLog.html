        Refactoring Log
      </h1>
      <p>
        A while back I had an opportunity to make a non-trivial change to some code in our non-XP environment. (I'm still trying to get CVS-type tools universally adopted) I decided to make the change in lots of little refactoring steps.

      <p>
        In the process, I kept a log of all the incremental changes.  It was just a text file, but it described each change.  I ended up making dramatic changes to the data structures [we don't use OO (sigh)], but by keeping the log, and creating <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s along the way, I was able to ensure that all the changes were correct.
      </p>
      <p>
        Has anyone else tried this technique, or is everyone else's environment sufficiently advanced that this is unnecessary?
