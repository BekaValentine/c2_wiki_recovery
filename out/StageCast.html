        Palo Alto, Calif., October 13, 1997 -- Stagecast Software, Inc., a K-12 software company, announced today that it will develop commercial products based on Apple Computer Inc.'s Cocoa technology. (See <a href="CocoaWorld.html">CocoaWorld</a>) Due to recent changes at Apple, the computer company discontinued commercial development of Cocoa. Members of the original Apple development team formed Stagecast to further their dream of creating a product line that takes advantage of the simple graphical programming technology first demonstrated in Cocoa.
