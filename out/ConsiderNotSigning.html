                   Oftentimes the page cannot be meaningfully refactored until more <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> discussion has occurred.  But consider applying <a href="RefactorByCondensingQuestionAnswerPair.html">RefactorByCondensingQuestionAnswerPair</a> when you respond.

               <a href="DoNotWorryAboutTheCredit.html">DoNotWorryAboutTheCredit</a> - it is amazing what one can accomplish if one does not care who gets the credit.

           Of course, if I'm not familiar with technology Foo and well-respected, and well-versed Userbar makes one comment about it, but well-known to be technologicially challenged Userbaz makes a contradictory comment, I'm going to go with Userbar's opinion until I have need to do further research on my own.

      <p>
        Consider also adding your name to the Contributors list instead of adding a signed comment.  This tends to keep the page in <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, and is a useful middle ground between signed threads and <a href="DoNotWorryAboutTheCredit.html">DoNotWorryAboutTheCredit</a>.
