        Russell Paradox

        The paradox associated with <a href="BertrandRussell.html">BertrandRussell</a>'s name shows that the naive idea of identifying a set with a predicate that selects its members from the set of all existing things (the <em>all-set</em>, or <em>universe</em>) leads to inconsistencies. Namely: A given set may or may not contain itself as a member. Now consider the set consisting exactly of those sets that do not contain themselves as a member. Then this set contains itself as a member if and only if it does not contain itself as a member. See <a href="ImpossibleSet.html">ImpossibleSet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        At a more fundamental level: there are "not-quite sets" called ProperClasses that you cannot think of ever being finally specified because their definition permits for a process to enlarge them whenever you think of them as finished entities.

        This could be some more verbose. I'll give it a try.

        The <a href="RussellParadox.html">RussellParadox</a> was given in the beginning of the 20th century by <a href="BertrandRussell.html">BertrandRussell</a>. It shows that careless handling of sets can lead to difficulties, or, actually, to severe paradoxes. Namely, he said the following:
        we all know what sets are. Now, a set may or may not have the property <em>P</em> which is that it contains itself. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Most sets we know of don't contain themselves, obviously. For example, the set {red,blue,green} does not contain itself, and the set of natural numbers does not contain itself. Now, we could imagine a set <em>S</em> which contains only itself, or say, a set <em>T</em> which contains <em>S</em>, 1 and itself. This is something surprising at first, but quite ok.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now, consider all sets which do not contain itself (these are 'most' sets, as we saw).  Let's call the set which contains all these sets <em>A</em>. The question now is: is <em>A</em> contained in <em>A</em>?  Unfortunately, this already leads to problems: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           if <em>A</em> is in <em>A</em>, it certainly contains itself, thus <em>A</em> <em>should</em> not be in <em>A</em>.
        </li>
        <li>
           if <em>A</em> is not in <em>A</em>, it obviously does not contain itself, thus it <em>should</em> be in <em>A</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Only after a second thought, one sees that there is not so much spectacular here. Obviously, we did something which we should not have done; something that sets do not allow. People then started on a more strict level, and namely assumed (the somewhat hidden assumption) that there exists no set which contains all sets; or more explicitly, that the set <em>A</em> does not exist. Actually, what is usually done is just to give specific axioms, the ZermeloAxioms, which say what sets exist - and then one may not take any set for granted, unless it is given by these axioms. One of these axioms is the <a href="AxiomOfChoice.html">AxiomOfChoice</a>, which has lead to many controversies in mathematics.
