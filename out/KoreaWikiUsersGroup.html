        Korea Wiki Users Group
      </h1>
      <p>
        A wiki space about wiki itself, wiki users (especially Koreans), and wiki cultures in Korea. The URL is <a href="http://no-smok.net.">http://no-smok.net.</a>
      </p>

        You have to register as a user if you want to edit any text, but you don't need any authorization, which means the place is totally open and public; all that you have to do is register your ID in <a href="SwikiFarm.html">SwikiFarm</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (It seems you have to sign up before you can view any pages.)
      </p>
      <p>
        All the <a href="KoreaWikiUsers.html">KoreaWikiUsers</a> here are welcome to KWUG. It seems more preferable to talk in Korean in KWUG not in this place because wiki is for sharing information but when it's in Korean, none other than Koreans would be able to share it.
