        Slippery Slope
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of the <a href="FallaciousArgument.html">FallaciousArgument</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Argumentation that A is bad, because A might lead to B, and B to C, and we all know C is very bad.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a logical fallacy because the chain A -> B -> C isn't deterministic, because it might be possible to stop (or branch) somewhere along the line.  A chain that <em>is</em> deterministic wouldn't be a fallacy and wouldn't need to be referred to as a <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a>.

        Plus, it can happen in both directions. Things can potentially slide toward super-conservative political-wise or super-progressive, for example. Thus, both sides could potentially apply if it's permitted.

        Example: <em>"If we legalize playing Unreal Tournament in public, we will have to legalize playing it with real weapons as well, and then people will start to die. Nobody can want this."</em> - The fallacy here is that it would be very well possible to legalize playing Unreal Tournament in public, but not with real weapons.

        <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a>, as a fallacy, comes when you argue against something because of a hypothetical outcome, but it's important to remember that some slopes are slipperier than others, i.e. a high probability outcome may be just as good (i.e. prudent to avoid) as a necessary outcome. E.g. with some people, when you give an inch, very often they will take a mile. Don't dismiss fears of a slippery slope just because it's not valid according to formal logic. Ever increasing (but only in small notches) sales tax, and ever-lengthening "limited terms" are examples of slopes which really can be slippery.

        This type of argumentation is also often used in combination with <a href="BadStatistics.html">BadStatistics</a>. For instance, "smoking pot leads to shooting heroin, because a survey showed that 90% of all heroin addicts had used marijuana earlier". Maybe it does, maybe it doesn't, but the results from the survey do not prove causation, they merely show correlation; another survey shows that "99% of all alcoholics have drunk water at an earlier age." Does drinking water lead to abusing alcohol? Obviously not.

        Then it's the burden of the side using <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a> to demonstrate that one side is more slippery than the other. Otherwise, the default is to assume each side is just as slippery, cancelling out <a href="SlipperySlope.html">SlipperySlope</a>.
