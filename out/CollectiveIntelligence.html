        Collective Intelligence
      </h1>
      <p>
        Collective intelligence is about free-flow and sharing of adaptive and functional information (in a way, by definition, ALL information is adaptive and functional, because if it's not, then it has not reduced anyone's uncertainty about anything, and this is a part of the definition of "information").
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        A problem sometimes arises when people in a collective intelligence effort cannot agree on what constitutes adaptivity and functionality (as opposed to maladaptivity or non-adaptivity and dysfunctionality or non-functionality). 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It would seem that adaptivity and functionality would be pre-requisites for all members of a collective effort. That agreement is not reached indicates a problem with selection of members.</em>
      </p>

        [My brain exhibits collective intelligence.  The whole thing appears to be much smarter than any individual neuron.  The neurons are adaptive in very limited ways.  They don't have to agree on what constitutes adaptivity or functionality.  All one has to do is send a signal down its axon when the product of the dendrite inputs exceeds a certain value.]

        In my brain, there's a lot of disagreement at times. "Get the Junior Mints!" "No, get the Licorice!"
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think we need to talk about "a collective intelligence <em>effort.</em>" Something can exhibit <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>, it can <em>not</em> exhibit <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't cease to be a <a href="CollectiveIntelligence.html">CollectiveIntelligence</a>, once there's a disagreement over values or something like that. Just like in my brain.
