        I work for Google.   Before that, I worked for Oracle, which bought <a href="PeopleSoft.html">PeopleSoft</a>; <a href="RogueWave.html">RogueWave</a>, bought by QuoVadX; Robertson, Stephens, & Company, an investment bank bought by Bank of America the week I joined them; <a href="ParcPlaceDigitalk.html">ParcPlaceDigitalk</a>, which bought (and later became) <a href="ObjectShare.html">ObjectShare</a>; RothWell, Incorporated, which was bought by Perot Systems; Apollo Computer, which was bought by <a href="HewlettPackard.html">HewlettPackard</a>; and Prime Computer, which bought (and later vanished into) ComputerVision.  Terrifying, isn't it?
