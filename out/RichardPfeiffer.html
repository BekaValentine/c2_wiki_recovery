        I've been a software developer for many, many years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now that I've been reading about Extreme Programming, and attended XP Immersion IV, I'm ready to give it a try.

        XP is a method that scorns methodology, a theory that rejects theorizing. I've been looking for something like it for a very long time.

        A few favorite quotes come to mind:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"No reason to get excited," the thief, he kindly spoke, "There are many here among us who feel that life is but a joke. But you and I, we've been through that, and this is not our fate, So let us not talk falsely now, the hour is getting late."</em> -- <a href="BobDylan.html">BobDylan</a>

        <em>Do! (then Reflect)</em> -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

      <p>
        <em>Theory is gray, my friend, but green the golden tree of life.</em> -- Goethe
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I am not bound to swear allegiance to the words of any master; where the storm carries me, I go ashore and make myself at home.</em> -- Horace
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And he to me, as one who comprehends: "Here one must leave behind all hesitation; here every cowardice must meet its death."</em> -- Dante
      </p>

        <em>Thus, the task is not so much to see that which has never been seen, but to think that which has never been thought, about that which everyone sees.</em> -- Schopenhauer
      </p>
      <p>
        Why didn't I think of that? :)
