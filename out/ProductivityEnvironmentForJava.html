        Productivity Environment For Java
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="ProductivityEnvironmentForJava.html">ProductivityEnvironmentForJava</a> (PE:J) from <a href="HywySoftware.html">HywySoftware</a> is an enterprise-ready Productivity Environment for Java that incorporates <a href="UmlSoftware.html">UmlSoftware</a>  Modeling, <a href="RapidApplicationDevelopment.html">RapidApplicationDevelopment</a> (RAD), and <a href="JavaDataObjects.html">JavaDataObjects</a> (JDO) compliant <a href="ObjectPersistence.html">ObjectPersistence</a> to produce mission-critical J2EE and J2SE applications. The <a href="ProductivityEnvironmentForJava.html">ProductivityEnvironmentForJava</a> (PE:J) integrates with major <a href="ApplicationServer.html">ApplicationServer</a>s and supports the JDO specification for object persistence to JDBC complaint <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>(s) (RDBMS). With support for <a href="ForwardEngineeringFromCaseTools.html">ForwardEngineeringFromCaseTools</a>, Forward Engineering from Java Sources and <a href="ReverseEngineering.html">ReverseEngineering</a> from existing Java objects and relational schemas, The <a href="ProductivityEnvironmentForJava.html">ProductivityEnvironmentForJava</a> (PE:J) makes <a href="RoundTripEngineering.html">RoundTripEngineering</a> a reality for new and experienced Java architects (and developers) alike. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ProductivityEnvironmentForJava.html">ProductivityEnvironmentForJava</a> (PE:J) also provides management reporting on the impact of changes and facilitates management of distributed development. It helps in complete <a href="SystemsDevelopmentLifeCycle.html">SystemsDevelopmentLifeCycle</a> and provides platform & vendor independence by making use of current trends and standards. The <a href="ProductivityEnvironmentForJava.html">ProductivityEnvironmentForJava</a> (PE:J) generates all the infrastructure code and frees up the developer to concentrate on business logic. It automatically generates both J2SE and J2EE Applications, and a JUnit test script framework.

      <p>
        In summary, PE:J made iterative, rapid prototyping a reality using code generation, and a bundled Tomcat Servlet engine. The tool was comprehensive with a) forward engineering (UML diagram driven), and b) reverse-engineering (Java src, Java class, SQL Schema, or Rational Rose, or XMI based diagram) environment, and c) round-trip engineering support in that it carefully parsed user Java source during re-generation to leave user-tagged sections alone so it was safe for the user to change the UML model (diagram) without breaking existing application code.
