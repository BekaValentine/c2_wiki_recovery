        Perl Unit Bugs
      </h1>
      <p>
        In the process of writing my own version of <a href="PerlUnit.html">PerlUnit</a>, I've uncovered what appear to be some bugs in the existing Test::Unit code, specifically the behavior of assert_equal. What isn't clear to me is whether they are bugs in the test code, design problems in <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> itself, or just fuzzy thinking on my part.
      </p>
      <p>
        One failure condition is that is_numeric appears to answer "true" when passed an array. I would think this is a bug.
      </p>
      <p>
        Similarly, it appears that the code as written is unable to distinguish a number from a stringified number -- in other words,
      </p>
      <code>
        $a = 3;<br/>
        $b = "3";<br/>
        if ($a == $b) {<br/>
        print "equal";<br/>
        } else <br/>
        print "not equal";<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        will test as equal.
      </p>
      <p>
        In fact, I see no way within perl to distinguish 3 from "3". While I understand that Perl attempts to coerce numbers to strings and vice-versa, it seems to me that a test harness really DOES need to be able to differentiate them. The rub is I see no way to accomplish the feat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Am I missing something basic here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If there's no way to distinguish between the two, then why do you care?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Here is a simple Perl program: 
      </p>
      <code>
        use strict;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        my $a = 3.0;<br/>
        my $b = '3.0';<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        my $stringCompareResult = $a eq $b?'true':'false';<br/>
        my $numberCompareResult = $a == $b?'true':'false';<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        print ("\$stringCompareResult: $stringCompareResult\n");<br/>
        print ("\$numberCompareResult: $numberCompareResult\n");<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This program produces the following output:
      </p>
      <code>
        $stringCompareResult: false<br/>
        $numberCompareResult: true<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        These two values -- 3.0 and '3.0' -- clearly produce different results when compared via eq and ==. This means that I need a way to distinguish the two.
      </p>
      <p>
        How shall the test harness distinguish a number (3.0) from a stringified number ("3.0")?
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely the language or interpreter provides such a mechanism. If not, it is surely broken.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is a "mechanism" -- exploit the difference in the way "~" acts on numbers versus strings. The following sub works (as compared to the version in Test::Unit::Assert.pm):</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        sub is_numeric {<br/>
        my $anArgument = shift;<br/>
        my $answer = ($anArgument & ~ $anArgument) eq "0";<br/>
        return $answer;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em>I believe it is important to shift in $anArgument, so that the routine does not operate on $_[0], because it will numberfy a string.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>One failure condition is that is_numeric appears to answer "true" when passed an array. I would think this is a bug.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, is_numeric expects a scalar.  When you "pass" an array to something expecting a scalar, perl assumes you want the length of the array, which is numeric.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes, apparently the original Test::Unit::Assert.pm code special-cases arrays before calling the code that invokes this.</em>
