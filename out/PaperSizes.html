        <em>Their claim that "Inconsequent use of SI units and </em>'international<em>' paper sizes is today the primary cause for US businessess failing to meet the expectations of the global economy" (if I understand it right; nearly every word in the claim is ambiguous) strains credibility.</em> Yes; it's not as though the United States is not out of step with the rest of the planet on so many other issues (litres/gallons, yards/metres, meters/metres...) that could be expected to have bigger impacts (A primary reason why U.S. -manufactured vehicles are less popular in other countries is because so few mechanics are prepared to keep around an entire set of imperial-unit tools and widgets just for the sake of the occasional U.S. vehicle that does wander in. Can't get the parts, you see - and a 10mm bolt will not fit in a 3/8-inch hole.)

        Why is it that the US and Canada are the only ones holding out on using A4 paper sizes?  <em>Because it could cost gobs of money to change?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If we switched overnight (a la </em><a href="TheEuro.html">TheEuro</a> ?) it wouldn't bother me. Mind you, it's not that big a deal.<em></em>

        What is <em>paper</em>? <em></em><a href="DeadTree.html">DeadTree</a><em></em>

        OTOH, what the h*ll difference does it make? I can open an A4 document in <a href="GhostScript.html">GhostScript</a>, set the paper size to Letter, and print away.

        Or you can use non-paper-size (no paper at all). See <a href="PaperPorting.html">PaperPorting</a> (<em>except in the case where you've got to comply with some outdated legal requirement to maintain all records in some non-volatile format that doesn't require intermediate machinery to read</em>)
