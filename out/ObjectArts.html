        Object Arts Ltd., based in London, was responsible for the development of <a href="DolphinSmalltalk.html">DolphinSmalltalk</a>, a <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> <a href="WinThirtyTwo.html">WinThirtyTwo</a>-based version of <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>. Its two owner-employees were <a href="AndyBower.html">AndyBower</a> and BlairMcGlashan. They founded the company after their previous employer, IntuitiveSystems, began then abandoned development of Dolphin Smalltalk.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of March 2008 Dolphin is still available and supported but major development has ceased. Bower and Mc<strong>'Glashan are busy elsewhere (</strong><a href="AlcheMetrics.html">AlcheMetrics</a> and <a href="MicrosoftResearch.html">MicrosoftResearch</a> respectively), and they have decided that the commercial prospects for Dolphin don't justify the work required to port it to <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a>.
