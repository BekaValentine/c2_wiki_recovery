        Partially dragging over a word or a sequence of adjacent words makes them into a link, immediately after releasing the mousekey: it initially produces a

        I used this technique for my own modified editor. It's very comfortable and even Microsoft has not implemented it in WinWord as a basic operation.

        A generalization for the <em>Drag And Link Option</em>, useful for a <a href="WysiwygWiki.html">WysiwygWiki</a>, is the <a href="DragAndSelectOption.html">DragAndSelectOption</a>.

        Fridemar: this usage model intrudes into the flow of writing. I can type <a href="WordsSmashedTogetherLikeSo.html">WordsSmashedTogetherLikeSo</a> or [[Words Smashed Together Like So]] or *Words Smashed Together Like So* (in various Wiki syntaxes) without interrupting my typing to reach for the mouse. While a facility like you describe is useful (and provided) in <a href="StandardGeneralizedMarkupLanguage.html">StandardGeneralizedMarkupLanguage</a> editors it seems to me that much of what we do on Wiki is either simpler or more complex; the complex stuff needs a Wiki <a href="RefactoringBrowser.html">RefactoringBrowser</a>. I'd be more interested in seeing a feature which suggested links to me as I typed, showing <a href="WikiNames.html">WikiNames</a> containing the current word; the most common reason (apart from spelling) that I come back to edit pages in Wiki is to <em>reorder</em> phrases (not just highlight them) to convert them to links -- <a href="BrianEwins.html">BrianEwins</a>

        Brian:  A db-based <strong>Related Wiki names Suggester</strong> would be indeed a nice 
        tool. My tool e.g. produces from the selected text above (in one stroke) RelatedWikiNamesSuggester (out of: 'related Wiki names suggester') and the suggested page and lets you go on editing there.  -- Fridemar
