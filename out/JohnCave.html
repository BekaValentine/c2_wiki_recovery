        I have always been a fan of speculative fiction since I learned to read and discovered the public library. I love anything that stimulates the imagination, and that includes elegance of form.

        I started programming for the sheer beauty of it. I guess professional programming has a few things in common with prostitution: 1st you do it out of love and curiosity, then you do it for a few friends, finally, you do it for money.
