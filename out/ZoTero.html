        Zotero <a href="http://www.zotero.org/">http://www.zotero.org/</a> is an extension to <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> which makes it easy to build up collections of references to material on the web. It can be used in conjunction with VUE (<a href="VisualUnderstandingEnvironment.html">VisualUnderstandingEnvironment</a>) to build a <a href="MindMap.html">MindMap</a> of the collection as well.

        <li>
           If a PDF file is put into <a href="ZoTero.html">ZoTero</a> it will import the metadata, if there is any stored in Google Scholar. Sometimes there isn't any, and sometimes it finds data on the wrong file.
        </li>
        <li>
           As a default, all the information is stored in a database within the <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> installation. It can be synchronised between computers, and shared with other workers.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ZoTero.html">ZoTero</a> integrates with some web sites which have a bibliographic button which makes it very easy to make a collection of references to books.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ZoTero.html">ZoTero</a> has an addon for <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a> which makes it easy to generate references from the database in <a href="ZoTero.html">ZoTero</a>.
          <ul>
            <li>
               It would be nice to have good integration with <a href="OneNote.html">OneNote</a> as well but it isn't there.

        I had never seen it before, but it is such a good tool I expect to use it all the time while searching for information on the web.

        Donald, have you seen the pages I have started for <a href="ZoTero.html">ZoTero</a> and <a href="VisualUnderstandingEnvironment.html">VisualUnderstandingEnvironment</a> (VUE)? I am very excited at what I can achieve with these tools, at also that VUE has the capability of handling ontology information and using it to build a mindmap from a web page. <a href="ZoTero.html">ZoTero</a> seems to be used by a wide range of different communities. I would be interested to know what you think. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <em>I have noticed it and have downloaded it (VUE), but have not yet taken a look at it. I believe it might prove to be one of the items I would include in what I term above as "TheCloud", which includes all of the artifacts which make information InternetReachable or useful via InstalledPrograms or devices. This mainly includes things such as the InternetBrowser and HtmlPages, SocialDevices such as </em><a href="FaceBook.html">FaceBook</a> and the like, GoogleTools and OnlineSearch engines, etc.<em></em>

        <em>I'll take a look at it this weekend and let you know what I think here, or on your </em><a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>. Thanks for drawing my attention to it. I believe I took notice of it because of some information you included on the page you mentioned above. Again, thanks.<em></em>

        I should acknowledge that I found it in the U.K. magazine LINUX Format, LXF129. I am very interested to find tools which make practical use of the ideas of the <a href="SemanticWeb.html">SemanticWeb</a>. -- John

        <em>Since I use </em><a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> and Windows, and since <a href="ZoTero.html">ZoTero</a> is a plug-in for <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a>, I couldn't do justice in a short weekend to the capabilities the pair of programs present. I will continue looking at them in the next couple of weeks.<em> -- drn</em>
