        A little while ago I felt my organization had a need for some form of asynchronous communication.  One of my coprogrammers and I started writing our CollectiveProgrammersNotebook on an intranet web server, for all to see.  No one around us followed our lead.  Perhaps because they tended towards Microsoft Windows, and couldn't bring themselves to log into the Linux machine and run a text editor such as vim.
      </p>

        Then I stumbled across the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> at C2 and thought that that would be a little more accessible.  I wrote a crufty clone (in sh) and demonstrated it to all.

        I got faint praise and one more convert.  Everybody else continued to edit their own collections of Outlook mailboxes and Word documents.

        Figuring that the bulk of my co-workers, being mostly sales and administrative types, preferred WYSIWYG programs, I added a PUT handler (See <a href="HttpPut.html">HttpPut</a>) to the intranet Apache server.
      </p>
      <p>
        One more convert.

        Most lately, my early partner in this effort has installed <a href="MicrosoftExchangeServer.html">MicrosoftExchangeServer</a>, set up several spiffy mailboxes, and configured everyone's copy of Outlook to talk to it.

        This endeavour is taking off very nicely.  Can't say I'm a little jealous though.

        My sympathy ... I failed totally once to get my staff to participate in a mailing list to CaptureAndShare <a href="LessonsLearned.html">LessonsLearned</a> and experience. Business needs any mechanism (Wiki, newsgroups, mailing lists) that could provide a start of a knowledge base, but I've never seen any attempts that worked in the commercial world. --<a href="JimRussell.html">JimRussell</a>
