        How's this coming?

        A lesson we learned is that Wiki is a great tool for collaborating on a book when you're all in the same room, but we weren't able to make it work for collaborating remotely. We are currently looking at how to make progress, both technologically and by further focusing the book on planning. Turns out we didn't know as much about testing as we thought. --<a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        <strong>[KB:]</strong> Anyway, the second book is called Playing to Win, and we quickly
        realized we had to cut down its scope---we couldn't talk about all the
        practice of XP. So we thought up the worst situation we could be in
        before adopting XP: The project is already late, morale is dropping,
        management and the customers are getting nervous. Then we asked what
        XP book we'd write for someone in that situation.

        Well, the two things you've got to do to get things under control are
        planning and testing.  You've got to be able to measure where you are
        today---that's the testing part. And you've got to be able to present
        alternatives for tomorrow, so the business can start steering
        projects---and that's the Planning Game stuff. So the second book is
        going to cover those two topics in depth.

        (May 1, 2000)
        The book has evolved to become advice to those who want to start on the XP adventure from those who are already on it.  In addition to the meat of the project contributed by <a href="KenAuer.html">KenAuer</a> and <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, along with contributions from the other three named authors, there are snippets of advice/experiences from others who have been there and done that.
