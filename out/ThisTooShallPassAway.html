        <dd>It is said an Eastern monarch once charged his wise men to invent him a sentence to be ever in view, and which should be true and appropriate in all times and situations. They presented him the words: 'And this, too, shall pass away.' How much it expresses! How chastening in the hour of pride! How consoling in the depths of affliction!</dd>

        During the ceremony surrounding the election of a new Pope, bundles of tow are burned in front of the new pontiff with the words "sic transit gloria mundi", <em>so passes the glory of the world</em>.

        During a Roman General's Triumph (his big parade through Rome), a slave stood behind him in his chariot whispering "You too are mortal".

        The Sabi might Wabi after all.
        I own lower life forms for pets. Cats, dogs and turtles

        The Gadget describes everything.  
        What are the properties of the Unknown Object?  
        Let the "them" describe it, like it is in nature, 
        If there is such a thing as nature.

        Prose comes to mind, Dr. Wabi.  
        How can my program seem to Sabi?

        A methodology to describe all The Universes is a matter of disk space, now isn't it?  Plus asking all the questions.  Wabi-ing and or Sabi-ing reflects itself in your eyes.  I can't read the symbols another language uses to describe a concept.  The concept never existed in the first place, as far as we can understand.  That's probably Wabi, there might be a Sabi secretly involved.  Life is a bunch of what's, maybe's and if's. You think?  Wabi this, Sabi that, Wabi Sabi the rest.  And, when you're ready, watch Jerry Springer to be glad you ain't them knowing your Wabi Sabis well.

        Where's my Wabi?
        It's in the not knowing,

        But describing reality is my job,
        As a programmed programmer.
