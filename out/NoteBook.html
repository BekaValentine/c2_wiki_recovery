        Another very <a href="WikiLike.html">WikiLike</a> thing is Notebook -- A searchable, customizable personal notebook and hypertext system. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The current version is Notebook V2.1.3, released on May 25, 2005.

        Visit <a href="http://notebook.wjduquette.com/">http://notebook.wjduquette.com/</a> for information and downloads. This is the most recent incarnation, however: <a href="http://notebook.wjduquette.com/svntrac.cgi/index">http://notebook.wjduquette.com/svntrac.cgi/index</a>

        There may be some useful information still on the old page, <a href="http://www.wjduquette.com/notebook.">http://www.wjduquette.com/notebook.</a>

      <p>
        It is a stand-alone app; no server or browser necessary.

        Written in Tcl/Tk, so it runs on nearly any OS. This allows you to modify its functionality, assuming you know Tcl/Tk. 
        Even if you don't, the Notebook Forum has some code contributed by other users.
      </p>

        One nice feature is that it can automatically create a new, dated page for you by selecting "Edit Today's Entry".
        This could be used for keeping a work log or a journal. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Another excellent feature is that it supports exporting to HTML, either a single page or an entire set ("notebook") of pages.

        <em>On the old notebook wiki there is some User code to make links to other sites and for example .doc or .ppt files working (see </em><a href="http://tcl.projectforum.com/notebook/52).">http://tcl.projectforum.com/notebook/52).</a> It is this feature (user programming extensions) that makes notebook so great.<em> --jroeterd ==> Alas, this link no longer works.</em>

           I have enjoyed using Notebook and it is easy to install and use. I am only worried about my Notebook growing too big and slowing down.

           I have been using it for almost two years and have had no problem. The main file I work with is 2.5 MB.
