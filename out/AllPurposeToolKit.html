        Is there anything else a person needs?  Even better, is there a way to replace any two items with another item that works as well as both? -- <a href="RjLesch.html">RjLesch</a>

        <em>If you get a hefty pair of pliers, you don't need the hammer.</em>

        But wait--the hammer can <em>also</em> be used as a (somewhat primitive) screwdriver.

        <em>Seriously kids, hammering with a hardened steel pliers or a file will shatter it, and even a cheap case-hardened tool can bury a painful chip fragment into your eye or hand. Better add a pair of goggles to the toolkit.</em> --SafeTMan

        If you get an extra large leatherman, you can use it to replace the knife, pliers, and  hammer.

        What is the baking soda and vinegar used for other than impressing little kids?

        <em>Both are great general-purpose cleaners, though not really substitutable for each other.  And, as you pointed out, if you need to generate a chemical reaction to increase pressure or something, you can mix the two. -- </em><a href="RjLesch.html">RjLesch</a><em></em>

        You should not forget a nice big towel. Preferably soaked with some nutrition liquid!
        At least that's what the Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy tells you.		--	TG

        Don't forget to add a DVD boxed set of all <a href="MacGyver.html">MacGyver</a> episodes! :-)

        A way to start a fire.  One interesting way is to put steel wool across a 9V battery (you might want to put a bit of duct tape across the battery terminals to store the kit, unless you want it to ignite itself!)

        Assuming you could find a stick and a rock, you could make a hammer from them + the Duct tape.

        Boy scout shops sell a plastic handle with a pencil width inch-long rod of magnesium sticking out of it, if scrape your knife along it sideways, it makes lovely sparks. Also, a leatherman is an amazingly useful tool.

        You seem to have left out the multimeter, crescent wrench, and condom.
