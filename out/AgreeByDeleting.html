        Agree By Deleting
      </h1>
      <p>
        Sometimes when somebody says something that overlaps what you have already said, you feel moved to delete it in the spirit of eliminating redundancy. You want everything to be said <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>. (The only time I have ever done this is when somebody else writes on my home page.)
      </p>
      <p>
        It may also be possible - although I have never done this - that you see an argument you agree with, but you think the author is making a mistake that you can correct, so you go in and correct it...
      </p>
      <p>
        The other situation, where you see that somebody else said something you wanted to say, so you choose not to say anything, may create a world where <a href="SilenceImpliesConsent.html">SilenceImpliesConsent</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        If, as has been suggested, editors wait until a page discussion has finished, or a general agreement reached, then delete much of the content, replacing it with a concise, fair and balanced summary.
      </p>
      <p>
        Would this not also create a <em>community</em> where everyone is striving to create the most efficient information resource possible?
      </p>
      <p>
        However, this could only be done once a general agreement had been reached and the page had largely finished being an active discussion area.
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, this brings us full circle: An active discussion page follows agree-by-adding (sometimes of the <a href="MeToo.html">MeToo</a> kind), then, once it has somewhat died, wiki citizens can <a href="AgreeByDeleting.html">AgreeByDeleting</a>. Of course, this will probably start up the discussion again. A good thing, perhaps?
