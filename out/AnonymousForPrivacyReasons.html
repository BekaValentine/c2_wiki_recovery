        Anonymous For Privacy Reasons
      </h1>
      <p>
        I don't really feel the need not to tell what I wrote, but I do like some privacy from Google and the like. So, I can't use my real name as signature, and I can't use a name I use in other places. I could make up a new name for every site I have an account or user name, but I already can't keep track of the different user names which are assigned to me and which I can't change (passwords are much easier in this respect, at least you can change them to something you can remember). (They probably invented the 'save password' feature to counter this). Furthermore, <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a> isn't appropriate because I don't wanna be anonymous to distance myself from my post.

        <a href="AnonymousOnPurpose.html">AnonymousOnPurpose</a> already has these semantics.  If you want to be anonymous, <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a>: don't sign your contributions at all.  It is polite to use <em>markup</em> or [brackets] to distinguish your text from previous contributions.
