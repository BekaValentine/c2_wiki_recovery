        Watch the directors cut, if you can! (Otherwise, please at least ignore the end).
        <em>That's all I've ever seen, you can't find the original release anymore.</em>
        <strong>The original release (the 1982 US theatrical release, that is) is now (2008) included among the 4- and 5-disk editions of the Final Cut DVD set.</strong>

               Actually there were at least 2 versions in the original theatrical release. The American release was about 30 minutes shorter than the European release. Read the FAQ.

        However, I added my opinion... :-)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My theory: Rick isn't but Gaff is. Gaff is a replicant made with Deckard's memories - hence the unicorn. Gaff acts pretty demented and ends up crippled - I guess Rick's memories didn't serve him well. I'm guessing he didn't suppress them adequately with alcohol.</em>
