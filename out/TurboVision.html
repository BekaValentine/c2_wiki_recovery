      <p>
        <a href="TurboVision.html">TurboVision</a> is a DOS-based GUI library that Borland developed for Turbo Pascal and Turbo C++.  It can also be used in DOS boxes in Windows. The object and event models are complete enough to be practical, but simpler than the Microsoft designs -- thus easier and quicker to program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using newer Pascal compilers such as VirtualPascal (<a href="http://www.vpascal.com/news.php),">http://www.vpascal.com/news.php),</a> <a href="TurboVision.html">TurboVision</a> code can be compiled in 32-bit mode for 32-bit Windows or OS/2 environments.
      </p>
      <p>
        The C++ version was released into public domain and is now being developed and distributed under GNU GeneralPublicLicense at <a href="http://tvision.sourceforge.net/">http://tvision.sourceforge.net/</a> .
