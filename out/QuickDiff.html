        Quick Diff
      </h1>
      <p>
        A useful tool to see what changes have been made to a Wiki page.
      </p>
      <p>
        To see just the most recent change to a wiki page, click on the date of that change at the bottom of the page or click on the time since the change as reported in <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>. A neat and useful feature but hardly an intuitive user interface, or one that is documented in an obvious place. Both link to <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>. Note that the latest change is not necessarily the latest significant change.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note that if the same user makes two or more changes in succession; the </em><a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> algorithm considers those a single change. However, if a different user/IP makes a change, then the baseline for <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> resets.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To use manually, edit the page URL replacing the word "wiki" with the word "quickDiff". This shows who made the change, and what exactly was changed. Much prettier than using "copy=".

      <p>
        For people not used to following every change on C2, <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> can be a hidden gem because of the converse of <a href="OneMansMeatIsAnotherMansPoison.html">OneMansMeatIsAnotherMansPoison</a>. I find valuable information in what people throw away, enough times that I sometimes become overly hesitant in adding changes of my own (often I do a <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> first before changes).

        I just held back on updating <a href="LeadershipIdeals.html">LeadershipIdeals</a> because <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> gives me a name of a <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a> who had interests and expertise in the subject area. Even though the change was made 5 years ago, my additional would have spoilt the presentation of the amount of work done then. So I chose to update the LeadShip page instead as its <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> was already spoilt on an earlier occasion (by me).
      </p>
      <p>
        It annoys me when <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> gets spoilt by the Spammers, e.g. BobbyWoolf page.

        Aug05 update. Just bumped into a page that supports my love for <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>. It has not changed for seven years and last change has significance. -- dl <em>[Bowdlerized to preserve the edit in question]</em>

        <strong></strong>HadTheLastWord - seeking a better way to make use of <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> even without versioning<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Earlier I said</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Earle you probably know I am a big fan of <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> as I have said so at C2 more than once. And I am also aware that you do not like me going about adding <last change ...> to highlight previous "important" change on a page. Is there another way to have something similar to "versioning / highlighting"? I made this as I just changed <a href="SignedWithaPurpose.html">SignedWithaPurpose</a>, I think it was important that CC remark be removed from that page, but by doing so I removed equally important observation (in <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>) in response to a contribution from another wiki participant. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           a previous example is the differences with CC in regards to <a href="SoaIsNightSky.html">SoaIsNightSky</a>. I wanted to update CC homepage (he started it and obviously wanted some response) but then the <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> showed he had what looks like unfinished dialogue with another person. I did not want to be rude and therefore talk to CC on my homepage, which later (eventually) led to OnDavidLiuDiscussion.
        </li>
        <li>
           for now I would still do my "awkward" last change type thing, only much less frequently. Sometimes I resort to not editing a page, or find another page to edit.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        I think the solution here is to keep content in a consistent state that can be interpreted without the use of <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>. It only takes a spelling correction to "remove" an important change from the diff display; therefore the tool is too fragile to be relied upon. Does it really matter enough when some contributions were made that they need to be <a href="TimeStamp.html">TimeStamp</a>ed? I don't think so; they can be brought to prominence by careful application of <a href="RefactoringWikiPages.html">RefactoringWikiPages</a>, <a href="WikiTag.html">WikiTag</a>ging or similar (although bear in mind <a href="GentlyReduceWikiBadges.html">GentlyReduceWikiBadges</a>). The profusion of what can only be described as <em>metadata</em> only makes pages more visually noisy and harder to read for those who are not interested in it. -- EarleMartin

        If <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> is just showing you the Wiki page, your URL is malformed. It should look like this: <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/quickDiff?QuickDiff.">http://c2.com/cgi/quickDiff?QuickDiff.</a>

        Some manglings of Wiki URLs let you browse just fine, but fail for <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> (and maybe other scripts). <em>[Has it been fixed?]</em> No - e.g., if you replace '/wiki' by '/wiki/wiki'.

        When a visitor saves a changed page, wiki keeps a copy of the old page. Clicking on <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a> for a page runs the diff utility with the previous version and the current version, does some trivial post-processing of the output, and returns it to the browser.
      </p>
      <p>
        BTW, the previous version's version number is not necessarily one less than the current version's version number.

        <a href="ViatassoWiki.html">ViatassoWiki</a> has a neat spin on <a href="QuickDiff.html">QuickDiff</a>: instead of showing only the diff listing, the diff is integrated into the page view by appearing as highlighted text within the page. Users can also choose in Preferences to highlight all changes made by a user or only the latest changes by anyone. If you choose the first alternative, when X writes all their changes will be highlighted as long as they are consecutive, as long as X will keep on making edits.
