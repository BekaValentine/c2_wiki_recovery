        It seems to me that and it'd be useful to have a page to make requests for help with a software design. Then there's a centralized place for such questions (<a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>), and we give helpful <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s a page they can check for problems they can help out with (seeing as how <a href="AnswerMe.html">AnswerMe</a> apparently didn't catch on). The page could be RefactoredMercilessly by moving off individual requests as the discussion got large. Or perhaps by just having links here like "KarlKnechtel'sProblemWithDesignOfX".

        The title is inspired by the common saying on USENET comp.* groups "we will not do your homework for you" (or words to that effect) - seems to me like that's entirely <strong>not</strong> the attitude promoted here. -- <a href="KarlKnechtel.html">KarlKnechtel</a>

        On a heavier note, here's an old April 1st post on <a href="news:comp.lang.c++">news:comp.lang.c++</a> , the home of online homework:

        <em>The UK National Lottery consists of a random drawing of 6 unique numbers from a possible 49. Using the results from the twice-weekly draws over the last year, Neural Networks, Artificial Intelligence, Chaos Theory and a large mug of tea (Earl Grey, no sugar, twist of lemon), write a program in Z80 assembler to predict the next result.</em> --Paul S. Ganney

        As a matter of fact (working on my own), I have just finished such a
        project, but I only collected enough data for one bet.

      <p>
        Now I must weigh the needs of your hamster against me winning the
        lottery instead of you. Gee, that's a toughie. I'l get back to you on it.
