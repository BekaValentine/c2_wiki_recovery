      <p>
        I am a member of various forums, IRC channels and other such things. I always go under some variant of Kemp or KempOfTheHive (my backup, almost-guaranteed-not-to-be-taken name). My main haunts these days are the mega-tokyo.com forums (using the name Kemp, on the OS dev section mainly) and wiki (TheKemp), and #XTV on EFNet (Kemp-). I'm also a member of various networking sites (hi5, ringo, you know the kind).

      <p>
        I am a computing student at university, soon to start my PhD (or maybe already started depending if I update this, I have too many profiles on too many sites these days).
