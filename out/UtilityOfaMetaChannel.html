      <p>
        So much of the Wiki is becoming meta or <a href="TripleMeta.html">TripleMeta</a> discussion about what should or shouldn't go on a page, or conversations between anonymous contributors with no <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>. Perhaps the community might want to consider some form of MetaChannel for all this.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Standard for this wiki</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Create a new page with the same name with the word "Discussion" appended (<a href="MoveThreadModeToDiscussionPage.html">MoveThreadModeToDiscussionPage</a>, <a href="DiscussionPage.html">DiscussionPage</a>, <a href="DiscussionVsConsensus.html">DiscussionVsConsensus</a>)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Pro:</em> Real easy to do
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Pro:</em> It is what people have been doing for years
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Pro:</em> No coding change
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Pro:</em> Discussion is useful content that should be left around until it is refactored into a document
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> Adds more pages (<em>easily fixed by more editing')</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> They never seem to go away after their purpose has been served. (<em>easily fixed by more editing')</em>
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> Usually are rather fuzzy on separation between "thready-discussion" and "meta-discussion" 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> Discussion is impossible while the discussion page is being vandalised

      </ul>

        There are some <a href="QuickTopic.html">QuickTopic</a> boards relating to this wiki which are effectively meta-channels, and now a <a href="WikiChannel.html">WikiChannel</a> mailing list.

           The Talk namespace, a la <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> Needs change to codebase
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> Rather large social shift
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Pro:</em> It's rather hard to get blamed for moving meta talk out of a page when there's an accepted namespace for it
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Pro:</em> Makes separation of <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> and <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> very easy
              <ul>
                <li>
                   <em>Caveat:</em> Differentiation between true meta thread, and loosely organized non-meta threadiness is a must. Otherwise, we'll have lots of (well, even more) parallel discussion.

           Double-bar meta separator (<a href="SummariesOnTopDiscussionBelow.html">SummariesOnTopDiscussionBelow</a>, <a href="SeparateThreadsFromContent.html">SeparateThreadsFromContent</a>)
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> Double bars didn't work too well for separating summary from discussion in Wiki's history
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> Probably hard for the entire community to follow
            </li>

               <em>Pro:</em> No coding change

            <li>
               <em>Pro:</em> Real easy to do
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>Con:</em> The existing examples of these rarely seem to be temporary (<em>easily fixed by more editing')</em>

        (^- this is a double bar on purpose. It got deleted by a well-intentioned editor. Supporting evidence that the DoubleBar idea never really caught on.)

        I'm going to begin using this <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a> when I see which could benefit from this. This is mainly to get a better sense of just how bad/not bad the problem is. Let it live for a while, if no-one like the tag, it'll be easy enough to do a reverse search later.

        Sunir, if you're lurking, I'm especially interested in your thoughts on this, even a cf to an appropriate <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a> page would give me some good reading.

        The fourth option above notes that xDiscussion pages never seem to go away as a con. Is that really a bad thing? It is often quite instructive to follow the course of discussion that led to a <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> page.

        <em>It would depend on whether the discussion is an unrefined form of the document or whether the discussion is just meta on how to structure the document. I can't see much use for the latter.</em>
