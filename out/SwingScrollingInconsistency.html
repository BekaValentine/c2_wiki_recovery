        Swing Scrolling Inconsistency
      </h1>
      <p>
        I was recently at a customer site and had a client come to me with a Swing problem that at first seemed simpler than it was.  
      </p>
      <p>
        They wanted a way to detect when the scrollbar on a particular JTable (e.g. the scrollbar on the JScrollPane wrapping it) reached the bottom.  I thought -- this shouldn't be hard -- just catch the scroll event and then interrogate the table to see if you are at the end.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a few minutes I had whipped up a demo using JLists that showed how it would work.  I showed it to one of my customers who then pointed out that the problem was that they were using TABLES not LISTS.  Undaunted, I looked at the JTable class and found some startling inconsistencies.
      </p>
      <p>
        I knew that JTable and JList didn't share a common superclass lower than JComponent, but what I wasn't prepared for is how different the two protocols are.  Naively, I was expecting something like the way that <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> Smalltalk worked -- where a list and a table were almost the same thing in many ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        In particular, my problem was this -- JList implements two methods that made my task trivial for lists:
      </p>
      <p>
        getLastVisibleIndex() -- returns the index of the last visible element
      </p>
      <p>
        locationToIndex(Point) -- converts a point to an index
      </p>
      <p>
        Strangely enough, JTable has <em>nothing</em> like these.  What I was able to do, however, was to steal the code from these two methods and directly apply it to my own class to write a method that took the visible rectangle and applied the same math the two above methods use to calculate the last visible row index.
      </p>
      <p>
        It worked, but I still don't like it.  So my question is, am I wacky to expect these two classes to work in the same way?  Shouldn't there be some common interface that they both implement?  Or am I just too poisoned by my long exposure to a self-consistent, reasonable UI environment like <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> :)
