        Rees On Object Oriented Features
      </h1>
      <p>
        Jonathan Rees writes a list of the different features which are commonly associated with the term "object oriented" and points out that definitions of OO include varying subsets of the list. See <a href="http://paulgraham.com/reesoo.html">http://paulgraham.com/reesoo.html</a> for the full text.
      </p>
      <p>
        The features are (quoting Rees here):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Encapsulation - the ability to syntactically hide the implementation of a type.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Protection - the inability of the client of a type to detect its implementation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ad hoc polymorphism - functions and data structures with parameters that can take on values of many different types.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Parametric polymorphism - functions and data structures that parameterize over arbitrary values.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Everything is an object - all values are objects.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           All you can do is send a message = Actors model - there is no direct manipulation of objects, only communication with (or invocation of) them.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Specification inheritance = subtyping - there are distinct types known to the language with the property that a value of one type is as good as a value of another for the purpose of type correctness.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Implementation inheritance/reuse - having written one pile of code, a similar pile (e.g. a superset) can be generated in a controlled manner, i.e. the code doesn't have to be copied and edited. A limited and peculiar kind of abstraction.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Sum-of-product-of-function pattern - objects are (in effect) restricted to be functions that take as first argument a distinguished method key argument that is drawn from a finite set of simple names. 
        </li>
      </ul>
