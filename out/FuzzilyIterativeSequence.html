        Fuzzily Iterative Sequence

        First there was the <a href="WaterfallModel.html">WaterfallModel</a>.

        Then practitioners with an ounce of intellectual integrity noticed, it is not quite that simple. In fact these stages seem to overlap a bit, and the tails seem rather long and at times the amount of stage 1 (analysis) process that is happening actually goes back up again even when we are in coding....

        Hmm perhaps the description is wrong.

        <a href="FuzzilyIterativeSequence.html">FuzzilyIterativeSequence</a> is where 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           more of stage N happens near the start than stage N+1
        </li>
        <li>
           At all times all stages seem to be happening at least a little.
        </li>
        <li>
           There seems to be loopiness in that the amount of Stage N being done can go back up again.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The process is neither interative nor sequential nor rigidly bounded. The all sort of seem to cooperate and assist one another.
