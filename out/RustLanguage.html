        Rust Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Rust is a low level programming language started by Graydon Hoare in 2006, and developed by Mozilla since 2009. Rust is designed for <a href="SystemProgramming.html">SystemProgramming</a> or ApplicationProgramming, to replace <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> for browser development. The motivation is to develop low-level, fast software with strong type safety. Rust therefore incorporates <a href="ConstCorrectness.html">ConstCorrectness</a> (everything is immutable by default) and innovative pointer types which allow the compiler to do detailed <a href="StaticCodeAnalysis.html">StaticCodeAnalysis</a> to track memory. Therefore typical code needs neither garbage collection nor manual memory management.
