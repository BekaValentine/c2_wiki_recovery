        <dd>The defect tracking system should have sort and filter features that allow maintaining an automated TODO list. Each item in the bug tracking system is assigned to one person and has a priority associated with it. The list of bugs becomes a personal, automatically updated and prioritized, TODO list.</dd>

        <dd>As a developer, filter on "Assigned To" to see your responsibilities. Sort by Priority to track the top problems.</dd>

           This, together with the patent reputedly granted for "wheel" - which I gather was a successful attempt to demonstrate a weakness in a new Australian approach, convinces me that the Patent System really is 'broken'. -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>.

           It covers the automated generation of a TODO list which is generated by the placement of TODO in the sourcecode of an application. It seems to apply to <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a> and does not seem to extend to Grocery lists and other such lists which might be the result of algorithms meant to capture general tasks.

        It seems that tracking and reporting of task completion will be among the improvements made in VisualStudio2005.
