        I have it and like it. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a> <em>... because ...</em> mmm... inexpensive, flexible and easy to use, free updates, independent vendor, supposed security :)

        <em>Do you need to protect your information from your little sister, or from determined cryptanalysts?  If it's the latter, then don't trust this or any other "custom-designed encryption technology."  There are very good well-known, well-scrutinized, efficient encryption algorithms in the public domain, e.g. AES and </em><a href="TwoFish.html">TwoFish</a>.<em></em>

        No, it's the former.  If someone breaks into my house and steals the computer I don't want them to have an easy cruise on the harddrive.  It is more important (for this purpose) that the cryptography  be easy to use than cryptographically secure.  I suspect this is actually true in the vast majority of everyday cryptography applications where you're trying to protect against bandits rather than foreign governments.
