        There is a current page called <a href="ThinkTwoJobsAhead.html">ThinkTwoJobsAhead</a>. I think it is not sufficient to do so, because in today's economic climate it is not <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>. Except for a small percentage of people who can change jobs and keep the same career going, the majority may have to have multiple careers in a <a href="LifeTime.html">LifeTime</a>. The alternative is <a href="JustGetAnyJob.html">JustGetAnyJob</a>.

        In IT, the profession is so broad that often even a job change will require retooling. The depressed market meant the employer can pick another person who already has the skills and experience, be it technical or application, for a vacancy.

        If anyone should think going back to school will help to sort things out, it is useful to check <a href="HowMuchDoYouLearnInSchool.html">HowMuchDoYouLearnInSchool</a> beforehand. Schooling does nothing to enhance <a href="PeopleSkills.html">PeopleSkills</a>, and is therefore not on the <a href="CriticalItSurvivalSkills.html">CriticalItSurvivalSkills</a>.

        <a href="WhySympathizeWithTheUnemployed.html">WhySympathizeWithTheUnemployed</a> became a hot topic starting Feb2004. I do not know whether the creation of <a href="CategoryEmployment.html">CategoryEmployment</a> helped to renew interest in the page which has been around. It does demonstrate the community at large want to explore various options and solutions to this issue.
