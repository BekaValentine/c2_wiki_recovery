        I'd like to set up a <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a> served under <a href="WebStar.html">WebStar</a> on a <a href="PowerMac.html">PowerMac</a>. Anybody done such a crazy thing?
      </p>

        It seems as if <a href="WikiWorks.html">WikiWorks</a> or some derivative would be useful, as long as I can get <a href="VisualWorks.html">VisualWorks</a> installed and happy (not a <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> person, frankly). Advice would be greatly appreciated.
      </p>

        Oddly enough, it seems as if much of the basic <a href="WikiFunctionality.html">WikiFunctionality</a> can be handled through <a href="AppleScript.html">AppleScript</a>. Anybody know of anything along those lines? --<a href="BillTozier.html">BillTozier</a>

        <strong>update a year later:</strong> <a href="ComSwiki.html">ComSwiki</a> is an excellent package, and highly recommended for anybody looking to host wiki-like things on a Mac running <a href="MacOs.html">MacOs</a> 9.x. The worst aspect is the editing rules are easier to remember than the ones here....

        Both <a href="UseMod.html">UseMod</a> Wiki and <a href="PhpWiki.html">PhpWiki</a> work fine on <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> with a minimum of fuss. I've had worse luck with <a href="MoinMoin.html">MoinMoin</a> and <a href="TwikiClone.html">TwikiClone</a>, but that's probably more due to the nut behind the wheel than poor documentation or OS problems.
