        Significant Recent Changes
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="SignificantRecentChanges.html">SignificantRecentChanges</a> is the correct spelling for <a href="SignficantRecentChanges.html">SignficantRecentChanges</a> (created in October 2000).
      </p>
      <p>
        Would anyone else be interested in helping to maintain and/or read a "significant" <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page?
      </p>
      <p>
        For the past few weeks (before October 9, 2000) <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> has had a large number of edits that I would call <a href="MinorEdit.html">MinorEdit</a>s.  Some of these edits are simply adding categories, removing signatures, and small editorial changes.  Other edits add only a small amount of content to a page, like adding one more link to a large list.  These edits are <strong>good</strong>, and totally within the spirit of wiki, but some people would rather not read them.
      </p>
      <p>
        For extreme <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s like myself, this isn't a big problem--it's easy to click through the <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> diff.  Not everyone has as much time for wiki as I do, and if one looks at a 3-day list of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> it can be quite daunting to find the good content.  The <a href="ChangeSummary.html">ChangeSummary</a> experiment of October 1999 was one attempt to find a solution, but writing the summaries took too much effort.  (The summary features in <a href="UseModWiki.html">UseModWiki</a> are another experiment to see if contributed summaries are useful.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Rather than attempting to change (tame?) <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, I'm proposing a new "significant" or "substantial" <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> page.  The new page would be manually edited, and would contain a list of pages with "significant" changes.  Any editor is free to define what "significant" means to them, but I would recommend a lower bound of two new sentences.  (Or a question for the community.)  People who feel a change is particularly significant could write a short summary after the change.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, my list of "significant" changes for today (October 9, 10:00am Eastern) might look like:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>October 9, 2000</strong> [as of 10:00 am EST]

        Does this idea sound useful?  Unlike the failed <a href="ChangeSummary.html">ChangeSummary</a>, it would only list a subset of pages, and summaries would be optional and minimal.  --<a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a> (who <em>obviously</em> hasn't learned his wiki lessons...)

        Well, maybe a next step would be code (not necessarily running at c2.com) that can be used to "moderate" Wiki pages along the lines of <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a>.  Moderators could choose from:
        -2 Just too tacky
        -1 About movies, not programming
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Whatever
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        +1 Provides a chuckle...
        +2 About a movie I like so all programmers would like it too!
        +3 Explains why Wiki should/should not stay as it is right now
        +4 Mentions XP
        +5 <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> explains XP

        How about this simple change:  Make "I'm just doing minor edit. Please divert the usual logging to <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a> instead." the *default*.?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That would be great! I often forget to check "minor edits" when I quickly want to change a typo or some such, I don't think I would forget it the other way round.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Surely that just means the <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s will instead need to keep a closer eye on <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a>? What you <em>might</em> want is a radio button with default unset. This would solve the problem in an annoying way.

        How about this simple change: put the diff size (e.g. -5+15 lines, or something from "diffstat") on the changes list. It doesn't tell of edit quality, or even significance, but a junkie may learn some useful correlations which save them some time.

        <em>I don't know. It is in </em><a href="OrphanNonHomePages.html">OrphanNonHomePages</a> and must have been created in October 2000, so no-one seems to have noticed or they could have corrected it over the years. The fact that it is misspelt will also mean it would not show up in a search for significant. When I created the correct spelling <a href="SignificantRecentChanges.html">SignificantRecentChanges</a> I found that it already had some links, including on <a href="RelevantChangesDiscussion.html">RelevantChangesDiscussion</a>, last edited in 2006, where the misspelling is actually mentioned. As a result of my changes it is no longer an orphan page and the whole subject is better integrated. It could be migrated to the page with the correct spelling.<em> -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
