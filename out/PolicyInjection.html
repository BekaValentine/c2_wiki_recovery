        Policy Injection
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a><strong> in general is when user-defined policies and priorities are injected into a decision-making process that broadly affects the behavior of a system. </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        To have <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a> for a given system, the prerequisites are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           user-defined policies and priorities for system-behavior. <strong>note:</strong> this is NOT the same as user-defined <em>behaviors</em>. Rather, it applies to the <strong>rules of selection</strong> for behaviors (which may or may not be user-defined).
        </li>
        <li>
           self-describing behaviors. If behaviors are opaque, it's impossible to make an informed decision between them! 
        </li>
        <li>
           an automated decision-making process modified by these policies and priorities
        </li>
        <li>
           that has profound impact on the behavior of the system
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This page is about a more specific instance of <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a>: in particular <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a> above <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> exists (in some minimal capacity) when a user can, via a general abstraction on the required capability or behavior, indirectly set behavior properties of another system. I.e. one has a generic need for a font package, and so one fills it, not necessarily knowing exactly who needs it. (It's one indirection from <a href="SetterInjection.html">SetterInjection</a>, where one directly modifies the behavior properties of another system). <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a> is one step further removed from <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a>: you now have a <em>pool</em> of font packages (i.e. a pool of factories that will return fonts on demand), and the user is now defining a policy to choose one font-package over another.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Context:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You have a decent <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> framework. You provide <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> features via <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> with <a href="PluginArchitecture.html">PluginArchitecture</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's suppose, for the sake of discussion, that your <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> framework takes URI-styled 'constructors' and returns 'objects'. Example constructors:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "font:helvetica;10pt" - returns an object that can be queried for glyph information, or perhaps replies with SVG descriptions of strings
        </li>
        <li>
           "random:fast" - returns a fast random number generator; can be queried to return a large string of random bits.
        </li>
        <li>
           "random:secure" - returns a secure random number generator (unpredictable enough for PKI and key generation)
        </li>
        <li>
           "joystick:*discovery" - returns an object that can be asked about joysticks attached to the machine
        </li>
        <li>
           "mapreader:wvs->xyz" - returns an object that translates world-vector shoreline maps into an XYZ format. 
        </li>
        <li>
           "google_earth:map_fetcher" - returns an object that attaches to data from Google's servers.
        </li>
        <li>
           "javascript:function(args) { return args[1] + 10; }" - returns an object that, when called with some arguments, evaluates <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and returns the result. (You get a <a href="ScriptingLanguageAgnosticSystem.html">ScriptingLanguageAgnosticSystem</a> if this sort of feature is provided by plugin.)
        </li>
        <li>
           "clock:GMT-7.00,accuracy:minute,precision:nanosecond,drift:nanosecond/hour" - requests an clock object with middling accuracy (correctness) and high-precision (reported digits), and some stringent anti-drift characteristics. 
        </li>
        <li>
           "cache:http" - returns a singleton object representing the system's HTTP cache.
        </li>
        <li>
           "<a href="http:get(www.example.com/cgi/wiki?P''''''olicyInjection);user_cookie=Dude">http:get(www.example.com/cgi/wiki?P''''''olicyInjection);user_cookie=Dude</a>" - returns an object that, upon request, obtains the specified page. The implementation of this object may, in turn, request "cache:http" for information.
        </li>
        <li>
           "dns:" - returns a relatively generic Domain Name Server that can translate domain names into IP addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
           "dns:reject_local" - returns a Domain Name Server with some security protections about resolving LAN and machine-local addresses.
        </li>
        <li>
           "compiler:C++" - returns an object that can take C++ code and return executable objects.
        </li>
        <li>
           "printer:file_printer(/var/tmp/myapp/mylog.log)" - returns an object that will addend/create to a log file
        </li>
        <li>
           "guishell:root" - returns an object that will accept commands to create windows and such.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Presented with such a string, the <a href="DependencyInjection.html">DependencyInjection</a> framework (in this case) will automatically break off the first word (up to the colon), filter the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> objects based on that first word, then present the remainder of the string to each of them until one returns an object. The code for doing so looks something like this:

      <p>
        The above '<a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a>' does some useful work - it filters by service class, which allows conventions to be developed on a per-service-class basis and potentially allows faster dispatch and construction. A points to note are that it injects itself into the factories it provides, which means that those factories will call back into one another to build objects. The 'semantics' of each constructor string are somewhat informal... or determined by convention rather than edict. I.e. it is likely expected that "cache:http" returns the same object every time, even if this rule isn't enforced or documented.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are a number of problems with the above code. Performance could be improved a <strong>great</strong> deal (e.g. presort <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> objects by service class). <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a> could readily be extended for the common classes we know about ahead of time (i.e. have <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a><Type> and <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a><<a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>> only as a fallback). The 'synchronous call' nature is also severely problematic... it would be <strong>very</strong> easy to make the above enter an infinite constructor loop, especially when building two services that are interdependent, so making the system more asynchronous would be wise. And speaking of asynchrony, the above isn't MT-safe, and making it MT-safe without risking deadlock means going a lot more asynchronous than one might initially think. The fact that the constructor is limited to strings is also problematic! That approach causes string URIs to end up containing the 'constructor' details for other objects... and every <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> becomes an "object configuration" language rather than having one common ObjectConfiguration language. (But that's a problem for later.) Also, the semantics could be further solidified (i.e. provide <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> support for singleton constructors, make the 'service_class()' much less ad-hoc) and security could be improved (distinguish factories based on security level, for example, so that high-security factories can't access lower-security factories, and a security-level may also be placed on areas of the application-configuration).
      </p>
      <p>
        But I'm writing this page to focus on just one problem: the order in which <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> is selected is poorly defined. That is, we may have <strong>many</strong> factories for a given service class. If we have many "http" fetchers, which should we select? Which one is the highest performance? What about selecting a guishell... which windowing system should it use? (KDE? Gnome? <a href="WxWidgets.html">WxWidgets</a>? Motif?). If we have many windowing systems, which one is selected? 
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <a href="PluginArchitecture.html">PluginArchitecture</a>, where the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> objects are added to the <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> based on a pile of DLLs in some directory (or code in a CPAN database, etc.), this problem is greatly exacerbated. I.e. adding a new DLL adds new <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> objects which might suddenly take over construction of certain objects by an accident of ordering. (The application is also able to add application-specific factories.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        We want options and plugin-extensibility. No reason to give those up. I.e. we want the ability to support two different plugins that provide font-factories, because this allows us to fall back on one plugin when the other fails. But we also want a predictable system (determinism). More than that, we want the ability to <em>influence</em> the system. Pursuing the example, if we have two different font-factories, it would be rather nice if we no the order in which fonts are selected isn't going to change randomly, and it would be even better if we could choose beauty vs. performance.
      </p>
      <p>
        An extension of this problem is that of "discovery" - i.e. informing the user which options are available, so that they may make informed policy decisions and have knowledge as to the impact of those decisions. In a <a href="PluginArchitecture.html">PluginArchitecture</a>, especially, discovery is important. But this only becomes an issue <em>after</em> static user-influence is supported. I'll get back to it after fixing the first issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Naive Solution #1:</strong> My first attempt was a simple priority system. Each factory is given a priority number (an integer) and the order the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> objects are tried within a service_class() is determined by this number, and additionally by other properties (like plugin DLL name) such that the final decision is deterministic.
      </p>
      <code>
        interface <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> {<br/>
        void   set_constructor(<a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a>); // <a href="SetterInjection.html">SetterInjection</a><br/>
        String service_class(); // for filtering<br/>
        <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> construct(String arg); // the construction command<br/>
        <strong>int    priority(); // for determinism</strong><br/>
        }<br/>
        // plus sorting in <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This does provide determinism (which is a significant improvement). Additionally, and less obviously, it allows some useful idioms. For example, a plugin can provide several factory objects for the same service_class(), but at different priorities. This would allow a plugin to be 'good' at some things, and provide 'fallbacks' for other things (in a simple two-tiered factory injection). Plugins would then be able to take over for the weaknesses of other plugins, resulting in a best-of-breed design. That's pretty damn good for a single integer!
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, this is pretty good before the whole "best-of-breed" design idiom gets involved. If we wished to select between Cairo and <a href="WxWidgets.html">WxWidgets</a>, we could normally just move that decision into the application-configuration. But this Naive Solution is a victim of its own success! The ability to support best-of-breed designs results in users (well.. me, in this case) wanting to use ever-more-generic service_class() names. As an example, I'd end up using "guishell:root" instead of "cairo:root", or I'd end up using "joystick:discovery" instead of "direct_input8:joystick_discovery". This allows more programs to overlap, improves my chances for at least one plugin to provide the service, and makes the configurations much less specific to an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a> or machine. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Naive Solution #2:</strong> To overcome the issues of <strong>Naive Solution #1</strong>, I started by going even further in the same direction. (Hey! It was working!) I broke plugins into more tiers, and put more 'selectors' into the request. As a demonstrated example, the above clock specification was <em>"clock:GMT-7.00,accuracy:minute,precision:nanosecond,drift:nanosecond/hour"</em>. That gets pretty busy, doesn't it? 
      </p>
      <p>
        It turns out that way lies a <a href="TuringTarpit.html">TuringTarpit</a>. Selectors add ever more parsing issues, which means it takes longer for factories to reject messages, and takes longer to write those factories. There are more factories, too. One needed to be really careful to properly 'reject' based on certain features in the higher-priority factories. It's painful - like slow torture by a papercuts painful. That is not what I want.
      </p>
      <p>
        Further, it still doesn't allow broad-spectrum decisions - one cannot, for example, make a decision to favor performance over quality for font packages for the application-as-a-whole. Instead, one would need to go around and edit the right-hand-side of that colon for every font reference in the whole application-configuration! <strong>Effectively, as the left-hand-side gets more abstract, the right-hand-side gets more specific.</strong> It was <a href="WaterbedTheory.html">WaterbedTheory</a> at work ^_^.
      </p>
      <p>
        Additionally, all these interweaving priorities have a hidden performance hit that occurs elsewhere. As a consideration not named above, it is rather useful of plugins can be usefully <strong>cataloged</strong> in advance, with metadata about them (which factories they provide in terms of service-class and priority) pushed into a database so that we may later load a <strong>minimum number of plugins</strong> to get the work done. This catalog would need updated if the DLLs are updated, of course, but that's likely to be a relatively rare event.  I.e. in the context design, one could at least filter plugins by the service classes they supported, and so one could load only plugins that support particular service classes. Then one would simply try each until it succeeds. With the specific service classes, this would usually mean loading only one plugin to get a given service. But, in solutions 1 and 2, once the whole 'best-of-breed with fallbacks' design gets involved and the broader service classes, it may require loading two or three or many plugins to select the appropriate <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Better Solution #1:</strong> Okay. So simply having more tiers on one number doesn't seem to work. Let's try more numbers! I.e. for a factory, I might have (performance:10, quality:20). Essentially, <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> was changed to look like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        interface <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> {<br/>
        void   set_constructor(<a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a>); // <a href="SetterInjection.html">SetterInjection</a><br/>
        String service_class(); // for filtering<br/>
        <a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a> construct(String arg); // the construction command<br/>
        <strong>Map<String,Int> features(); // factory selector</strong><br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Of course, maps of integers lack a <a href="TotalOrder.html">TotalOrder</a>. For determinism, which we still want, we <em>need</em> a total order for these factories. This is where the user-influence comes in. <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> is modified to contain an arbitrary predicate operator for choosing factory priority, and users provide their own priorities... i.e. this predicate-operator becomes a form of <strong></strong><a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a><strong> because user priorities are being injected into a decision-making process for automatic system configuration.</strong>

      <p>
        I haven't yet implemented this new design (came up with it very recently), but it promises advantages over the prior solutions. For example:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           For the clock, unless one truly needs specific precision and drift properties, one could simply weigh precision highly. 
        </li>
        <li>
           For fonts, one could put weights (potentially negative) on properties like "True Type" in addition to selecting performance over quality. This would increase the chance of selecting the right font package the first try.

           For a 'guishell', one could simply tilt the whole application to using, say, a wxWidgets plugin by making the brand into a quality and giving it a really high weight.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But, still, this solution seems to be missing something... not quite certain what, though, so I'll list my thoughts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Stronger filtering would still be useful. In particular, having an option other than weighting a feature super-high. This is especially true on a per-object basis. Perhaps I could allow object constructors a list of strings for filtering. I considered object per-feature weights; it can be done (not much different than text search) but it means loading more plugins since one is more likely to need a different plugin after reordering the factories per-object. So I'll go with boolean 'AND' filtering and see how far that gets me. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The Factory itself is unaware of the user-policy. <em>It is, however, still influenced by the user-policies.</em> In particular, if an object created by a factory constructs another object, that new object was also selected accordingly. I'm certain a factory <em>could</em> be made more aware of exact context. <em>Should</em> it be? I'm not sure... more information isn't always a good thing, because it implies more processing is needed to take advantage of it. There is a decent chance this would lead to more monolithic factories that tried to make use of this information, which would in turn lead to reinventing the original <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a> within the factory. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           'Weights' seem to be a pretty ephemeral thing. We need a measuring stick. I'm thinking a decent measuring stick would be to pick one feature - say the 'priority' field from the prior versions - and give it a default weight... say 100. This weight could be changed by the app developer, of course, but it would be the one and only default. Using it, people could weigh something at 120 to be more, 80 to be less, 20 or 10 for small weights, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If requirements are supported, service-class no longer needs to serve as a 'filter'. This better <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> makes it easier to decide how to sort by service: by the role in the object configuration, by the parameters and behavior expected, etc. Filtering can be done using features. So, as an example, I could be rid of "javascript:" and perhaps replace it with "evaluation:" and use 'javascript=1' in the weights. I no longer need to use 'javascript' just to filter out the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> objects that don't know how to produce javascript'. As another example, I could change out "google_earth:..." for something more like "mapdb:google_earth" without hitting every single plugin that knows how to load a particular map database... I'd need to put something like 'supports_google_earth' in requirements, though, which seems a bit redundant.
        </li>
      </ul>

        I'll give this a try and see what I bump into.

        <strong>Discovery:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I posit that primitive 'Discovery' for the application is the ability to present a user with a catalog of available factories and their weightings, along with descriptive strings (names, text, license, manual), service class (and a description for that, too), and so on. This lets the user know exactly what is available, exactly which weightings and requirements can be used to select features, relative quality of implementation issues (priority, quality, performance, stability vs. experimental, security properties), and so on. In a distributed system, this simply extends to describing which features remote systems are willing to produce.
      </p>
      <p>
        Once discovery is performed, appropriate weights can be selected, and a valid application-configuration may be written (i.e. one that is unlikely to fail). With a good app-developer, discovery could make construction of applications very easy... especially if arbitrary objects are added to the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> 'constructor' so the app-configuration can build objects and hook them together.
      </p>
      <p>
        Beyond primitive discovery is knowing where to get more features, and having prebuilt templates for tying features together.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll give this hypothesis a try at some point in the future.

        This page raises an interesting issue, one that I've encountered in a somewhat glancing fashion in implementing <a href="DateAndDarwensTypeSystem.html">DateAndDarwensTypeSystem</a> for the <a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a>.  I see a possible correspondence between the points noted above and the use of specialisation-by-constraint to automatically instantiate (or, more accurately, to use Date & Darwen's parlance, <em>select</em> a value for) the most specific subtype of a given supertype.  In <a href="DateAndDarwensTypeSystem.html">DateAndDarwensTypeSystem</a>, subtypes in a type hierarchy employing specialisation-by-constraint are not selected explicitly.  Only the supertype may be selected explicitly, and the subtypes' specialisation constraints are evaluated to determine the value's appropriate subtype at run-time, i.e., the most specific subtype which defines a specialisation constraint that evaluates to true.
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, whilst not specified by Date & Darwen's model (and, in some respects, possibly in violation of it as currently written), it seems reasonable that the weights discussed above could be incorporated into specialisation constraints in a type system that supports them.

        There is certainly a shared relationship to <a href="AbstractConstructor.html">AbstractConstructor</a>. I think, however, in your case it would be sufficient to support deterministic selection rather than give users control over the heuristics used to select in cases of ambiguity. <a href="PolicyInjection.html">PolicyInjection</a> is much more useful at the higher layers of the system, where projects are developed piece-wise by so many developers that the right hand knows not what the left is doing.
