        A <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> is a model that describes a model -- the class variables of a particular kind of model or a way of discovering a model. -- <a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a>s are generic models -- the class structure of models or properties of models.  I also think of <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a>s as a way of discovering models in a particular application arena.  Some examples that I use are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          W5H The Journalist's <a href="MetaModel.html">MetaModel</a> -- Who? What? When? Why? Where? How? these questions summarize the entities that can be known about an event, properly adjusted for the domain.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {SPA/E(M)}+ -- A System Model -- Sensation Perception Action IN AN Environment CONDITIONED BY Mobility -- the curly braces denote a Set_Of and the + indicates one or more.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {S/R}+ -- Stimulus Response Nets -- these are event triggered entities
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          {IPO/D}+ -- Input -- Process -- Output (Data) -- this is the basic entity in a Jackson Decomposition as I interpreted when I was starting out.  Combined into networks all systems can be modeled.  It is related to and can be recast into {SPA/E(M)} form.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Force Field Analysis -- a technique for discussing barriers to progress composed of tabulating supporting and resisting forces and then looking at both enhancement and removal strategies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          SOM -- Subject Object Modeling -- based on ELM EntityLifeModeling -- A Subject is an entity with a long time-like thread that controls things (Objects) and is Persistent in the environment.  Objects tend to obey a S/R structure -- you call them, they run and die after doing a service.  Systems are composed of intercommunicating sets of Subjects and Objects.
        </li>
      </ul>
