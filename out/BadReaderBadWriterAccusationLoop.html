        Bad Reader Bad Writer Accusation Loop
      </h1>
      <p>
        A common theme in some arguments-gone-sour where one side accuses the other of not researching or reading up on a given topic sufficiently and the other side accuses the other of not attempting to isolate or simplify the argument enough to present it in a shorter or more relevant fashion than a long or academically-worded paper. Essentially both sides are accusing the other of being lazy, but in different kinds of task.
