        Anti Vote
      </h1>
      <p>
        How about an <a href="AntiVote.html">AntiVote</a> system?  <a href="RobertHeinlein.html">RobertHeinlein</a> once said that there is very rarely anyone worth voting for, but there are always people worth voting against.  I can imagine a system where you have one vote for a candidate and one vote against.  The winner is the person with the most votes left when they have had the 'against' vote subtracted from the 'for' vote.  This should result in the least unacceptable candidate winning. -- <a href="DaveKirby.html">DaveKirby</a>

        Alternatively, give people one vote which they can use either for or against.

        Problem is, there's always too many people to vote against. You should have just <a href="AntiVote.html">AntiVote</a>s and unlimited numbers of them. But that turns it into <a href="AcceptanceVoting.html">AcceptanceVoting</a>.
