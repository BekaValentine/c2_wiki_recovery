        Corn Field Effect
      </h1>
      <p>
        I had this cute story quietly bouncing  around the back of my head until I heard that <a href="WardAndKent.html">WardAndKent</a> work better together than separately, and noticed similar effects with other experts on projects.  Actually there are two stories I heard, both paraphrased below because I don't have perfect memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        "I saw an ad for 'the tallest corn in the world', so I ordered it.  Sure enough, that stalk of corn grew so tall I couldn't believe it.  But I was horribly disappointed when the ear of corn grew.  It was tiny :-(        Later, I learned that corn gives its biggest yields when grown in bunches (no doubt there is a reason).  It seems corn needs other corn nearby to grow properly.  My solitary stalk of corn was tall, but did not give much yield."

        Other story was about horses, I don't have the numbers correct, I am sure, please forgive that, but they are close...

        "In hauling contests, one horse can haul up to 1200 pounds, but two together can haul 3000 pounds."

        I think of the <a href="CornFieldEffect.html">CornFieldEffect</a> when I see designers feeding off each other's ideas to create a better design.  I use this as a basis for the <a href="DayCare.html">DayCare</a> pattern. --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Wouldn't Synergy describe this?  Or does Synergy have a connotation of differing qualities?  --<a href="PeteHardie.html">PeteHardie</a>

        <em>Synergy does describe this, but only by those who can stand to hear the word.  To many techies, the word 'synergy' sounds like content-free corporate fast talk.  --</em><a href="RobMandeville.html">RobMandeville</a><em></em>
