        Case Delusions
      </h1>
      <p>
        A real conversation I had recently. (OK, so it's slightly paraphrased...)
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>x</strong> - Our system has nearly 300 business classes. We design using <a href="RationalRose.html">RationalRose</a>, and use it also to generate IDL for distribution
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>y</strong> - So you have three hundred individual IDL source files? Aren't these difficult to manage?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>x</strong> - well yes...
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>y</strong> - And you're distributing your system at the level of the smallest objects in your business model? Doesn't that kill the network?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>x</strong> - We did notice that.
      </p>
      <p>
        A good example of Case Delusion no.1 - the belief that by using a tool you're guaranteed to be doing the right thing. Luckily for this project they had the time to take a more considered approach to their distribution models - but they're still driving everything from a mammoth model in Rose...
      </p>
      <p>
        Case Delusion no.2 - If we design using a method and a case tool, the quality of the code will automatically be improved. I've seen people on projects spend three or four weeks getting the pictures right for a design which half a day of coding could have convinced them would not work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Too often these tools are used to <em>avoid</em> having to think about the hard problems in an architecture or design. Give a case tool to an inexperienced designer and what you have ... is an inexperienced designer with a case tool and a delusion of quality.

        (I spent four years of my working life writing case tools - poacher turned gamekeeper here.)

        Case tools don't seem to offer substantial support for <em>reasoning</em> about concurrent/distributed systems. Surely this is one area where a tool founded on sound computer science principles could provide substantial value beyond just
        diagramming and code gen. How could we modify/extend case tools to detect a large set of common architectural faults? (e.g. Does this  deadlock?, Is there higher coupling across distributed interfaces than local ones?.)
