        Virtual Device
      </h1>
      <p>
        A device, or piece of hardware, that isn't really hardware at all. Just look at <a href="http://www.bigfoot.com/~selfaware">http://www.bigfoot.com/~selfaware</a> (<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a>, 2007082). Looks a little TV-like, and is used to browse the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>. Yet it is totally constructed out of <a href="HyperTextMarkupLanguage.html">HyperTextMarkupLanguage</a>, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, and images.

        <dd>The <a href="QuickTime.html">QuickTime</a> 4.0 Player sports a consumer interface, designed so that it "looks like" a physical consumer product. Apologists for this design philosophy maintain that users will more readily be able to transfer their knowledge of real-world objects to the software. Unfortunately, the apologists fail to recognize that there are two likely consequences of this approach: (1) the user is unable to transfer his or her existing knowledge of computer interaction, and (2) the software becomes needlessly subject to the limitations of the physical device.</dd>

        <em>Countercounterpoint.</em> Media Players (without upsidedown floating heads as skins). They look like VCRs/cassette players and the interface is pretty good.
