        One Finger Keyboard
      </h1>
      <p>
        A key setup that is optimized for use with one finger.  Very popular on pen-based computers, as they can be used by tapping the pen.

        Scribbling is more natural; but typing is still faster, for at least some people.

        I use Fitaly for my <a href="HandspringVisor.html">HandspringVisor</a>, and it's definitely faster. There are tradeoffs, though, largely because you're typing on little tiny cells. With <a href="PalmGraffiti.html">PalmGraffiti</a>, you can look elsewhere while you're writing (so you can take notes in a meeting or class without looking down all the time), and your error rate is less. But I decided the speed was worth it. Also, it has handy popup screens for numbers, punctuation, accented characters, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'll cast a vote for Fitaly also, although I only use it when writing large amounts of text.  I do wish I could customize the layouts--I use punctuation characters often when programming, and Fitaly puts them in awkward places.  I usually stick with Graffiti for small amounts of input.  --</em><a href="KrisJohnson.html">KrisJohnson</a><em></em>

        I have done a simple analysis to compare Fitaly and Atomik, with the following results:
      </p>
      <code>
        C:\>cat BookOfMatthew.txt | groovy fitaly.groovy<br/>
        Fitaly distance: 192163.3 units<br/>
        Atomik distance: 198783.9 units<br/>
        Fitaly is better by 3.4%<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        C:\>cat GrimmsFairyTales.txt | groovy fitaly.groovy<br/>
        Fitaly distance: 814045.4 units<br/>
        Atomik distance: 834466.2 units<br/>
        Fitaly is better by 2.5%<br/>
