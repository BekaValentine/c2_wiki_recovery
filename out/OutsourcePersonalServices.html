        Outsource Personal Services
      </h1>
      <p>
        If it's smart business for companies to outsource time consuming functions that they're not especially good at, does it make sense for individuals to do the same?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm a single programmer. It occurs to me that it might be a smart move for me to use a laundry service, hire a housekeeper, and have groceries delivered. With the time I save, I could grow my business, i.e., take on a small consulting project each month; thus, I'd spend more time doing challenging work, less time doing tedious chores, and expand my resum√© all at the same time.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you think, sirs and madammes? Is this lunacy, or is it smart time management?

        It is if you make a net profit. I'll leave it to you to define profit.

        You win by getting more work time. You lose breaks and opportunity for flirting with the grocery dealer. I personally can think well when doing the washing. I would never let someone else do it. I like the breaks <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a> gives me.

      </p>
      <p>
        Doing laundry only takes a few minutes -- throw it in the washer, go back to the computer, when it's done throw it in the dryer, go back to the computer. The time-consuming part is hanging it all up in the closet once it's dry.

        Or just don't clean house. ;-)

        If you telecommute, you don't even need clothes at all. Well, maybe a bathrobe or boxers or pajamas, if you like having the blinds open. -- <a href="JoeWeaver.html">JoeWeaver</a>
