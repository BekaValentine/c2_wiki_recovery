        Is this the WikiWikiTalkPage?

      <p>
        <a href="DabbleDb.html">DabbleDb</a> inspired me to review <a href="SeasideFramework.html">SeasideFramework</a> once again. Like anyone who gives it more than a glance, I like it a lot - it would be a <a href="RubyOnRails.html">RubyOnRails</a> killer if it could scale.
      </p>
      <p>
        But continuations are too memory-expensive to put in the server.
      </p>
      <p>
        Which got me to thinking, why not put 'em in the client? You'd need a good language there though ... and if <a href="SeasideFramework.html">SeasideFramework</a> is your aim how about <a href="AjaxSmalltalk.html">AjaxSmalltalk</a>? Smalltalk interpreters are tiny, right? Writing one in <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, you've already got most of the basics taken care of. There's already JsLisp and JsScheme as examples of adaptation idioms. <a href="SpoonSmalltalk.html">SpoonSmalltalk</a> is probably overkill. Then:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You'd want to bridge <a href="AjaxSmalltalk.html">AjaxSmalltalk</a> to the <a href="DocumentObjectModel.html">DocumentObjectModel</a> and the JS APIs so you could leverage all the <a href="ScriptAculous.html">ScriptAculous</a> goodness modern <a href="AjaxWebApplications.html">AjaxWebApplications</a> do.
        </li>
        <li>
           Smalltalk objects would only run in the client-side interpreter.
        </li>
        <li>
           You'd <a href="XmlHttpRequest.html">XmlHttpRequest</a> to pull clean ST objects from your server and push dirty ones back again.
        </li>
        <li>
           This would provide the ability to move the <a href="SeasideFramework.html">SeasideFramework</a> semantics directly into the client, where they can scale however you like.
        </li>
        <li>
           Never write another line of anything but Smalltalk so long as you live.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I have resisted learning Smalltalk properly for years. But <a href="RubyLanguage.html">RubyLanguage</a> has seduced me and this seems to be a readily realizable step toward a real <a href="SymphonicArchitecture.html">SymphonicArchitecture</a>. My first question is, why hasn't some bright young smalltalker already done this? Given the enablement of <a href="WebThreePointZero.html">WebThreePointZero</a>, I guess my next question is, who wants to help out? -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        If the control is in the client, do you even *need* continuations.  You're back to the good old rich client, stateless server  architecture that we all learned during the early 90s.

        <em>Yes. For </em>ControlFlow, <a href="WorkFlow.html">WorkFlow</a> and for versioning maybe. Some of these can be done with good old <a href="LexicalClosure.html">LexicalClosure</a>s. But as for the impact of <a href="WpFe.html">WpFe</a>, yes, EverythingOldIsNewAgain.<em></em>

        Ah, Pete, always behind the times, will you never catch up? <a href="VistaSmalltalk.html">VistaSmalltalk</a> is already doing all this ... but without the javascript. See, the way of the future (this week ...) is <a href="XaMl.html">XaMl</a>. You're not going to have a really rich user experience with that old JS/CSS crap, are you?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now Pete, simmer down, I'm doing my best to catch up. It's not easy living in the </em><a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> you know ...<em></em>
