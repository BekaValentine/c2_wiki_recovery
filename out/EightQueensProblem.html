        Eight Queens Problem
      </h1>
      <p>
        Place eight queens on a chess board so that no queen attacks any other. (Yes, it can be done.)
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was just a kid, they were using this problem in elementary programming courses to teach the use of recursion and backtracking.

        A problem that can be solved by <a href="BruteForce.html">BruteForce</a> (and doesn't suffer from <a href="CombinatorialExplosion.html">CombinatorialExplosion</a>).

        There are 12 unique solutions: <a href="http://www.ic-net.or.jp/home/takaken/e/queen/.">http://www.ic-net.or.jp/home/takaken/e/queen/.</a>  This includes rotations only; if you include reflections, there are 6.  On a physical chessboard, it matters whether the pieces are above or below the board, so a reflection is still "unique".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In a group theoretic sense, there's no such difference between rotational symmetries and reflectional symmetries; the pieces do not end up "below". This can profitably be regarded as a rotation through a fourth spatial dimension.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't follow that, Doug. Any reflection is its own inverse. That isn't true for all rotations, only those (effectively) through 180 degrees.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You're right. But why does that matter here?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you rotate through an extra dimension, you have to be sure that the end result is still in the same 3-D section.  That necessitates making a 180-degree turn, which is self-inverse.  All reflections can be considered this way.  More notably, you can notice that the board is essentially 2-D, and that placing queens above or below the board only matters for the convenience of the players.
      </p>
      <p>
        [A reflection is equivalent to a rotation through 180 degrees about a line through the middle of the board. That doesn't require a fourth dimension.]  It requires one more dimension than that of the object in question.  If you include the orientation of the pieces above and below the board, you need a fourth dimension, but not otherwise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Right, right. But at any rate, it seems to me that this all adds up to what went before: that both rotations and reflections should be considered.
