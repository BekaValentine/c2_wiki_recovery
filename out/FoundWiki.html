        Found Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        How is it you <a href="FoundWiki.html">FoundWiki</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        Some people were exploring patterns. This, the first ever wiki, is devoted to software patterns.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           From a link in the "<a href="ThinkingInPatterns.html">ThinkingInPatterns</a>" online book.
        </li>
        <li>
           Learned of patterns from <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a> in a conference in Chicago; he recommended this Wiki - <em>back when it was the </em><a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a>, rather than the XpWiki.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           I came looking for the <a href="PortlandPatternRepository.html">PortlandPatternRepository</a> long ago. Did Wiki predate the GOF book? <em>See </em><a href="DesignPatternsBook.html">DesignPatternsBook</a> and <a href="WikiHistory.html">WikiHistory</a><em>.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Found it while looking for J2EE design patterns. I left for half a year, then returned looking for XP information. A year later (May, 2001) I'm still here!
        </li>
        <li>
           <strong>A UML Pattern Language</strong> [ISBN: 1-57870-118-X] by Paul Evitts. Just trying to stay on top of the game, or at least somewhere above the trough of the wave.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Others came here to learn about extreme programming. This site was the first, and may still be the largest site devoted to xp, though the xp list archive is probably bigger.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The <a href="XpMailingList.html">XpMailingList</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html">http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/integrateoften.html</a> - <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           A friend told me about XP and I did a search on Extreme Programming. I found <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>. Best search I can recall doing.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some people found another wiki first and followed a link to here. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           While reading about the <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, I encountered a page called ThinkiWiki. It had a link to <a href="PythonIdioms.html">PythonIdioms</a>, a part of the Wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           I first found wiki when I discovered <a href="SeattleWireless.html">SeattleWireless</a>' homepage, after initial confusion and shock a bit of thinking and some reading on <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a> finished the process.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ZwiKi.html">ZwiKi</a> (<a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> Wiki).
        </li>
        <li>
           I found Wiki through zWiki, and I came here to find out whet a Wiki is. I'm still not really sure, but that seems to be part of the fun!

           <a href="TwikiClone.html">TwikiClone</a> installation at work
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

        <li>

        The patterns movement, and Wiki, were started by Smalltalk programmers.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I found Wiki several years ago (don't remember exactly how) while keeping up with what was going on in the Smalltalk community.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And a few more defy classification.

      <ul>
        <li>
           From a multi-step path of:

           A <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> story mentioned the GameOfNomic. I started to play <a href="WikiNomic.html">WikiNomic</a>, and I liked the WikiPart about it.

           I was 'wandering lonely as a cloud, when all at once -------- '.
        </li>
        <li>
           Now I come to think about it, I was looking for something completely different. Can't remember if I actually found it.
        </li>
        <li>
           I was looking for information on J2EE application servers, techniques... The rest is history...
