        The Last Cee Program Written
      </h1>
      <p>
        I get the strange sense that programmers who yearn to write the next great <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a> all have the same wicked little thoughts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I understand how the computer works better than all the rest - my <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> code is king and can never be <a href="SegFault.html">SegFault</a>ed.
        </li>
        <li>
           My combination of language elements and style will beat all others - I have the lock on language design.
        </li>
        <li>
           My <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> that runs My <a href="ByteCode.html">ByteCode</a> will be the fastest - mine will be the last C program ever written!
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I know these thoughts all too well! I have thunken them! Evil pride, I banish thee!! :P
      </p>
      <p>
        So, will there only be a handful of native code programmers someday that hold the keys to the car? Will the JVMs, and the SQLs, and the CLRs, and the <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a>s of the world be the only <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> programs left?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Contrary to popular belief, C is not the only language with native-code compilers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is, when will CLRs and <a href="MicroKernel.html">MicroKernel</a>s be written in anything else?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>They already have been. Just as one example: the Scheme48 runtime environment is written in a dialect of Scheme. On non-standard hardware (Lisp machines), Lisp was used down to the metal; I think this should be possible on standard hardware too, although I don't have an example.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's rephrase - when will such be written and become ubiquitous the way C/C++ (<a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a>) has, both commercially and as <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>? Symbolics machines in museums don't really count except as nostalgia or if you believe <a href="LispMachinesAreComingBack.html">LispMachinesAreComingBack</a>.
