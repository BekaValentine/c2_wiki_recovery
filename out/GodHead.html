        Confessions of a God Head
      </p>
      <p>
        Hey, I resemble that remark. Any tips on changing my attitude?  Keep in mind that I am dealing with code from "professionals" with years more experience than I have, yet they have left my team with Do Loops that span two include files, encapsulated in an If statement that spans three files.  So I must say I feel justified in feeling like I know more.  I've had to deal with spaghetti written by my supposed "betters".

        Josh,  I found that I also fell into the <a href="GodHead.html">GodHead</a> category.  Too many of my developers are wet behind the ears, and write obtuse code that makes my skin crawl. -- Paul V.

        Is your goal to change your <em>attitude</em> or your <em>behavior</em>?
      </p>

        <strong>Proposed solution: realize how much you too can improve.</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Seek out and read excellent code (e.g. <a href="TexTheProgram.html">TexTheProgram</a>). Compare your code to it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Improve your skills. Can you write a <em>(fill in the blank: LR parser, distributed system, thread library, filesystem, etc.)</em>?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Explore other programming paradigms. Are you as comfortable doing functional programming as procedural programming? Object-oriented programming? Logic programming?
        </li>
      </ul>

        Thanks for pointing out a major flaw in my personality at work. Godheads are unwelcome in any project, so we are sometimes kept around due to lack of options, but when the time comes we are harshly dealt with. From now on, no more godheading for me.
