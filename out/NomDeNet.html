        Nom De Net
      </h1>
      <p>
        Pseudo-french for an online name/nickname; in particular one which an individual is heavily invested in (as opposed to a throwaway name).  Examples of such on this Wiki include <a href="TaralDragon.html">TaralDragon</a>, <a href="RiVer.html">RiVer</a>, <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>, <a href="TorneWuff.html">TorneWuff</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some rules of thumb:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Is the name, although unconventional, a legal name or alias which you use online (in addition to using in other forums)?  If yes, it's a <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Is the name one which is your primary online name, which you use everywhere online in preference to your "legal" name (except for those websites that disallow/discourage the use of anything but a legal name)?  If yes, it's probably a <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Is it a name you only use in certain forums (one name in IRC, another name on <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>, another name in <a href="YahooGroups.html">YahooGroups</a>)?  If yes, probably not a <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Is it a name you use to <em>hide</em> your real identity (including for legitimate reasons, such as being able to comment on your employer without getting sacked)?  If yes, probably not a <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Is it a "throwaway" name, used to affect or create a different persona, a <a href="SockPuppet.html">SockPuppet</a>, etc?  Is it a name that you haven't used for very long, and are likely to replace in the near future?  If yes to either, not a <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Are you trying to impersonate someone else?  Definitely not a <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a> means you're well known by it; a handle might be something that you dreamed up five minutes ago. Lothie's my <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a>, for instance; I've been using it on the 'Net for 20 years now. Just my take. -- <a href="LothieBelle.html">LothieBelle</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>OK, so to use myself as an example, I use katascope (including katascope.com) as my "public face" to the net (including other sites like winamp, </em><a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a>, flipcode, etc), because a handle seems more appropriate on those sites. Here I use my real name as a professional courtesy because handles seem inappropriate here. . . . but that's a personal choice - mainly because i would feel silly telling programmers call me katascope. So perhaps the real question is when are real names vs handles appropriate (not on this wiki, but in general)? -- <a href="LayneThomas.html">LayneThomas</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As you've said, it depends on the context.  My usual <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a> is engineer_scotty, which I don't use here as a courtesy to this site--not because this site seems "professional" but because the site explicitly asks for <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>.  Pretty much everywhere else I go online, I use it.  I don't use engineer_scotty at all in professional/legal circles; nor do I use it with family and friends; it's strictly a <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a>.  However, I have considered using engineer_scotty here as well (<a href="EngineerScotty.html">EngineerScotty</a> in <a href="WikiCase.html">WikiCase</a>) but so far haven't done so.  It's not a big deal to me either way; however it seems curious that the rule is "use <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>; but if you choose not to and can get away with it for a while, it's probably OK; lots of folks here use a <a href="NomDeNet.html">NomDeNet</a> and that's OK."  -- <a href="ScottJohnson.html">ScottJohnson</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>I think the point there is that we try to keep this wiki at a professional level (which helps keep the dolts & jerks "away"), and the standard professional approach is to give one's real name. Since this isn't a business or professional organization, people aren't required to, but I imagine the ones that give their real name are afforded more respect as  that's just human nature. I always personally felt that using a handle was like a masquerade ball (in forums), someone putting on airs (I am </em>LordDarkAvengerHackerWizard!), a desire for pseudoanonymity(StopSmirkingChimp04), but usually not their nickname. . . I'm not necessarily right, but that was my perception, and likely a common perception. -- <a href="LayneThomas.html">LayneThomas</a><em></em>
