      <p>
        Old, grumpy, generally p*ssed off by the state of the UK and large chunks of the world in general.
      </p>
      <p>
        Staggered by the greed which drives us to burn ever greater quantities of carbon for energy instead of putting PV (photovoltaic) units on every home because although it would be good for the environment it would be bad for profit.
      </p>
      <p>
        Really really grieved about the stupid, childish way our councillors and politicians join up in gangs and throw abuse at one another, rather than getting on in a professional manner and running this country for us as they are paid to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mostly grieved that there is very little that I can do about it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actively monitoring the internet for tools to network other Meldrew like personalities to give us the voice and power to shape world we all want and want also for our children and grandchildren.

        Since I obviously stumbled across this home page, I seem to be spending a bit of time surfing the net.  If you can be a bit more specific about what you are looking for, I would be pleased to post anything I stumble across that I think might be of interest to you. (After all, I'm clearly interested enough in what you are saying to at least post this offer.)  I'm not sure this offer will result in anything of value, but I know that I can confidently offer you a 100% money back guarantee :-) -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>
