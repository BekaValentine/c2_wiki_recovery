        Rexx Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Rexx is a language invented by IBM. It was used on OS/2, among other IBMish operating systems. It is very much geared toward text processing.
        It first appeared in IBMs VM/SP3 Mainframe Operating System in 1984.
      </p>
      <p>
        Stands for "Restructured Extended Executor"
      </p>
      <p>
        It inherits some of its syntax (such as DO-END loops) from <a href="PliLanguage.html">PliLanguage</a>.
      </p>

        REXX is/was a wonderful language, extraordinarily easy to use and very powerful (superb parsing, and arbitrarily structured associative arrays).  Its inventor <a href="MikeCowlishaw.html">MikeCowlishaw</a> got made an IBM Fellow for its invention.  I sorely miss it. --<a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>

        Alistair, you don't have to miss it.  Use regina or brexx which are both freely available.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can purchase Object Rexx (<a href="ObjectRexxLanguage.html">ObjectRexxLanguage</a>) from IBM for Windows and Linux (possibly others). It is free on Linux.

           IBM has <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>d this and it is now Open Object Rexx, which can be found at <a href="http://www.oorexx.org/">http://www.oorexx.org/</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You can also use <a href="NetRexxLanguage.html">NetRexxLanguage</a> to write Java JVM compatible programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that REXX was designed to be an <a href="EmbeddedLanguage.html">EmbeddedLanguage</a> like <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>.  So, you could use REXX as your macro language.  Famous programs such as the XEDIT text editor on VM/CMS used REXX in this way.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, REXX was/is used as a replacement for the VM/CMS Exec2Language.
      </p>
      <p>
        REXX (as AREXX) was the OS-standard inter-application scripting language of the <a href="AmigaComputer.html">AmigaComputer</a>.

        There is a website for all things Rexx:  <a href="http://www.rexxla.org">http://www.rexxla.org</a>  (Rexx Language Association)

        I have a program, PalmGlobe, on my HandSpring that displays the globe from any angle and provides day/night shading.  The documentation states it was written in a version of REXX.  Evidently there's life in the old girl yet.  -- <a href="GarryHamilton.html">GarryHamilton</a>

        I find myself in a Rexx-like mindset when programming in <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>.  Both have free typing of variables and minimal symbol clutter (semicolons).  That keeps both programs clean and easy to read.  Not surprisingly, I find both lead me into the same errors:  "I thought that was a number not a string" and "How did that value get in there".  -- <a href="DaveEaton.html">DaveEaton</a>

        There are 9 free Rexx interpreters for download.  Six are "classic Rexx," two are object Rexx, and the final one is NetRexx.  All have their unique advantages, so it's nice to have a selection.  Access any of them here -- <a href="http://RexxInfo.org/html/rexxinfo2.html.">http://RexxInfo.org/html/rexxinfo2.html.</a>  -Bob

        Rexx survives by way of Regina in The Hessling Editor, using it as the macro language similar to Kedit/XEdit -- <a href="http://hessling-editor.sourceforge.net/">http://hessling-editor.sourceforge.net/</a>  One of my professors swore by it as an open source editor for this very reason. -- RobertQuigley
