        I think a <a href="CommodoreSixtyFour.html">CommodoreSixtyFour</a> or <a href="AppleIi.html">AppleIi</a> version would be the most fun.... whether it works as an HTTP server, as a BBS mod, or as a stand-alone program, why not? Hypertext has been done on Atari 8-bit BBSes, this one just goes a little further.

        <em>That would certainly be obscure. I'm not sure about SLIP/TCP implementations for C64, but then real programmers interface directly to the wires using the cassette port ;).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd say TCP/IP wouldn't be a requirement. Just make it accessible on, say, a single-user application written in BASIC or 6502 assembly. The <a href="WikiPrinciples.html">WikiPrinciples</a> say it should be publicly accessible, but you could probably say that a computer doesn't need remote access to be public, much less Internet access specifically. Or, through the magic of emulation combined with client/server technology, you can argue that any Commodore program can  be accessible to the public.

        <em>Kodak makes a camera with a built-in scripting language. Who will be the first to bring wiki up on that? To be a wiki I have to be able to make pages that link over the internet.</em>

        <em>What about a wiki written in postscript, that could run directly of a printer? Not sure what the input mechanism would be, but postscript seems like the perfect language for a wiki.</em>

        A Commodore 64 wiki on a single system?  I just had an idea.  Know how <a href="ColorForth.html">ColorForth</a> has different colors for foos and bars?  Well, Commodore 64 has intrinsic support for colored text in a very lightweight way.  So, the wiki syntax would be that all blue text under 15 characters is a link to a page with the most similar filename, to save the trouble of writing case-sensitive logic.  Then, all you need to implement is the text editor and the navigation.  Except, search and <a href="BackLinks.html">BackLinks</a> are problematic.  You'd have to run a batch that generates some kind of word index.
