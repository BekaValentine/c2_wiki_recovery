        ...a (usually) formal symbolic language used to describe and reason upon constructs of another language.

        <a href="BackusNaurForm.html">BackusNaurForm</a> is a language (not a method) to formally describe the <em>syntax</em>
        of programming language constructs.

      <p>
        It is also possible to formally describe meaning or <em>semantics</em>.
        There are three classic ways to do this: AxiomaticSemantics (see <a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?axiomatic+semantics)">http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?axiomatic+semantics)</a> by using <a href="HoareTriple.html">HoareTriple</a><strong>'s, </strong>StructuralOperationalSemantics (see <a href="http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?operational+semantics)">http://www.foldoc.org/foldoc/foldoc.cgi?operational+semantics)</a> by GordonPlotkin, and <a href="DenotationalSemantics.html">DenotationalSemantics</a> by <a href="DanaScott.html">DanaScott</a>.

        The name of the <a href="FunctionalProgrammingLanguage.html">FunctionalProgrammingLanguage</a> ML derives from "meta-language," as the <a href="MlLanguage.html">MlLanguage</a> was originally a <a href="MetaLanguage.html">MetaLanguage</a> for writing proof tactics for a theorem-prover.  Later people decided it was more generally useful.

        The term meta-language developed in 20th century philosophy as a kind of parallel to <a href="MrAristotle.html">MrAristotle</a>'s Meta-physics (The book after Physics).

        The <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> can be used as a meta-language.  A Forth programmer can design an application-specific language, with whatever syntax and semantics are desired, and then write the application in that language.  Lispers express a similar attitude to programming.
