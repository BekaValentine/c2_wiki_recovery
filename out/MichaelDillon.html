      <p>
        I first became interested in patterns in 1982 shortly after I was
        married because my wife and I wanted to eventually build our own
        house and I had purchased several architecture books including
        one entitled A <a href="PatternLanguage.html">PatternLanguage</a> by <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a>. I enjoyed
        this book so much that I also bought the <a href="TimelessWayOfBuilding.html">TimelessWayOfBuilding</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Both books have influenced my thinking about the software 
        I was designing which at the time were
        complete systems of business applications written in COBOL or 
        Business Basic. Nowadays I am more interested in working with
        dynamic object-oriented languages such as Python and Java although I'm trying
        to learn Smalltalk and plan to someday delve into Objective-C.
      </p>

        I have been involved with computers since 1972 doing all manner of
        things, mostly related to programming or design. I also write a 
        weekly column for Internet Week magazine about Internet infrastructure
        and a monthly column for Boardwatch about building an ISP service. 
        See my web page at
        <a href="http://www.memra.com">http://www.memra.com</a> for links to my articles.

        And although I have experienced many conferencing/discussion systems
        over the years, both on the web and off, this Wiki has to be one of the
        most enjoyable I have come across to date.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of these days I plan to incorporate the Wiki ideas into an Internet-based
        collaborative work system that I am designing and prototyping in my spare time.

        I don't visit here as often as I used (there are other wikis out there to play in now :-) but I still try to keep up with goings on every so often.
