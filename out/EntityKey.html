        Entity Key

        The EJB Spec requires that every Entity bean also have with it an <a href="EntityKey.html">EntityKey</a> that is used to look up the bean and compare two <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s.  The <a href="EntityKey.html">EntityKey</a> is a separate utility class that is developed along with the bean.  It generally consists of the key field(s) of the corresponding database row.  <a href="EntityKey.html">EntityKey</a>s are used as a arguments to EJB finder methods and in other places.

        Is there some good argument against using things like java.lang.Integer or java.lang.String as <a href="EntityKey.html">EntityKey</a> when your keys are only a single field?

        Yes, there are some.

      <p>
        One argument for using java.lang.Integer etc is that it saves some coding. (Every line of code is a potential bug!)

        One argument for using special key-classes is type-safety. I've been in projects where they used Strings as keys for all entities and passed them around as arguments a lot. There was some spectacular bugs happening when people mixed the different arguments up.

        Also, if you have composite keys there really isn't much of a choice.

        As of EJB1.1 it is a custom to use int and String directly without encapsulating them into wrapper classes. You can use Integer and String as <a href="EntityKey.html">EntityKey</a>s . Or your <a href="EntityKey.html">EntityKey</a> can be a combination of all the fields (public and persistent) in your <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>. This is very useful if you want have the <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a> to represent a table with no primary keys.

        <a href="EntityKey.html">EntityKey</a>s are also used to compare two objects. If two <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s have the same <a href="EntityKey.html">EntityKey</a> then they are equal. Its different from the reference comparing under corba where we check to see if both objects point to the same chunk of memory in a VM. Fred
