        Wiki Vandalism Solutions
      </h1>
      <p>
        There have been some proposals for dealing with <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a>s. Let's collect them here for comparison. See also <a href="http://ward.c2.fed.wiki.org/wiki-vandalism-solutions.html">http://ward.c2.fed.wiki.org/wiki-vandalism-solutions.html</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        We haven't yet come up with a list of requirements for a successful vandalism solution.  Here is a first pass: (see <a href="WikiVandalismAnalysis.html">WikiVandalismAnalysis</a> for more)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Should address <a href="WikiTrolling.html">WikiTrolling</a>.  (see <a href="TrollDefinition.html">TrollDefinition</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Should address <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           Should address <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> material (either embrace it or eliminate it--at a minimum, set clear guidelines as to what is OK and what is not).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that spam and vandalism have very different motivations, although they are similar in outcome.  A well-crafted solution is needed for each problem, but discussion is likely to be more productive if we don't confuse the issues.  <a href="WikiSpamSolutions.html">WikiSpamSolutions</a> should be addressed on that page, not here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most proposals either attempt to make trolls want to leave on their own, or to forcefully remove them.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Ideas to make trolls want to leave on their own:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="AnonymizeRecentChanges.html">AnonymizeRecentChanges</a>.  Take away trolls' ability to target specific individuals.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TolerateOffTopic.html">TolerateOffTopic</a>.  Learn to live with it.  Maybe the trolls will go away on their own.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LetsSlowDownDeletions.html">LetsSlowDownDeletions</a>.  Slowing down deletions will allow more cooling-off time, so there will be less spontaneous trolling.
        </li>
        <li>
           SubscriptionFee.  Make it a financial burden for the trolls to continue.
        </li>
        <li>
           DelayAction. Create an impervious fence with time. Make it impossible for an attacker to get results right away.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Ideas to forcefully remove trolls:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           HumanVerification.  Prevents automated vandalism.
        </li>
        <li>
           PoliceForce. Special users get some administrative authority.
        </li>
        <li>
           AccessLevels/FunctionalAccess. Provide a hierarchy of privileges to different members of the community.
        </li>
        <li>
           WeightedFranchise. Give more valued members of the community more weight when making decisions.
        </li>
        <li>
           RandomPeerPrivilege. Allow ordinary users some administrative capabilities, when several of them act together.
        </li>
        <li>
           GatedCommunity. Only let a select and invited group of people into the "club". (aka "by invitation only.")
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiNeedsTrustMetrics.html">WikiNeedsTrustMetrics</a>/<a href="TrustMetric.html">TrustMetric</a>/<a href="WebOfTrust.html">WebOfTrust</a>/CommunityWarning.  Trust is earned when other users don't revert your edits.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Partial solutions and specific technologies:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DefensiveScriptIdea.html">DefensiveScriptIdea</a>/<a href="OpenProxySelfBan.html">OpenProxySelfBan</a>.  A mechanism for blocking open proxies.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="LetsSpeedUpDeletions.html">LetsSpeedUpDeletions</a>.  Speeding up deletions will allow gnomes to revert changes faster.
        </li>
        <li>
           KillFile/BanList.  Bad users lose the ability to edit.
        </li>
        <li>
           AutomaticSandbox (implies KillFile).  A way of maintaing an open communication channel with those who have been banned (allows for appeals).
        </li>
        <li>
           CitizenArrest. (implies <a href="LetsSpeedUpDeletions.html">LetsSpeedUpDeletions</a>, KillFile).  A ban feature that automatically reverts all edits by an individual.
        </li>
        <li>
           PersonalIdentification. Create a login system by which you can track each member's identity.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Proposed solutions:</strong> (these are intended to meet all of the requirements.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="LetsWithdrawIntoSolipsism.html">LetsWithdrawIntoSolipsism</a>/<a href="FilteredRecentChanges.html">FilteredRecentChanges</a>.  Users keep a personal list of pages they do not want to see.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PersonalWatchList.html">PersonalWatchList</a>.  <a href="PersonalWatchList.html">PersonalWatchList</a> proposes to defuse vandalism by taking away <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> as an attention-getter.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a>.  Editors or teams of editors create clean "views" of wiki, and vandalism is tolerated in the unclean wiki.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiSig.html">WikiSig</a>.  Allow off-topic material.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="SplitWiki.html">SplitWiki</a> into a formal and less formal section
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Note that the grouping above is pretty arbitrary and may not make any sense at all.  We should come up with a better way to organize this page.  Also, these proposals and ideas have lots of dependencies on each other.  I've pointed out a couple using "(implies x)" syntax, but there are many more to add.
