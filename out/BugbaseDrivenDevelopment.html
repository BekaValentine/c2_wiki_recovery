        Bugbase Driven Development
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You want to document in real time, so you don't end up like that one project where the new team members read the [<a href="BigRequirementsUpFront.html">BigRequirementsUpFront</a>] documentation and made all the design mistakes, but you don't want to waste time that could be devoted to project growth.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dispatch two (or more) avifauna with one lithoid missile; lean on the bugbase for the documentation system. Encourage everyone to converse, in prose, about bugs & dark corners of the system, in that bugbase, to keep the project information widely dispersed among the personnel. 
      </p>
      <p>
        First, you install a bugbase, such as <a href="BugZilla.html">BugZilla</a>, <a href="BugaBoo.html">BugaBoo</a>, Insecticida, <a href="TestTrack.html">TestTrack</a>-Pro, <a href="JitterBug.html">JitterBug</a>, <a href="ExtremePlanner.html">ExtremePlanner</a>, <a href="FlySpray.html">FlySpray</a>, <a href="RedMine.html">RedMine</a>, <a href="TracProject.html">TracProject</a> / <a href="TracWiki.html">TracWiki</a>, <a href="TargetProcess.html">TargetProcess</a>, <a href="GitHub.html">GitHub</a>, etc, etc... literally any one can do: you can roll your own as part of the project with only the slightest overhead.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, you hash together whatever works, in the code, in a garage, and spooge it out as Beta 1. With a few light topics such as "screen with buttons that turn it on" type stories; the obvious stuff nobody pays attention to.
      </p>
      <p>
        The Beta 1, however, naturally becomes the mother lode gold mine of new issues of every stripe. You harvest dozens of bug reports and feature requests, from idealized and/or real customers. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Everyone learns early to mercilessly refactor the bugs, to read them a little & pass them on, adding their wisdom & subtracting value from the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, for each one, you prioritize it onto a carousel daily, as team members pluck tasks from its other side.
      </p>
      <p>
        They only write code if they have a bug to fix, and they only deploy if hordes of manual testers thumbs up their assigned bug portfolios.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bug reports reference each other, groom each other over time, amanuenses of the project archeology & outlook.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lowly bugbase has now grown to be the central & number one knowledge base and living hive of the community.
