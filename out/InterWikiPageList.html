        Inter Wiki Page List

      <p>
        This would be a page which would consist of the titles of the pages contained within the wiki. It would be constructed by the server for the wiki periodically, perhaps once per hour for some wikis and other intervals determined by WikiAdministration.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some wikis have such pages available as in: TitlesIndex. It would serve as a white pages listing of pages of the target locale and could be included with the page lists from all Wikis chosen as <a href="SisterSites.html">SisterSites</a> in a master page list. This master list would then be acted upon by the wiki server as if the pages were addressable directly by a suitable interface.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the wiki was quite large and the listing of AllPages would create a page ToLargeToEdit, a way to secure the page list might be provided instead, for this wiki:
