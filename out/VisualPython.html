        Visual Python
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Visual Python</strong> is a <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> variant developed for physics modeling at Carnegie-Mellon University. It has a 3-dimensional vector space and a lighting model for making scenes. Uses OpenGL and automagically allows scenes to be rotated and zoom-able. Probably one of the nicest additions to the language.

        It was nearly included in the Python standard distribution, but was factioned-off when a <a href="LanguageWars.html">LanguageWars</a> erupted over FloatingPoint. The scientists wanted floating point division, and the computer scientists wanted integer division.

      <ul>
        <li>
           For only graphics, or for other purposes?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It was mostly a cosmetic issue because the language did and does support both. Yet the lack of true floating point being embraced by the syntax was seen as a flaw by the scientist who doesn't want to have to worry about the personal philosophy of the language's creator.

      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>It perhaps says something about the limitations of the language that it couldn't have supported both.</em>

        Hmmm, hopefully they can merge their efforts. VPython uses the Wx windowing library rather than Qt. (<em>And Python(x,y) haz </em><a href="WxWidgets.html">WxWidgets</a>, too.;<em>)</em>
