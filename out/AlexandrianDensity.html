        <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> described how the use of one or two patterns in a structure doesn't make it noteworthy, but that when many patterns are used in an overlapping fashion in a small space, the net effect can be profound.

        Does anyone have the exact reference in the <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> literature?

        <em>This was an early conjecture that one can find in many places in the </em><a href="RugBook.html">RugBook</a> (e.g., Ch. 5, p. 36). But by <a href="NatureOfOrder.html">NatureOfOrder</a> he refines this view and goes on to give a rather formal definition of Wholeness based on a definition of coherence that underlies the TheoryOfCenters. It is no longer based on density. The definition is quite involved, but he lays the foundations for it as follows, based on a trivial rectangular tesselation of the field<em> R </em>into<em> n </em>elements.<em></em>

        <dd>To make the idea of different degrees of coherence explicit, we introduce a measure of coherence <em>c</em>, on the subregions of R. Call each possible subregion of R, <em>S(i)</em>, where <em>i</em> ranges from 1 to 2**n. The coherence of the <em>i-th</em> subregion <em>S(i)</em> is then to be <em>c(i)</em>. Each <em>c(i)</em> is a number between 0 and 1, and every subregion of R is to be given its measure of coherence. The most coherent regions have a <em>c(i)</em> which is close to 1; the least coherent regions have a <em>c(i)</em> which is 0 or close to 0.<em></em></dd>
