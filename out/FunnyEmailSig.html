        Funny Email Sig
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's amazing how an EmailSignature has become such a great medium for <em>humor</em>.  Who would have thought?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           First off, signatures originated with Usenet posting software and spread to email from there, back in the 1980s.
        </li>
        <li>
           Secondly, what do you mean "become"? Signatures have been humorous since about the third one in existence.

        It's interesting seeing the evolution of signatures on Slashdot, where the majority of the posters are not familiar with them from Usenet. I.e., its evolution on Slashdot parallels its evolution on Usenet. <em>Except that </em><a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> limits you to 120 chars and enforces a sig marker, so it ducks a lot of the flame wars and WarLording that <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> has seen.<em></em>
