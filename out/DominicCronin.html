        I am a computer programmer living in Amsterdam, The Netherlands. My current work is mostly in <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>, as is most of my programming at home. I also still do some <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>. Back in 1989 I worked on the beginnings of Computer Integrated Manufacturing using tools like C and ORACLE. I did some work in C after that too, but it's been a long time since I really worked in C, apart from the occasional recent excursion when it seemed the best tool for the job. I also worked for a long time on writing database applications using the "Magic" RAD environment. A while ago I experimented with <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> and messed about in <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a> (or more accurately <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a>) to customise <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a>. Did I mention that I also work with a fair amount of <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> ?

        Other interests include the <a href="LightweightDirectoryAccessProtocol.html">LightweightDirectoryAccessProtocol</a> and libraries that are useful in that context.

        I recently started looking at <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> - which seems pretty good. Now that I'm running a <a href="LinuxOperatingSystem.html">LinuxOperatingSystem</a> at home I appreciate anything that gives me leverage on disparate operating systems. I suppose I'm also <a href="LearningLinux.html">LearningLinux</a> although it's not too daunting if you ever worked on <a href="UnixOperatingSystem.html">UnixOperatingSystem</a>. Other home projects include investigations into <a href="ZopeApplicationServer.html">ZopeApplicationServer</a> and <a href="PloNe.html">PloNe</a>.

        I work as a consultant, mainly using the TridionWebContentManagement system and generally using Microsoft tools.

        When I get the time, I'm into EnglishFolkMusic and RapperSwordDancing, although spare time is always at a premium, even more so now that I'm a family man. I still try to find time to indulge my obsessions, whether computer-based or not.
