        Arr Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        R Language (<a href="ArrLanguage.html">ArrLanguage</a>) is a <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a> language which has some relationship to <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>. It is described as an open source version of the S language (<a href="EssLanguage.html">EssLanguage</a>).

        It is particularly developed as a set of <a href="PowerfulAdHocDataProcessingTools.html">PowerfulAdHocDataProcessingTools</a> for use by statisticians, and currently appears to be the lingua franca for academics researching statistical methods. Consequently there are many extensions available for statistical calculations. There is an extraordinary plotting library 'ggplot2' inspired by the <a href="TheGrammarOfGraphics.html">TheGrammarOfGraphics</a>.

        The "weirdest" characteristic of R is its that it uses a <a href="CallByNeed.html">CallByNeed</a> evaluation scheme, despite <em>not</em> being a <a href="SingleAssignmentLanguage.html">SingleAssignmentLanguage</a>. Function arguments are not evaluated until referenced in the body of a function. You usually don't notice, but sometimes you do. For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        makeAddarr <- function(addWhat) {<br/>
        function (x) x + addWhat<br/>
        }<br/>
        addarrs <- list(makeAddarr(1), makeAddarr(2), makeAddarr(3))<br/>
        for (a in addarrs) print(a(10))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        prints 11, 12 and 13 as you might expect, but
      </p>
      <code>
        for (i in 1:3) {<br/>
        addarrs[[i]] <- makeAddarr(i)<br/>
        }<br/>
        for (a in addarrs) print(a(10))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        prints 13, 13, and 13! The reason is that, for each adder, the value of addWhat is not computed until referenced in the inner function -- by which time "i" has already changed.
      </p>

        The <a href="CallByNeed.html">CallByNeed</a> system is also exploited in writing things that act like <a href="RuntimeMacro.html">RuntimeMacro</a>s.
