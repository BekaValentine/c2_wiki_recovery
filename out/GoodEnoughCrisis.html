        Good Enough Crisis

        <dd>In many segments of the sector, vendors have a difficult time convincing customers to upgrade to newer versions of their products when installed versions work adequately.

        <dd>The consequences of <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a> are fundamental. With customers essentially happy with their existing systems, the pace of product upgrades slows. But even more critical is the fact that such satisfaction typically reduces the impact of product-based innovation as a differentiator for software vendors — thus substantially changing the basis of competition across the sector.</dd>
