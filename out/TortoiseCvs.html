        <a href="TortoiseCvs.html">TortoiseCvs</a> is a plug-in for Windows Explorer written by Francis Irving.

        <em>Tortoise lets you work with files under CVS version control directly from Windows Explorer. It's freely available under the GPL. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>With </em>TortoiseCVS you can directly check out modules, update, commit and see differences by right clicking on files and folders within Explorer. You can see the state of a file with overlays on top of the normal icons within Explorer. It even works from within the file open dialog. <em></em>

        It's brilliant.  --<a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a>.  (Oh, but get TweakUi too so that you can repair your icons occasionally)

        Fantastic and....
        Version 1.45 includes a 'rebuild icons' option on the context menu :)  --An Ant.

        CVS is a mediocre revision control system at best.  It doesn't version directories or renames, branching is baroque, and it's not ACID.  But <a href="TortoiseCvs.html">TortoiseCvs</a> is an amazing front end.  Absolutely fabulous.  With <a href="TortoiseCvs.html">TortoiseCvs</a>, using CVS is a pleasure, and I can overlook CVS's deficiencies.  No other revision control system I've seen comes close to the combination of Tortoise and CVS.  --<a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a>

        I totally agree.  By the way, you might want to try <a href="SubVersion.html">SubVersion</a> -- it is supposed to address some of those limitations in CVS, and handily enough there's a <a href="TortoiseSvn.html">TortoiseSvn</a> project so you get to keep the nice front end. -- <a href="KevinMcConnell.html">KevinMcConnell</a>
