        Threading Model

      <p>
        The major classifications of threading models I've worked with are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Cooperative Threading - Each thread runs until it releases the CPU for other threads to execute.
        </li>
        <li>
           Pre-emptive Threading - Threads are given time slices in which to execute.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Process scheduled ("green threads") - Each process has its own thread scheduler that divides the process's time slice between its threads.
            </li>
            <li>
               OS scheduled - The OS gives each thread a time slice.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        "green threads" - is this what is called "fibers" in Win32?  -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>
