        Alanguage Capturing Capabilities
      </h1>
      <p>
        Computing Machines become useful because they usually have <a href="AlanguageCapturingCapabilities.html">AlanguageCapturingCapabilities</a> of that machine. There is an almost constant creation of new machines and new languages for the machines. Uses are planned for the machines, but inevitably there are innovators who can find and use peripherals and attachments to extend the capabilities beyond original intentions. This is the adaptive side of technology. Designers often see ways they can move these peripheral processes and capabilities into the next processor chip set. This might be termed ScientificEvolution.
