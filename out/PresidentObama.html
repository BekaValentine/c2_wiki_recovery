        President Obama
      </h1>
      <p>
        Change has arrived even here on the craggy old C2 <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does <a href="PresidentObama.html">PresidentObama</a>'s election mean to the future of software development? His administration is already vastly better wired than that of his TechIlliterate predecessor. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Besides his justice department hiring lots of </em>RecordingIndustryAssociationOfAmerica lawyers? or selling out all our phone taps to the big telecoms?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        America's energy, transport and financial infrastructure is in critical disrepair but <a href="PresidentObama.html">PresidentObama</a> promises a massive public works project to renew it all. He will have to PrintMoney to pay for it ... but that beats printing money for no good reason at all.
      </p>
      <p>
        All <a href="PresidentObama.html">PresidentObama</a>'s new infrastructure spending will require new ControlSystems, SecuritySystems, and ManagementSystems. What will we write them in?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And increased funding for cops catching minorities with a joint and throwing them in jail for multi-year sentences?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And let's not forget we have brand new ElectoralSystems to put in place. We've already seen something wonderful on change.org ... but what else could be done now?
      </p>
      <p>
        If American foreign policy is rededicated to principles of <a href="SatyaGraha.html">SatyaGraha</a>, how can we extend and deepen the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> movement to build on this?
      </p>
      <p>
        What a wonderful day has dawned!

        I must have missed something.  What new ElectoralSystem?  And I wouldn't get quite so excited about Obama.  He still hasn't actually changed anything (except perception).
      </p>
      <p>
        To answer the questions,
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           there will be a short term increase as the infrastructure is built, but that will be temporary.
        </li>
        <li>
           that depends on what you want to accomplish.
        </li>
        <li>
           I doubt American foreign policy will be rededicated to the principles of <a href="SatyaGraha.html">SatyaGraha</a> in the first place, so I doubt we will be able to extend and deepen the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> movement to build on it.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>The best long-term Obamoid goal would be to strengthen democracy. The same systems Karl Rove used to steal the last 2 presidential elections can now be turned around and used to enforce voter rights. That, in turn, might lead to more education, and less people voting against their own best interests...</em> --<a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
