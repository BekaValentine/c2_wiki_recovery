        Primary Colors
      </h1>
      <p>
        As any artist can tell you, the primary colors are Red-Yellow-Blue.  Red and Yellow combine to create Orange, Yellow and Blue create Green, and Blue and Red create Purple.  To account for all six colors of the rainbow. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The question is:  yellow and green are both at the center of the rainbow, why is it that we use <a href="RedGreenBlue.html">RedGreenBlue</a>?  It can't be because of an additive or subtractive light issue.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It can be, and it is.  Pigments (artists' paints) are subtractive, lights (most display pixels) are additive.  See </em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Additive_color</a> and <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color''">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subtractive_color''</a>
