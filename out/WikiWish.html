        I should have checked this <a href="WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml.html">WhyDoesntWikiDoHtml</a> out first, but it's fun to reinvent the wheel, sometimes -gy

        I love web design and anything aesthetic too esp. if is has to do with computers, but I remember when someone answered a similar question to yours by saying that the reason wiki doesn't HTML is that content is more important that the way it looks and that HTML would detract from the 'bare-bones' of what is being said and also make it really hard for people who didn't know HTML to contribute (making wiki a bit elitist for programmers), which made me forget almost completely about how much I love HTML and making websites look good, no wait, look great :) but I like the idea all the same. -- SusannahWilliams
