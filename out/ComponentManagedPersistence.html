        [<em>Below is the original pattern and format used; currently, we're morphing it to our standard Alexanderian form.</em>]
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Intent</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Separate the aspects of managing persistence issues away from the container of components. Encapsulate the persistence or transience of a component independent of its container.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Motivations</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a component developer producing components applicable to a number of domains and to exist in an arbitrary Container, he/she cannot guarantee the level of persistence available from any particular Container/domain. To overcome this the developer would apply this pattern to guarantee the level of persistence required by their component.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, the developer may be producing a component to be used in a specific framework, and therefore knows the level of persistence is not enough for their component. Upon applying the pattern they can be satisfied that the persistence will be sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Consequences</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ComponentManagedPersistence.html">ComponentManagedPersistence</a> pattern has the following benefits and drawbacks:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <em>It ties the component to a specific persistence store.</em> This could be seen as a benefit to some developers, but on the whole a drawback as it reduces the reusability of the component. To overcome this use the <a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a> pattern, delegating persistence management to the components container or the <a href="PackagedPersistence.html">PackagedPersistence</a> pattern, which uses an
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        intermediary object (probably one of the GOF patterns).
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <em>Increases size and complexity of the component.</em> One of the primary aims of component development is to produce small, interoperable packaged pieces of code. Having a component manage its own persistence will obviously increase its size and complexity breaking this aim.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           <em>Makes the component independent of the evolution of other components.</em> This is good or bad, depending on your situation. If you want co-evolution, it is bad. But if you want to ensure that this component continues to work in the same way, regardless of its peers' evolution, then it is good (rather like <a href="RenamingWikiPages.html">RenamingWikiPages</a>). 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        This is more apparent when this pattern is used in conjunction with <a href="InheritanceManagedPersistence.html">InheritanceManagedPersistence</a>, where our component may have inherited its persistence management from another component or base library class.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Maybe it should be <em>Makes the component independent of the evolution of other components/containers</em>? Just to clarify, when you say this are you referring to removing the dependency upon another component to carry out persistence management? I suppose a container can be seen as a component. -Stuart)

        <strong>Known Uses</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="EnterpriseJavaBeans.html">EnterpriseJavaBeans</a> model has both <a href="ComponentManagedPersistence.html">ComponentManagedPersistence</a> and <a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        ADO (ActiveX Data Objects) uses <a href="ComponentManagedPersistence.html">ComponentManagedPersistence</a> to read/write data to/from any kind of OLEDB provider, or using things like Orbix to get to another component model's server object, which in turn reads and writes to and from persistence. 
      </p>

      <p>
        Note on the evolution of this would-be pattern: 
        <a href="StuartBarker.html">StuartBarker</a> first mined this, and after seeing it complement <a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a> in <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>'s paragraph in <a href="InheritanceManagedPersistence.html">InheritanceManagedPersistence</a>, I figured it was time to whip some junk up onto <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> and take it from there. I copied and tweeked the Intent from <a href="ContainerManagedPersistence.html">ContainerManagedPersistence</a> and felt the group could get involved, and even go as far as link it to other patterns. -- <a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a>
