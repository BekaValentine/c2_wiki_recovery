        Community Of Trust
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... a group of authors and a moderator are assembled
        to review a literary work.  The author is bringing
        a work for review, a <a href="WorkInProgress.html">WorkInProgress</a>, and seeks
        help in refining the work.
        This group will develop into
        a <a href="CommunityOfTrust.html">CommunityOfTrust</a> that can serve several authors.
        At a conference like PLoP, there are many papers to
        review.  How do you best utilize this group?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>An effective </strong><a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> is built on a community<strong></strong>
        <strong>of trust.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Trust is a key ingredient in a <a href="SafeSetting.html">SafeSetting</a> for reviews.
        One important objective of the <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> format is
        to guarantee a community of trust, so the author's
        dignity is retained.
      </p>
      <p>
        The author is willing to release unpolished work for
        review in this setting, knowing that everyone knows
        that it is unfinished work, which implies a different
        review perspective than for typical, polished, conference
        submissions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>However, the review of a single work rarely takes</strong>
        <strong>longer than an hour, which is not enough time to</strong>
        <strong>cement long-term relationships.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A group of people can develop trust only through many
        shared experiences.  If a <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> is to provide
        a community of trust, it must be together for a period
        of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a> reviewers could participate in an
        "OutwardBound" exercise to build trust;  this is how the
        Hillsiders built their initial community of trust.  However,
        there often is no time for such exercises, and such exotic
        measures are frowned upon in the mainstream corporate
        cultures that patterns mean to serve.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Organize </strong><a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a>s by areas of interest that<strong></strong>
        <strong>tie together the works of the authors involved.</strong>
        <strong>The authors/reviewers and gallery should remain with</strong>
        <strong>the same workshop for the duration of the reviews</strong>
        <strong>of all authors' works.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The manuscripts reviewed in the workshop are not</strong>
        <strong>published outside the workshop in which they are</strong>
        <strong>reviewed, until the author refines the works and</strong>
        <strong>offers them for wide publication.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>*  *  *</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        At PLoP, we start to build trust by assigning a
        PatternShepherd to help the author prepare his or
        her work for the workshop.
        The shepherding process helps filter out the most
        embarrassing misfits, so that all papers enter the
        forum with the benefit of the shepherd's insights
        on what makes a good pattern.
