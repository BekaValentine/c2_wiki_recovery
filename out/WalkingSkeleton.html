        Walking Skeleton

        "A Walking Skeleton is a tiny implementation of the system that performs a small end-to-end function. It need not use the final architecture, but it should link together the main architectural components. The architecture and the functionality can then evolve in parallel." -- Alistair Cockburn (from <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Walking_skeleton)">http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Walking_skeleton)</a>

        It is a pattern intended to kick-start <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a> (mentioned at <a href="http://www.mockobjects.com/book/kickstarting-tdd.html">http://www.mockobjects.com/book/kickstarting-tdd.html</a> )
      </p>
      <p>
        The pattern is described at <a href="http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Walking_skeleton">http://alistair.cockburn.us/index.php/Walking_skeleton</a>

        To be pedantic, <a href="WalkingSkeleton.html">WalkingSkeleton</a> is a technique to kick-start a project.  If you follow <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, then you'll use your <a href="WalkingSkeleton.html">WalkingSkeleton</a> to kick-start that process.  If you follow some other process, you'll use your <a href="WalkingSkeleton.html">WalkingSkeleton</a> to kick-start that.

        <em>Is there a relation with </em><a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The distinction seems to be subtle and somewhat amorphous (and perhaps unimportant), but it would appear that a <a href="WalkingSkeleton.html">WalkingSkeleton</a> implements the full range of <em>types</em> of application architecture, but doesn't implement all necessary functionality.  A <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> is either a particular component of functionality or a "rough sketch" system to verify feasibility, etc.  For example, a <a href="WalkingSkeleton.html">WalkingSkeleton</a> might implement a portion of the back-end database, some of the database abstraction layer, a portion of the business logic, and an associated data-entry form.  That would allow the full architectural range of the system to be examined and further evolved.  A <a href="SpikeSolution.html">SpikeSolution</a> might consist of just the data-entry form, or (alternatively) might present the same functionality as the <a href="WalkingSkeleton.html">WalkingSkeleton</a> but only as a test environment intended to be studied and then thrown away.
