        Java Static Problem

      <code>
        <strong>public class</strong> Registry {<br/>
        <strong>private static</strong> List register = <strong>new</strong> <a href="ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a>();<br/>
        <strong>public static void</strong> register(Object obj){<br/>
        register.add(obj);<br/>
        }<br/>
        <strong>public static boolean</strong> isRegistered(Object obj){<br/>
        <strong>return</strong> register.contains(obj);<br/>

        The above <em>Registry</em> class makes use of a <strong>private static List</strong> to hold objects. There are many cases where this is fine. However, What would happen if <em>Registry</em> were loaded by two different <a href="ClassLoader.html">ClassLoader</a>s.  I think there would be two instances of the class, and therefore two instances of the <em>register</em> list. -- <a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a>

        <em>More generally, since </em>'static<strong> methods are not polymorphic, you may find using them to encourage a less </strong>objecty<em>' (and perhaps more smelly) style.</em>

        There's also the trap that I fall into, that static members are not inherited. So if you have a FooRegistry which extends Registry, it needs its own static <a href="ArrayList.html">ArrayList</a> <strong>and</strong> you have to re-write the register etc. methods <strong>not</strong> in terms of super().

        Though personally I don't find these kinds of "static classes" objectionable, especially where they're used for Factory or registries or in-general keeping track of instances of a set of related classes. I'm also happy that there exists the Collections class (I like this 'pluralization' naming convention, too) in the Java library for its methods like #sort(), but there are others there - especially things like #unmodifiableSet() that would benefit from <a href="MoveMethod.html">MoveMethod</a> refactoring.
      </p>

        In ZoIsite I use "static classes" to implement a kind of Facade - that's how I think of it anyway. Whenever I write one of these, I always include something like
      </p>
      <code>
        private ClassName() {} // static class<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Interesting. Where would you move 'Collections.unmodifiableSet(<Set>)' to?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        'new UnmodifiableSet(<Set>)'  That's what happens behind the scenes in Collections.unmodifiable<Blah>() anyway.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Something like that. and Collections.singleton(Object) - I think that was the name; the one that makes an immutable set containing just the specified Object - definitely needs that kind of treatment. Say, new </em>UnmodifiableSet(Object[]) with a one-element array.<em></em>
      </p>

        Static methods in Java aren't really class methods. They're really global methods, since they're bound at compile-time and can't be overridden. In the past I've found myself writing bizarre hacks to get around this limitation in language design, though these days I just use another language if I have a choice. -- francis
