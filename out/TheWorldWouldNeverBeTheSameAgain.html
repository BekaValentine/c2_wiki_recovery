        The World Would Never Be The Same Again

      <p>
        Skinny Sally Jones and the Mad Professor knew that something had to be done.  Wiki must be saved. But first, there seemed to be a problem with the rest of the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was like "War of the Worlds" writ larger - total population delusion! In these virtual times, no-one ventured into the physical outdoors. They had become entirely dependent on virtual reality for their knowledge of the world. And the Kowmungers had now obtained total control - not just of Wiki but of the entire internet, of the virtual world, and therefore effectively of the totality of reality.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sally and the Prof hastily put on their clothes. Sally's journey to her liaison with the Mad Professor had of course been purely virtual. Now the two of them left their physical apartments into the outside world, and proceeded on foot to their agreed meeting place.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was years since they had been into the physical outdoors, as opposed to the virtual outdoors. They were astounded to find that nature had reclaimed the roads, the cars, the railways and the ports. These things had not been used since the advent of the virtual age.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wild crops had spread. Unhindered by pollution, they had prospered. Sally and the Mad Professor found a small shelter and tasted a wild peach together. Bliss! How could they have been so deluded, so ignorant? How could they ever have fallen into the trap of virtual living?
      </p>
      <p>
        Never again would they fall into that trap. Bugger the internet! Bugger Wiki! Thanks to the Kowmungers for destroying the rest of civilization! Skinny Sally Jones and the Mad Professor would never again waste their time in virtual discussions on OrganicFoodConsideredHarmful, Now, the whole physical world (and all the organic peaches in it) was theirs.
      </p>
      <p>
        So Sally and the Mad Professor lived happily ever after.
