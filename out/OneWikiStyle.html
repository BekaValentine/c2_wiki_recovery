        Please do not take this as a voice-from-above giving you rules for how to use Wiki, either on the page from whence you came or in general.  <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> just ain't that way.  This page and the approach it describes are meant only as an attempt to stimulate our best possible discourse.

           <strong>Every page on the wiki is not required to reflect your views.</strong>  Wiki is a center of discourse, not a group manifesto.

      <ol>
        <li>
           Link freely, especially when criticizing.

      <ol>
        <li>
           Find a place for people whose views counter your own.  The only view that can't fit within Wiki is the view that other people aren't allowed to disagree.

        <li>
           Edit boldly when you agree, but be very cautious about reversing existing content.

        <li>
           BeExcellentToEachOther.  A cheesy reference to a popular comedy, but we could do a lot worse than to follow this practice in <em>all</em> of our discourse.

        <li>
           Strive to undo your mistakes.

           Carefully and occasionally ignore this advice.

        That's it.  Thanks for checking it out!

        How about: When you create a MundaneLink, include in the Wiki some idea of what is in the page/site being pointed to.

        A would-be contributor wonders in <a href="OneWikiEvolution.html">OneWikiEvolution</a>.  <em>Thanks for linking to your thoughts rather than stepping on these.</em>

        This doesn't seem to be working too well in terms of the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. I see the <a href="BigDesign.html">BigDesign</a> pages being modified back and forth in a very contentious fashion, rather than the productive tolerance that usually characterizes <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>. If you can't explain WhyOneWikiStyleWorks, I think I'm going to sign this here paragraph -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        <em>Yeah, it didn't work out so well, did it?  It got even worse!  Note the new edits, in an attempt to fix up the idea.</em>

        <em>It's more that the alternatives manifestly don't work. Something needs to be done differently. See </em><a href="ThreadModeCorrected.html">ThreadModeCorrected</a> and <a href="ThesisAntithesisSynthesis.html">ThesisAntithesisSynthesis</a> for other attempts.<em></em>
