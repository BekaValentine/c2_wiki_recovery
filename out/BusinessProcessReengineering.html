        Side note:  <a href="IvarJacobson.html">IvarJacobson</a> wrote a book called "The Object Advantage: Business Process Reengineering With Object Technology" ISBN:0201422891.  I have not read it, but, as best I recall from what someone explained to me, Jacobson makes the case for using <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a> for BPR.  It had something to do with <a href="UseCases.html">UseCases</a> representing a process that adds value for the customer/user.  I don't mean to confuse, but I hope it helps understand what is a process, as opposed to a task.

        The book is quite rigorous, but you can get a feel for the power of the idea by using
        object modelling techniques rather than the conventional procedural 'workflow' ones. 
        Using that approach you identify how people need to work as teams (possibly virtual teams) to 
        look after your 'assets' (products, customers, suppliers, resources, etc.). You could
        think of these as use cases. This approach has been successfully used within a very large
        UK company and has proved very successful -
        people actually use and maintain the process descriptions because they are people-oriented.

        The fundamental idea is that if you automate the current manual practice, all you'll get is a <strong>fast</strong> ineffective practice.
      </p>
      <p>
        What you need to do instead is to redesign or "reengineer" the customer's business process, to be more sensible, effective, efficient, focused on results of value to their customer, etc...  before you ever try to build an automated system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without BPR, you run the risk of automating bad business practices, and thereby "locking them in" -- making them nearly impossible to fix ever in the future.
      </p>

        <em>Isn't this a bit arrogant?  Sure, there are often current practices that are less than perfect in any business, but who is the BPR consultant to say that the business </em>'must<em>' redesign its practices before any software can be started?</em>

        Over at <a href="XpIsResultOfApplyingBusinessProcessReengToSwEngProcess.html">XpIsResultOfApplyingBusinessProcessReengToSwEngProcess</a>, we've
        gotten an interesting statement. That XP and BPR are really instances
        of the same idea, applied to slightly different concepts. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fine. Could somebody explain what BPR is?  What is the fundamental
        text, who believes it (academics? business people? some unholy 
        conglomeration of the two?), what are the perceived benefits, 
        etcetera.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bonus points for addressing the following sorts of questions: If I believe the 
        claim of <a href="XpIsResultOfApplyingBusinessProcessReengToSwEngProcess.html">XpIsResultOfApplyingBusinessProcessReengToSwEngProcess</a>, how
        should I change my actions?

        <em>I'd buy into that, in that BPR is for redesigning our customer's business process, and XP (and all other development methodologies for that matter) are about redesigning our development "business process" -- the techniques we use to develop the software itself.  I don't think it changes your actions, as the fact that we talk about development methodologies at all means that we're already doing BPR -- on ourselves.  -- </em><a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a><em></em>

        I've changed my actions by ordering the book. BPR is a buzzword in a lot of America's industrial companies, and many of them are actually trying to do serious rethinking of their processes.
        My mission, should I choose to accept it, is to "sell" XP into the corporate environment, and the hook to something they know about and (somewhat) believe in, may be valuable.
        I'm also hoping to get some ideas to feed back into the XP process itself.  --<a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
