        <strong>Old Guys:</strong>  Take some integers, some byte addressing instructions and a
        reliable code generator and build a few layers of abstraction out of it.
        Then, if there is time left, think about the really cool things that
        could be built with a few layers above that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>New Guys:</strong> Takes some jpegs, some Director files and a GUI framework in
        beta and see if you can make some cool visualizations.  Then, if there
        is time left, think about how you could put a program behind the whole
        thing to actually make it do something.

        I kinda think today's programmers don't know the difference between <em>elegant</em> 
        and <em>baroque</em>.  They stuff their apps full of arcane, 
        non-orthogonal <em>features</em> that intimidate an old-fashioned guy like me. -- <a href="JimWilson.html">JimWilson</a>

        <strong>Old Guys:</strong> When the system crashes, they look at the last few system inputs and outputs, read some source code, figure out exactly what the program did that caused it to crash, then go fix it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>New Guys:</strong> When the system crashes, they fire up the source language debugger, step through every instruction the system executes, examine the values of various variables, watch the program crash, then go fix something. -- <a href="DouglasSurber.html">DouglasSurber</a>

      <p>
        <strong>Newest Guys:</strong> When the system crashes, they fire up the GUI debugger, run to the point of the crash, see that it's in some code generated by some Wizard or Expert, then go ask an Older Guy how to fix it.  -- <a href="DavidHooker.html">DavidHooker</a>

        <strong>Older Guy:</strong> When the system crashes, they look at the machine code dump for the last few instructions, find the corresponding source code, figure out exactly what the program did that caused it to crash, then go fix it.  -- <a href="ShalomReich.html">ShalomReich</a>

        <strong>Recent Grad:</strong>
        Post to comp.lang.<em>whatever</em> complaining that the
        development tool is broken.
        (Though if <em>whatever</em> =
        <em>java,</em> chances are good that the tool
        <em>is</em> broken, at least with the current generation
        of tools.)
