        Books That Should Be Made Into Films
      </h1>
      <p>
        Way back in college, I read "The Tomb" by F. Paul Wilson and thought It would make halfway decent adventure/horror movie. What other books would make good movies, but haven't yet ?.
      </p>
      <p>
        - I just googled for "repairman jack" (The central character on "The Tomb") and there are attempts to make this into a movie, but suffered a setback because of a bad script. Rumor also has it, that some un-named popular young actor wants the role.

        <em>that is the worst rumour i have ever heard</em>

        <strong>Lucifer's Hammer</strong>, by Larry Niven and Jerry Pournelle. Special effects out the ying-yang.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <strong>Cluster Command</strong> series (three books) by David Drake. Would make the final fleet engagement scene from "Return of the Jedi" look like a schoolyard rumble.

        The biggest and baddest encounter in the forty-plus year history of Fred Saberhagen's <strong>Berserkers</strong>. My favorite is "A Teardrop Falls," but that story is a little too small for the big screen. Perhaps <strong>Berserker Planet</strong> would be a better choice.

        The Forgotten Soldier, it could totally dethrone Saving Private Ryan.

        Every AynRand book. Then it should be required viewing in every school at every grade. The books/movies should then be endlessly discussed on all media for the next hundred years. No one should be allowed to vote unless they can write a 100 page report on objectivism.
