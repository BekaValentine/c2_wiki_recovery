        Refactoring Is Not Rewriting
      </h1>
      <p>
        A statement I've had to make quite a bit lately, in two contexts:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> To Managers</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've had to explain that object-oriented programming allows for code encapsulation; which allows you, with the use of a unit test suite, to carefully evolve programs and data models into a simpler, easily maintainable code base.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em> To Developers</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is also a mind set of the old <a href="PlanToThrowOneAway.html">PlanToThrowOneAway</a>, that just does not seem to fit well with refactoring a code base.  By 'throwing away' code, there is significant risk in the possibility of altering interfaces, etc.  Evolve, don't throw away...
