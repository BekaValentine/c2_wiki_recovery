        <a href="NegativeOne.html">NegativeOne</a> is the greatest of the negative integers. <em>Sounds like an ego trip.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If using TwosComplement arithmetic, <a href="NegativeOne.html">NegativeOne</a> has the same bit-pattern as the maximum representable unsigned machine integer.
      </p>
      <p>
        ANSI C doesn't express it in such terms, but its rules for casting between signed and unsigned ints effectively say that "it's a no-op if you're using TwosComplement".
      </p>
      <p>
        And is generally represented in a computer as a string of all-set bits, or in hexadecimal as all 'F's.
      </p>
      <p>
        As opposed to NegativeZero, which has no representation in 2's-complement, but does in other schemes.

        Well, to be exhaustive, wouldn't you need to say something about its <a href="SquareRoot.html">SquareRoot</a>? I mean, where would complexity and <a href="ChaosTheory.html">ChaosTheory</a> be without imaginary numbers?

        The value -1 is often used in software as a special value to indicate "error", or "not applicable", or "missing value" (see <a href="ZeroMeansNull.html">ZeroMeansNull</a>). Many people consider this to be a bad idea, a remnant of low-level programming languages and simplistic storage techniques.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The value -1 is also equal to the value TRUE in many (scripting) languages. This makes sense, if you consider that its binary equivalent has all bits set to 1 (e.g. 11111111 for a 8-bit value). So binary spoken, false equals 00000000, and true equals 11111111. (ANS <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a> is an example.)

        A few years ago, a questionnaire was making its way through e-mail boxes. I sent it to an old friend from college. Here is part of his response:

      <code>
        WHAT'S YOUR FAVORITE...<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Salad Dressing: Roquefort.

           Color of socks: Black

        <li>
           Why?: People tell me I'm a negative one.
