        War On Waterfall

        Let's say you've a process that demands that developers write Functional Design Documents or produces Wireframes
      </p>
      <code>
        - Word docs, PDFs, Visios, Slideshows or just Plain Old Photoshop Files.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I mean demands as in 'Management says moar'.
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you do?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you feel like your client and your customer are no longer the same person?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you feel like your liaison no longer has the shareholders interests at heart?
      </p>

        I do, and after many years of reading developer stories at c2, one day I decided to declare <a href="WarOnWaterfall.html">WarOnWaterfall</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I started to provide estimates on documentation tasks. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Albeit I regard the waterfall artifacts as pseudo documents in any case. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="UnitTests.html">UnitTests</a> and <a href="AcceptanceTests.html">AcceptanceTests</a> being well, you know, a bit more functional.
      </p>
      <p>
        I created user stories like 'As an organization I want the team to create a Visio of the solution architecture so that...'
      </p>
      <p>
        So that, hmmmmm....
      </p>
      <p>
        "So that we can put it the Functional Design Document".
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway ... "1 week estimate", for the diagram only.
      </p>
      <p>
        "People will be looking at it and discussing it, that takes time."
      </p>
      <p>
        In the beginning the <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> made it into the iteration, but after a while at the <a href="PlanningMeeting.html">PlanningMeeting</a> they started to get pushed into the backlog because you know...
      </p>
      <p>
        When pushed, everyone would actually prefer the developer was coding. 
      </p>
      <p>
        All I'm trying to say is  - you can do it too!
      </p>

        PS: I have a smashing Visio of my <a href="SolutionArchitecture.html">SolutionArchitecture</a> and I look at it all the time. It was worth every cent.
