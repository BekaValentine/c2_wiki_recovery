        Extreme Hypothesis
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="ExtremeHypothesis.html">ExtremeHypothesis</a> is, of course, "This project we're looking at right here is Extreme."
      </p>
      <p>
        A project supports the <a href="ExtremeHypothesis.html">ExtremeHypothesis</a> to the extent that it follows the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> methodology. Some practitioners have suggested that projects should be rated by a number 0 <= p <= 1 designating the Proper Proportion of Extremeness of which the Project Partakes (PPEPP). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Sticklers for detail of course point out that p is a function of time and contemplate a graph of p vs time. These individuals suggest that the top boundary of the graph, p=1, be designated Project Perfection, while the lower boundary, p=0, be designated Project Phailure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        True Extremists, of course, just use good old 0 and 1, none of these wimpy uncommitted in-between kind of girly-man numbers.
