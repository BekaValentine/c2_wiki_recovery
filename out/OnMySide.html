        A <a href="SoftwareUsability.html">SoftwareUsability</a> metric--how much is it <a href="OnMySide.html">OnMySide</a>, as opposed to <a href="InMyWay.html">InMyWay</a>?   Software which is <a href="OnMySide.html">OnMySide</a> a simple, coherent feature set that is directly related to the job at hand, and has a simple interface for accessing said features.  Examples of <a href="OnMySide.html">OnMySide</a> software are <a href="ProjectBuilder.html">ProjectBuilder</a>, <a href="TextEdit.html">TextEdit</a>, <a href="CocoaBrowser.html">CocoaBrowser</a>, <a href="SafariBrowser.html">SafariBrowser</a>, and tools such as wc and grep.

      <p>
        There are parallels between <a href="OnMySide.html">OnMySide</a> software and well-designed objects or subsystems.

        Of course, this is subjective.  For a long time I've said that "emacs is my friend", but many just don't want to learn about it. -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>

        Software that's <a href="OnMySide.html">OnMySide</a> is usually that which is "transparent" or "invisible". That is, it just lets me get on with the task at hand. I don't have to devote mental effort on obscure conceptual models inherent in the system design, or waste time moving the mouse to places it should never need to go to.
        I merely have to worry about the letter I'm writing, the code I'm cutting, or the data I'm exploring. -- <a href="MichaelMahemoff.html">MichaelMahemoff</a>
