        For anyone <a href="InterestedInSoftwareArchitecture.html">InterestedInSoftwareArchitecture</a>, here are some papers and books which may be useful. These wont all appear on the <a href="GreatBooksList.html">GreatBooksList</a>, but they do go some way to setting the scene and help to provide some common ideas and vocabulary.

        The Aesop meta-tool for creating style-specific architectural design tools was itself built out of common off-the-self (COTS) software products and this paper details some of the many difficulties in composing large-grain software components.

        Describes the use of a design space to evaluate the architectural-level structure of user-interface systems. A design space is a multi-dimensional space that consists of a number of axes which each represent one property of the systems being compared, such as use of parallelism. A system being evaluated is measured along each of the axes in the design space. A number of rules complement the space that describe connections between axes and so allow the evaluator to easily navigate among them.

        Introduces software architecture by drawing analogies to hardware, network and building architecture. Some motivations for studying and researching software architecture are given, along with a model for architectural description - consisting of processing, data and connecting elements. Includes a case study of two different architectures for a multi-phase compiler.

        From Charles Weir:
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's an interesting set of patterns I came across recently.  They describe
        the <a href="BigBallOfMud.html">BigBallOfMud</a> software architecture at <a href="http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html.">http://www.laputan.org/mud/mud.html.</a>  This, for the uninitiated, is what normally happens for any large and long-lived system: the architecture of a system gets cobbled together and everything gets rather complicated.
