        National Public Radio

      <p>
        One of the last decent places to listen to a talk show. Unless you are a <a href="HowardStern.html">HowardStern</a> fan.

        The web page supposed to tell you to get permission to do this:

        I don't find their talk shows too edifying. Everyone sitting around agreeing to everything, no real diversity of opinion. The only thing that distinguished it from other talk radio is a lower decibel level.

        <em>There's some truth in that, but it varies by time and day quite a bit. Bear in mind the time difference. At appropriate times, if you email a show, the message is likely to be broadcast. You can even telephone from the USA (or anywhere) and ask to be called back.</em>

        NPR has an extreme right-wing bias, as bad as CNN or MSNBC. For their reporters to maintain access to various government crooks, they often under-report on their crimes.

        PrairieHomeCompanion is not a NPR show--it's a PublicRadioInternational show [formerly APR]. On the other hand, CarTalk is NPR. The problem now is that all NPR stations are becoming the same. In the Washington, DC area, WAMU changed its schedule to be nearly a clone of WETA. The bluegrass fans were not pleased. -- <a href="EricJablow.html">EricJablow</a>
