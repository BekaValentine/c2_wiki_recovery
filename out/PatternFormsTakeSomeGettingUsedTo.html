        Pattern Forms Take Some Getting Used To
      </h1>
      <p>
        Even though I typically enjoy structured documents, I have to say that my first impression of <a href="PatternForms.html">PatternForms</a> (such as the <a href="CanonicalForm.html">CanonicalForm</a> and <a href="GoFform.html">GoFform</a>) was that:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They placed an unnatural order on documents.
        </li>
        <li>
           They relied on previous understanding of the form.  ("'Forces'?  Forces on what?", I asked.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Over time, I've learned to understand <a href="PatternForm.html">PatternForm</a>, and now feel that in many cases using it is a great way to document an idea (for example, "<a href="LetsPlayTeam.html">LetsPlayTeam</a>").
      </p>
      <p>
        My point is this:  There is a certain amount of overhead that each person will have to go through before <a href="PatternForm.html">PatternForm</a> becomes a natural way to read.  Until the reader has gone through this, they could be distracted by it, defeating the point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Solutions:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If a document resists being put into the form, consider it a <a href="TextSmell.html">TextSmell</a> to be heeded.
        </li>
        <li>
           Put a link to the <a href="PatternForm.html">PatternForm</a> you used.  This will be redundant to those who already get it, but for those who don't, it could help a lot.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Forces are easier to understand if you understand <a href="EasternPhilosophy.html">EasternPhilosophy</a>. Other lessons from the East that are important include simplicity, especially in names and explanations.

        <em>The point is that the </em><a href="PatternForms.html">PatternForms</a> rest on previously known information, which this statement supports.<em></em>
