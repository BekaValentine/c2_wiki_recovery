        I am Interested in forms of High Tech design that apply to low tech solutions <a href="HighTechLowTech.html">HighTechLowTech</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        One example is Wind-up/Solar powered radios that are being deployed in Africa
        (see <a href="http://www.freeplayfoundation.org/lifelinewhat.php">http://www.freeplayfoundation.org/lifelinewhat.php</a> Lifeline radio for an example )
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also interested in applications of products like Amorphous Silicon Solar panels
        (see <a href="http://www.uni-solar.com/Our_Technology_a_Si.html)">http://www.uni-solar.com/Our_Technology_a_Si.html)</a> that can be used as roofing material
        and generate power on to the grid reducing fuel consumption
      </p>
