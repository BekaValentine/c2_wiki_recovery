        Promoting Xp
      </h1>
      <p>
        What can be done to increase the number XP developers and XP projects?
      </p>
      <p>
        The best way seems to be: work in a project that uses XP, then you might be able to help the next XP project work. And if you want to start a new project that should use XP get an experienced XP coach. 
      </p>
      <p>
        But sorry, that won't work, or at least, it will take too long. If the computerized world would survive Feb 29 2000, it will certainly be blown up by highly complex low quality software before the end of 2001 (or whatever the release date of Win, Doze, 2.0.0.1 and friends will be).
      </p>
      <p>
        A rapidly growing number of developers, software development managers, CIOs, IT consultants etc. will get to know XP and a lot of them will say: "That's the way we should go!" But they won't be able to go, because they won't get a coach. 
      </p>
      <p>
        At the moment there might be about 10 to 15 experienced XPers (or even less?). If a typical XP project lasts 6 months and generates 2 new XP coaches, there might be 90 to 135 coaches, worldwide, in one year.
      </p>
      <p>
        And suppose I am an experienced software developer that learned all about XP and understands most of it: What are the chances to get into an XP project within the next 12 months and make my enthusiasm work?
      </p>
      <p>
        So there must be some way to start XP projects without an experienced XP guru directly involved. One way to solve this problem would be:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           teach XP in the first step in an <a href="XpCourse.html">XpCourse</a> and then 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           keep in contact with the pupils when they are in their first XP project, in order to help them or even exert some sort of control. 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        (That would be two fine jobs for the XP gurus.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Or, simply speaking: There might be little- or even un-experienced"  XP coaches that are supported by really experienced gurus. Hard work for the gurus, I know, because they still have their jobs as coaches (otherwise they would lose their experience).

        First, notice that you can't go faster than you can go, and cultural changes take more time than "mere" technical changes, which take a long time already. That said, there is no reason why XP can't spread quickly. If projects that use it are successful, and if each project spawns new ones, organic growth will cause it to spread rapidly.
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, there is no reason that a BlownSeedXpProject is impossible. The "coach" approach is really a risk shift. If the team isn't afraid, and they are committed, they can just execute <a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a>' "Solve Your <a href="CurrentWorstProblem.html">CurrentWorstProblem</a> The Xp Way" adoption strategy. Getting a day of technical training before starting a practice might be a good idea, but mostly for reducing fear. The rules of the practices aren't so hard to follow.
