        Imake Tool
      </h1>
      <p>
        Imake (including the xmkmf tool) is a build configuration tool which generates Makefiles. It was developed back in the 80s by former <a href="TektronixInc.html">TektronixInc</a> engineer ToddBrunhoff as part of the X Windows System, and is (or was until recently) a key part of the development environment for X - at least the XFree86 distribution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The inheritors of XFree86 are working to replace imake with an </em><a href="AutoConf.html">AutoConf</a> based make system, like many other large <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> projects.  They are also breaking the X source tree into modules that can be compiled independently.  Soon, imake will become a relic of history.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think it's used anywhere else.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is a classic example of <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> going awry. Even its author repeatedly has disclaimed it as a "dirty hack" or some such.
      </p>
      <p>
        Essentially what Imake does, is that it serves as a preprocessor for Makefiles. You feed it a "makefile template" (an Imakefile) describing the software you want it to build, and "target description" files describing the target you want to build it for, and it outputs a set of Makefiles customized for your particular target. 
      </p>
      <p>
        This was done in the days before Gnu make (to say nothing of other build configuration tools such as <a href="ApacheAnt.html">ApacheAnt</a>) was widely available - and was designed to deal with numerous different Unices, each with their own crippled version of Make (and other insidious platform differences).  
      </p>
      <p>
        However....
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Both the template and the generated makefile tend to begin at about 10,000 lines in the simple case and grow without bounds from there
        </li>
        <li>
           Rather than invent a preprocessor, the author of Imake decided to use an existing one. Unfortunately, the <a href="CeePreprocessor.html">CeePreprocessor</a> was chosen - as a front-end to <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>, cpp is barely adequate. As a general-purpose macro processor, cpp is terrible. This makes Imakefiles <em>way</em> more complicated than they need to be; as you are constantly having to hack around the limitations of cpp. Plus, cpp and Make interact with each other in strange ways; e.g.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Both treat backslash-newline as a "line continuation" indicator. To embed a backslash-newline in the resultant Makefile, you have to type @@\ in the Imakefile. Making sure, of course, you haven't left any whitespace <em>after</em> that backslash....
            </li>
            <li>
               Many pathnames found in Unix makefiles contain a path separator (/) followed by the "select all files" wildcard (*). Of course, to cpp the string /* starts a comment. Some of the hardest-to-debug problems with imake are when this shows up in an Imakefile.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           The imake distribution contains a set of sample templates for various platforms. Unfortunately, they contain reams of X-specific cruft; use of imake to build anything that isn't X is an interesting challenge.
        </li>
        <li>
           Invoking imake directly is difficult--a typical imake command line is several lines long, with numerous difficult-to-remember options.  As a result, a typical imake-generated makefile consists of rules to rebuild the makefile, so the user doesn't have to run imake directly--"make Makefiles" will do the trick.  But what if
          <ul>
            <li>
               You are bootstrapping the system for the first time?
            </li>
            <li>
               A change to the imakefile causes in invalid makefile to be generated, such that make fails?
            </li>
            <li>
               In the latter case, most Imakefiles arrange for a backup copy of the makefile to be made.  In the former case, you're on your own--the usual solutions include a "bootstrap script", and/or a hand-written top-level Makefile.  Constructing either is a RPITA.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
