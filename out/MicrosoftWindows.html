        <strong>Q:</strong> Is Windows an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>? That's the important question.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Those who use Windows are more aware of the ease of operation and the intuitive interface which allows use of the computer, its files, programs and peripherals and having a low barrier of entry. It employs a graphical user interface. Underlying this is a system which supports such usage. A <a href="CommandLineInterface.html">CommandLineInterface</a> is also available.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> In the days of the OS/2 (<a href="IbmOsTwo.html">IbmOsTwo</a>) wars, IBM referred to Windows through the 9x line as "a popular line of DOS extenders". There's no reasonable question that NT/2K/XP and CE are operating systems. The more interesting question is, are they RealOperatingSystems?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> It is now, yes. <a href="WindowsNt.html">WindowsNt</a>, <a href="WindowsTwoThousand.html">WindowsTwoThousand</a>, and <a href="WindowsXp.html">WindowsXp</a> remove the 16-bit <a href="MsDos.html">MsDos</a> code and replace it with a fully 32-bit kernel based on that originally developed for the <a href="VmsOperatingSystem.html">VmsOperatingSystem</a>. The DOS shell is now confined to a window running in an emulation mode; they've even changed the default shell from command.com to cmd.exe. There is no way to boot into DOS mode. (Not that there was under WindowsMe, but WindowsMe was still <a href="MsDos.html">MsDos</a> on the inside. God, that OS sucked.)

        <dd><em>To be honest, yes it did. The XP Command Prompt wasn't much better than none at all in the way of </em>BatchFile<em>s</em>, but would be challenging <a href="DosBox.html">DosBox</a> at overall emulation. Get any later OS's <a href="CommandPrompt.html">CommandPrompt</a>, and although it processes BatchFiles better, it has<em> </em>'ZERO<em>' </em>emulation. --<a href="SimonMould.html">SimonMould</a><em></em></dd>

      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Windows was once famously described as "32 bit extensions and a graphical shell [on top of] a 16 bit patch to an 8 bit operating system originally coded for a 4 bit microprocessor, written by a 2 bit company, that can't stand 1 bit of competition."  This was attributed to Art Bahrs (an HP guy) in Aug 1997, although it probably predates that.
      </p>
      <p>
        While humorous, it's inaccurate: neither DOS nor its predecessor QDOS were a patch to any flavor of CP/M (presumably the "8-bit operating system"), and no flavor of CP/M never targeted a 4-bit microprocessor.

        <strong>Q:</strong> How can something that manages files, memory, threads & processes, security, and network i/o not be an operating system?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong> Not everything labeled "Windows" manages files, memory, threads & processes, security, and network I/O. <em>Huh?  Are you making a historical argument (that Win95 wasn't an OS)?  Win2000, </em>WinXP, and Win2003 are operating systems.<em></em>

        <strong>Q:</strong>Is there a wiki version running locally on a Windows system?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A:</strong>Try <a href="EddieEdwards.html">EddieEdwards</a>'s <a href="WikiServer.html">WikiServer</a>, which can be run as a localhost. It doesn't require a local Web server. If you do run a Web server on your machine, many <a href="WikiEngines.html">WikiEngines</a> will do the job.

        In the MS-Windows GUI, the window or widget with current focus receives mouse scroll-wheel movements. This keeps tripping me up. It would be more natural for the window/widget under the mouse-pointer to receive scroll-wheel movements.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This has been fixed, now the behaviour is what you describe</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not for me. Both work and home machines (Windows 7) still do this.

        thumbs.db - annoying little files that always get locked up etc. and clutter things up. A separate parallel folder set should perhaps have been used instead.  A good idea done wrong.
