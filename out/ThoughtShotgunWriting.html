        Thought Shotgun Writing
      </h1>
      <p>
        An <a href="IncrementalWiki.html">IncrementalWiki</a> technique that applies to all kinds of writing:
      </p>
      <p>
        When you get an idea while you're working on writing another one, jot it down just enough to remember where you were going and move on.
      </p>
      <p>
        We must harness the creativity or be driven mad by it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's a good quote, I think this is part of how computer's have saved me - they let me record ideas that I can't implement in their totality just yet. Faster than writing, and easier than a typewriter.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Similar to a literary technique of <a href="StreamOfConsciousness.html">StreamOfConsciousness</a>.
