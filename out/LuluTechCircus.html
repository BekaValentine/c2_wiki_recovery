        I got to play 20 minutes of <a href="UnrealTournament.html">UnrealTournament</a> 2003. The graphics were impressive. Can't say the gameplay seemed any different (that is to say, it was no more or less fun than previous versions -- just prettier).

        The Lego Mindstorms booth was cool, but as an adult, I stood back and let the kids have fun.

        It seemed lightly attended. A few of my friends hadn't even heard of it the night before it started.
