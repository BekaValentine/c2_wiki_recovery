        Please Stop With The Category None
      </h1>
      <p>
        Whoever is doing this, please stop. At first I thought this was a joke because of the recent revival of the various category discussions, but it's gone on way too long. This pseudo-category is contaminating the entire C2 with useless edits and a false and misleading "category."
      </p>
      <p>
        Hey, we have useful categories in abundance around here. Look at some of the discussion about categories before you just slam a non-functional tag on a page! We <strong>use</strong> categories to make finding pages related to a particular topic easier. Categories allow the Wikizenry to group ideas related to a topic together without necessarily binding them tightly. This is why lots of pages have multiple categories assigned to them; their multiple inheritance and multiple parenthood is <em>useful</em> to the C2 community.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sadly, the "none" category doesn't do any of those things. In fact, it appears to group pages together without regard to content at all! This is harming the C2 Wiki, not helping. Please, let's not do that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Agree! CategoryNone seems pointless, and its addition clutters </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Also, please don't remove </em><a href="ImplicitTopics.html">ImplicitTopics</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Those who anonymously talk about categories and are not even able to assign a meaningful category to their rant can not be taken seriously.

           The ones which did not understand the value the CategoryNone has, are trying to impose their lack of understanding on those who add such a tag by this rant page.

        I made that page because I had been maintaining these by creating new ones and they were not being used. Think of the page as having a query at the end of the name. It is <strong>NOT</strong> a reason for deleting the old information. As there is more discussion now there is a reason for using them again to note what is going on. I have created the ones for the current months. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        As a <a href="WikiZen.html">WikiZen</a>, I vote to allow the "none" category if it aides in categorizing topics down the road. I applaud those who attempt to improve the finding/categorizing of pages. Nobody is deleting anything or shuffling content without permission such that any harm done by adding that tag is small. There are bigger things to fret over, like book titles that don't have "book" in the title. Those irritate the living [bleep] out of me. -<a href="TopMind.html">TopMind</a>

        [Yes, the creation and maintenance of new categories has vastly improved the organization of the C2 for purposes of finding related discussions and dissertations. There are several categories I find quite very useful. I have extracted much writing from the C2 for professional papers and training material. "None" provides no useful organization or grouping of information, unfortunately. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>]

        Categorizing of pages is a sizeable and difficult task. As of November 2014 there are greater than 16000 pages which remain uncategorized, mostly because their creators did not find it necessary to place a category on them when the page was first introduced to this wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        It would take several months to simply add <strong>CategoryNone</strong> to such pages, and if done in even six months, would make <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> almost useless during that period. I still wonder who would find the category useful? It would be possible to make a list of such pages without the irritation of the normal change page process.

        If you need such, it is an easy matter to produce it.

      <p>
        An automated process for manipulating pages to add CategoryNone to the 16368 pages not yet categorized is a terrible idea. Categories should only be added with considerable thought and with the purpose that they will be <a href="UsefulUsableUsed.html">UsefulUsableUsed</a>.

        There are 584 pages having the CategoryNone applied to them. Before you proceed in what I view as an unwise action to continue this, please tell me in what way will you or anyone else use this existing group of pages?

        Gnomes <em>et al.</em> could then step in from there and add useful categories to pages that group together with other categorized pages.
