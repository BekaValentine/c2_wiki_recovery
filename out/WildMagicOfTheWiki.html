        Wild Magic Of The Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        A Wiki is like wild magic.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is no controlling it. Pages grow, change, evolve way beyond the intent and wildest imaginings of the author.

        This is Good.

        <em>Cute. I like this phrase. Of course, usually "wild magic" in fantasy novels is as much of a curse as a blessing...caveat emptor.</em>

        Life will find a way. How long until Wiki causes a new branch in chaos theory?

           Hmm. Well, Jurassic Park gave lip service to chaos theory, but nothing that happened was actually about chaos theory. The issue about hermaphroditic frogs would have been known to any of the staff biologists, though. Both Jurassic Park and wiki are more about <a href="MurphysLaw.html">MurphysLaw</a> than about chaos theory (which is merely about sensitive dependence on initial conditions, not about chaos in the conversational sense of the word).
