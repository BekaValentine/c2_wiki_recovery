      <p>
        My name is Alan Moore and I am working on a multi-year project to improve the tools and practices used in software engineering.
      </p>
      <p>
        I started this project with a few of my friends and some people I met online. At the moment, my time is focused on the planning and design of some programmer-to-programmer collaboration tools. I would rather not build these by myself, so if you are interested in a cooperative effort, drop me a note.
      </p>
      <p>
        My real passion is for multi-language interoperability, generative/aspect/intentional programming, distributed programming methodologies, and generally trying to raise the level of abstraction and intelligence of computational tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am also interested in the economics of programming. Don't know much about it but I have some ideas...
