        A totaligism is a statement that provides every possible answer, and likewise, a <a href="NonTotaligism.html">NonTotaligism</a> is a statement that doesn't provide every possible answer. -- <a href="RobertKausch.html">RobertKausch</a>

        <em>I can't find "totaligism" in the dictionary; could you elaborate? Do you perhaps mean "tautology"?</em> -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>

        OED doesn't have it either. Looks like 'totaligism' a neologism. By the sounds of the above soft definition, I expect that a 'totaligism' would have but one correct answer: 'mu'. English doesn't really have an equivalent word.
