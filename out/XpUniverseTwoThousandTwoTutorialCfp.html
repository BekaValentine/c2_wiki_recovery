      <p>
        The XP/Agile Universe Conference is now accepting proposals for the
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           tutorial sessions. This conference has expanded its scope since
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        its inception last year, and its focus includes all Agile Methods,
        including Extreme Programming. Tutorials for any Agile Method are
        accepted and encouraged.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tutorials are an independent instruction on a self-contained topic of
        relevance to conference attendees.  Therefore no commercial or
        sales-oriented presentations will be accepted.  We encourage tutorial
        proposals that provide clear utility to practitioners, especially
        innovative tutorials, which depart from lecture style delivery, and
        tutorials on highly advanced topics in lightweight processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Tutorials are presented in half-day (3-hour) or full-day sessions
        (6-hour). Accepted tutorials will run only if there is enough
        attendance.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to organize a tutorial, submit a proposal via e-mail to
        the tutorial chair Brian Button (bbutton@objectmentor.com). We will
        accept PDF (preferred), HTML and MS Word files as proposals. A
        tutorial proposal must be two pages and should include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Tutorial title and summary (used in advance program) 
        </li>
        <li>
           Duration (full- or half-day), aims and audience 
        </li>
        <li>
           Content outline 
        </li>
        <li>
           Presenter resume with contact information 
        </li>
        <li>
           Examples of supporting material 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each tutorial proposal will be evaluated on its anticipated benefit
        for prospective participants and its fit within the tutorial program
        as a whole. Factors to be considered also include: relevance,
        timeliness, importance, and audience appeal; suitability for
        presentation in a half- or full-day tutorial format; effectiveness of
        teaching methods; and qualifications of the instructor(s).
