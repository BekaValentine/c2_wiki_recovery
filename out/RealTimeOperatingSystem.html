        I have found a site worth its weight in gold when it comes shopping for an RTOS. I haven't found any other site that has done as much conclusive testing on almost every RTOS. The WinCE 4.2 testing and a comparison to <a href="QnxOs.html">QnxOs</a> and <a href="VxWorks.html">VxWorks</a> is there as well.

        Thanks, Andrew. There aren't enough hardcore embedded technoweenies on this Wiki to form much of a group, so we have to share as best we can. Nice to see somebody has a handle on comparing RTOSs toe to toe. -- <a href="MartySchrader.html">MartySchrader</a>

        No, really. We have a project that is grounded in this concept. Stop laughing! It's <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a>, I tell you!

        Of course, this has required plenty of fiddling down in the BSP to make anything work that has a resolution of tighter than 100ms. Glad we're not flying missiles.
