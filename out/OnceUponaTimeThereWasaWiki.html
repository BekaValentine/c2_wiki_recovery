        Once upon a time there was a Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        At first, it was was nothing more than the common meeting-ground for a bunch of like-minded web-addicts. It grew words and memes and fights and winners and losers. It brought together thinkers from different countries, different ways of life, different social circles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over the years, the Wiki was even responsible for the occasional love match. Skinny Sally Jones was too shy to ever have a date, until she got to know the mad professor at OrganicFoodConsideredHarmful.

      <p>
        And that was the most exciting thing to ever happen on the Wiki. Until the day the Kowmungers discovered it.
