        Software Market Factors
      </h1>
      <p>
        Incentives to produce high quality, inexpensive software:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           availability of non-software alternatives, particularly in smaller scale businesses
        </li>
        <li>
           importance of reputation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Incentives to produce low quality software:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           training/support revenue often easier to collect than software usage revenues
        </li>
        <li>
           see speed-to-market factors
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Incentives to get software quickly to market:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           brand allegiance in software is compounded by need to modify old documents
        </li>
        <li>
           network effect for a lot of software makes software much more valuable as more people use it
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Incentives to create small, reusable components:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           allows greater agility in producing customized software
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Incentives to create highly complex architectures:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           bundling lets you sell a bunch of products on the merit of one
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Other unique market factors for software:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           software benefits can be highly intangible and difficult to measure
        </li>
        <li>
           software project durations are hard to predict
        </li>
        <li>
           software has extremely low replication costs
        </li>
      </ul>
