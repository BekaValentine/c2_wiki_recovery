        Waterfall Methodology
      </h1>
      <p>
        The waterfall method attempts to structure development as a single sequence of non-overlapping heterogenous phases, the output of each being the input to the next. Typical phases are: analysis, design, code, test, deployment
      </p>
      <p>
        A dangerous misunderstanding of Waterfall and other methodologies can be found here:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://www.ncycles.com/e_whi_Methodologies.htm">http://www.ncycles.com/e_whi_Methodologies.htm</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Strengths cited are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ease in analyzing potential changes
        </li>
        <li>
           Ability to coordinate larger teams, even if geographically distributed
        </li>
        <li>
           Can enable precise dollar budget 
        </li>
        <li>
           Less total time required from Subject Matter Experts
          <ul>
            <li>
              Demonstrably false, as this is the slowest model to produce a working prototype and also requires the most paperwork.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Weaknesses cited are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Wildly inaccurate at predicting the impact and length of implementation, as it performs poorly at predicting all needs in advance.
        </li>
        <li>
           Since the coordination is mostly via paper, unlike, e.g. <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>, where you talk to the customer on a daily basis and developers pair coordinate, gross misunderstandings are guaranteed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Budget has no correlation to actuals.
        </li>
        <li>
           Projects invariably run over-scope, over-schedule, and over-budget; they require a much larger budget or adjustments thereto if the client wants to have their needs met.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Increased</em> total time required from Subject Matter Experts.
        </li>
        <li>
           Intangible knowledge gets lost between hand-offs.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lack of flexibility.
        </li>
        <li>
           Lack of team cohesion.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Not necessarily.
            </li>
            <li>
               Designers often dictate to developers who are in a much better position to improve the design in cases of emergent design, yet often lack the clout to do so.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Design flaws not discovered until the Testing phase
          <ul>
            <li>
              However, you can inspect the design during build
            </li>
            <li>
              Design flaws that affect the underlying architecture often introduce large delays and waste that could have been much easily addressed is Agile methods
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        In the most strict interpretation <a href="WaterFall.html">WaterFall</a>, it does no good to "inspect the design during build". The <a href="DesignPhase.html">DesignPhase</a> is over, there is no going back. If, during build, the design is found to be flawed, well, then what?
      </p>
      <code>
        Actually, I have always understood the waterfall flow to be like this:<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        .-----------------------------+------------------+---------------------+----------------------------.<br/>
        |                             |                  |                     |                            |<br/>
        |                             |  not ok?         | not ok?             | not ok?                    |<br/>
        |   +--------------+     +----+---+     +--------+-------+     +-------+------+     +-------------+ |<br/>
        `-> | Requirements | --> | Design | --> | Implementation | --> | Verification | --> | Maintenance |-'<br/>
        +--------------+     +--------+     +----------------+     +--------------+     +-------------+<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The idea is, if written programmatically:<br/>
      </code>
      <ol>
        <li>
           R = REQUIREMENTS
        </li>
        <li>
           D = DESIGN(R)
        </li>
        <li>
           IF NOT OK(D) THEN GOTO 10
        </li>
        <li>
           I = IMPLEMENTATION(D)
        </li>
        <li>
           IF NOT OK(I) THEN GOTO 10   'Notice the target!
        </li>
        <li>
           V = VERIFY(I)
        </li>
        <li>
           IF NOT OK(V) THEN GOTO 10   'This would drive me batty...
        </li>
        <li>
           M = MAINTAIN(D, I, V)
        </li>
        <li>
           GOTO 10
        </li>
      </ol>

        [Why deleted? Rebuttals have good value.]

      <p>
        <em>Good rebuttals have good value.  Saying </em><strong>"No"</strong><em> doesn't qualify as a good rebuttal.</em>

        <em>The waterfall method structures development as a single sequence of non-overlapping heterogenous phases, the output of each being the input to the next. Typical phases are: analysis, design, code, test, deployment</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The word 'phase' is a misnomer since every one of these overlaps with nearly every other at every stage of the software lifecycle. Coding almost always involves analysis, designing and testing.
