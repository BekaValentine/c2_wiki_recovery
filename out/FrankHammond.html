        I was here! And I have noticed others noticing...

        I have been reading a book Faster [ISBN: 0-679-40837-1] by JamesGleick, The author of Chaos.
        It has been a very surrealistic book, but has managed to somehow bring the realities of living in a HyperActive, <a href="MultiTasking.html">MultiTasking</a>, <a href="SleepDeprived.html">SleepDeprived</a> world.
        Some of it's topics are the vagaries and limitations of <a href="ShortDistanceVerticalTransportation.html">ShortDistanceVerticalTransportation</a> design, the silliness of humans trying to cope within the millisecond time interval, FastFood, faster information and how it slowing us all to a snails pace in terms of actual accomplishments during the 1440 minutes in a day.
        Studies suggest that most modern workers may get as much as 6 hours of work done in a twelve hour "Work Day"... MAX!! That doesn't justify the overworked, self-aggrandizing work-a-holics view of life, but im my opinion points backwards in time to the forward thinkingness of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.

      <p>
        Blah, blah, blah...
        Is that a verb or noun? It's just mostly irritating!
