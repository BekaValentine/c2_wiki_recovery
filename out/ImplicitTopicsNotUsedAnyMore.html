        Implicit Topics Not Used Any More
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>7th November 2011</strong> There has been one use of <a href="ImplicitTopics.html">ImplicitTopics</a> in <a href="JulyEleven.html">JulyEleven</a> and none at all in <a href="AugustEleven.html">AugustEleven</a>, <a href="SeptemberEleven.html">SeptemberEleven</a> and <a href="OctoberEleven.html">OctoberEleven</a>. I have already created the pages for <a href="NovemberEleven.html">NovemberEleven</a> and <a href="DecemberEleven.html">DecemberEleven</a>. I suggest that if there is no use of the pages by the end of 2011 that these pages cease to be provided for 2012. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <em>I'm still visiting c2 now and then but I haven't seen many pages really applicable for </em><a href="ImplicitTopics.html">ImplicitTopics</a>. But then I might have overlooked them. -- <a href="GunnarZarncke.html">GunnarZarncke</a> (the one who introduced <a href="ImplicitTopics.html">ImplicitTopics</a>)<em></em>

        <em>(later) Hm, it seems that somebody else is also still adding </em><a href="ImplicitTopics.html">ImplicitTopics</a> (adding <a href="NovemberEleven.html">NovemberEleven</a> yesterday). I'd guess the reason thus really is that no real discussion is going on on c2 recently. -- .gz<em></em>

        The <em>somebody</em> was myself as there did seem to be discussion going on. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <strong>2012</strong> I have created <a href="JanuaryTwelve.html">JanuaryTwelve</a> to see if there is any interest in continuing <a href="ImplicitTopics.html">ImplicitTopics</a>. As there has been some I have made the next two as well. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <strong>2014</strong> We are approaching the end of 2013 and there has been a small number of pages to be noticed each month. I am prepared to keep this running into next year. I actually forgot to do the pages for April, May and June until the end of April! No one had used March at all. I think I will see what happens in the next two months and not bother after that unless some demand develops. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

      <p>
        <strong>1st August</strong> I made the pages up until <a href="JuneFourteen.html">JuneFourteen</a> which no one used. I forgot all about them and no one seems to have noticed. I intend to leave it like this. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <strong>4th November</strong> There is much more discussion happening recently. Maybe these could be revived. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        They serve as a reference of what was going on. Someone now or in the future may refer to them. Doesn't History matter? -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I agree that history matters and I never thought to remove old use of </em><a href="ImplicitTopics.html">ImplicitTopics</a>. I started the page because the topics were not being used. I have made the ones for last month, this month and next (October, November and December 2014) to see what happens now.<em> -- </em><a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
