        Web Development Tool Chain
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="ToolChain.html">ToolChain</a> is just like says. It's a chain of tools used to perform some function, such as if you're going to hammer a nail, your tool chain may be: nail, hammer, arm, <em>etc</em>.  Each is needed to hammer that nail into a piece of wood.  The following is a proposed hierarchical list of general categories associated with <a href="WebDevelopment.html">WebDevelopment</a> or <a href="WebDesign.html">WebDesign</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        [computer] [operating system]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           [text editor or WYSIWYG client] [scripting knowledge(?)] [content] [design knowledge]
          <ul>
            <li>
               [internet connection] [ftp client or text field]
              <ul>
                <li>
                   [server] [scripting language]
                </li>
                <li>
                   [server] [scripting language] [database]
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Specific chains</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        There seems to be an abundance of different tool chains in use for web development, probably because the field grew big so fast so recently (relatively speaking). The choice of a tool chain is important as it has a strong impact on productivity, but the market is totally confusing, as there are too many toolchains to have a good overview.

        Should this topic be WebMethodology or something? There are existing topics related to it, BTW, I just cannot think of the names right now. Perhaps try <a href="CategoryInternet.html">CategoryInternet</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Tomcat, Oracle etc. are certainly not methodologies, so why should it be "</em>WebMethodology"? One alternative expression I've heard is TechnologyStack, so we could name this page WebDevelopmentTechnologyStack if people think that's more apt.<em></em>
