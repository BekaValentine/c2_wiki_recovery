        (ISBN 0932633161), a new spin on problem solving; spend more defining the problem than attempting to solve it!

        Actually, for my money, anything Gerry writes is worth getting; writing one great book is an achievement, but 30? Thanks, Gerry. -- <a href="StewartBaird.html">StewartBaird</a>

        Seriously, are there any quotable quotes out from this book? I live in a country where I cannot browse a lot of the books at bookstore, and have already exhausted my book budget long ago, are there any scraps to share?

        Any time you solve one problem you create another - until you have thought of five possible problems you are about to create, you don't understand the original problem. It's a great book.
