        Responsive design simply means that a web layout adjusts
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To the size of a device’s browser window including the screen resolution
        </li>
        <li>
           So no matter if a user is viewing your page on a desktop, laptop, iPad, smart phone or TV, your important information is sized to the screen in a readable form 
        </li>
        <li>
           Using a “media query” to detect the height, width and resolution of the user’s browser and then adjusts the layout accordingly through the Cascading Style Sheet (CSS)
        </li>
        <li>
           Properties such as display width, page orientation, pixel resolution and other device features determine a style sheet which is designed to present the page for its user
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
