        <strong>Part 1 Halting Problem</strong>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> states that it is impossible to write a program that runs in finite time that is able to decide whether an <em>arbitrary</em> program will halt (with a certain input).
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> does <em>not</em> state that it is impossible to decide for a specific program whether it is going to halt. It is even possible to write programs who make this decision. They simply work only on a subset of all programs.
      </p>
      <p>
        To be correct about terms, the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> is actually the question, "Given this code X, will it terminate (halt)?". Usually the only reason to ask this formulated in such a way is to give an example of a problem for which there is no recursive enumerable algorithm, i.e. an algorithm that will itself always produce a result.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is the proof of the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Assume I have a program P that can tell you whether any program halts or not for given input data.
        </li>
        <li>
           I construct a program Q based on P which, if P says its input program doesn't halt, immediately halts, and if P says the program halts, goes into an infinite loop.
        </li>
        <li>
           Feeding Q(Q) to P I can see that if P says it halts, it won't, and if P says it doesn't halt, it will.
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore I don't have any such program P and anyone else who says they do is full of it.
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        That argument applies only to a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> or equivalent. A real machine has a finite amount of state, so you can just run the program in question until it either halts or repeats a state. The machine P runs on would have to be larger than the one Q runs on (a <a href="TortoiseAndHare.html">TortoiseAndHare</a> approach would have P's machine large enough to contain two copies of Q's machine state), so Q cannot fully simulate P.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Quite so. But the general </em><a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> isn't interesting because it indicates a limit to what debuggers do. It's interesting because (a) it's demonstrably insoluble and (b) it's easy to transform large classes of problems into it. This is why it's one of the fundamentals of computability.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Are there any known interesting problems to which this theorem is applicable?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. The answer to the question, "Can I please have 3 million dollars for my research project to detect by inspection whether a program will halt?" is <em>no</em>. Surprising useful. Just as is, "Ha Hahahaha, My computer's instruction set is more powerful than yours!!" being a nonsense claim, thanks to establishing quickly that they are all <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> equivalent. Saved decades of advertising one-up-manship.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, the </em><a href="ChurchTuringThesis.html">ChurchTuringThesis</a> hasn't been proved and isn't proved by alluding to the general <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>. It just hasn't been disproved. Cf. the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        However, that doesn't affect the fact that proving a computer's instruction set Turing-equivalent demonstrates that it is no more powerful than a Turing machine.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Known interesting problems... yes. "Will this line of code ever be executed?" If we replace the line of code with the HALT instruction, we can see the question is equivalent to the halting problem. (Hence perfect optimization is impossible.)
      </p>
      <p>
        "Does this program do the same thing as this other program?" If we choose as our second program the one-liner "HALT" (which always halts), we can see this question is, in general, equivalent to the halting problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        The theorem shows there is a limit to what you can do with a static type checker. If you make a static type system too powerful, it becomes <a href="UniversalTuringMachine.html">UniversalTuringMachine</a>-capable, and hence you may have to solve the halting problem before you can say whether a given program is type-safe. (Avoiding this is essentially what the word "static" means here.) This is why designing a good static type system is hard, and part of why so many of us prefer dynamically checked languages like Smalltalk.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are lots of more-or-less trivial variations. I was recently asked to give a bound on the stack size for an arbitrary program. Clearly we can construct a program which halts if and only if a given program exceeds such and such a bound, so finding the bound is equivalent to solving the halting problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        In a way, this theorem is saying there are no short cuts. Turing earlier showed that a <a href="UniversalTuringMachine.html">UniversalTuringMachine</a> can tell you what any other <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> will do by emulating it, which is a powerful positive result, but the halting theorem says that emulating it is the only way, which is a powerful negative result. Turing gave with one hand and took away with the other.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can think of many (perhaps all) physical processes as being computations, with inputs, outputs and evolving states. A <a href="UniversalTuringMachine.html">UniversalTuringMachine</a> is rather a simple machine, therefore we might expect many physical processes to be <a href="UniversalTuringMachine.html">UniversalTuringMachine</a>s if you look at them right. Hence predicting their behaviour by way of short cuts like partial differential equations is not going to work. Not only is computer-modelling a respectable approach to physics, it may ultimately be the <em>only</em> respectable approach. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong><em>But...</em></strong>
        It's also a good excuse for giving up too early.
        For example, if you want to know the maximum stack depth of a program, and find that there are no recursive loops of calls in the program, then finding the maximum depth is really quite doable.
        However, if there's a loop in the static "call tree" of the program, then you're back to the halting problem - and can't be sure how much stack will be needed.

        Unless you happen to be able to prove some relevant property of the specific algorithm it implements, and prove that it does implement that algorithm, of course. I hesitate to make this comment here, because it tends to confuse the student more than it clarifies things, prompting thoughts such as "What about a program which will either prove that a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> halts, or prove that it is impossible to do so for that specific <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>?" (which are answered by other theorems...), but I trust that anybody who considers this seriously harmful will delete it. Wiki is fun that way. -- <a href="DanielKnapp.html">DanielKnapp</a>

        Another important consequence of the halting problem is being unable to know whether a given mathematical formula is a theorem or not (given a set of axioms and inference rules). It is possible to construct an effective enumeration of all theorems: start with the axioms, then the set of all formulas that can be deduced from combinations of axioms and the inference rules, then the set of all formulas that can be deduced from combinations of the formulas earlier listed and inference rules and so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can create a program P such that given a formula f as its input, it traverses the enumeration of all theorems and stops when it finds f (and, if f is not a theorem, it never stops as the enumeration is infinite). If we could decide whether P, given a certain formula, will halt, we would be able to know if a given formula is a theorem or not.

        Unfortunately, we are not.

        It is false to consider the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> as a major thorn in the side of those who would like to be able to use mathematics to prove whether or not a program is correct. This is done. Just like it is shown for many programs whether they halt. It is just impossible to generalize this to an algorithm or program which works on all programs.

        It has been speculated that the physical conditions in the universe under gravitational collapse could enable computation in this manner (exponentially decreasing time needed per computation), due to the contraction in space and increase in energy density.

        From: <a href="http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~dale/godel/godel.html#HaltingProblem,">http://www.math.hawaii.edu/~dale/godel/godel.html#HaltingProblem,</a> a page about <a href="GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem.html">GoedelsIncompletenessTheorem</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> Theorem. There is no program R(p,i) which for each program p and each input i, can determine "yes" or "no" if p halts on i.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proof.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Suppose there is such a program R(p,i).
        </li>
        <li>
           Let h be the program which on input p computes R(p,0), R(p,1), R (p,2), ... until it finds an i such that R(p,i) is "no".
        </li>
        <li>
           On finding such an i, it outputs i and halts.
        </li>
        <li>
           If there is no such i, it searches forever and doesn't halt.
        </li>
        <li>
           Now for any program p, we can decide whether or not p halts on all of its inputs:
          <ul>
            <li>
               p doesn't halt on all its inputs iff
            </li>
            <li>
               h does halt on input p iff
            </li>
            <li>
               R(h,p) is "yes".
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Contradiction: by the lemma above, this is undecidable.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        One should note that the proof above applies only to a <em>general purpose</em> halting prover. If the program to be decided (p) is restricted to be smaller than the prover (R), then R(R, <any input>) is not allowed. Note that the size of the prover (R) could be <em>much larger</em> than the largest program allowed (p).
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, consider a limited prover which determines whether any 16-byte program in 6502 assembly language will halt given less than 8 bytes of input i. It is conceivable that a small problem like this could be solved using a prover R which is much larger than 16 bytes. Indeed, one could imagine a 4-gigabyte prover program which could decide the halting problem for all 1024-byte sequences of 80386 code with up to 512 bytes of input. (I'm not volunteering to write it.)

        <dd><em>Why not just use a big lookup table?</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd><em>Because there are 2^8192 different 1024-byte sequences (if we agree that a byte consists of 8 bits). Considering that there are only about 10^80 atoms in the universe, it is just impossible to save all byte sequences, even if every atom in the universe could hold a googol bits. -- </em><a href="PhilipBusch.html">PhilipBusch</a><em></em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Another way around the problem is to create environments where programs always halt. (One could argue that some operating systems act this way in practice. :-) For instance, in a Java environment one could count bytecodes and halt after a certain number. The prover in this case is trivial (if the programs cannot alter the counter).
      </p>
      <p>
        Still another approach would be to create a compiler which rejects programs unless they are proven to terminate. Such a compiler may reject otherwise legal programs. One would build programs by making legal transformations which always guarantee the program will halt. (One rule might prevent altering a pointer unless one could guarantee that it did not cause a circular data structure. Alternately, a possibly-circular structure could only be traversed using algorithms which terminate.)
      </p>
      <p>
        In short, while it is not possible to write a <strong>completely</strong> general halting prover, it may be possible to write a prover for any finite interesting program. I suspect that <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a> theorists are still working on the related problem of ensuring that certain instruction sequences will complete within a certain time period. -- <a href="OpenAuthor.html">OpenAuthor</a> <em>Er, so the prover itself wouldn't qualify as a "finite interesting program"...?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Great clarification, thank you. But does this lend any hope to the prove-the-program-correct people? Their cause looks pretty bleak to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not so. It is possible to make a contribution without reaching a stated (or implied) goal. A quick web search for WeakestPrecondition seems to indicate that that approach to reasoning is valued in the cryptographic community at least.

      <hr/>
      <p>
        The fact that there are programs that cannot be proven to halt does not mean that people who want to prove programs correct are wrong. In general, the people who are trying to prove programs correct are not trying to take some random program and automatically prove things about it. Instead, they are <em>constructing</em> programs that they can prove things about. Programs should be understandable. If you can't prove that a program even halts then it is going to be hard to understand. Don't write programs like that!
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem with proving program correctness is that it is too much effort for too little benefit. The benefit varies, of course. There have been a few times in my life where it was worthwhile to prove some properties about a program, and I did it. But most of the time, it is not worth the time involved. -- <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Here's another way to think about it:
      </p>
      <p>
        Programs can be written that are equivalent to mathematical problems. For example, you could write a program that searches for a counter-example to Fermat's last theorem. If it finds one, it halts.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you had a tool that solves the halting problem for any program, it would automatically be able to solve all sorts of hard mathematics problems with no work. It's not reasonable to expect such a magical tool to exist, so we shouldn't be surprised that it doesn't.
      </p>
      <p>
        However does this say anything about the programs we actually write? Many of them aren't equivalent to tough mathematical problems. A program prover that works for many cases but sometimes says "I don't know" would still be quite useful. At least, it would focus our attention on the cases it can't prove.
      </p>

      <p>
        It seems to me that it might be useful to write a program that took a time-limit and had <em>three</em> return values:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The program provably halts
        </li>
        <li>
           The program provably loops forever
        </li>
        <li>
           It could not be determined either way with the resources allotted.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The third return value might also provide a means to continue the search (a continuation, in Scheme parlance).
      </p>
      <p>
        Really I don't think the complexity of the halt-detector is a concern so much as the time or memory that it uses. Here's my halt detector:
      </p>
      <p>
        Define such a thing as the "state" of the program under test, including the pointer that points to the next part of the program's input. Start the test-subject in its start state. Move the test-subject to its next state, repeatedly - but <em>remember all the states the test-subject has ever been in.</em> If the test-subject moves into a state it has been in before, then it will loop forever. If it terminates, then it will provably terminate. The concern is that the test-subject will just accumulate distinct states without ever terminating; then, your memory will run out! You can trade memory for time; you can, after all, calculate any state on demand, given the start state and the number of moves to take. But still, if the program can keep coming up with distinct states, it can out-run the halt detector.
      </p>
      <p>
        A human would be able to detect patterns in the states and perform induction upon them. What's hard is figuring out how to get the halt-detector to do that. Even if it does do it, it still falls prey to the original problem: somebody who knows what sequence patterns it <em>will</em> detect can make a sequence which follows a pattern it <em>won't</em> detect. Feeding the halt-detector a version of itself guarantees that this will occur.

        It isn't nescessary to know how to find a pattern, it's existence is enough. If such a pattern exists it is possible to create a proof enumerator which enumerates all possible proofs until it finds the right one describing te pattern and the induction upon it. It'll take some (lots of) time, but it <em>is</em> computable. -- <a href="AnonymousForPrivacyReasons.html">AnonymousForPrivacyReasons</a>

      <p>
        The previous solution gets considerably harder once you factor in the fact that the "verifier" should cope with more than a single input per program. What if it the program being verified could accept any length of input? By definition there is an infinite set of states. -- <a href="ArnonKlein.html">ArnonKlein</a>

        The way the problem has been classically defined, the particular input of the program is part of the question. In other words, we are not just asking if program X halts; we are asking if program X halts when given input Y. Whether the machine halts when given the same program but input Z is considered to be a separate question. -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a>

        LoopInvariants are a great help in writing all but the simplest loops.

        Similarly, StateInvariants are helpful in writing classes with non-trivial state. These can sometimes be checked at runtime using assertions to help in testing.

        But the most useful proof technique is abstraction, i.e. specifying <em>what</em> is required separately from <em>how</em> it is implemented. Abstraction is crucial to good class and subsystem design. <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>s are often stated in terms of abstractions of the components of the system.

        This is a common misunderstanding of the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> Theorem.
        The HPT does <em>not</em> mean that, given a particular program, it is impossible
        to prove that the program halts. Proving that a particular program halts
        can be arbitrarily difficult, but for any program that is understandable
        by a human being, it is usually trivial. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So there is actually no theoretical problem with the idea of proving programs
        correct. As a matter of fact, people are doing these things as we speak.

        Besides, a perfectly <em>correct</em> program needn't necessarily <em>halt</em>; consider a program that finds solutions for <a href="FermatsLastTheorem.html">FermatsLastTheorem</a> or simply think of the implementation of an endless loop.

          Usually* trivial. For example, the naive program that halts if there is an odd perfect number and keeps searching if there is not, is extremely simple. However, since it is not known whether or not there is an odd perfect number, it is also unknown whether or not the program halts. But the programmer will probably lose his funding after a few years of searching without results, so he'll close the program - it will halt.

        The real question with proving programs correct is not: Can I prove this program correct? But: Can I build <em>all interesting and useful programs</em> using only two things:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Things that we know about (they either halt, or they don't, and we know which - in other words, instructions), and

      </ul>
      <ul>

        It's actually fairly easy to set up systems using these two components; however, the programming exercise becomes a constant battle with the machine, trying to figure out how to express your ideas using only those constructs the machine will find acceptable.

        Yes, the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> is often misunderstood:
        Some years ago, I was working on a case tool project in the R&D division of a large multi-national company.
        They claimed that their case tool, and all the code it produced was "provably correct" because they added a counter to every loop, ensuring that it would terminate.
        Instead of...
      </p>
      <code>
        while (not eof(file)) {<br/>
        read;<br/>
        process;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        They'd do this:
      </p>
      <code>
        counter = 65535<br/>
        while (not eof(file) and counter-- > 0) {<br/>
        read;<br/>
        process;<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        As you can see, proving that their programs terminated was a trivial exercise:
        All loops had a fixed maximum number of iterations.
        (And they did no recursion.)
      </p>
      <p>
        However, in fact, their programs often crashed, often produced incorrect results, and the code they generated often didn't work.

      </p>
      <p>
        I am sure. The execution of any select statement can be implemented by constructing the set of all combinations of all tables mentioned in the FROM clause, removing those rows that do not fit the conditions specified in the WHERE clause (if present), applying the grouping rules specified in the GROUP BY clause (if present), filtering again by the conditions specified in the HAVING clause (if present), sorting this output according to the ORDER BY clause (if present), and then displaying results as specified in the SELECT clause. This is a program that executes in polynomial space and time, where the polynomial has the degree of the number of tables specified either directly in the FROM clause or mentioned in any way in any subquery.
      </p>
      <p>
        Every other basic type of SQL statement also can be implemented naively in polynomial. time. (Ideally, of course, your database finds a more efficient representation.)

           Nope! The important thing about computer programs is not bit-setting in variables, it's that they can do arbitrary (non-deterministic, potentially infinite) looping and/or recursion.

It is also the case that you can't have TuringEquivalence without such. As a comparatively minor side-issue, your assertion that SQL queries cannot run in polynomial time of their input is misleading to the point of being incorrect - they <strong>always</strong> run in polynomial time of their input, when input is defined to be both the query plus the database size. You presumably are thinking only of the query as input, but that is an erroneous approach; the result of such analysis is not helpful, whereas including database size as part of the input does yield a useful analysis.

        The "proof" of the halting problem given in section 2 of this page has a problem: 
        "program P that can tell you whether any program halts or not for given input data." and "program Q based on P which, if P says its input program doesn't halt, immediately halts, and if P says the program halts, goes into an infinite loop.* Feeding Q(Q) to P..."
      </p>
      <p>
        When you feed Q(Q) to P, P begins to execute Q(Q), which makes Q begin to execute P(Q), which makes P begin to execute Q, which makes P begin to execute with no input.

      <p>
        It seems to me that all you need to do is add one more line of code to program P that reads something like "If P has no input, output=ILLOGICAL PROGRAM, halt.

        [[What follows below is simply misunderstanding about the Halting Problem and the proof that it is undecidable. Instead of P and Q, below, let me use Halt for the alleged program (of one argument) that solves the Halting Problem, and Spoiler the program (of zero arguments) that shows that Halt cannot work. It is a plain and simple result that Spoiler will cause Halt to fail. That is unavoidable. If you want, you can take the text of Spoiler, and incorporate it into another program Halt1, which tests to see if its input is the program Spoiler. But that program Halt1 will have its own Spoiler1. There is, quite simply, no way to avoid this. It simply does not matter what sort of examination Halt makes of its input tape, or whatever. Spoiler takes Halt as given, and is constructed to make Halt fail. That's it. End of story.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nor are the attempted objections to the misunderstanding relevant. Even if Spoiler includes the text of Halt directly in some sense, Halt will not be able to exploit that fact. Spoiler is constructed by definition to make Halt fail, the proof that it does so is simple. There is no need to invoke an "obfuscated" version of Halt inside a virtual machine to thwart it. In fact, the problem of whether or not an obfuscated version of a program is equivalent to the original version is also undecidable (it is the problem of program equivalence), but this fact is proven by reducing the halting problem to the problem of program equivalence, not vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But ... there is apparently an even more basic misunderstanding which has to be addressed, because of the potential mechanics of Turing Machines and how they might be put together</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It was to clear up this misunderstanding that the argument about an "interpreter" was invoked below. Let's summarize it up here. It relies specifically on Turing Machine formulations of the problem. Halt is defined so that, on a tape that contains <em>nothing but a description of a 0-argument Turing Machine</em>, it runs and leaves a tape which contains only a 0 or a 1, depending on whether or not the given Turing Machine halts on an empty tape. (This is all without loss of generality, I think everyone can agree.). The alleged refutation relies on the fact that when Halt is run, it need not assume that the tape is empty except for its own input. The tape may contain some other markings that a containing program, such as Spoiler, has placed on the tape. It is alleged that by examining these markings, Halt can alter its output to get around the problem Spoiler presents it with. But this is quite simply false. This is where the "interpreter" comes into play (not to obfuscate, as I thought was being suggested, but) by <em>preventing the version of Halt contained within it from accessing anything outside what it would be able to access had it been started under normal conditions</em>. In fact, it is not Halt that is contained within Spoiler, but a lobotomized version of it that forces it to work only on the Halting Problem and not anything else weird involving going outside its own input. It may be objected that this is not fair, restricting Halt in this way, but of course it is totally fair, because there is no obligation to include Halt inside Spoiler. All that is required for the simple proof to go through is a program that is input-output equivalent to Halt <em>when it is started on as tape containing nothing but the program whose halting status it is supposed to ascertain</em>. An "interpreter" of some form may be required to do this (such as one that simulates that otherwise empty tape, even while the program doing the simulation writes other stuff on the "real" tape). But the key is that the modified Halt, contained as a subroutine in Spoiler, is input-output equivalent to the original Halt on the actual problem that was given to the original Halt. It is irrelevant that it is not input-output equivalent on some other strange problem.]]

           Well said, that's right on target. On the last point, though, it's worth noting that there are many, many different ways of proving that program equivalence is undecidable, and equivalently, that there are an infinite number of algorithms/functions/machines that compute any given thing, not just the proofs that depend on the halting problem as a lemma. One of the more startling ones is the Speedup Theorem: there is no such thing as the fastest program; there's an infinite series of programs, each a bit faster than the previous, yet all computing the same thing. But yes, in any case, that result demonstrates that you cannot hope to simply recognize which machine is input, since there are an infinite number of variations on the same theme. -- Doug

And I'm to take it on faith that, both without assuming the antecedent of non-recursive halting (which, being the fundament of so many such proofs, I rather suspect is after all assumed, but will let it go), you can demonstrate the undecidability of program equivalence, and the uncrackability of I.

        [[Uh, no. There is no need to be concerned with the undecidability of program equivalence here. There is no need for "uncrackable" anything, whatever that means, and certainly the version of Halt used by Spoiler (Halt') is more than "any source that expresses the same function" as Halt (how would one find such a thing if not as a provably equivalent minor modification of Halt itself?) It is in fact essentially Halt, but Halt restricted to run on a tape that it was required to be designed for. Note that Halt must be able to run on a tape that starts with nothing on it but a representation of the program it is required to test. It may contain some extra code to look elsewhere on that tape in order to see if it is "being tricked", however, it must be able to solve the Halting Problem without applying that code, in the circumstance that it is started normally on a tape containing only its own input. It is thus a simple matter for Spoiler to take the tuples defining Halt, and alter them so in effect they are running on a virtual tape/head combination, instead of the real tape/head (which is simulating them), and, most importantly, deliver the same answer as would be delivered by Halt running on the real tape/head combination, which, by the claim of its author, has input/output behaviour defining the Halting Problem, and which is the minimum anyone claiming to solve the Halting Problem must be able to provide. Given this using of the simulated Halt, which has input/output behavior equivalent to the original Halt, it is the usual simple proof to show that Halt applied to Spoiler cannot deliver a consistent result.

        You know, computability theory is a highly developed and very interesting discipline. Do you really think you have found some problem at the very basis of it that renders all of the deep and complex results (such as those describing the highly complex structure of the recursively enumerable degrees) somehow flawed? Perhaps you should have a little less hubris. I see this has all been explained before, below, although perhaps the explanation that stays at a more concrete level (keeping always in mind that we are dealing with concrete Turing Machines, not lisp machines, abstract environments and interpreters not directly reduced to Turing Machines, etc) may be more helpful. But maybe nothing is helpful for a troll?]]

        Brand new semi-humorous argument: my machine P is both a <a href="GeneralHaltingProblem.html">GeneralHaltingProblem</a> solver and also good at inferring the intent of its input. When invoked as Q's inner loop, P will examine its input (source of Q) and immediately realize that it (P) is being used in a misguided attempt to prove that it (P) cannot actually exist. It (P as Q's inner loop) will consequently print "0" - causing Q to halt - while simultaneously adding states to its (Q's) FSM which, when inspected by the outer invocation (P), explain the subterfuge, permitting it - the outer invocation of P - to assert the correct halting value. Which is, correctly, "1".

      <ul>
        <li>
           Ah, but P doesn't act non-deterministically; it merely inspects all the contents of the tape - including its own outer invocation. This is to say, the way it makes its distinction about whether to print a subterfugal "0" is to see all the universal-turing-machine gear, the source of its own outer invocation, and so on. It's all there on the tape, and in finite form, so it's easy for it to do deterministically.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Well, you assume that it is easy for your program P to determine the context in which it is invoked, but that ain't the case. To make it more clear, let's put it first in Scheme, then in pure lambda calculus:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        ;assume we have a program p<br/>
        ;without side-effects, in Scheme<br/>
        (define p (lambda (x) <strong><body-of-p></strong>))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ; and p solves the halting question for a program x returning<br/>
        ; true if (x) halts and false otherwise.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ; then we define the program q<br/>
        (define (q) ( if (p q)<br/>
        (loop-forever)<br/>
        #t))<br/>
        ; and if p doesn't have side-effects (it is purely functional)<br/>
        ; then (p q) should yield the same result in all context,<br/>
        ; and it is easy to see that<br/>
        ; (p q) = true <strong>implies</strong> q loops forever<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ; Now the inventive Peter, will protest that q has access to an environment<br/>
        ;(which makes the recursive invocation (p q) possible, so then if p has access to the<br/>
        ; environment than p can distinguish the places of invocation<br/>
        ; therefore the only technical trick to be done is to de-recursify q,<br/>
        ; remove all access to the environment while keeping it a program equivalent with the above,<br/>
        ; To do that we use a fixed-point combinator like the U<br/>
        ; <a href="http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/fixed-point-combinators.html">http://okmij.org/ftp/Computation/fixed-point-combinators.html</a><br/>
        (define U (lambda (f) (f f)))<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        ; we can then define q as<br/>
        (define q (U<br/>
        (lambda (f) (if (p f)<br/>
        ((lambda (x) (x x))(lambda (x) (x x)));loop forever<br/>
        #t))))<br/>
        ; now we eliminated the recursion while keeping q the same<br/>
        ; let's inline the lambda expression for U and p<br/>
        ; let's inline the lambda expression for U and p<br/>
        (define q ((lambda (f) (f f))<br/>
        (lambda (f) (<br/>
        if (<br/>
        (lambda (x) <strong><body-of-p></strong>) ;p actually, applied to<br/>
        (f f))                        ; applied to (f f), which is actually a stand-in for q,<br/>
        ; then<br/>
        ((lambda (x) (x x))(lambda (x) (x x)));loop forever<br/>
        ; else<br/>

        ;therefore if <body-of-p> exists with the above property, <br/>
        ;there exists the lambda expression denoted by q<br/>
        ;and evaluating<br/>

        ((lambda (x) (x x))(lambda (x) (x x)))<br/>
        #t))))<br/>
        ;we reach the conclusion that <strong>body-of-p</strong> cannot<br/>
        ;exist with the specified properties<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Now, because in pure lambda calculus a program is simply evaluated (or technically reduced according to the rules) and doesn't have any kind of access to any environment, inspecting the stack, etc., it is a basic property that if (f a) "terminates" it always yields the "same" result (modulo renaming, etc.). Then constructing the above lambda expression, if it evaluates to "true" ( known as (lambda (x y) x) in lambda calculus), it follows that it doesn't evaluate at all. So that's it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
          Because of the restriction of lambda calculus it is thus less appealing to claim that <strong><body-of-p></strong> can detect the context in which it is evaluated (there's simply no such mechanism in the lambda calculus formalism), so if p cannot exist in lambda calculus, p cannot exist inside a TM (unless you want to disprove the equivalence between LC and TM).

           Actually, I've been told by reliable sources that TM and LC are really computationally equivalent :) While you certainly have not produced code for your P. Let's call your P, P_TM. I produced a mapping from an P_LC to a Q_LC that proves that P_LC cannot exist. This strongly suggest that your P_TM does not exist, lest the widely held conviction about the equivalence between TM and LC is wrong. So somebody needs to dig a reference to Turing's proof about the equivalence between LC and TM and verify that, but I rather suspect it's just a matter of technique, cause it's obvious to me how to implement a TM in a purely functional Scheme (and consequently in LC). The less obvious is implementing a LC interpreter in TM, but in the end we'll implement somehow some assembly language primitive in TM, and use it to emulate x86 assembly, and then existing interpreters for Scheme are good enough to show that LC can be encoded inside the TM universe.

           <em>I had heard that somewhere, yes :) But the gap in the TM frame I drove my truck through is that nothing prevents P or Q from examining and modifying any and all of the tape. I had thought of self-refuting by showing that the inner P couldn't count on the Q code dwelling within a finite distance on the tape ... but of course then that would go for Q not being to get at P too. You adroitly spotted the whole in my hole and have ably plugged it for Post. Basically, P </em>'can't<em>' be permitted to figure out that it's testing itself. As far as I can see, nothing in the Turing UTM construction prevents this, so that's that for him. Worth noting that a C-machine could always receive signals via sensors that would permit it to know that it was testing itself - reviving the A-irrelevance claim on CASP ...</em>

            <li>
               Let's say you were correct about this ("P <strong>can't</strong> be permitted to figure out that it's testing itself"), for the sake of argument. The <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>, however, is about figuring out whether any and all programs halt -- it was never claimed that it can't be solved for <strong>some</strong> programs. So say you've got a program P, which, if allowed to figure out it is testing itself, can solve the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> when given itself as input: P(P). Ok. Now take modified program P' which cannot test to see whether it tests itself. You appear to agree that P'(P') fails to solve the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>. But then your other program, P, will fail to resolve the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> when given P(P'(P')) - and P' is not P, so the notion of seeing whether it is testing itself or not is of no help in any case. -- Doug

           Peter was onto something, because the construction of Q in "popularization of science" books was rather <strong>informal</strong> (along the lines Q invokes P and then takes the opposite decision (to halt or not to halt). This is rather sloppy, because for a particular program P the construction of Q fails to provide the counter-example. Imagine if we're inside Java (and I saw Java and C based sketches of the proof that fail to consider this), and Q invokes P and then P tests to see if the stack depth is greater than 1 and it does the trick suggested by Peter if so. That means the sketch of a proof <strong>fails</strong> to give a correct algorithm for deriving Q from P.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           But then the trivial technical trick that solves the problem in the naive construction of Q. Rather then calling P directly, Q constructs a Java (or C, or Scheme, or TM, etc.) <strong>interpreter</strong>, and thus runs P inside the interpreter, for which purpose now P can see that it's running top-level. So now the inner instance of P cannot do the trick, and thus the outer instance is condemned to fail to decide correctly the outcome of Q. Thus the pseudo-code for q becomes
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        (define q (if (scheme_interpreter '(p q))<br/>
        (loop-forever)<br/>
        #t))<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <ul>
        <li>
           And therefore now there is no programmer distinguishable difference between the outer top level (p q) and the inner (p q). Sorry, Peter, now the Nobel has to wait a little bit. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>As I said to Doug, I don't buy this in the TM construction; P can always drop down to the tape and analyze it bit by bit to figure out what the whole of Q is doing. LC prevents this exformally, so closes the barn door before the horse has bolted.</em> -- Pete
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Again, the inner instance of (p q) is run inside an interpreter. So it cannot analyze the "whole tape" that is really running the show, but only the virtual tape that it is offered to it by the interpreter. And then no matter what decision it takes, with the sole condition that it is deterministic, even if P has the knowledge that it's analyzing exactly the Q that he knows in advance, Q will take the opposite decision, and P is in a lose-lose situation. The only way P could try to avoid the defeat was if it could distinguish the situation when it's running inside Q or when it's being run from the "top-level" (so to speak). But then Q by running P inside an interpreter made the two situations undistinguishable. So whatever decision you take, even knowing in advance the Q that I'm going to write, you're doomed to give bad results. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As a proof of that, given the generation of the Q above (it really should eb a Scheme macro, but you get the drill) try to write a program P that decides not the halting of all programs, but just of the program Q that will be derived from P itself. You won't be able to write it. Because if you return "TRUE" you'll return TRUE both from the top level and from inside Q, and then my Q will not halt. And if you return false, my Q will halt. Replace a Scheme interpreter written in Scheme with a TM interpreter written in TM and you get the same effect. -- Costin

        Ahem, I beg to differ, Pete. If we restrict the discussion to a purely functional subset of Scheme, then such interpreters of a functional subset of Scheme are written by students around the globe all the time. That they cannot be "broken" follows trivially from the semantic of Scheme: if all the primitives (car,cdr, define, let, if` etc) are deterministic, and all the composition constructs are deterministic, it follows by structural induction that all constructed procedures are deterministic so that evaluating the same expression in any correctly implemented interpreter will always yield the same result.

        Keep in mind that Turing's original machines are far from the only model of computation ever studied. Machines with oracles are non-deterministic, for instance, and there are also randomized machines, which do indeed have different performance. For instance, the computational complexity of some algorithms depends on whether the Extended Riemann Hypothesis is true, which no one knows is true or not - however, such algorithms can typically be converted into the faster computational class simply by using randomness, which doesn't exist in the original Turing machines. It's a pretty big topic, and <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>s are simply a <strong>starting place</strong>. -- Doug

        The most fundamental plank of <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> is the General <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>. Unfortunately there appears to be a problem with the GHP, as follows:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I have here the code for a program, P, that can tell you whether any program halts or not for given input data.
        </li>
        <li>
           I construct a program Q based on P which, if P says its input program doesn't halt, immediately halts, and if P says the program halts, goes into an infinite loop.
        </li>
        <li>
           Feeding Q(Q) to P I can see that if P says it halts, it won't, and if P says it doesn't halt, it will.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore,</strong> 
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have any such program P and anyone else who says they do is full of it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>But:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>If I don't have any such program P then there's no way I can construct the derivative work Q.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Since the proof of P's non-existence requires me to feed Q(Q) to P, which I can't do without Q, then I can't prove P's non-existence. In effect, the proof is subject to a subtle </em><a href="AntecedentAssumedFallacy.html">AntecedentAssumedFallacy</a>.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>

        I can't quite tell whether this is a joke or not. Assuming it's serious (<a href="DeleteMe.html">DeleteMe</a> if it's just a joke): There is no fallacy. Here's one way to adjust the proof that may make it clearer that there is no fallacy.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Consider <em>any</em> program P. It needn't be a halting tester.
        </li>
        <li>
           Define a new program Q, which passes itself as input to P, runs P, and (a) returns immediately if P returns 0, (b) goes into an infinite loop if P returns 1, and (c) does anything you like if P doesn't halt or doesn't return a single value that's either 0 or 1.
        </li>
        <li>
           Observe, trivially, that if you feed Q to P then P doesn't return 0 if Q fails to halt and doesn't return 1 if Q halts.
          <ul>
            <li>
               <em>Um, did you mean to feed Q to Q? Obviously if P is </em>'any<em>' program it is free to do act however it likes, including returning 0 if Q fails to halt, and returning 1 if Q halts - right?</em> Nope, I meant what I said. See below.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Now consider the statement "For any inputless program R, feeding R into P yields 1 if R halts and 0 if it doesn't".
        </li>
        <li>
           That statement is false, because what it asserts of all inputless programs isn't true for the particular inputless program Q.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Hence, we've shown that no program P can be a halting tester in the precise sense described by that statement. And we haven't had to assume that any program is a halting tester in order to do it. We started with any candidate program, and produced a new program for which it doesn't give the right answer. -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a>

      <code>
        # ALLEGED_TESTER is a function which accepts a single argument.<br/>
        # We return a new function F that proves that ALLEGED_TESTER isn't<br/>
        # a perfect termination tester: in other words, either F terminates<br/>
        # and ALLEGED_TESTER(F) doesn't return 1, or else F doesn't terminate<br/>
        # and ALLEGED_TESTER(F) doesn't return 0.<br/>

        Proving the assertions in the comments there is easy. If ALLEGED_TESTER(F) returns 1 then F loops for ever. If ALLEGED_TESTER(F) returns something other than 1 then F doesn't loop for ever.

      <p>
        Briefly, to know if Q halts, you need to know its input.
        Its input is Q, but to know if that Q halts, you need to know its input.
        So, you're really testing this:
      </p>
      <code>
        Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q(Q( ... ))))))))))))))))))))))))<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Where there's an infinite number of Qs.
      </p>
      <p>
        The definition of the thing you wish to run doesn't halt, so you can never get to the point of running it.

        No, what you input to Q is the "source code" of Q, so no need to get all recursive here.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No, there's no way to know if a program will halt or not unless you know the input. Consider this program: { if input = "halt" then halt else loop_forever } Now, does it halt or run forever? You can't know if it halts unless you know if the input is "halt".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So, to evaluate if Q halts, you have to know its input halts. That input would be Q, so...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, but the input to Q is not the result of executing Q, it's nothing at all. Here's a slightly reworded definition that makes that a little clearer:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           program P(source, input) = { if source_code_will_terminate(source, input) then return 'halts' else return 'loops' }
        </li>
        <li>
           program Q() = { execute P with (source = source of Q, input = null); if result is 'halts' then infinite_loop }
        </li>
        <li>
           The call to P inside Q is trying to work out if running Q with no input data will halt or not.
        </li>
        <li>
           Therefore running Q with no input data will halt if running Q with no input data doesn't halt, and loop if running Q with no input data halts. This is clearly a paradox.
        </li>
        <li>
           The only way to resolve this paradox is to assert that source_code_will_terminate doesn't know what the hell it is talking about.

      <p>
        I think the problem might be relating to the definition of 'input'. I'd say that, although there is no explicit input to 'Q()' (according to the signature), there is an <em>implicit</em> input, in the form of the call to 'P' ('Q' <em>asks</em> for input from 'P'). With that call, 'P' ends up having to analyse itself with the associate input of 'Q'... and now we've got a problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        As an aside, there would seem to be no reason that 'Q' couldn't detect the situation, that it has processed itself multiple times, or even processed itself at all, and therefore respond to the question with a question, so to speak: "Does 'Q' halt? I don't know... do you want it to halt?"

        <em>"Does 'Q' halt? I don't know..."</em> Well if 'P' doesn't know then it isn't solving the halting problem. If you ask the question "does this program halts?" and for some programs like 'Q' you are forced to answer something else than 'yes' or 'no', then Turing is right: you cannot write a program which can answer that question with a 'yes' or 'no' for any given input program. -- Samuel Gélineau

        To break down what I see as the problem here, at least on the top part of the page, the proof is this: "<em>Even if</em> you had a halting predictor, you don't have a halting predictor. I can do this for all putative halting predicters." To put something else in that form, "Even if you think you have an integer that is greater then all others, I can prove that your integer isn't greater then all others (by simply adding 1 to yours). I can do this for all putative largest integers."
      </p>
      <p>
        Your inability to produce the integer that is greater then all others isn't a problem.

        Assuming that a program could be defined which can recognize itself as input:
      </p>
      <p>
        From any halting detector, you can provide a program which halts or not based on the opposite of the decision of that detector.
      </p>
      <p>
        And for any such program you provide me which does that, I can provide a program which can detect trickery of that specific nature.

        We can't solve the halting problem in general, but we can get as close as we'd like.

        Why need a "Halting Predictor" to prove the point...
      </p>
      <p>
        How about "Is it possible to predict the output of the function f(int i){return i;}"? The function takes an int (let's say only 0 or 1) and spits it out. It is not possible to tell exactly what it spits out, whether a 0 or a 1 (without knowing the input). Doesn't this qualify as a "proof" that it is not possible to predict the output?
        If NO (it doesn't qualify), then how different is the "Halting Problem" from this one other than to disguise the input and output in some fancy programmer's formalism?
        -- Mohyneen Mehdi
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        You don't necessarily need something fancier, but you do need to consider all possibilities one way or another. You're basically assuming the result you want to prove; that's why this is not a proof.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Maybe I am missing something or maybe I am not, but I can't give in to the "circular reasoning" that lurks in the proof of the Halting Problem.
        In standard English, the solution goes like this... P has the task of predicting Q's output (or behavior). But Q has the final say in the matter and waits till P makes its prediction, after which Q conveniently adapts its behavior only to violate that prediction.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, as I see it, P has to look at "Q AND Q's Input" in order to predict its behavior (or output). But Q's INPUT is P's OUTPUT. So, effectively, P has to look at "Q AND P's OUTPUT".
        But P's OUTPUT is obtained only by looking at "Q AND Q's Input". Back to square one! 
        It's important to understand that by Q's INPUT I don't mean Q's parameter values; I mean information that Q eventually uses to behave the way it does.
      </p>
      <p>
        P needs information which is obtained from Q, who in turn needs the "same" information from P.
        But according to the proof, that information is generated on the fly and P is given the credit (or discredit) for generating it. That information (i.e the prediction P makes) couldn't have been generated because P doesn't know Q's complete Input information, information which can come only AFTER P makes it's prediction (i.e the prediction itself). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Where exactly am I going wrong?
        -- Mohyneen Mehdi
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's how I see it: Q's input doesn't have to be a precalculated boolean value equal to P's output. P is supposed to (among other things) look at its own source code and figure out for himself what P's output is supposed to be. If P wants to execute this code in order to find out then P will loop forever, won't ever give an answer for this particular program, and cannot solve the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> in general. If P chooses to guess Q's input without executing its own source code, then whatever his guess will be he will give a wrong final answer about Q, so P still isn't solving the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a> in all cases. -- Samuel Gélineau

        The same sorts of confusion have led many people to claim that <a href="QuineProgram.html">QuineProgram</a>s are impossible, when clearly several do exist.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, a few of the "proofs" of <a href="FreeWill.html">FreeWill</a> seem to be based on the same confusion.

      <p>
        <em>P needs information which is obtained from Q, who in turn needs the "same" information from P.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, sort of. When P runs, it <em>inspects the source code for Q</em>, and also <em>inspects the input that will be fed to Q</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that P does not actually call() or eval() or execute Q. (Although the sorts of analysis it does are probably very similar to the sorts of analysis that go on when the compiler compiles and partially evaluates Q when we later compile Q).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But according to the proof, that information is generated on the fly and P is given the credit (or discredit) for generating it.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes, exactly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That information (i.e the prediction P makes) couldn't have been generated because P doesn't know Q's complete Input information, information which can come only AFTER P makes it's prediction (i.e the prediction itself).</em>

        I think you're very close to understanding the <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this case, P *does* know Q's complete input information. Tell me the source code to P (long before you ever *compile* P), and I can tell you the long string that makes up Q's complete input information. It is, in fact, the source code to Q (which includes a copy of the source code to P that you gave me).
      </p>
      <p>
        Say I want to know whether this function halts (i.e., whether it is an algorithm), and if so what value it returns:
      </p>
      <code>
        int count_apples(){<br/>
        int left = count_apples_on_left();<br/>
        int right = count_apples_on_right();<br/>
        return( left + right );<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        By "input", we normally mean input from *outside* the computer. The value returned by count_apples_on_left() does *not* count as "input". I inspect that function and see that it calculates a value without any input from *outside* the computer. Say I run count_apples_on_left() once and it returns "17". I can be confident that it will return "17" every time I or anyone else runs that subroutine. Right?
      </p>
      <p>
        So, what does count_apples() return? Or does it never halt?
      </p>
      <p>
        I inspect count_apples_on_right(), and I see that it reads in 2 characters from standard input. Those 2 characters count as "input", not just to count_apples_on_right(), but to any program that calls it (such as count_apples() ), and to any program that indirectly calls it (perhaps by calling count_apples() ).
      </p>
      <p>
        If I know what those 2 characters will be, do I have any hope of figuring out the output of count_apples()?

        For halting property, there are three kind of program.

      <ul>
        <li>
           Program that always halts.
        </li>

           Program that always does not halt.
        </li>
        <li>
           Program that halts on some input and not on other. Let's called it "Conditionally halt"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Halting problem states that (I took this from first line in <a href="HaltingProblem.html">HaltingProblem</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        "It is impossible to write a program that runs in finite time that is able to decide whether an arbitrary program will halt (<strong>with a certain input</strong>)."
      </p>
      <p>
        Let 
        P be the halt tester program, and
        Q be the program that will be feed to P, and go in infinite if P return "Q will halt", and halt if P says "Q never halts"
      </p>

        Now the statement <strong>With a certain input</strong> is where the flawed is.

        <em>Which is more faithful to the original formulation of the halting problem where P had to have 2 arguments (P X I) where X is the program and I is the input. But this later arrangement, while valid, makes it less intuitive, as the reader is distracted by the artifice of using Q both as program and input, and by the role of the dummy variable X in the body of Q. So reducing the problem to programs with empty input, makes the intuition much more accessible. So we prove that we cannot even construct a program that decides the termination of all programs with an empty input.</em>

The weakest such area is the Church-Turing Hypothesis, which amounts to the notion that anything that is computable can be computed via Turing machines, and this is simply a hypothesis because it doesn't formalize the definition of "computable" in a non-circular way, so it remains possible that someday someone will come up with a new notion of "computable" that fits everyone's intuitions, and yet is larger than the class of functions that <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>s can handle.

           FPGAs are no different than any other electronic circuit, in that they can be simulated by a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>.

Some other page talks about open versus closed systems and claims that FPGAs are more powerful than <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>s because they are open systems interfacing with the outside world, but that's a complete red herring.

           Inteferometry (and various other optical computation devices, like the Hughes light valve, or indeed simply using lenses to compute Fourier transforms) is interesting because we can use it to achieve high levels of parallelism. However, this doesn't have much to do with the fundamentals of mathematical complexity analysis. Turing machines take exponential time for many problems that von Neumann machines such as the Pentium do not, but this is not because of a gaping defect in math, it's because that kind of Turing Machine is simpler to analyze.

           <em>We're talking about computability, not complexity. Pentiums are as as tightly bound by Turing complexity results as any other VNA; they just trade off time for space as per usual.</em>

           There are variants that do not have that exponential behavior, but then the math is more tedious. Similarly there are Turing Machine variants that can compute exactly the same problem as does interferometry, and with the same time bounds, so long as one limits the problem to something physically realizable: a small finite problem computed in a small finite time. Interferometry only becomes "magical" in the unrealizable limit of infinite wavelengths, infinite lens apertures (see the fundamental theorem of Fourier optics for why that matters), non-quantized purely wavelike light, non-analytic functions of the optical wavefront, etc.

           However, if you insist on more computational power, like being able to match indefinitely nested parenthesis, then you have to move up the hierarchy. It's not intuitive, but a machine that has just an ACCEPT state (showing it accepted the input string as being an acceptable match to the grammar) can be <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a>, yet if you add a REJECT state (indicating that it has definitely rejected the input string), then in general the latter cannot be <a href="TuringEquivalent.html">TuringEquivalent</a>!

This is not a trifling matter of terminology about states, it's about whether the computation time is bounded, and you can't define that away by labelling one state as "halt" or as "runs forever" - that actually is irrelevant to the problem (which is in fact always true of word definitions in math).
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>It's not a trifling matter if you trouble yourself to consider it seriously for a moment. A "universal" state can be defined by any recursively enumerable trajectory over any recognizable pattern on the tape. Consequently, a "halt" state can be defined to match any "noncomputable" behavior of the machine. The program that produces the "noncomputable" behavior will itself serve as an adequate exformal definition of this state. If one could get rid of this exformation - if one could, for example, show that only a limited set of entirely computable behaviors can serve to signify halt states - you could distinguish between a "noncomputable" behavior and a halt state. But the </em><a href="BurdenOfProof.html">BurdenOfProof</a> remains on the Turing fans to establish this.<em></em>

      <ul>
        <li>
           The converse may be more clear: if a machine is guaranteed to complete its calculation in a finitely bounded time, it cannot compute total recursive functions. You would not like a programming language that enforced that, you really wouldn't. In such a language, you wouldn't be able to e.g. have conditionals change program flow. No non-trivial conditional recursion nor looping.

           <em>The hell I wouldn't. ESOPs [Exclusive-or Sum Of Products] are my bread and butter. Constant time and don't spare the transistors.

          <ul>
            <li>
               You're in trouble immediately. A large percentage of real world problems suffer a combinatorial explosion such that insisting on constant time will lead to a requirement for an exponential numberr of gates, and not only is that impractical for all but small problem sizes, communication delays rapidly become a dominating issue even if you try to push the limits a little. 
            </li>
            <li>
               <em>I'm well aware of combinatorial intractability. There are two exformal operations necessary to dispense with it. The first is that the bits represented by your computer must represent the most significant empirical distinctions on the signal under interpretation. The second is that the remaining state required for your computation is represented by the source of signal itself, not by your computer. </em><a href="SaulAmarel.html">SaulAmarel</a> described one example of such reformulation with his <a href="CannibalsAndMissionaries.html">CannibalsAndMissionaries</a>. But reformulation of a general class of problems remains an area of active research.<em> </em>

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           For instance, even just modelling a full 32x32 multiply tends to cause an exponential explosion, e.g. using BDD's, a problem that was only worked around relatively recently, and there are many related problems where extended BDD's still show exponential explosion in gates. An obvious example is factoring integers. This is potentially solvable as a satisfaction problem over boolean operators on boolean variables, e.g. each bit of the input and output being a boolean variable. But exponential explosion means this is unrealizable except on the tiniest of problems, whereas my little program with looping and conditionals can solve vastly larger factoring problems.

           <em>I don't question that these problems, as formulated, are not amenable to constant time computation. I question whether any of the number systems and operations on them you mention are actually the most efficient way to deal with empirical classification and transformation - which is exformal to any computational intent.</em>

           The proof is via diagonalization, as pioneered by Cantor for proving the existence of higher orders of infinity. This is not a matter of common sense. :-)
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>At last we agree on something. </em>ThereIsNoInfinity, so Cantor is just as worthless as Turing. More worthless - he's wasting more brainspace in otherwise useful minds.<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               But I don't agree. There are no infinities that we know of in the physical universe, but infinity is critically important to mathematics. Diagonalization, and different orders of infinity, are important even for so simple a thing as demonstrating the existence of real numbers as opposed to rationals.

               <em>Yes, there are no real numbers in reality. Even Turing says they're not computable. Ask yourself then, why do we take them seriously? Answer: because </em>LimitTheory depends on them. Standard and non-standard analysis depend on 'em. They are conventional to the vast bulk of modern mathematics. So there's a really wonderful AdPopulam argument for their necessity.

           There's no escaping this; it's been extremely thoroughly explored by people who share your tastes, and mathematically, you're stuck with it. Math in general just fails without it. And no one ever claimed it applied to the real world.

           <em>I'd like to agree with you on this, but unfortunately reals and complex and surreal etc. numbers are used, without questioning their provenance, throughout theoretical physics. </em>LimitTheory is accepted without question by vast numbers of physicists.

           This is not a question of personal opinion and taste and philosophy, this is a question of studying existing mathematical theory and history and understanding why all attempts to topple this inevitably failed.

           The tricky part of this is probably simply that people tend to say "well, if it doesn't exist in the real world, then I can safely reject it in math, too". But this is false. The ancient greeks discovered irrational numbers -- the hypotenuse of a triangle in general has an irrational length, so if you want to solve real world problems, the best way is to allow irrational numbers as a useful abstraction, even if they don't exist in the real world.

           Similarly with negative numbers. For a long time (millennia), they were either not conceived as "numbers", or else philosophically rejected as "numbers". But they are a great way to model, e.g., debt in the real world.

           Infinity and infinitesimals have often been rejected as physically unrealistic - but they are often the best model. Models of computation, such as Turing Machines, are sometimes rejected by people's intuition, and yet they are sometimes the best model. It doesn't matter worth a damn what someone's personal intuition is; this space has been thoroughly explored long since by people much smarter and more expert than you and I, on <strong>both</strong> sides of the issue, and it's long since been settled.

           I'm not sure what <strong>you</strong> think you're arguing there, but it is in fact true that <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>s <strong>cannot</strong> compute pi. Does that help? Transcendental numbers are not computable. It's quite parallel to the way that you yourself cannot compute pi on paper, you can only compute a series of rational approximations - although you have the advantage of being able to reason about the existence of a limit if that series can be proven to converge. The latter activity happens in a larger system than does the computation of the series of rationals.

           <em>I spoke of computing the digits of pi. These digits are obviously Turing-computable and, just as obviously, their limit is not. Similarly, the digital expansion of rational numbers like 1.00000000000000000[etc] is not Turing-computable. I fail to understand the relevance of this to the utility of the approximations of intermediary terms of expansion. These approximations are all that we will ever get from any physically realizable machine.</em>

        There is no spoon. Intuitionistically speaking, all programs that cannot be inductively proven to terminate are illegal. For reactive systems, use coinduction proofs and replace termination with progress. Are there any interesting programs left?
