        Wiki Is Not Your Notebook
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em></em>'A<em>' wiki can be your notebook, or your blog, or whatever you can dream up, but please don't use </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a><em> for that purpose.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        We all have things we think are worth keeping a note of, possibly in some kind of <a href="LogBook.html">LogBook</a>, or maybe instructions for using a piece of software, or other <em>aide-memoire</em>s. Wiki seems like the obvious resource to store your jottings in - but it is not. Creating pages that are of little value to anyone in the community bar yourself is abuse of the facility that the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a>'s host, <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>,  has provided us with. If you simply <em>have</em> to have personal notes here, please keep them on your <a href="HomePage.html">HomePage</a>. You can do what you like there. If you need more space, why not set up a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a>? It's easy, fun and useful.
      </p>

        A <a href="ProgrammersNotebook.html">ProgrammersNotebook</a> is a valuable tool, and <a href="WikiAsProgrammersNotebook.html">WikiAsProgrammersNotebook</a> works well for many. <a href="StevenNewton.html">StevenNewton</a>, for example, created a <a href="PersonalWiki.html">PersonalWiki</a> and has gained a lot of value from keeping random thoughts, things to remember, and his little tidbits of insight together in a searchable, linkable, <em>private</em> form.
