        Irreducible Complexity Entity Model
      </h1>
      <p>
        I am not sure that the name Irreducible Complexity Entity Model actually fits what I am about to describe, but it was the best name I could think of: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Lets think of an <a href="EntityModel.html">EntityModel</a> (DatabaseModel?, <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>?) that has at least one instance of each kind of entity relationship, so that it becomes representative of pretty much anything that can happen at any database: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So we would have: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           TableA One To One TableB
        </li>
        <li>
           TableB One To Many TableC 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But then, lets remember that there are recursive relationships so the list now is: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to the same table
        </li>
        <li>
           A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to another table
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to the same table
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to another table 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        So now we have: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           TableA <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> TableA
        </li>
        <li>
           TableA <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> TableB
        </li>
        <li>
           TableB OneToMany TableB
        </li>
        <li>
           TableB OneToMany TableC 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But then we realize that is not representative of all cases, because there is another kind of relationship, one that is “complex” (formed by 2 of the “simple” ones described before: Many To Many)  so:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to the same table
        </li>
        <li>
           A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to another table
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to the same table
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to another table 
        </li>
        <li>
           A ManyToMany relationship to the same table
        </li>
        <li>
           A ManyToMany relationship to another table 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And now we have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           TableA <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> TableA
        </li>
        <li>
           TableA <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> TableB
        </li>
        <li>
           TableB OneToMany TableB
        </li>
        <li>
           TableB OneToMany TableC 
        </li>
        <li>
           TableC ManyToMany to TableC (using TableCC as intermediate)
        </li>
        <li>
           TableC ManyToMany to TableD (using TableCD as intermediate)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Now, with at this point one would think that we have a representative case for each “conceptual” kind of entity relationship. Right? After all ObjectRelationalMappers offer a way to map relationships for their <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> counterparts, and the only kinds of relationships that are supported by them when going from the database to the object model are:  <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a>, OneToMany and ManyToMany. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, it turns out that if we leave the relational world enter object orientation, then "Inheritance" enters the game, so I guess this <a href="IrreducibleComplexityEntityModel.html">IrreducibleComplexityEntityModel</a> has to include "InheritsFrom" as a relationship type (note that InheritsFrom is the only kind of relationship that can not be used in "reflective" way):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to the same class
        </li>
        <li>
           A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to another class
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to the same class
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to another class
        </li>
        <li>
           A ManyToMany relationship to the same class
        </li>
        <li>
           A ManyToMany relationship to another class
        </li>
        <li>
           A InheritsFrom relationship to another class
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And so we get:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Composition
          <ul>
            <li>
               ClassA <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> ClassA
            </li>
            <li>
               ClassA <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> ClassB
            </li>
            <li>
               ClassB OneToMany ClassB
            </li>
            <li>
               ClassB OneToMany ClassC 
            </li>
            <li>
               ClassC ManyToMany to ClassC 
            </li>
            <li>
               ClassC ManyToMany to ClassD 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Inheritance
          <ul>
            <li>
               ClassD InheritsFrom ClassE
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But, then we realize there is another case, what if the relation is not to a concrete but to an abstract class?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Composition
          <ul>
            <li>
               A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to the same class
            </li>
            <li>
               A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to another class
            </li>
            <li>
               A OneToMany relationship to the same class
            </li>
            <li>
               A OneToMany relationship to another class
            </li>
            <li>
               A ManyToMany relationship to the same class
            </li>
            <li>
               A ManyToMany relationship to another class
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Inheritance
          <ul>
            <li>
               A InheritsFrom relationship to another ConcreteClass
            </li>
            <li>
               A InheritsFrom relationship to an <a href="AbstractClass.html">AbstractClass</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And then (finally?) we realize that this "Concrete/Abstract" separation also applies to the Composition relationships:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Composition
          <ul>
            <li>
               A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to the same abstract class
            </li>
            <li>
               A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to the same concrete class
            </li>
            <li>
               A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to another abstract class
            </li>
            <li>
               A <a href="OneToOne.html">OneToOne</a> relationship to another concrete class
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to the same abstract class
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to the same concrete class
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to another abstract class
        </li>
        <li>
           A OneToMany relationship to another concrete class
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A ManyToMany relationship to the same abstract class
        </li>
        <li>
           A ManyToMany relationship to the same concrete class
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A ManyToMany relationship to another abstract class
        </li>
        <li>
           A ManyToMany relationship to another concrete class
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Inheritance
          <ul>
            <li>
               A InheritsFrom relationship to another ConcreteClass
            </li>
            <li>
               A InheritsFrom relationship to an <a href="AbstractClass.html">AbstractClass</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Mmmm, now I realize that if its hard to find a Relational <a href="FunctionallyCompleteCrudGenerator.html">FunctionallyCompleteCrudGenerator</a> it is  event harder to find an <a href="ObjectOriented.html">ObjectOriented</a> <a href="FunctionallyCompleteCrudGenerator.html">FunctionallyCompleteCrudGenerator</a>, the <a href="IrreducibleComplexityEntityModel.html">IrreducibleComplexityEntityModel</a> gets really complex and it is easy to oversee a particular combination of the kinds of relationships (Event now I wonder if I am missing a particular combination/ relationship kind).
