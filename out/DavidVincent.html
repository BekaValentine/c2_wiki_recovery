        I got interested in TestCentredDevelopment in the late nineties.  If I recall correctly, I discovered <a href="RecursiveMakeConsideredHarmful.html">RecursiveMakeConsideredHarmful</a> and then the <a href="AeGis.html">AeGis</a> configuration manager.  Around then I learned about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.  Since then I have tried to apply it and related things, with varying success.

        I got interested in HardwareDevelopment including AnalogElectronics in primary school.  In the 7th grade I discovered DigitalElectronics and soon after that <a href="SoftwareDevelopment.html">SoftwareDevelopment</a> and perhaps became a CompulsiveProgrammer.

        I try not to give up.
