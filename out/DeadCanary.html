        Dead Canary In a Coal Mine.
      </p>
      <p>
        Little bird in a cage in the mine. Bird sings happily (or whatever). Oxygen level sinks due to methane rising silently from a hidden source. Bird stops singing and falls asleep. Why? The bird is such a small one, he is much more "hit" by the methane level than a human (needs less methane in the air to die). Today there are machines for that, but, no happy bird-tunes down there anymore. Just buzzers. A shame, really, for the musical coalminer of nowadays.

        In geek talk, the canary is like an EventListener, or perhaps closer to a WatchdogTimer.

        I once set up a little app at a client's site that periodically runs a bunch of test queries against some databases, and sends out warning emails if any of those queries turns up something strange. It gives us a heads up on problem data that has somehow made its way into the system. We called it the Canary. :-) -- <a href="KevinMcConnell.html">KevinMcConnell</a>

        Maybe you should use a framework for that, like NagiosMonitor.

What would be the name for the opposite pattern, i.e., some "magic" that is placed in a data area to detect that it has been (correctly) overwritten? An InverseCanary of sorts. -- <a href="ClaesWallin.html">ClaesWallin</a>
