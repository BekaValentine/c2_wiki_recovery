        Single Use Continuation
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <em>single use continuation</em> is a continuation which (duh) can only be used once (or not at all); after which it becomes invalidated.  This restriction greatly simplifies the implementation (no need for <a href="CactusStack.html">CactusStack</a>s, heap-allocated <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s, or other things like that), but restricts their use.  Full continuations can be used multiple times, which makes them powerful (but easily-abused).  See <a href="ContinuationsAreGotos.html">ContinuationsAreGotos</a>, an argument (rant) that mainly applies to <a href="FirstClass.html">FirstClass</a> continuations.
      </p>
      <p>
        In many (most) cases, invocation of such a continuation is up the call-stack only (or the call-chain if <a href="ActivationRecord.html">ActivationRecord</a>s aren't kept on <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to enforce the single-use constraint is to make continuations a second-class language feature; allow them to be passed as arguments to functions (and invoked), but not to be bound to (non-temporary) variables or returned from functions <em>(or referred to in constructs that create a new thread)</em>.  In this way, it's <em>impossible</em> to use a continuation more than once--the instant a continuation is invoked; control is transferred to a context where the continuation is no longer in scope.  The restriction on sticking the continuation in a variable prevents it from being invoked a second time; the restriction from being returned ensures that invokation always goes up the call-stack.
      </p>
      <p>
        Despite these restrictions, <a href="SingleUseContinuation.html">SingleUseContinuation</a>s are useful.  They can be used to model <a href="ExceptionHandling.html">ExceptionHandling</a> (the terminating kind found in <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, and others), <a href="BackTracking.html">BackTracking</a>/failure semantics, as well as ordinary function calls and basic control structures (looping and iteration).  They can't model <a href="CoRoutine.html">CoRoutine</a>s/threads, iterators/generators, etc. however.
      </p>
      <p>
        setjmp()/longjmp() can be used to implement single-use continuations in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> <em>(but arguably not well)</em>.  See <a href="ContinuationsInCee.html">ContinuationsInCee</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note you can make a multi-use setjmp(). One way is:
      </p>
      <code>
        while(setjmp(buf));<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Does any language have continuations which are single-use, but allow the continuation to be invoked if the invoking context has already returned "normally"?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The </em><a href="ActorsModel.html">ActorsModel</a> has continuations that are intermediate in expressiveness between <a href="SingleUseContinuation.html">SingleUseContinuation</a>s, and full continuations as in <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a>. Normally they are single-use, but an actor can be programmed to accept a continuation more than once. So "actor continuations" are nearest to what this question asks for, I think. See <em>"Viewing Control Structures as Patterns of Passing Messages"</em> and <em>"Issues in the Design and Implementation of Act2"</em>, at <a href="http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html">http://www.erights.org/history/actors.html</a> .<em></em>

        There is a paper in the book 'Advanced LISP Technology' called 'Indefinite One-time Continuations'.
        The authors (Komiya and Yuasa) have implemented them for TUTScheme. The idea is
        similar to <a href="SingleUseContinuation.html">SingleUseContinuation</a>.
