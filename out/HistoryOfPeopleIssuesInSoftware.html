        History Of People Issues In Software
      </h1>
      <p>
        The original works looking at people issues associated with software were
        Brooks's The <a href="MythicalManMonth.html">MythicalManMonth</a>; before that, there was <a href="HarlanMills.html">HarlanMills</a>'s <a href="ChiefProgrammerTeam.html">ChiefProgrammerTeam</a> paper. These were followed by <a href="GeraldWeinberg.html">GeraldWeinberg</a>[A], <a href="TomDeMarco.html">TomDeMarco</a> & <a href="TimLister.html">TimLister</a>[B], and <a href="LarryConstantine.html">LarryConstantine</a>[C].

        But the "people side of objects" has been hidden in workshops and papers
        for quite some time.  Only recently have we begun to see it addressed
        explicitly.

        SteveFrasier lead a panel session at OOPSLA '94 titled something like
        "Do Objects Structure Organizations or Do Organizations Structure
        Objects."  Hidden in that discussion was the reality that the health of
        the organization needs to be addressed before you can answer the
        questions.

        <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>'s and <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>'s pattern languages [D], [E] explicitly
        discuss how people can be organized to produce object-oriented systems.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NormKerth.html">NormKerth</a> and EileenAndreason [F] applied family systems theory to
        explain the behavior we see from people as they move through the process
        of mastering objects.
      </p>
      <p>
        At OOPSLA '95, <a href="NormKerth.html">NormKerth</a> offered a Birds-Of-A-Feather session titled,
        "The Psychology of OO Folk."  The room was packed, many people had to
        stand.  The variety of interests in various psychological and
        sociological issues was rich and interesting.  During the wrap-up, we
        agreed to propose a day long workshop for OOPSLA '96 (PeopleSideOfObjectTechnology).
