        Geocodes May Replace Addresses

        This page is intended to evolve into a set of notes focused on all aspects of "address" data.

        It is finally being triggered by refinements in GoogleMaps that now make it possible to jump to a Canadian postal code have galvanized action on the following dated statement... [<em>Can someone make sense of that?</em>]

      <ul>
        <li>
           take a more holistic view of 'address'(es)and some of their implications. For example...
          <ul>
            <li>
               conventional and geocoded views of...
              <ul>

                <li>
                   location.address.employment
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               alternate domain addresses, such as...
              <ul>
                <li>
                   location.address.telCo ( location.address.telCo.home , location.address.telCo.work , location.address.telCo.cell )

                   Companies that collect Address data now have an obligation to protect that data, rather than merely taking the view that "Custody = Ownership" (without Obligation)

                    <li>
                       In effective, Data Custodians should have effective maintenance practices that ensure the information is at least Current, Reliable and Secure.

        Saying that <a href="GeocodesMayReplaceAddresses.html">GeocodesMayReplaceAddresses</a> is like saying that IP addresses may replace domain names. Posted on 207.173.206.25 (yeah, that's C2.com).

        <em>There are indeed aspects of this analogy that are intriguing, especially considering "dynamic" IP addresses and temporary residences.</em>

        <li>
           While it is certainly true that GeoCode will not <strong>eliminate</strong> the use of addresses, there are many current uses of conventional addresses that are likely to become obsolete. For example...
          <ul>
            <li>
               ...
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Perhaps this should be reworded as GeocodeWillAbstractAddresses, since (As of 2010) it is apparent to me that emerging styles of Tag use will have an impact and should allow myTagValue to be mapped to a geocode. -- <a href="HansWobbe.html">HansWobbe</a>

      </ul>

        One issue is that it is sometimes useful to know that 2 people live in close proximity to each other (carpooling, etc). If the "address" includes no human-readable hints of this proximity, it will be arduous to determine such things.
