      <p>
        There are <em>so</em> many books that talk about (or reference) Patterns coming out now.  I can't seem to buy a technical book without coming across a quote from <a href="ChristopherAlexander.html">ChristopherAlexander</a> or a reference to the GOF <a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not all of these books are good.  However, I think that it would be interesting to compile a list of all  books that have been written <em>under the influence of</em> Patterns. I have chosen to place these titles  in our Wiki  <a href="BookList.html">BookList</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Keep the list growing, and if you have a review or comment on a listed book, go ahead and put it on its wiki link.
