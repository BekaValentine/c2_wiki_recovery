        Grapes Of Wrath Vs Nineteen Eighty Four

           Wow, that book had the saddest ending of any book I've ever read.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>You obviously haven't read 'Grapes Of Wrath' recently!</em>

        Actually, I have. I didn't find it to be as sad. I read it with some friends (you know, so we could discuss it, see <a href="BookDiscussion.html">BookDiscussion</a>), and they tended to think that the ending of <a href="GrapesOfWrath.html">GrapesOfWrath</a> was pretty sick. I felt indifferently towards the whole book. In <a href="GrapesOfWrath.html">GrapesOfWrath</a>, we had poor people remaining poor, trying to become less poor and being disappointed. In <a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a>, this man's <a href="HolyFire.html">HolyFire</a> was taken from him. I find that much sadder. <em>I don't find the ending to </em><a href="GrapesOfWrath.html">GrapesOfWrath</a> sad at all. He dies happy. That's the most anyone can ever really ask for.<em></em>

        He does in <a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a> too!
      </p>
      <p>
        The final chapter of 'Grapes Of Wrath' comes as catharsis after the previous horror. It's a message of hope about the ultimate, basic decency and nobility of mankind. Yes it's sad, but it's good. <a href="NineteenEightyFour.html">NineteenEightyFour</a>, on the other hand, contains absolutely no message of hope. It is unremittingly bleak.

        <em>What about </em><a href="AnimalFarm.html">AnimalFarm</a>?<em></em>

        <em>What about Jude The Obscure?</em>

        Clearly, we need a <a href="TheSaddestEnding.html">TheSaddestEnding</a> page.
