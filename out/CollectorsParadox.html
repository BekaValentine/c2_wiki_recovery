        Collectors Paradox
      </h1>
      <p>
        You want to learn to do a task by collecting practices that have worked in the past.
      </p>
      <p>
        No one has done the task before.
      </p>
      <p>
        One can paraphrase the <a href="InventorsParadox.html">InventorsParadox</a> to say that it is sometimes easier to learn how to solve a particular problem by first learning how to solve the next more general problem, and then specializing the more general solution.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Start collecting practices that have worked for the next more general task.  Slowly refocus the collection of practices to the specific task as experience grows.
