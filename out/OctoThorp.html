        Ask your nearest Brit if that is a "pound sign"...

      <p>
        <em>It isn't.</em>

        Count the thorps. There are 8. Hence - octothorp

        <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a> twice edited the over-sized <a href="OctoThorp.html">OctoThorp</a> above, making it symetric, like it was when he first wrote it. If he is not, indeed, opposing a wiki vandal, is he opposing someone with a curious font setting?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Most curious.  The over-sized </em><a href="OctoThorp.html">OctoThorp</a> is now entirely not an <a href="OctoThorp.html">OctoThorp</a>, post re-edit by <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>.  My font settings are, to my knowledge, precisely the defaults supplied in <a href="FireFox.html">FireFox</a> 3.0 (Windows XP and Linux) and <a href="InternetExplorer.html">InternetExplorer</a> 7.0 (Windows XP).  My edit to said <a href="OctoThorp.html">OctoThorp</a> (and the reversion of Ph1Ip's edits) was an attempt to make it symetric, which it was not.  I've left it in its (non-symetric to me, symetric to <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>) state, pending resolution of this peculiar puzzler.<em></em>

        k now the arms are way too short. 5 hashlets in each of the two cross-beams is no longer working. Maybe my Firefox caught the issue you have. Now I see this as correct:

        <a href="AsciiArt.html">AsciiArt</a> is an exact science, in a monospaced font, right? May the second one will get long for me, presently...

        {Symmetric counts would work for a vertical number sign:}

        {But once you tilt it, the horizontal bars need to cross the additional horizontal distance spanned by the vertical bars. The horizontal tilt is +5 spaces for the vertical bars (one per unit height), so the horizontal bars may be 10 or 11 units width. Yours is a the correct one with a tilt.}
