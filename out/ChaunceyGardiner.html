        I add little bits to many pages, often anonymously. I mean them to be constructive.

        I am amazed at the patience people have to participate in the long <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> conversations. I often throw little bits into them, always attempting to get to whatever the point is. I am always disappointed in the reaction to whatever I write. I just drop it then.

        I am uneducated. Everything I know has been learnt on the job. Which is probably regarded by some as highly as Chauncey's preparation for the presidency. The feeling is not mutual. Some of the best I have worked with have been Ph. D's. But some of them have been sailors.
