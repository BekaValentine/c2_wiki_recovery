        It has been a life-long pursuit of mine: collections
      </p>

        Not to much unlike that of others, I perceive.  I have an image of a comedy routine on TV some years ago, when the comedian was making comedy of this idea. Instead of using the word "collections", he used the word "stuff". While it was a comic routine, it was also an illustration of human management of collections of "valued", or "desirable" objects, and how to have the space required for their keeping.

        <li>
           the subject of many books, whatever their title may be.
        </li>
        <li>
           a continuing problem as newly observed, invented and manufactured objects appear.
        </li>
