        I am working on my own object oriented language called SOOL, for Simple/Sophisticated Object Oriented Language, with OOF the Object Oriented Framework. And an OS I call OOOS. These are still in conception phase. I am toying with a language I call FOOL which is an object oriented unctional language.
