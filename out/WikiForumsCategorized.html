        Everyone,
      </p>
      <p>
        If you have a favorite <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a>, why don't you try classifying it and add it to the list? If it covers several topics, enter it in more than one category. (If appropriate, make a new category in the style of this list.) If you don't feel comfortable entering it in the list, put a note here with some description of its focus (and URL), and I will add it to the list. PS: When you enter the URL, pick a good starting page relevant to the topic, if you can. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Aside: I will try to work my way through <a href="PublicWikiForums.html">PublicWikiForums</a> and copy those wikis to this list.

        Have you thought about refactoring the local-wiki pages, so every wiki they reference has a local-wiki page? Then each page could have the something like:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="CategoryWiki.html">CategoryWiki</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           CategoryWikiCategoryScience
        </li>
        <li>
           CategoryWikiCategoryScienceBiology
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        on the bottom.  
      </p>
      <p>
        I am not sure if it's better to use names like CategoryWikiCategoryScience, or if it's better to simply all the categories that apply to a particular wiki on its wikipage (i.e.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           CategoryExternalWiki
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CategoryScience.html">CategoryScience</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="CategoryBiology.html">CategoryBiology</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each category page could contain the <a href="OpenDirectoryProject.html">OpenDirectoryProject</a> category equivalent to the wiki category.
        I have added those into the three categories above.
      </p>
      <p>
        I can envision a day where wiki pages are all categorized, and wikis provide an RDF description of the wiki pages and a mapping (OnTology) from the wiki metadata into classifications used on the web, like <a href="OpenDirectoryProject.html">OpenDirectoryProject</a> categories. 
      </p>
      <p>
        There is the <a href="RdfWiki.html">RdfWiki</a> for the advancement of rdf.

        My desire for the "Learning" <computer language> forums is to list forums containing material to help a programmer familiar with one or more other languages learn this language as easily as possible, but not as a first computer language. That implies that there is room for another category of forums like Learning to Program, or a series of forums, LearningXxAsaFirstProgrammingLanguage. The "Learning" <computer language> forums are also intended to focus more on learning than using, or introductory learning rather than the continuous (advanced) learning that everyone needs to do in a language.

        This might become duplicated in a table on <a href="WikiReviews.html">WikiReviews</a>, or possibly be replaced by that table, but, for now, I'm starting with a list. -- <a href="RandyKramer.html">RandyKramer</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Randy, do you give permission, to transform some of your stuff into tables on the experimental <a href="WikiReviews.html">WikiReviews</a> forum, just for testing the practicability. As authentication [<a href="AuthenticationByWebsite.html">AuthenticationByWebsite</a>], that it is really you, you could leave a pointer here to a static HTML page on your Website, where you formulate your permission (with a backlink to this Wikipage). -- fp 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fridemar, sure, yes! However, I don't have an active website, and I'm not sure we really need to get so formal as <a href="AuthenticationByWebsite.html">AuthenticationByWebsite</a>. Do you think we do? -- <a href="RandyKramer.html">RandyKramer</a> (PS: I'm not sure how long your note was here - just noticed it a few minutes ago.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Randy, in this case <a href="AuthenticationByWebsite.html">AuthenticationByWebsite</a> may be overkill, because it is not critical stuff, but on the other hand for the same reason it would be practical to start serious forms of collaborations, based on non-critical stuff. The wiki explosion is lurking with quite a lot of potential in the professional (economy integrated) sphere. Have a look at my current validated search in <a href="WikiInternetSearchResults.html">WikiInternetSearchResults</a>. -- fp 
      </p>
      <p>
        Fridemar, 
      </p>
      <p>
        I looked at your validated search, and it looks good. I have never tried <a href="CopernicTwoThousand.html">CopernicTwoThousand</a> but the automatic validation of links is sure to be useful. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With respect to your other points, it appears that wikis may be in trouble in Hawaii, see link number 26 in your search results. (26. Endangered Species of Hawaii ;-) enjoyed that too -- fp 
      </p>
      <p>
        More seriously: 
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Do you think those search results will be a replacement for this page, or do you think that they will be raw input for this page? Of course this page appears to me more valuable, but nevertheless you may freely copy material from the HTML-list to reuse it in a HTML capable <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a>, e.g. the <a href="WikiReviews.html">WikiReviews</a> forum. -- fp 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
           It would be nice to see a wiki explosion that resulted in some opportunities to make a living with wikis. The future of Ecommerce might be Wiki, specializing the <a href="CluetrainManifesto.html">CluetrainManifesto</a> message: "The future of Marketing is Conversation" -- fp 
        </li>
      </ol>

        On a different subject, I have a question about Smalltalk that you might help me with. The wikis that I have seen so far written in Smalltalk do not include a diff. I got to wondering whether writing a diff in a language like Smalltalk (which I don't know, tried looking at a few weeks ago) would be especially difficult for some reason? Any insight? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Oops: Never mind, <a href="WikiWorks.html">WikiWorks</a> 0.6 is written in Smalltalk (I think) and includes a diff. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks, -- <a href="RandyKramer.html">RandyKramer</a> (PS: As usual, delete anything no longer appropriate from these notes after you see them.) 
      </p>
      <p>
        Randy, instead of deleting (prematurely), I reuse our temporary text for inserting and adding a link. -- fp

        <em>I"m sure this page is useful, but it struck me as kinda odd that it indexes forums of one peculiar (or should I say particular?) format. If I'm looking for a forum, I probably don't care (primarily) what format it uses. Maybe </em><a href="KissPrinciple.html">KissPrinciple</a> rules, but consider inviting mention of any kind of interactive forum. (I was thinking specifically of message boards. Dialup BBSes seem inappropriate.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmmm, this started out as an effort to categorize <a href="WikiForums.html">WikiForums</a> (that were being listed under <a href="PublicWikiForums.html">PublicWikiForums</a>). I particularly like wikis, and want to encourage wikis as opposed to message boards. But, this is not my wiki. If people add message boards or whatever, I won't delete them. (That sounds more negative than I meant to sound, hey, the more the merrier - I will keep searching for and encouraging wikis.) If it gets overwhelming, it may be appropriate to refactor on some basis.

        I see that the
        <a href="PublicWikiForums.html">PublicWikiForums</a>
        list has been moved to
        the <a href="WikiIndex.html">WikiIndex</a> project <a href="http://www.wikiindex.com/">http://www.wikiindex.com/</a>
        .
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm planning on moving the information from
        <a href="WikiForumsCategorizedAyThroughCee.html">WikiForumsCategorizedAyThroughCee</a>,
        <a href="WikiForumsCategorizedDeeThroughZee.html">WikiForumsCategorizedDeeThroughZee</a>, etc.
        to that wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then C2 will be rid of <a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a> clutter, and can focus on, you know, Serious Programming Stuff.
        Like
        the <a href="OneTrueBraceStyle.html">OneTrueBraceStyle</a>,
        whether or not <a href="ExtremeProgrammingIsNotTheOneTrueFaith.html">ExtremeProgrammingIsNotTheOneTrueFaith</a>,
        <a href="FunnyThingsSeenInSourceCodeAndDocumentation.html">FunnyThingsSeenInSourceCodeAndDocumentation</a>,
