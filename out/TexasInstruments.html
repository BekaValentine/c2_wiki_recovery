        Texas Instruments is more colloquially known for it's calculators.  Middle-aged folk may remember TI for the TI/99-4A personal computer, which looked like a cross between an Apple IIe and an Atari game console.  It even used cartridges!

        Texas Instruments also manufactured the <a href="TexasInstrumentsExplorer.html">TexasInstrumentsExplorer</a>, a Lisp machine (<a href="http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/artificial.shtml).">http://www.ti.com/corp/docs/company/history/artificial.shtml).</a>   There is a project (<a href="http://www.unlambda.com/lispm/)">http://www.unlambda.com/lispm/)</a> to build a software emulator for the Explorer.

        First introduction to programming was on a brand-new TI-99!  What a rush, and what a blast...  They were so new at the time that I was able to talk-down the price at a major retail department-store chain (hard to do nowadays).
