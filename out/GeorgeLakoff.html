        I just picked up a new book by Lakoff called 
        <em></em>MoralPolitics. What Conservatives Know that Liberals Don't<em> ([ISBN 0226468054]).</em>
        Its a nice piece of work teasing apart the <a href="ConceptualMetaphor.html">ConceptualMetaphor</a> underlying political discourse.  I consider Lakoff's methods to be a bit like Alexander's, though more in line with current attitudes in cognitive psychology. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        I've had <a href="WomenFireAndDangerousThings.html">WomenFireAndDangerousThings</a> ([ISBN 0226468046]) by Lakoff recommended to me from a couple of sources, but I haven't had a chance to get it yet -- <a href="MichaelFeathers.html">MichaelFeathers</a>

        Read it now. OOP advocates will learn a bunch there about inheritance (Lakoff's Categories) when used for implementation vs specification.

        Lakoff and Nunez have written a fascinating book called WhereMathematicsComesFrom ([ISBN 0465037712]), where they detail a set of metaphors that can be used to explain mathematics. The book has a set of case studies at the end, that purport to explain the meaning of, for instance, the identity e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0.
