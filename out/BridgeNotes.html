        Bridge Notes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Since this is well explained in our study book (with good diagrams), I'll only be putting up an outline here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Bridge Pattern - aka Handle/Body
        Decouple Abstraction from Implementation
      </p>
      <p>
        Common tendency - handle special cases with inheritance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Example problem space using inheritance - see UML diagrams pg 127, 128
      </p>
      <p>
        What if we add another drawing program.
      </p>
      <p>
        Solution: Take the variations and encapsulate them by putting into different classes.
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two main OO concepts employed here:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Find what varies and encapsulate it
        </li>
        <li>
           Favor object composition over inheritance
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Seen in Java's java.awt package:
        Component is the abstract class that represents the abstraction
        Inherited from Component are Button, TextField, List, etc.
        java.awt.peer contains interfaces for the platform specific implementations -
        ComponentPeer, ButtonPeer, ListPeer, etc. 
        java.awt.Toolkit acts as the <a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> (next meeting) that is used by the sublasses of 
        Component to create their implementations.  Thus, the platform supplies the concrete factory class.

        Consequences(from GOF)
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Decouples interface and implementation
        </li>
        <li>
           Improves extensibility
        </li>
        <li>
           Hides implementation details from clients
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Implementation issues (from GOF)
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Only one implementator (degenerate case)
        </li>
        <li>
           Creating the best Implementor object
        </li>
        <li>
           Sharing Implementors
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Patterns often used with:
        Adapter

        If time permits: Another (interactive) example.
