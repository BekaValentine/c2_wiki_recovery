        The United States Defense Department has written specific criteria for evaluating the products it purchases.  These <a href="MilSpec.html">MilSpec</a>s often cover more extreme operating conditions (such as high temperature, low temperature, or moldy tropical climates) than most civilian products are designed to withstand.
