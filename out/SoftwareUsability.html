        Software Usability
      </h1>
      <p>
        A measure of how well the system interacts with end-users. Typical definitions refer to <a href="SoftwareUsability.html">SoftwareUsability</a> as a composition of several factors, such as:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Learnability
        </li>
        <li>
           Efficiency/Throughput
        </li>
        <li>
           User Appeal / Subjective Satisfaction
        </li>
        <li>
           Memorability	(note this can differ from learnability - e.g. it's hard to learn to ride a bike, but easy to remember how to do it)
        </li>
        <li>
           Usefulness.
        </li>
      </ul>
