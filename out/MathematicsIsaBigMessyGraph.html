        Mathematics Isa Big Messy Graph
      </h1>
      <p>
        Thinking of <a href="LifeIsaBigMessyGraph.html">LifeIsaBigMessyGraph</a> and <a href="EveryLanguageFixesSomething.html">EveryLanguageFixesSomething</a>, it seems also Mathematics is too. If one were to draw links representing dependencies between definitions/axioms theorems and subsequent theorems for various BranchesOfMathematics, would there be a common pattern/structure? I don't think they would be Lattices as there would not be a sup and inf but it is interesting to imagine. I was going to make a <a href="VisualTour.html">VisualTour</a> of some of the interlinked mathematical definitions on Wiki as an example but it is not working so here is a more concrete one:
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance take a few <a href="SetTheory.html">SetTheory</a> definitions:
      </p>
      <p>
        def1:A intersect B = {x:x elem A and x elem B}
      </p>
      <p>
        def2:A union B = {x:x elem A or x elem B}
      </p>
      <p>
        def3:A subset B -> (x elem A -> x elem B)
      </p>
      <p>
        def4:A = B <-> A subset B and B subset A
      </p>
      <p>
        thm1:A intersect (B union C) = (A intersect C) union (A intersect C)
      </p>
      <p>
        thm2:(A intersect B) subset A subset (A union B)
      </p>
      <p>
        thm3:(A subset B) <-> (A intersect B) = A
      </p>
      <p>
        The proofs of these example theorems have the dependencies (as a <a href="DirectedGraph.html">DirectedGraph</a>):
      </p>
      <p>
        {(def1,thm1),(def2,thm1),(def1,thm2),(def2,thm2),(def3,thm2),(def1,thm4),(def2,thm4),(thm3,thm4),(def4,thm4)}
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps the graph could be made less messy by only showing links from the previous level, ie if
      </p>
      <p>
        a -> b -> c and also a ->c don't show a -> c. Perhaps this would aid memorization for <a href="TheoremProving.html">TheoremProving</a> and reduce the perception that <a href="MathIsHard.html">MathIsHard</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Buddy, if you think the above has any chance of reducing the perception that </em><a href="MathIsHard.html">MathIsHard</a>, you need to get out and socialize more!<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You mean like so: ?
        <img src="http://construct.haifa.ac.il/~cerpe/papers/Image6.gif" /> <em>(</em><a href="BrokenImage.html">BrokenImage</a>)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        For some of us here, I suppose that is as close as we come to "socialize" :-)
