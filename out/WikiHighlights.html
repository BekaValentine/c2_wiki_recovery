        <a href="WikiHighlights.html">WikiHighlights</a> (and <a href="ChangeSummary.html">ChangeSummary</a> before it) used to attempt to bring to focus some of the more interesting pages on Wiki. However many of us have now learnt the hard way: Wiki links to the pages that it likes in context.

        In fact, important pages form natural "centres" aka <a href="NatureOfOrder.html">NatureOfOrder</a> that are like gravity wells: you'll "fall" into them almost inevitably. Like NewEmptyPage.

        So much for "falling into them." I have implemented the shortest path length sort for <a href="MeatballWiki.html">MeatballWiki</a>, which detects the "centres" of the graph analytically. This is super expensive, so I only generate the page once a day. It lives at <a href="http://sunir.org/meatball/path.html.">http://sunir.org/meatball/path.html.</a> I suspect running the same analysis on <a href="WikiWiki.html">WikiWiki</a>'s tens of thousands of pages would take a <em>very long</em> time. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a>
