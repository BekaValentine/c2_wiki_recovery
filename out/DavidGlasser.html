        Hi, I just found this place.  I program <a href="InteractiveFiction.html">InteractiveFiction</a> in the <a href="TadsLanguage.html">TadsLanguage</a>, and this site seems like a good place for discussion.

        Well, as long as the discussion has to do with patterns... :-) -- <a href="MarnixKlooster.html">MarnixKlooster</a>

        Of course.  I'm still trying to understand what patterns are.  Can you get more examples up on the page please please pretty please?  It seems helpful to IF, but we need a better example or two.--<a href="DavidGlasser.html">DavidGlasser</a>

        There are patterns all over the place.  You just need to see what one looks like then you'll notice all the links.  For development patterns, connect to <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>'s <a href="http://www.bell-labs.com/cgi-user/OrgPatterns/OrgPatterns,">http://www.bell-labs.com/cgi-user/OrgPatterns/OrgPatterns,</a> I have a little pattern set locked in an article on a design technique called <a href="EndGame.html">EndGame</a>, which may be similar to what IF would want: <a href="http://members.aol.com/acockburn/papers/endgame.htm.">http://members.aol.com/acockburn/papers/endgame.htm.</a>  Also, try to find the pattern language from the PatternLanguageOfPrograms (PLOP) 1996, on patterns in teaching.  I think you would find that very useful as a base set of patterns for writing good IF.

        Okay, here's a great pattern:  <a href="HandsInView.html">HandsInView</a>  I think it is a great example of what a pattern is and can be.  It conforms to the given format for a pattern, and is rather universal--you should easily be able to understand the 'forces' involved since in pertains to skiing ;-)

        Okay, I've been busy.  In addition to fleshing out the Transporter pattern on the InteractiveFictionPatterns page, which I'm not all that happy with, but is at least relatively simple, I've also written a new pattern, InteractiveFictionPuzzleHint, which I am much more happy with, but is relatively complex.  Let me know what you think, then write some of your own!  --<a href="LucianSmith.html">LucianSmith</a>
