        Saving Orphans

      <p>
        This page exists mostly as a way of bringing interesting <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s closer to the tip of the <a href="WikiIceberg.html">WikiIceberg</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a place to list pages someone feels should be referenced somewhere, but they just can't work out where.  If you can, please place a reference there and cut it from here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Without further ado lets begin:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="DefinitionOfLove.html">DefinitionOfLove</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WritingCodeAtHome.html">WritingCodeAtHome</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="TwoTypesOfCodeClarity.html">TwoTypesOfCodeClarity</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <em>Why not bring the </em><a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a>s closer to the tip by actually discussing and referring to them?  Empty references <em>[like the bullet list above?]</em> seems to be a bad tactic and artificial.  And some pages are probably orphaned for good reason... <a href="DefinitionOfLove.html">DefinitionOfLove</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes a page gets orphaned even though it's interesting but there's no way to work into a sentence that isn't so contrived you might as well just have the <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a> on it's own.
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally it would be nice to just have some script that automatically brings orphans to the surface. Something along the lines of RandomOrphanPages. Of course this wouldn't just be orphaned pages but also pages that have no links to them. Maybe this page is really about ResurrectingDeadPages than <a href="SavingOrphans.html">SavingOrphans</a>?

      <p>
        <a href="OrphanPage.html">OrphanPage</a> has a link to a script that shows pages where the parent page no longer exists:
