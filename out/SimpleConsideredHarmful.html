        Simple Considered Harmful
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>SOAP and SOAP::Lite entirely reinforce my belief that any variation on "Simple" or "Lightweight" in the name of a protocol, library or other software product is to be be treated with the same suspicion as "People's" or "Democratic" in the name of a country.</em> -- <a href="DanBarlow.html">DanBarlow</a>, from <a href="http://ww.telent.net/diary/2004/11/#16.69212">http://ww.telent.net/diary/2004/11/#16.69212</a>

        <em>LDAP is indeed lightweight compared to what it replaced. Likewise for SOAP, when compared to CORBA. While neither of these things can adequately be described on a page - much of the complexity is due to complexity in the underlying problem domain.</em>

        Disagree. The complexity comes not from the problem domain, but from the misguided attempts at making the protocols robust by overspecifying. CORBA is indeed complex, but a better comparison for SOAP is XML-RPC, which truly is simple and equally capable. LDAP and SNMP both, ultimately, communicate a hierarchy of key/value pairs, and there are absolutely much simpler ways to do that. To me, these three protocols are eloquent arguments against <a href="StaticTyping.html">StaticTyping</a>, which is a holy war I hope we can avoid waging here.
