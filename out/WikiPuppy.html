        A <a href="WikiUser.html">WikiUser</a> who discovers wiki, loves it, gets excited, and pees all over the wiki.  <a href="MostlyHarmless.html">MostlyHarmless</a> but can turn into a <a href="WikiGremlin.html">WikiGremlin</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sometimes I wonder if I'm a </em><a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a>. I love the wiki, and try not to pee all over it, but I sometimes can't tell if I'm being insightful or annoying.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        And you gotta love all the newcomers whose excitement devolves into yapping at strangers and guarding a territory of topicality. ;-)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some of those who are striving to keep this wiki topical are not newcomers. Some of them have seen what happens when some semblance of topicality is not maintained and are trying to use that experience to help this wiki remain a useful place.

        May I suggest that this page be merged into <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a>? Somehow the name "<a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a>" seems vaguely insulting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It is vaguely intended to be. It's also much more accurate, and for those who have endured several, if not many, at least it adds a lighter note. Suffering from </em><a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a> is distinct from being a <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Another 'voiced' agreement that: it adds a lighter note, and is distinct.  I'd like to see it remain, especially since I have already linked to it from a sister site.  After all... <a href="ExactlyOnce.html">ExactlyOnce</a> (or, for the novice) ... <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>!
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Agree. Has a sense of cuteness.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           Disagree. While I don't think that the pages should be merged, it seems to me that the only difference between <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> and <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a> is only in the eye of the beholder. Honestly, what is the real difference between "peeing all over Wiki" and "not having yet mastered <a href="WikiSocialNorms.html">WikiSocialNorms</a>"? To put more bluntly, <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a> seems like a first person form of <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a>...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are important differences between <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> and <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a>, just like there are differences in the personalities of the individuals that use this Wiki that would be tagged with either when appropriate.  In this case <a href="MoreIsBetter.html">MoreIsBetter</a>.  Multiple forms of similar, yet different, content makes it easier for some people to learn, and being able to come across a point at different times and under slightly different circumstances makes it harder to say "this does not apply to me".

        A WikiKitten on the other hand would probably bring down a whole curtain rail and set of curtains, as one real kitten I know once did.... -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        A <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> was here and he pooped on this page.  Oh dear

        Often times, we need a new page titled WikiPuppyBehavior to remind even old-timers, not to run around and create a multitude of pages when feeling like they need support in an <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>.

        I think <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a> is cool. I adore <a href="WikiPuppies.html">WikiPuppies</a>
