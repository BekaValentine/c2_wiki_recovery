        I'm a software developer using design patterns heavily on many projects. The first was a complex data visualization framework named Giza. Giza is centered around a design pattern I call the ?RoleAdapter. I wrote a tech note about that pattern, which was published in the '98 OOPSLA, and that you can read at <a href="http://maparent.webhop.net/TechNote.html.">http://maparent.webhop.net/TechNote.html.</a>
      </p>

        Giza was developed at CRIM (<a href="http://www.crim.ca)">http://www.crim.ca)</a> by Luc, myself and Louis Vroomen. We all left CRIM since; Luc is still designing interfaces at Nortel, and I am still dreaming up complex design patterns. (Mostly in Python, now.)

        I've gone back to school to study SystemsScience.
