        Half Bug
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>s constitute the fundamental problem with unsupported / inadequately supported concurrency programming.
      </p>
      <p>
        Deriving <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a> from half-life:
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="RaceCondition.html">RaceCondition</a> produces a bug that may be expected to occur occasionally.  Similar <a href="RaceCondition.html">RaceCondition</a> bugs that may exist will be expected to occur with their own periodicity. The entire class of <a href="RaceCondition.html">RaceCondition</a> bugs that may be expected to exist will exhibit an 80/20 rule / ParetoDistribution / LogNormalDistribution, or something like a half-life distribution -- ergo <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If one <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a> is found, the existence of additional <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>s should be inferred. <a href="BlackBoxTesting.html">BlackBoxTesting</a> cannot be relied on to find (all) <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>s. The user-base CAN be relied on to find all relevant <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Microsoft's approach to experimentally finding relevant <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>s is perhaps the only relatively effective <a href="BlackBox.html">BlackBox</a> solution.  DrWatson ("Click yes to send bug-report") allows the full run-time of a significant portion of the installed user-base to act as a test-bed for finding low-probability <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Implication: If testing cannot be relied on to find <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>s, and if one's development environment cannot be relied on to prevent one from writing <a href="HalfBug.html">HalfBug</a>s, concurrent code cannot be considered to be fully reliable. The reasonable expectation is that such code will fail regularly.
      </p>
      <p>
        Assuming that all bugs encountered during testing were resolved (a grossly unreasonable assumption), then one might extrapolate a per-user BugFrequency of half the total CPU-time spent in <a href="BlackBox.html">BlackBox</a> testing. In fact, given the likelihood of substantially greater installed-base variability versus testing variability, one should expect a substantially higher bug frequency.  -- <a href="HankHoek.html">HankHoek</a>
