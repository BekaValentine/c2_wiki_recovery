        Integration Machine
      </h1>
      <p>
        Context: Multiple development pairs in a team are working on a code base simultaneously and need to periodically (hourly to daily; <a href="ContinuousIntegration.html">ContinuousIntegration</a>) integrate their code with the main code base.
      </p>
      <p>
        Forces: 
        Each integration should begin and end with clean (<a href="GreenBar.html">GreenBar</a>) code. If two pairs are integrating simultaneously, they can break each other's tests and cause confusion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Development environments can diverge, so it is useful to have an authentic standard platform so you don't hear "The tests all passed for <em>me</em>! What's <em>your</em> problem?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Resolution: Serialize integration by making developers go to the <a href="IntegrationMachine.html">IntegrationMachine</a> to integrate their code and run tests. The software configuration on the <a href="IntegrationMachine.html">IntegrationMachine</a> is treated as a standard for the development environment, to avoid divergence in developers' workstations from being an issue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Variation: An <a href="IntegrationToken.html">IntegrationToken</a>, which serializes commits to the code base without providing an authentic configuration base. ("I need to integrate, who has the Rubber Chicken?") If your development environment is automatically built from a script, maybe <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> applies to a distinguished integration station.
