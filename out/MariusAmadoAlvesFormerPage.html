        I'm a researcher on Adaptive Hypertext and other things at www.liacc.up.pt

        Before I said:

      <p>
        "I am a programmer and a linguist from Portugal.
      </p>
      <p>
        I work on the DarkSideOfNlp, i.e. working <a href="NaturalLanguageProcessing.html">NaturalLanguageProcessing</a> software, and on my thesis Computational Lexicon Engineering, with the New University of Lisbon.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am revisiting the <a href="WikiWeb.html">WikiWeb</a> after a big while. (2000?)
      </p>
      <p>
        And today again. (2002)"
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        The searches don't seem to work for some browsers. Try typing "<a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=ralph">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?search=ralph</a>" instead. 
      </p>
      <p>
        (Note to the Search coder: try "<form action=the_cgi>". This has happened to me. Let me know if it is a pattern.)--MarioAmadoAlves

        I made the change you suggest. Thanks for the tip. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>
