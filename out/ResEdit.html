        A utility once used for editing the contents of the <a href="ResourceFork.html">ResourceFork</a> of files (usually applications) on the Macintosh. Since the <a href="ResourceFork.html">ResourceFork</a> could contain many different data types - from text and settings, to icons and pictures, via sounds, colours, etc, <a href="ResEdit.html">ResEdit</a> had to be a bit of a <a href="SwissArmyKnife.html">SwissArmyKnife</a>. Indeed, it made a useful word processor - the 'styl' styled text resource gave 90% of what you need, and you could even have several in a file!

        <em>"once used"? So what is used now? (I haven't touched a Mac for many years at this point, alas...)</em>

        Not to be confused with !<a href="ResEdit.html">ResEdit</a> which is still used for editing resource files on the Acorn line of machines, such as the RiscPC.
