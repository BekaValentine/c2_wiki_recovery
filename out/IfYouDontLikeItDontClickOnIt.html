        One IanMcDonald, author of <a href="BrunoTheBandit.html">BrunoTheBandit</a>, had a curious experience doing a regular Saturday strip for the notorious <a href="SluggyFreelance.html">SluggyFreelance</a>:

        A one-sided view of the fate of "Meanwhile, in the Dimension of Pain" appears here:

        <a href="http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Sluggy_Freelance">http://www.comixpedia.org/index.php/Sluggy_Freelance</a>
      </p>

        That slant attempts to blame Ian for the strip's negative response. The fan-boys and -girls who flamed the strip (and who wrote that report) justify their reaction by claiming, for example, Ian indulged in potty-mouth humor, compared to Pete Abrams' sterling erudition.

        This is patently absurd in the face of overwhelming evidence. <a href="SluggyFreelance.html">SluggyFreelance</a> named one story, for example, "Torg Potter and the Chamberpot of Secretions."

        What really happened was very simple. Everyone has a short list of web sites they visit periodically. People who needed a daily SF fix could not adapt to a slightly different strip each Saturday. In short, they could not prevent themselves from clicking on, and disliking, a web page they already knew they would dislike.

        To prove this theory, Pete wrote and inked an MITDP episode. The fan-children flamed it, not realizing that their idol Pete wrote it.
