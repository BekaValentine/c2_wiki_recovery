        Groovy software for keeping your PDA synchronised with your phone, your email client, your laptop, your other email client.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mostly it works.  It only supports a limited number of phones.  It doesn't support the multiple-numbers-per-person facilities in recent Nokia phones.

        I use it for keeping my contacts and calendar synchronised between my office and home PC's.

        NOTICE OF DISCONTINUATION OF FUSIONONE BASIC SERVICE
      </p>
      <p>
        Dear <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Basic and Plus Users,
      </p>
      <p>
        Several months ago, we informed users of our free <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Basic service that we would no longer be supporting the free service, and urged users to upgrade to our fee-based <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Plus service. Therefore, effective March 31, 2005 <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> will permanently discontinue the <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Basic service. After that date, the Basic service will no longer be available, and any data Basic service users have stored on <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> servers will be permanently deleted. We will not be able to provide access to that data in any form after March 31, 2005. We strongly suggest that Basic service users retrieve and/or delete any data stored inside the <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> service prior to this date. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Please note that subscribers to the fee-based <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Plus service will not be affected. Current <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Plus users will be able to continue to use the service through the termination date of their subscription. At least two weeks prior to subscription termination, <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Plus users will be reminded of the termination, and advised to retrieve and/or delete any data stored inside the <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Plus service. In addition, effective immediately, upgrades or new subscriptions to the fee-based <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a> Plus service are no longer available. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We encourage you to learn more about <a href="FusionOne.html">FusionOne</a>'s other service offerings for mobile phones: MightyPhone (www.mightyphone.com) and MightyBackup (www.mightybackup.com).
