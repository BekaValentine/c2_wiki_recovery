        Synch And Stabilize

      <p>
        I've just read the summary of <a href="SynchAndStabilize.html">SynchAndStabilize</a> given in "MANAGEMENT & VIRTUAL DECENTRALISED NETWORKS: THE LINUX PROJECT" by George N. Dafermos

        It has some similiarities to Xp:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Small Teams (3-8 developers plus 3-8 testers)
        </li>
        <li>
           Short-ish, iterative development (3 major milestones within a 6-12 month period)
        </li>
        <li>
           Specifications are allowed to evolve 
        </li>
        <li>
           Testing and Development done in parallel ("Developers design, code and debug. Testers pair up with developers for continuous testing." -- page 71)
        </li>
        <li>
           Feature prioritising, critical features and shared components done in phase one (milestone 1)
        </li>
        <li>
           Refactoring is called "optimisations" (although it might be just that and not refactoring) and are done as part of the development phase of a larger milestone phase
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Some things the process does not have:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a>, features are obtained from customers before start of project
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="FortyHourWeek.html">FortyHourWeek</a> is probably  not part of the process!
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> or any sort of breaking down of specifications aren't explicitly mentioned
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I found it interesting that MS has also realised that the waterfall model simply does not work and has defined its own process that bears some similiarities to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. --<a href="GerritRiessen.html">GerritRiessen</a>
