        I work in the Museum world and am trying to help set up group working projects.

        I was so impressed with wikipedia.org that I'm seeing if I can do something similar with my own sites.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="NoteWiki.html">NoteWiki</a> looks great but could I export the pages to another web based wiki at a later time?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If all you use is text and </em><a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s, you shouldn't need much conversion.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm really after a wiki that I can implement on the web as easily as <a href="NoteWiki.html">NoteWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've used <a href="SeedWiki.html">SeedWiki</a> and found it good but not sure how and when they start charging as I have so many ideas I'd like to try out!
