        Steven Spielberg
      </h1>
      <p>
        A purveyor of affable & homiletic movies about ordinary folk like you and me getting eaten alive by giant monsters.
      </p>
      <p>
        Considered by some to be one of the greatest filmmakers ever, at least from the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a>.  Has made some truly great films from many different genres (a list which includes EeTeeTheExtraTerrestrial, CloseEncountersOfTheThirdKind, RaidersOfTheLostArk, TheColorPurple, SchindlersList, SavingPrivateRyan).
      </p>
      <p>
        Considered by others to be one of the worst purveyors of overly-sentimental, treacly schlock--not to mention just a few plain stinkers (NineteenFortyTwoMovie, BatteriesNotIncludedMovie, HookMovie, <a href="AiTheMovie.html">AiTheMovie</a> to name a few).

        IMHO both are right.  With a good script, and subject matter that he cares deeply about, Spielberg is a master of his craft.  However, he is too easily lured into producing sappy tearjerkers--he often tries to cram too many "emotional moments" into a film.  Quite a few of his movies would be better if 30-45 minutes of footage were left on the cutting room floor--HookMovie was a canonical example.)

        Unfortunately, Spielberg is one of the most powerful men in Hollywood (the S in SKG Dreamworks)... there isn't a person in show business who can order him to cut a scene.
