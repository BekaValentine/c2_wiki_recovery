        Deleted And Refactored
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hi. You've probably come here from a page you authored that you just checked up on only to find that all the text was replaced with "<a href="DeletedAndRefactored.html">DeletedAndRefactored</a> to PageName". Don't panic! This is just some <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a>'s way of telling you that the content you added belongs on PageName.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you think they made a mistake, just press <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> and then <a href="EditCopy.html">EditCopy</a> to get back the original text of your page.
        <em>(But please look at the other page first, because probably everything you typed was moved to the other page.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are happy with the change they made (or <em>you</em> made a spelling mistake or something), replace the current text of the page with the word "deleted".
      </p>
      <p>
        If you are not the original creator of the page please wait a while before seconding the deletion to give the original author a chance to see this page.
