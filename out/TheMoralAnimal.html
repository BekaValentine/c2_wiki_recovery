        <em>The Moral Animal: the New Science of Evolutionary Psychology</em>

        Robert Wright, Vintage Books, 1995, [ISBN 0-679-76399-6]
        Original out-of-print hardback Pantheon Books, 1994, ISBN 0-679-40773-1

        Wright, an evolutionary psychologist [No, I think that he is actually a journalist writing about EvolutionaryPsychology ], is presenting what he believes we know about the universals of human behavior: what behaviors are present, in varying forms, in all cultures, and how these behaviors might have been useful adaptations for the species.

        Wright is an extraordinarily humane writer who likes human beings; he has chosen to hang this book on a scaffolding of Charles Darwin's life, using incidents in Darwin's life as illustrations of principles.	Wright tries hard to separate his premises from his conclusions, so that readers can judge his logic for itself.
