        Will Rel Ever Have Jdbc Driver
      </h1>
      <p>
        Waiting for a JDBC driver to connect to Rel since 2008... will it ever become true? or is it just too hard a problem to be solved in the near future (in other words, its something better left for much later) or is it just not a priority?
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd love to see it happen, and finally be able to use Rel as something more than just a nice interactive toy...
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's a priority, but not a high priority.  It's actually trivial to implement (with certain usually-acceptable constraints), but since Rel is primarily used as a teaching tool and a working model of </em><a href="TheThirdManifesto.html">TheThirdManifesto</a> principles, development necessarily focuses heavily on those areas.  The code for a JDBC driver is still disassembled on my workbench.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Of course, the </em><a href="RelProject.html">RelProject</a> is <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, so if you're interested in a JDBC driver you should download the source and implement it!  I'd be happy to provide advice, suggestions and guidance.<em> -- </em><a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
