      <p>
        In gentler words - the kind of work your <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> does. Categorizing pages, fixing typos, removing your signatures to ease refactoring, etc. These are usually considered a <a href="GoodThing.html">GoodThing</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, some view this as a problem, because it causes more entries in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.

        The focus of this wiki is textual content, not perfect punctuation and presentation.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Don't reflow paragraphs by removing newlines. This does not affect the appearance of the page and just clutters recent changes.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't convert between the various forms of dashes (EmDash, EnDash, -, --, –, —).
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't prefix every signature with '--' just to satisfy the <a href="SignatureSurvey.html">SignatureSurvey</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't convert British spellings to American spellings (color/colour).
        </li>
        <li>
           Don't just insert/remove commas, periods, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Currently, there is an automated <a href="SharkBot.html">SharkBot</a> which will revert these kind of edits.
      </p>
      <p>
        But do <a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Fix obvious spelling mistakes and poor grammar, but only if it <strong>aids understanding</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Add and fix <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a>s.
        </li>
        <li>
           Convert broken character encodings to <a href="UtfEight.html">UtfEight</a> (there was recent breakage due to a server upgrade).
        </li>
        <li>
           Add bulleted lists.
        </li>
        <li>
           Refactor pages to improve structure and reduce duplication.

        "...removing your signatures to ease refactoring..."
      </p>
      <p>
        I cannot object to this practice strongly enough. When I put my signature on a particular contribution it is because I want my words kept as is. There have been times in the distant past when something I said was buggered up by someone wanting to "streamline" or "correct" one of my statements. Instead of improving my contribution these do-gooders screwed the pooch badly. I wish my statements to be left alone when I sign them.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, I have made plenty of contributions to this Wiki that were unsigned, sometimes with my name added to the list of contributors at the bottom of the page. This is a great way to let any involved <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> sort out the <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> diatribe into a more concise <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> statement of <a href="ThesisAntithesisSynthesis.html">ThesisAntithesisSynthesis</a> and still maintain one's tracking of ongoing discussions.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please don't remove signatures without asking the original author of the statement.
