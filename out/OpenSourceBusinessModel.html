        Did I read somewhere that companies, not limited to <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>, donate their technology into the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, hoping to

           gain points on reputation with endusers
        </li>
        <li>
           gain converts (they call partners) who subsequently have to licence an "advanced version" of their donated standard (but nolonger <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>) to do more serious applications?
