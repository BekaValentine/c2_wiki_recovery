        Any suggestions on whether to use Wiki as a development tool?
      </p>
      <p>
        What sort of developement tool? It's not much use as a compiler, or source code control.  It could serve as a project management or bug tracking system.  There are several pages that discuss that.  Or something other than software development, like commericial sales or community development?
      </p>
      <p>
        This page's title doesn't enlighten as to the content.  Perhaps a better choice would be Wiki<name of tool>.

        <em>It's not much use as ... source code control.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why not?  
      </p>
      <p>
        What if the wiki were implemented on top of a version control software (like RCS), and didn't do the page formatting translations?
      </p>
      <p>
        The build and tests could be managed from the server using something like <a href="CruiseControl.html">CruiseControl</a> that would build and run tests as soon as a change was made.
      </p>
      <p>
        Emacs (and probably other editors) could be made to get source code from the wiki, and save it to the wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using wiki as a source-code control tool would be something like WebDAV already is.  Some SCM tools are already using WebDAV -- <a href="SubVersion.html">SubVersion</a> being one that I know of.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why use a wiki for that instead of something like </em><a href="WebDav.html">WebDav</a>?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Because I didn't know <a href="WebDav.html">WebDav</a> existed, or what <a href="SubVersion.html">SubVersion</a> was.  Now that I know, I'm going to have a look at <a href="SubVersion.html">SubVersion</a>.
