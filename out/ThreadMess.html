        The key to a good page is that it's short, to the point, and generative of other pages. <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> encourages the development of <a href="WikiAsDrama.html">WikiAsDrama</a> at the expense of <a href="WikiAsExploration.html">WikiAsExploration</a>.
      </p>

        Cleaning <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>es, especially your own, is being a <a href="GoodWikiCitizen.html">GoodWikiCitizen</a>. Especially if you find yourself about to add comments to a <em>mature</em> <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> discussion, first consider refactoring it. Just make certain the thread is <em>mature</em> - it's all played out and cool.
      </p>
      <p>
        The traditional way to do this is to separate the old threads into a page of their own called <PageX>Discussion. That way anyone who feels particularly attached to some particular edit can still find it easily and <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> it wherever they think it fits better.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is important because often <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> occurs when contributors add content that is almost on-topic for a page, but subtly misses the point that the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> is trying to make; that is, the <a href="ThesisAntithesisSynthesis.html">ThesisAntithesisSynthesis</a> can't happen because there is too much noise. A page may contain very good content that is still noise <em>to that page.</em> If one comes across misplaced content cluttering up a <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> discussion it is one's duty to move the good stuff to where it can be useful. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Then leave a note to show what the removed material was and where its new home is located. Lousy content -- chatter, drivel, and other fluff -- can be moved to a Discussion page without any mention at all. If it had value, it'll show up again.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the discussion is very long, or if it recurs, also consider <a href="PageVersioning.html">PageVersioning</a>.

        Discussion moved, of course, to <a href="ThreadMessDiscussion.html">ThreadMessDiscussion</a>.
