        <strong>The claim</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a> claims of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, <a href="ItWorks.html">ItWorks</a>. He further states that the solution is not to make major alterations in the way the wiki software works which would remove the openness, wikiness and other ineffable qualities that make <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> special. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The solution</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A solution which works using the same software involves recognition that if wikizens become concerned and active in those things which are of "common" interest, problems will be marginalized. Wiki problems derive from folks acting in selfish ways to further their own interest at the expense of the common interest.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>An Objection</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        That <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> history tends to show that it doesn't work (it is purely utopic to dream of bringing all members of a diverse community onto the same wave-length), that proclaiming a "common" interest would only help to repeat <a href="TragedyOfTheCommons.html">TragedyOfTheCommons</a>, and that no practical solutions to current practical problems have been advanced.

        The original discussion:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Wiki is more like London Hyde Park's Speakers' Corner than it is like Oxford University.</em> (<a href="BritishCulturalAssumption.html">BritishCulturalAssumption</a>... Interestingly this claim was made by an American who is familiar with both places) [For others who do not know: Speakers' Corner, Marble Arch, at a corner of London's Hyde Park, is one of the world's most famous locations symbolizing the democratic right of free speech.]
      </p>

        There are two different dynamics and levels of authority involved. For EruditeExclamations from the TenuredVoicesOfAAuthority, you go to one; to hear the voices directed toward common folk, you go to the other. <a href="HorsesForCourses.html">HorsesForCourses</a>.

        <dd>Speakers' Corner has had a more powerful influence than any "<em>university</em>" in the world, because here there are no entry requirements, no rules of intellectual formality and above all, no class restrictions. It is, as Leslie James the Hyde Park pamphleteer wrote, a fitting location to represent <strong>"<em>the century of the common man</em>"</strong>.</dd>

        <dd>There is, of course, a widespread belief that Speakers' Corner is some kind of "<em>nuthouse</em>", where "<em>cranks</em>" and tourists go. This idea is widespead, particularly amongst those who visit it only once. Lenin once related the story of a man who was wildly shaking, seated, his arms were swinging around; the observer thought it was a madman, but upon closer inspection he discovered it was a man sharpening a knife.</dd>

      <p>
        <em>Of course, any comparison between </em><a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> and Speakers' Corner is void on so many grounds that it constitutes <a href="ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof.html">ShiftingTheBurdenOfProof</a> to even raise it in this context. SpeakersCorner creates no content, wiki is meant to create content through open collaboration and sharing of knowledge and experiences. The idea that we should subordinate this purpose to the purpose of being an outlet where everybody shout their 2c on equal footing is borderline idiotic and has nothing to do with <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> as originally intended. If you are looking for such an agora, you can find it on <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a> or <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>. Like you said, <a href="HorsesForCourses.html">HorsesForCourses</a>, but wiki is not the course you think it is. The good thing is that <a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a> can also accommodate a SpeakersCorner and let it compete against the more reliable edited content. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        SpeakersCorner does not represent what change is necessary, but rather what happens when there are no entry barriers. There is shouting and subordination present within wiki. There is no referee, no expert, no adjudicator. Witness <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> for the past 6 months and you will find much evidence to support and prove this. Content is created in both places and there is a sense in which it's remembered and a sense in which it's forgotten and erased. In wiki, it remains in words which may change; at SpeakersCorner, the remains reside in the fleeting memory of those who take part. Metaphors are patterns which fit somewhat but not at all [in some points, but not in all points]. Comparisons are relative, not absolute. It may be said that "Borderline Idiocy" does exist within wiki, as you and others have pointed out several times in responses to that which is deemed so. Wiki is open. Wiki is accurate and inaccurate, Wiki is changing moment by moment, Wiki can be valuable and at the same time it can be worthless, <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>. Wiki is not and cannot become a place where correctness, stability, and scholarship reside if it allows those who do not exhibit such characteristics to participate. Wiki reflects its participants and it is such a place we now have where the inept, the expert, and merely curious mix it up. Let's hope that the collaboration you speak of occurs and that those who are expert will make the corrections necessary to make wiki UsefulUsableAndUsed. -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
        <em>Yes, and if you allow the expert and the inept to mix up you got what you've got now, and what you've gotten for the past year: crappy mediocrity that can only go further down because experts have a huge disincentive to waste their effort in the chemical dump. The "let's hope" part of yours is wishful thinking. The </em><a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a> would allow the "correctness stability and scholarship" (or in more modest term just a meritocracy) to happen on wiki by letting everybody participate but allowing both the readers and writers the freedom to choose whom they trust. What you have now is that the only meritocracy is the meritocracy of <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>, of the obsessive repetition and of junk. <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> as it stands now is broken and we all know it, just some people perpetuate their delusion that it is not.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        "If you allow", does not mix well with openness. Mixing of the expert and the inept is called education. Experts do not waste their time in senseless edit wars and tramping around in the "chemical dump". They create "expert content". They post that which is accurate, correct and stable and maintain it in that condition. The inept learn from that and emulate it. When they fail to be accurate the experts lend a hand in correction. Correction in the form of this is what fits here or this is a better solution here, or it will work better if ... Experts who have expertise and wish to share it, can find in this wiki a host of those who will listen and learn. It will however be found that experts who with condescension and abruptness degrade, denounce and pronounce things as stupid, silly, or idiotic will not garner much awe and respect. It is the mix of the expert and the novice that is basic in the preservation of crafts, the teaching of skills, and the betterment of the whole society. If the experts want only to be sheltered in the ivory towers of peer recognition and review, without the sharing of such expertise in the plains outside those towers, eventually the experts will lose sight of the practicality of that learning in the common and mundane.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not see the wiki as broken; I do, however, see those who are doing things which will break parts of it. I have chosen not to participate in such destruction and failure. I will continue to "live in the delusion that I and others who mix it up with me are not breaking it". I will continue to "trust those who seem more willing to construct, promote, contribute and exhort, and be delusional that such people exist". I will continue to concentrate on actions and activities which will be constructive, helpful and which have "merit". I have been here a long time, and do not intend to leave or to give up now. I navigate this Wiki with a list of all of its pages, and intend to read as many as seem of interest to me.
      </p>
      <p>
        Broken - no, Some torn sails, perhaps. But Ward and his Wiki have navigated through these waters before and the ship has remained afloat going on now for almost ten years. Not many Internet/Programming/Products/Languages/Schemas/etc. can claim such consistency and success. Wiki can Change, Wiki is Changing, Wiki is Change. I proposed long ago that it is a <a href="NobleExperiment.html">NobleExperiment</a> and a <a href="PositiveDialogueCommunity.html">PositiveDialogueCommunity</a>. I still think it is.

        <em>This nice theory of yours failed to verify in practice for more than a year already, and before it worked only partially and with limited results. You are delusional when you refuse to confront the reality that those nice people you theorize about cannot practically make any difference in a wiki where rogue behavior and aggressive mediocrity have the greatest reward. Keep you head in the sand, Donald, the situation is pretty rosy down there.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In addition:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Be that as it may, there are folks thinking that wiki should be only one way, and they are absolutist in their conviction that wiki "can never" and "will never" ... That's not a reason to think that the current </em><a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a> will be the end of wiki as they know it. Under the current proposal they can also have Wiki exactly the way they want it, except that others may enjoy the liberty <strong>not to engage</strong> in futile <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a>, <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s and so on, so forth. There will still be a RawMaterialWiki_ identical with the existing one. If they think the wiki purity is best and the community doesn't need elementary protection mechanisms, they certainly can make their "head in the sand" version of wiki better than any edited version. And if they think that futile fights against rogue behavior is a price worth paying for this elusive "purity", they will certainly enjoy that. I can assure them that the likes of RA will never disappoint them and will give them the pleasure of fighting for the RawMaterialWiki_.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        After initially thinking no response was necessary, decided against that notion:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           What was described was a practice, not a theory.
        </li>
        <li>
           Working with nice people (they exist), results in collaboration, development of signal (content that informs, aids, describes, presents, outlines, endures), does not produce the noisy confrontation, deletion and conflict which typifies some who see wiki only through the short lens of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           If I encounter aggression and opposition regarding a post, and someone deletes it, I restore it once (while I may make some needed changes in it in the mean time). If it is deleted again, I leave it deleted. If it attracted the killer-bees it must not have properly done. I recollect, reform and repost in another more accommodating place, or in a better format and with different and better construction. I view my opponents and their moves as an opportunity to learn. (Isn't that similar to learning to play chess well?)
        </li>
        <li>
           It is not through "burying one's head in the sand", and refusal to consider other's views and opinions (moves) that one accommodates to a "real world". A real world includes everybody, friends, foes and those who you may encounter in passing. It includes not only your King, Queen, Knights, Rooks, Pawns, and your opponents pieces in the game before you, but other instances, situations, the history and outcomes of all you have encountered and choose to remember (a sharpened saw).
        </li>
        <li>
           For me there is no "Raw Wiki", no "head in the sands Wiki", there is just "Wiki". It is all "Edited Wiki" found from time to time in the editors of tens, hundreds, and thousands.
        </li>
        <li>
           "Wiki is", Wiki was", and soon "Wiki will be".

        Here's your <strong>theory</strong>, quoted directly from you: <em>Mixing of the expert and the inept is called education. Experts do not waste their time in senseless edit wars and tramping around in the "chemical dump". They create "expert content".</em>. It is a theory because it does not reflect what happened or what happens, it reflects your idealized, rosy glasses picture of what is supposed to happen. In conflict with your theory, the reality of Wiki is that experts left wiki, the very few that remained are reluctant to contribute anything of substance or value, not even <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s are able to perform much of their good work any more, and the overall experience of Wiki has been a quagmire for the last year or so. It is burying the head in the sand the fact that you idealize a version of wiki that was proven inadequate in real life. And no, your ramblings have nothing to do with learning chess. Among the top quality a chess player needs to have is to adapt to changing situations and confront the reality. "Working with nice people" sounds good in theory, except few if any nice people have collaborated recently on wiki to produce <a href="ReallyValuableContent.html">ReallyValuableContent</a>. You theorize about how it should be, the reality that these experts and nice people did not subscribe to your theoretical view of wiki, but voted with their feet.
      </p>
      <p>
        Your theory is that "If I encounter aggression and opposition regarding a post, and someone deletes it, I restore it once", and that this represents a model of behaviour that if followed by others only milk and honey will flow all through wiki and every problem will be solved. The grunt reality is that if an expert's contribution is quagmired by the inept chaff of somebody like RA, then that person will have a better use of his/her time than to waste it on a forum where she is hassled by idiots. No matter how much you want to handwave about openness and wiki ideals the results speak for themselves: the ration of signal to noise have evolved towards negative records, resulting in a net loss to wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the reality of it, because that's how it happened and it continues to happen. Your head in the sand vision of how wiki should be does not address any such problems other than repeating wishful thoughts of wiki glory that have no real correspondent in reality. I got news for you: things <strong>change</strong>, things can evolve towards different, better, worse). Only the chronically unadapted get stuck in the same place, dreaming of the ever elusive GoldenAge that has long disappeared and may never really have existed in the first place. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        Interesting how you have taken:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If I encounter aggression and opposition regarding a post, and someone deletes it, I restore it once. <em>If it is deleted again, I leave it deleted. If all it attracted was killer-bees it must not have been very good. I recollect, reform and repost in another more accommodating place, or in a better format and with better construction. I view my opponents and their moves as an opportunity to learn. </em>(Isn't that similar to learning to play chess well?)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        And form the following conclusion:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Only the chronically unadapted get stuck in the same place, dreaming of the ever elusive </em>GoldenAge that has long disappeared and may never really existed in the first place.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        You have failed to consider that a full two-thirds of my comment (in italics) is about adaptation in conflict, improvement and learning. It is all about responding by making changes. (Isn't that how you play chess?) (By nice people, I mean not those who agree with you or are sympathetic or supportive, I mean those who play by the rules.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I haven't failed to consider any of that. The rules are deeply flawed in the current situation, and it is time to consider changing the rules. The fact that you consider changing anything </em>'but<strong> the rules, which is what is needed to attain the goals of this community allows me to derive my conclusions. If you are willing to make changes in all the wrong places or in places where it doesn't matter, but rule out changes where they can make a difference, then you're not really willing to make changes. Nobody in the world will convince me that say experts need to change their convictions or their way of presentation to make it appealing to idiots, nor do good people need to make changes in order to make RA and the likes "happy" (for some value of happy). In real life </strong>it doesn't work that way<strong>. In real life there are environments that shield the experts from having to waste their energy defending against idiots (i.e. peer reviewed environments like ), or you get environments like Wiki where in the end experts </strong>just leave<strong>, because the environment is counter-productive. Current </strong><a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a> tries to advance an environment where experts and non-experts can interact, and even experts with different views can interact more easily, but there will always be a plausible and workable recourse against rogue behavior, ignorance, stupidity, and there will never be a need for an <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>, nor will there be any need for interminable <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> arguments.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is no workable recourse against such things in the current version of wiki. And this has been proven time and again and is so bloody obvious to so many people that only sticking your head in the sand can make you claim otherwise.

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In the end, I guess I'll have to take my own prescribed medicine, and I'll say that you either get it or you don't. Trying to explain it any more than I did is counterproductive waste for both of us and for this page. -- Costin </em>

        It is true that: <em>The grunt reality is that if an expert's contribution is quagmired by the inept chaff of somebody ..., then that person will have a better use of his/her time than to waste it on a forum where she is hassled ...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Consider this: There are some very interesting thing happening on this thing we call the internet, and that some of the experts are getting involved in those things instead of being here. Their going does not mean that their doings have gone with them. They remain untouched by <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, untouched by those who would purify the wiki by making it in an image "they" consider proper.
      </p>
      <p>
        Therefore: I can be found reading AllPages (trying to read from a list a selection of from 20 to 100) per day. It is when I am doing this that I can be found <a href="CollectingWikiGems.html">CollectingWikiGems</a>, making minor edits and corrections, an occasional deletion, restoring a page defaced by a WikiSpammer, Adding an appropriate category classification, putting in my 2cents worth, an occasional laugh, and sometimes following a link to a place I've never been. Experts, at least those I call experts, are doing some of the same things, but because they are experts, what they do receives little notice, because it is so right and it follows the rules.
      </p>
      <p>
        I do not consider this exchange a waste of time, for it has extracted something from both of us which until now had not been said quite in the way it has been.
      </p>
      <p>
        I am for change, a change which is fundamental and coherent, harmonious with Ward's original ideas of openness, etc. But the problem that exists, exists because people do not act in the interests of the whole. They act in ways they see and agree unto themselves. It is behavior which needs to be changed, not procedures.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is complete nonsense. Of course people will <strong>justifiably</strong> act in their own interest, and not for the elusive interest <em>of the whole</em>, whatever whole that may be. That's why people left Wiki when wiki became a chemical dump, and will have no interest in subscribing to an illusional idea that "behavior" needs to change so that everybody acts in the interest of the "whole". And claiming that your change is coherent with Ward's original ideas, while implying that other avenues are not, is further unsubstantiated nonsense.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As long as people bring into this wiki in your page, their page, someone else's page a boxing ring, and step in it, challenging all comers, and as long as there exists those who will be distracted by the lights and the cheering mobs and as long as there are those who will strap on the gloves and enter the ring, there will be knock-downs and drag-outs.

        I also think that changing the software is in the province of the provider of the medium. It seems in your description of the problem that the defect is not in the way the "software works", but in the way <strong>some</strong> of its "users work".
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The problems are with both. The software was not designed to address the set of circumstances that we find later. It has assumptions embedded in it that no longer are true. But even for users with best of intentions the software has obvious limitations in providing for fruitful collaboration. A software change will also <strong>empower</strong> the community with <strong>effective</strong> tools to address the social problems with social means.

        It is my contention that the actions of a few do not typify the action of the majority.

        <li>
           Your contention is both inaccurate and irrelevant for so many reasons I don't know where to begin, and it would be a waste of my time to give you all the reasons. There's no such thing as a majority. There's not even such thing as <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> as a reliable actor in the process. Those who pretended to speak for <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> at one point or the other were mostly doing for the cheap rhetorical trick it provided.

        In every organization and effort involving human interaction there will exist those who fail to value cooperation and subordination of self in a common good. Such is life. It is a common misconception that making rules and regulations will fix that. It is my conception that discipline that works is self-imposed. Communities work because there exist commonalities that are embraced by those involved in its actions, which are derived from common values. Communities are disrupted when members allow those who would try to impose disharmonious values and actions to garner the attention and disapproval of those who have ensured that <a href="ItWorks.html">ItWorks</a>. In giving attention and disapproval, the fabric of commonality is disrupted. When and if such disruption becomes big enough and involves a significant number of the active community, it is only natural for some to blame the system. Cries begin to be made, ItDoesntWork, what do we need to do to make it work.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Complete nonsense. The cry is not only that it doesn't work (and it actually <strong>does not work</strong>), but also that we are not empowered to fix it. The proof that it does not work is even a well-intentioned guy like you can have a completely crappy understanding of the opposite point of view, generating tons of noise on this page. Your not making conversation, here, Donald, you talk to yourself.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It becomes an exercise in changing a working system because of those whom we recognize and empower by allowing them to successfully employ techniques which deflect the intentions and interests of a working community.
      </p>
      <p>
        It has been a working community for nearly ten years. Stick around and you will see it remain a working community for ten more. This is because it is a community based on simplicity and the belief that community can exist.

           You probably try to say that it has had problems for ten years and counting. It has continued to lose valuable contributor after valuable contributor. It reached 30000 pages, the vast majority of which are crappy, therefore decreasing signal to noise ratio to negligible quantities. During those years, Ward already burnt the disk packs once. You're trying to portray the image of your projected wiki that never really existed.

           From: <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20050310120451/http://www.freemasonrytoday.co.uk/issue23-julian.shtml">http://web.archive.org/web/20050310120451/http://www.freemasonrytoday.co.uk/issue23-julian.shtml</a>

               But at the same time, action undertaken collectively with others is so often more purposeful and effective than individual strivings. I have been reading Ian McEwans Enduring Love. I wont spoil the story if you have yet to read it, but in the first Chapter there is a situation where six men try to hold down a helium balloon to prevent it soaring away with a small boy marooned in the basket. While the six hold on, there is a chance the balloon may not break free, but in all their minds there is doubt; doubt that the six of them may not be enough to hold the balloon down, but also doubt about each one's physical ability to hold on. A nice dilemma. The first one to let go effectively scuppers the rescue attempt of the remaining five, four of whom then let go, one after the other. The last, who perseveres on his own, lets go only when he can physically hold on no longer, by which time it is too late and he falls to his death. I need hardly spell out the moral for you. Not only can we achieve collectively far more than we can individually, but an endeavour may only be attainable if we don't let go, if we work together and in harmony of purpose and action.

        <em>Sure, collective effort, peace and love and all that jazz, they're all nice. But beyond nice words you have to confront reality. You can have efforts that are wasted in vain, and you can have smart efforts. One small adjustment may have orders of magnitude greater effects. That we can achieve collectively great things has nothing to do with our discussion. The question is if we proceed to do it in a dumb way (that is without taking into account whether out theories measure up to what really happened), or we can do it smartly including </em><a href="SharpenTheSaw.html">SharpenTheSaw</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I shall characterize your position as a gratuitously utopic idealism, stuck in the admiration of the blunt saw, that refuses to even contemplate the idea of sharpening the saw for fear of losing the ineffable experience of the blunt saw. The bottom line becomes not cutting the wood, but the very experience of using the blunt saw. Maybe, in your parable, one of those guys could have come up with a smarter solution rather than hanging desperately to the ropes, so that's as far as argument by analogy goes. Thus you militate to hold a community hostage to one particular utopia. No matter how blunt the saw, the community can always put more effort into using the beautifully blunt saw.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Let me present this paradox to you: Why not practice what you preach, Donald, and subordinate your private and passionate stuckness to your private </em>WikiTopia, to the common goal of building a better and more effective community? How can you claim that others act egocentrically and spoil wiki by following their own interest, when you yourself cannot be sure that you do not act just the same? This paradox should make it clear to you that there's no such thing as a communal mindset that can be used as an etalon [<em>Is there no better word?</em>] to make judgement values on individual actions and behaviors. Your "communal" attitude is nothing but a peculiar version of individualism, proclaiming that one's Utopia should be considered as <strong>the</strong> communal utopia.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In contrast to </em><a href="ChangeTheCommunity.html">ChangeTheCommunity</a> proposal, <a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a> tries to just let the individual be, without requiring <strong>everyone</strong> to be subordinated to any "communal" goals, principles or even worse, value judgements as a precondition to have a satisfactory wiki. Thus a true sense of community (and possibly several interacting communities) can emerge when the freedom of individual agents is maximized.<em> -- </em><a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        "true sense of community", I like that, If the <a href="WikiChangeProposal.html">WikiChangeProposal</a> can bring that about while letting the individual be, not requiring subordination to ..goals, ..principle, or value judgements, while employing maximized freedom. Sounds practical, realistic and doable. May it be so. <em>Does sound a little like the emergence of a different (dare we say change of a) community (or communities).</em>

        <em>Can you swim in the same river twice, Donald? If your answer is yes, in spite of the water never being the same in the river, you'll be part of the same community even as the community evolves. If your answer is no, much less you'll be able to participate in the same community no matter what.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The river, the water, and the swimmer are different at different times. You can swim in the river, yes. You can swim in the river twice, yes. The river is changing, yes. The swimmer is changing, yes. Yes four times, No, zero times.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can be in a community without taking part in the "sense of the community". What we do in that community changes it by either reinforcing that "sense", or by destroying that "sense".
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>And what would make you presume that by evolving the rules the sense of community would be destroyed rather than reinforced? On the contrary, by making life in community easier for its members, one would presume the attachment to the community would not be diminished. Practical reality check: shall I enumerate tons of </em><a href="ReallyValuableContent.html">ReallyValuableContent</a> creators that left the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> in frustration with the current circumstances? Could it be that the current set of rules help destroy the sense of community by being hopelessly inadequate? Never mind that, Donald, let no facts interfere with your firmly held conviction. We can beat this dead horse to the end, as long as you don't want to account for reality this conversation is impossible.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Think about what you just said. The horse is dead, and you are still found putting things in the saddle bags: i.e. "And what would make you presume that by evolving the rules the sense of community would be destroyed rather than reinforced?"

      <p>
        <em>The two are not symmetrical and it's trivial to make the difference, however I'll spell it out for you. Once something does not work, or does not work quite well, one is supposed to ask the </em>'what<strong> (did not work), </strong>why<strong> (it did not work) and the </strong>how<strong> (can we improve things for the future) and do some </strong><a href="CriticalThinking.html">CriticalThinking</a> about it. It follows that evolving the rules to address these things according to some rationale, while it cannot offer any absolute guarantees, it offers better prospects than being stuck in the same muddy place. That's how smart people react and adapt. That was supposed to have been something obvious to the guy who wrote <a href="SuccessOrientedApproach.html">SuccessOrientedApproach</a>: if you have a failure, you adapt and you change by addressing the causes of failure. Practice what you preach, Donald.<em></em>

        One must recognize to what degree one can address correction of that which is not within one's powers of correction. One can, however, address some of the brokenness with selective and considered use of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. Such as in the construction of such pages as RelevantChanges (which perhaps would be more correctly labeled <a href="CategorizedChanges.html">CategorizedChanges</a>). It is a matter of using, and not abusing the available vehicle which has been provided for us. It is users realizing and acting as though they are members of a cooperative and collaborative community that will make Wiki continue to Work.
