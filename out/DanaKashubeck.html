        I work for a very small company which is busily porting Objective-C apps from NeXT. Yes, we still use NeXT here for our day-to-day operations!

        Most of my Objective-C experience has been with <a href="WebObjects.html">WebObjects</a>, but I have done some Cocoa work. I took Aaron Hillegass' fabulous class at the Big Nerd Ranch (which I highly recommend, by the way).
