      <p>
        Backpedalling is a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a> wherein one piece of code is executed which then has to go through various indicators, data stores, and state queries to figure out what had happened earlier, in other functions. It shows that a LineOfCommunication has been broken. 
      </p>
      <p>
        When code does something, it knows it's doing it. It can communicate that to a function to-be-named-later, who will know with certainty exactly what it's supposed to be doing.
