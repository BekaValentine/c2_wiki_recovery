        <strong>What books does everyone have in their personal libraries, and what are their publishers?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What a bizarre question. As if you expect it to be a half dozen books, rather than a number much too long to list. You'd be very sorry if all us bibliophiles answered you literally.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (Doesn't this belong @ /.?) I didn't expect complete answers. I didn't even completely answer my own question! The <em>intent</em> was to think about how one's collection gathered, and I also wanted a general survey of some good (and bad) books.  Perhaps the question wasn't worded correctly.

      <p>
        Could you explain a little bit more? What's a "warring pattern?"

        <em>Hello there! I wanted </em>SomethingNew, but it turned out to be a vacuous page. I suggest you delete it.<em></em>

        Hu?  Your comment is a little vacuous.  Just kidding.  ;)  Could you explain that comment again, since it confuses me?
