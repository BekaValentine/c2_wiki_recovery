        Talking about structure...The structure of many Wikis I have seen so far need a bit of serious editing. I'm wondering whether you have any ideas on this. Someone like a moderator on a mailing list. An editor. As the wiki is more successful it might just be crushed by its own weight, because it has no structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        So, who's going to be confident (arrogant) enough to think that she understands what the others actually want to say, and reformat the whole discussion, adding structure, chapters, paragraphs, an index, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, it'd be cool when *additions* would be highlighted in bright colours so that you can more easily read up when your already familiar with the wiki.

        In the edits at the top of the page (meant to create a clear distinction between the topic - KM - and the discussion about the format), led me to the following point:
      </p>
      <p>
        Why do I say that knowledge is linked with people and time? Well, because i feel that knowledge without context is of lesser value. There is an old saying "it is not what you know, but who you know" there is a lot hidden in this simple sentence.

        I've also been thinking about patterns and knowledge and computation. Patterns are powerful partly because they are generative grammars. Generative grammars are powerful. I'm groping towards some insight involving the <a href="ChomskyHierarchy.html">ChomskyHierarchy</a>, where simple languages are recognized by finite state machines, more complex ones by push-down automata, and the most complex need full Turing machines. There's some connection between the language we use for talking (and thinking), and the computational power of a Turing machine.

        On "Who you know" - provenance of ideas is important. If I know who wrote a page, I can discount for known stupidity, or pay more attention to known experts. This is important on the WWW because anyone can put up a web site containing any kind of rotten information. Schoolchildren need to be taught how to discriminate between web sources, and provenance is one of the tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        Part of <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> is that because anyone can edit anything, the pages reflect, more or less, the consensus of the community. Bad stuff gets deleted, or at least annotated with an explanation of why it is bad. This means the provenance of individual paragraphs is less important for signalling quality. Rather then, "I'm not going to believe anything unless it has Ward's name on it", it's kinda enough to know Ward read it and didn't delete it.
      </p>
      <p>
        This strikes me as rather radical and unlike the rest of the <a href="WorldWideWeb.html">WorldWideWeb</a>.

It's possible to keep track of who read what and when, and who the author was, etc. Also to detect edit conflicts, to recover accidental or malicious deletions, and the like.

        In the sense of "managing useful information", all the above is great, and proven. Has anyone actually listened to, or read, the real KM-speak?

        I agree there is much hype in the air around KM. The comments in this community on the superiority of patterns is an interesting case I think of <a href="GroupThink.html">GroupThink</a>. I have seen references and appeals to the <a href="ScientificMethod.html">ScientificMethod</a> and to logic, but patterns like process, carry a certain type of 'blindness', they too are social artifacts.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many who come to KM will depart with a sense of shallowness and may feel some snake oil but there is an interesting and lasting quality to working with knowledge that parallels the TQM movement. Those who wish to get something of lasting value from KM should look to the social aspects of collaboration, communion and critique, seek opportunity in new perspectives of work practice, learning, innovation and knowledge sharing.
      </p>
      <p>
        An interesting connection between KM and patterns is the <a href="DataMining.html">DataMining</a> movement who seek to discover patterns in data streams. Data mining uses algorithms to search for possible patterns and relies on people to interpret the significance and meaning of the 'discoveries'.

        I desire knowledge. I am leery of <a href="KnowledgeManagement.html">KnowledgeManagement</a>. I love learning new patterns. Most talk about patterns is vapid. I've enjoyed the conversation about <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> because it is concrete and tells me what to do, and I can use it to give concrete advice to others.

        Used to be a content freak at one time. Now I have come to value the synergy, innovation and negotiation in deep dialog. It is through conversation that all patterns are tested, evaluated, appreciated. After you have a closet full of patterns, you realize you have to come into the conversation to use, improve, announce, evangelize and make your patterns work. Sure you can apply them in isolation, but you will reap the rewards in an island economy too.

In particular, its use for small research teams where collaborative documentation is the main artifactual representation and product. Can anyone help me locate Wiki examples (templates?) where this genre is used for problem solving, co-ordination, scheduling and tracking commitments, or good exemplars of capturing design rationale?

        I am working in this field also. I've tried to use a Wiki engine but it fell short when dealing with some information (like version handling, lifecycles, rights...) I ran against a product called Enabler for Softlab and it fits the bill for knowledge storage. It would be nice to build a wiki-like interface for it. I will do it in the coming months (or weeks).
