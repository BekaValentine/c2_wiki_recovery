        My name is Kent Kirby.  I work for AT&T Laboratories in
        Kansas City.  I have worked in Object Oriented technologies
        for 5 years.  I have performed the duties of <a href="SystemArchitect.html">SystemArchitect</a> for the past two years within the Network Services
        Division of AT&T. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I have designed and implemented three Object Oriented
        systems.  As I have matured in my design skills I have 
        become more interested in "<a href="DesignPatterns.html">DesignPatterns</a>".  I attended
        a patterns workshop at OOPSLA '95 led by the gang-of-four.
        Having read the gamma, etc. book I have begun to use some
        of the patterns described within there.
