        Disease Control
      </h1>
      <p>
        Why all the fuss about SARS? The only reason it's a problem is because of human stupidity, because of deliberate sabotaging of the steps necessary to effectively deal with the problem. Just like in the Alien movies where the xenomorphs are only a problem because of human treason.
      </p>
      <p>
        So let's outline the necessary steps to effective <a href="DiseaseControl.html">DiseaseControl</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           make breaking quarantine a criminal act on a par with multiple homicide
        </li>
        <li>
           make the non-reporting of symptoms a serious criminal act
        </li>
        <li>
           treat hospital waste separately from hospital food
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The unwillingness to give disease control specialists absolute powers is the only reason why multiply-resistant strep and AIDS are problems in the developed world. If we had effective disease control, we wouldn't even bother looking for cures. Which probably explains why corporations don't have any interest in it.

        Some good news is coming though. Cures for the voracious diseases called 'rabbits', 'mosquitos' and 'cats' are on the horizon. They depend on Horning Genes which cause sterility and eventually extinction. So within a couple decades, Australia may finally be rid of the rabbit plague, and the world may be rid of the carrier for WestNile virus and malaria.

        <em>What ? Yes, many people thought that 'cats' carried Black Plague. They were wrong. Rats carried the Plague. Killing the cats just made things worse.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I think you misunderstood buddy. The point isn't that cats are a <em>carrier</em> of disease. No, cats <strong>are</strong> a disease.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>woof, woof!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You know, I've yet to see a dog eat a cat. Or kill one. Hell, even chase one.

        And of course, there's computer viruses. Here again, lack of genuine ComputerSecurity is the reason for the repeated infections.
