        Managed Collection
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <em>managed collection</em> is a collection of objects/data with the following properites:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Collection is deemed to "own" the data which it contains; external pointers from outside the collection into the internals of the collection are <a href="ConsideredHarmful.html">ConsideredHarmful</a>.  External code may make <em>copies</em> of the data; or keep pointers if the data is invariant (in which case, a copy and a reference are semantically indistinguishable--assuming, of course, the collection doesn't overwrite the underyling storage in the presence of external pointers).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Collection enforces one or more <em>invariants</em> on the data.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Mutation of the data only occurs through "official" channels (often using <em>transactions</em>, which can fail if invariants aren't satisfied).  ACID or ACI semantics are common (though not strictly required for some applications).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           This is one reason that keeping pointers to the guts is often verboten--if one can mutate a managed object directly; this might cause the invariant to become violated.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Due to the use of transactions, other side effects can be made to occur upon completion of a transaction.
        </li>
      </ul>

        The canonical example of a <a href="ManagedCollection.html">ManagedCollection</a> is a <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a>.  Other database topologies may also qualify.  The <a href="RelationalDatabase.html">RelationalDatabase</a> is a preferred solution for many applications. (At least by <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s.)
