        Virtual Object
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="VirtualObject.html">VirtualObject</a> is an object that doesn't formally exist within the framework of the programming language. It exists as word, concept and object in the framework of the <a href="LopLanguage.html">LopLanguage</a>. -- <a href="HelmutLeitner.html">HelmutLeitner</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        These examples are trivial. They are not meant to teach something new. They are necessary to explain the term <a href="VirtualObject.html">VirtualObject</a> as it is used in <a href="LanguageOrientedProgramming.html">LanguageOrientedProgramming</a>. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The following function calls are without an explicit object reference. The words  "World" and "System" represent the <a href="VirtualObject.html">VirtualObject</a>s (no need to explain them).
      </p>
      <code>
        wtime=WorldRetTime()<br/>
        wtime=World.retTime()<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        stime=SystemRetTime()<br/>
        stime=System.retTime()<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Usually programmers would use terms like "namespace" or "toolkit class" to speak about such a situation. But note that in <a href="LanguageOrientedProgramming.html">LanguageOrientedProgramming</a> the words "World" and "System" are not arbitrary, they are meant to model real objects. They have to be justified, defined and documented before you are allowed to use them. 
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        The following function calls use more than one parameter as an object reference.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rewritten (and extended) from the standard C library:
      </p>
      <code>
        MemClear(p,size)<br/>
        MemSetChr(p,size,char)<br/>
        MemCmpStr(p,size,s)<br/>
        StrCpyMem(s,p,size)<br/>
        FileCpyMem(filename,p,size)<br/>
        MemFindStr(p,size,s)<br/>
        MemFindChr(p,size,char)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The object Mem is represented by a Pointer and Size parameter (and means an arbitrary range of RAM memory). It stands for an object abstraction that does only exist in the mind of the programmer. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why not actually represent Mem as a object (strictly an ADT) that holds the pointer and size as member variables, and controls access to those variables with methods or access functions?</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Answer one: usually this abstraction is only valid for a very short time, say one or two function calls. So the overhead of an object doesn't make sense.
        </li>
        <li>
           Answer two: very often it *is* made an object, but then it aquires a meaning, additional functionality and a name. So it is not the virtual object Mem anymore. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Just an example from a "higher level":
      </p>
      <code>
        ImageRectClear(image,pRect);<br/>
        Image.RectClear(image,pRect);<br/>
        ImageRectWriteFile(image,pRect,"test.jpg");<br/>
        Image.RectWriteFile(image,pRect,"test.jpg");<br/>
        ImageRectSetColor(image,pRect);   <br/>
        ImageRectMoveKxyAbs(image,pRect,x,y);   <br/>
        ImageRectMoveKxyRel(image,pRect,delta_x,delta_y);   <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In this case ImageRect is an abstraction that may be used in a lot of functions but is not (and perhaps will never be) an object of its own. <a href="LanguageOrientedProgramming.html">LanguageOrientedProgramming</a> requires that such potential for introducing order  and symmetry in an API is used.
