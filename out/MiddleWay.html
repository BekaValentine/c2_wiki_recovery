        Middle Way
      </h1>
      <p>
        Madhyamaka: (Sanskrit) The middle way, a system of analysis founded by Nagarjuna, based on the prajnaparamita sutras of Shakyamuni Buddha, and considered to be the supreme presentation of the wisdom of emptiness 
        (from <a href="http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/glossary_lr.htm).">http://www.buddhanet.net/e-learning/history/glossary_lr.htm).</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        My commentary:
        Following the Middle Way, one avoids the two extreme views: eternalism and nihilism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Eternalism, roughly, is belief in an unconditional, solid reality or permanence - belief in a solid, permanent self.
      </p>
      <p>
        Nihilism is the view that things happen for no rhyme or reason, or through fate. 
      </p>
      <p>
        As Saraha said (something like), the one who believes he exists has got it very wrong; but the one who believes he doesn't is dumber than a cow.
