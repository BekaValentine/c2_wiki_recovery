        Tab Delimited Tables
      </h1>
      <p>
        Software such as SuperCalc, dBase II, Excel, and many other RegisteredTrademarks have had the ability to emit <a href="TabDelimitedTables.html">TabDelimitedTables</a> for years. Often, these tables have a header which names the field in the column below it. This facilitates data interchange between various pieces of software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rod Manis, Evan Schaffer, and Robert JÃ¸rgensen have written a book titled <strong>Unix Relational Database Management</strong>. ISBN013938622x
        They describe a suite of tools which they collectively call <strong>/rdb</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If it uses something other than tab for the field separator, it's more generally a <a href="DelimiterSeparatedValues.html">DelimiterSeparatedValues</a> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Their tools operate on <a href="TabDelimitedTables.html">TabDelimitedTables</a>, in a Unix shell environment. They interoperate with other Unix tools. I found it just as I was learning the Bourne Shell. Their suite operates on tab delimited tables with "headlines" (see below).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Without indexing, some operations, such as joins, are very difficult to do. I was *forced* to use a tool like that once, and I almost went insane trying to work around it.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The table object has been quite useful to me, and to others I work with - including the computers I interact with. With tables of named information, both the computer and I can do operations on named columns, such as sort or subtotal.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the promise of XML, humans and machines will be able to refer to the same sorts of information. If a computer were to join <a href="StateAbbreviations.html">StateAbbreviations</a> and AreaCode on the ST field, it could name the capital of the state with area code 513. Can you?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <strong>headlines</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Headlines are bits of meta data included within the result of the query.
      </p>
      <p>
        In /rdb, from RevolutionarySoftware, a head line consists of a tab delimited list of fields followed by a tab delimited string of hyphens underlining each field.
      </p>
      <p>
        In /RDB, Hobbes replaces the hyphens with an N for a numeric field, and with M for a field with a month.
      </p>
      <p>
        The name of the fields in the headlines simplify pipelines, by allowing a field to be referred to by name. Imagine a table called checkbook with a headline of <strong>checknumber date payee amount withholding memo</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Dataflow for making W2 forms might be about as simple as 
      </p>
      <code>
        cat checkbook | sorttable payee | subtotal -l payee amount withholding<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <em> or simpler, sorttable payee < checkbook | subtotal -l payee amount withholding </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The beauty of this suite of tools is that the beginning and end of almost every pipeline are <a href="TabDelimitedTables.html">TabDelimitedTables</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Tabs tend to be problematic characters for cross-system data sharing. Sometimes they end up getting converted into spaces for various reasons. Thus, <a href="CommaSeparatedValues.html">CommaSeparatedValues</a> tends to be more popular because they rely purely on WYSIWYG characters.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Note: If a user puts a comma in a single field, put quotes around that field. If the user wants to put quotes in a single field, escape them with a backslash, or double the quotes character.</em> That's a weird mashup of both <a href="DelimiterSeparatedValues.html">DelimiterSeparatedValues</a> and <a href="CommaSeparatedValues.html">CommaSeparatedValues</a> quoting rules and I haven't seen the program that handles both conventions in the same file.
      </p>
      <p>
        Precisely because tab is *not* a WYSIWYG character, it's useful as an out-of-band character to indicate "next field", while allowing *all* WYSIWYG characters to be used in any field without any weird escape codes.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That is true, but its downsides override that in my opinion.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="AsciiCode.html">AsciiCode</a> allocates four control characters (28-31) for record structuring:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           FS - File Separator
        </li>
        <li>
           GS - Group Separator
        </li>
        <li>
           RS - Record Separator
        </li>
        <li>
           US - Unit Separator
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is a shame that these aren't used more widely for their intended purpose.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Probably because it defeats the purpose of being "ASCII", which usually implies it is human-viewable in a generic editor. Using those would make it not much different than a "binary format". </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Only because the ASCII separator codes never caught on for general use, unlike other standard ASCII control codes used in text files, such as TAB, CR, and LF.
      </p>

      <p>
        In some of the seminal texts about UnixProgramming and the <a href="MakeProgram.html">MakeProgram</a>, the concept that the tab is difficult to spot among spaces has been mentioned by some as a design flaw [<a href="SyntacticallySignificantWhitespaceConsideredHarmful.html">SyntacticallySignificantWhitespaceConsideredHarmful</a>].
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it is okay for same-program usage, but not for cross-system.
