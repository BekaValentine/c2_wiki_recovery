        An outsourcing company focused on distributed, mobile, and <a href="PervasiveComputing.html">PervasiveComputing</a>. <a href="WirelessNetworking.html">WirelessNetworking</a> excites us, as does <a href="DistributedObjects.html">DistributedObjects</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        We like to worth with <a href="BlueTooth.html">BlueTooth</a>, JINI, Python, Java, and other technologies. We work in a highly iterative way, striving towards <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>. We like to have our clients commit initially only to small units of work on our part. This helps to build a business relationship in a manner which limits the amount of risk for each side while each of us gets to better understand the other. This works well with the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> principles of <a href="OnsiteCustomer.html">OnsiteCustomer</a>, <a href="FrequentReleases.html">FrequentReleases</a>, and <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>.

        We wholeheartedly believe in the <a href="FortyHourWeek.html">FortyHourWeek</a>, as we believe that we are far more efficient when not burned out, and actually produce more per unit of calendar time than pressing much <a href="OverTime.html">OverTime</a> work. This is a bold and somewhat unique step for a company in <a href="SiliconValley.html">SiliconValley</a>.
