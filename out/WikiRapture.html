      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        </li>
        <li>
           creation of so many pages that <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s and <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s can't keep up
        </li>
        <li>
           suggestions for improvements to Wiki (some novel, some not)
        </li>
        <li>
           debates about why WikiIsNot______ (Usenet, <a href="WysiWyg.html">WysiWyg</a>, YourBlog, aDictionary, aSoapbox, aHostingService, <a href="TreeStructure.html">TreeStructure</a>d, <a href="SlashDot.html">SlashDot</a>, YourNotebook, <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>, aForum, better categorized, AboutDebate, etc.)
        </li>
        <li>

        The only known cure for sufferers of <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a> is to <a href="SlowDownToSpeedUp.html">SlowDownToSpeedUp</a>. Sit back for a while and observe how the <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> behaves.

        Many victims of <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a> become valued <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a>. Others have gone on to populate wikis closer to their temperament and interests.

        Another word on <a href="SlowDownToSpeedUp.html">SlowDownToSpeedUp</a>: recipients of <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a> would do well to consider that many of their ideas and inspirations have already been thoroughly mulled over, perhaps years ago, and those discussions can be found somewhere in this unruly garden. <a href="AdviceToNewcomers.html">AdviceToNewcomers</a> is that they would do well to PostLessReadMore, so that this initial enthusiasm can temper into wisdom.

        <em>What's wrong with redundancy?</em> We have discussed that at length see <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>.
        <em>You can learn a lot by writing the same things over and over. You can probably find this line somewhere on the net, many times.  And writing the same things over and over can help you learn a lot, so redundancy's not all bad.  And as for redundancy, well you can learn a lot by writing the same things over and over.  Plus, redundancy's not necessarily a bad thing, because writing the same things over and over is not necessarily repetition of the same things over and over, which I'm sure teaches us something, if not necessarily a lot.</em>  We have a page for this too:  <a href="RepetitionIsTheKeyToLearning.html">RepetitionIsTheKeyToLearning</a>

        Is there such a thing as a WikiTribulation?

          Yeah, I thought <a href="WikiRapture.html">WikiRapture</a> is when all the good authors up and disappear overnight because the WikiGods saw fit to grant them early access to WikiHeaven!
