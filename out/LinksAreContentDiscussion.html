        Links Are Content Discussion

        Links have to be content because:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>there is no way of deriving where the edges are in the hypertext graph from the nodes alone. </dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>thus, they carry information and hence are <em>content.</em></dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        If you can embed information in links, you have be just as careful where you put them as with text. You can be too spartan or too babbly.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But we don't embed information </em>'in<strong> links. Links </strong>are<em>' information. </em>No, they are meta information.<em> They should justify themselves on a page just as the words do, no more, no less.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You embed information in a link the same way you embed information in a page. A link is an unordered 2-tuple {from,to}. As such, the structure of the link is fixed, the structure carries information ("a link is undirected between two points") independent from the actual information of which nodes it connects. Similarly, a page by itself is a node with a title and a (possibly empty) set of referants. You embed content in the page by writing something on it. This is getting <em>very</em> esoteric. I apologize. I agree with your conclusion about justification, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At least in the case of the WWW, links are not a 2-tuple; they are {from, to, link text}, and, if you're feeling generous today, {context} of the link as well. Evidence of the theoretical importance lies in the often ironic use of links, where the </em>'to<em>' contradicts the link text, or subtly undermines the context. They are definitely content; done correctly they can completely shift the meaning of an otherwise-unlinked block of text.</em>

        As far as I know, the task of language itself is to refer to concepts and links between them. If a news article writes about a recent political event and its effects, the article refers to the link between the events and its effects. Therefore the link is the <em>object</em> of the article. And as by magic the two objects of event and effect are joined by a third object. This, to me at least, is the magic of writing. If you refer to two concepts and you can find a name for the link between them, all you need to do is promote the link to an object, just by making it your subject. -- <a href="StijnSanders.html">StijnSanders</a>

        I have found it very rewarding to systematically create new links which reference a page where the entry previously referred to is in a way which did not make a link. Example:
      </p>
      <p>
        SWIG does not make a link, but SimplifiedWrapperAndInterfaceGenerator does link to the page describing SWIG.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <em>reward</em>? I have learned a lot from the pages I would not otherwise have visited.
