        This is a Diff ran on <a href="HelpersInsteadOfWrappers.html">HelpersInsteadOfWrappers</a>. It appears that <a href="GrammarVandal.html">GrammarVandal</a>-related multi-edits lost changes. I intend hand-edit to put them back one of these days. Until then, it sits here. If somebody remembers how to restore from archive, that would be great.

           Thanks for the offer. The problem is that new stuff is mixed up with old stuff now. It will probably have to be hand-fixed.

        Parameter "fieldTitle" defaults to "fieldName" if empty.
        "options" are words embedded in parenthesis for easy parsing. Example: "(required)(trunc)". Here, "(trunc)" means that the value will be truncated if larger than given length. Without it, an error is given if oversize.
        The 'map' parameter is a by-reference associative array. It contains or will contain these entries:

           errorMsg - The error message of any problem found. It is blank if none found. A fancier version could return multiple error messages and perhaps have a warning-only level. But this is often overkill.

        I've found that leaving the abstractions a bit "leaky" makes them far more flexible. For example, suppose I have a function/method for generating menu items with links:
