        Inventory Goes Home At Night

        In <a href="WhyLeadersCantLead.html">WhyLeadersCantLead</a>, <a href="WarrenBennis.html">WarrenBennis</a> quotes Louis B. Mayer, the head of MGM Studios during Hollywood's golden era, as having once said, "The inventory goes home at night." (p. 86)

        In <a href="OnBecomingaLeader.html">OnBecomingaLeader</a>, <a href="WarrenBennis.html">WarrenBennis</a> quotes Michael Eisner, the Chairman and CEO of Disney, as having said, "our inventory goes home at night." (p. xiii)
      </p>
      <p>
        (Maybe Eisner was quoting Mayer. Maybe everyone in Hollywood says that. Maybe Bennis is confused.)

        This is a common belief in Hollywood, and should be one in Silicon Valley-style software companies as well. These companies are nothing without their people, and people are the easiest assets to lose. That's what necessitates <a href="LeadershipIdeals.html">LeadershipIdeals</a> like <a href="CovenantalRelationships.html">CovenantalRelationships</a> and <a href="EmPowerment.html">EmPowerment</a>.

        I'd also say that in today's high-flex economy, if you don't treat your employees well, someone else will. (See <a href="HighFlexSociety.html">HighFlexSociety</a>.)
