        Uml Fallacy
      </h1>
      <p>
        The fallacy of taking <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a> (UML) in the direction of <a href="ModelDrivenArchitecture.html">ModelDrivenArchitecture</a> (MDA) and executable diagrams is the idea that programming languages are hard because they look like code; and that if you make a language that looks like diagrams, it'll be easy. Cf. <a href="CobolFallacy.html">CobolFallacy</a>. -- <a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd say the <a href="CobolFallacy.html">CobolFallacy</a> at least points in a better direction than the <a href="UmlFallacy.html">UmlFallacy</a>. OO languages represent a move toward the semantic structure of natural language that goes beyond the surface similarity of COBOL.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't find OO particularly a close fit to natural language. Could you please clarify?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Problems with UML:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           there must always be an associated specification in natural language without which diagrams can't be interpreted.
        </li>
        <li>
           the semantics of the diagram are not easily extensible by composition of existing diagrams but require new natural language specification - unless you're an artist; extension of semantics in a text language is intrinsic: the lexicon of the natural language is directly available.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Use Case diagrams are an example of the above. The stick figure representing "Agent" may seem like a "natural" way to extend diagrams but it leads to ambiguity. And the arrows are really ambiguous. -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a>

      <p>
        I have concluded that it is often bad form to say how software "should" be represented. Some prefer code, some diagrams, others tables (<a href="TableOrientedProgramming.html">TableOrientedProgramming</a>), and others like a mix. I think the <a href="BenefitsAreSubjective.html">BenefitsAreSubjective</a> WRT which is better. If  somebody claims they work faster/better using a diagram-based approach, who am I or you to tell them that is not true.
