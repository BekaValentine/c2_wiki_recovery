      <p>
        I am a PerlProgrammer, <a href="LinuxOperatingSystem.html">LinuxOperatingSystem</a> user, artist, web application creator, and on and on by trade. I have a huge interest in sociology and the trend of merging technology with civilization. The connection of the world has given rise to an infant collective mind that is growing more mature and vast each and every day.

        Collections such as this growth around us, are giving light to new worlds, and I find that to be very exciting indeed.
