        I am interested in plant community ecology, and particularly in the ecology of biological invasions. Invaders have been transported across biogeographic barriers and grow in the absence of the natural enemies that evolved with them. Introduced species can be used to address the effect of species additions on communities, the role of herbivores and pathogens in structuring communities, the importance of single-species effects on larger-scale processes, and can help us to understand the constraints and consequent tradeoffs made in the course of their evolution. The field of invasion biology is an important connection between applied and academic ecologists, and there has been fruitful exchange of ideas between the two groups. Many of the core assumptions and theories regarding species invasions are based on anecdotal data and on the observations of land managers, and the field is rich with untested theories. I believe that a rigorous science of invasion biology will add vitality to all of ecology, offering the opportunity to test and integrate old theories and to create a more coherent framework for understanding ecological systems. I am excited to start my career at a time when this is beginning to occur, and hope that my dissertation work and other projects will make a meaningful contribution.
