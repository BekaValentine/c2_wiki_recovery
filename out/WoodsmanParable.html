        Woodsman Parable
      </h1>
      <p>
        A man was walking through the woods when he came upon a man attempting to chop down a tree. The woodsman was chopping madly away but the going was very slow as the axe was very blunt. The man asked the woodsman: "Why do you not stop and sharpen your axe, the chopping will go much faster?", to which the woodsman replied: "Can't you see I haven't the time to stop and sharpen my axe?"
