        Interesting question.  I have experience in evolving the decidedly graphical
        components of the <a href="UnidrawFramework.html">UnidrawFramework</a> toward other uses.  So far we've dealt with
        map features, decision trees, vehicle models, and raster objects.  Although
        each component has a certain aspect that isn't completely about how
        they will be rendered on the screen, it was convenient to reuse the graphical
        component architecture of Unidraw.  And all but the vehicle models made
        direct use of the graphical mechanisms when integrated into a viewer.

        <a href="JohnVlissides.html">JohnVlissides</a> tried to tease apart components from graphical components when
        he originally wrote the software.  The ultimate base class is Component, but
        the base class that everything derives from is GraphicComp.  I think in a
        server there is certainly room for components without a graphic nature.
        But we needed to retain all the other capabilities, like serialization, 
        property lists, scripting language, etc..  And we wanted to be able to export a view of the component in some graphical language.  Which
        for the most part required graphics software.

        Take a look at Microsoft's <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a>.  Most of the components are non-graphical: they produce, process or render frames of continuous media.  The components that render graphical media (such as frames of video) are adapters between two different frameworks, acting as <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> media sinks and ActiveX embeddable objects.

        Is there any persistent information in a <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> component that is there
        specifically for the use of an eventual ActiveX object?
      </p>
      <p>
        No.  <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> and ActiveX are two completely separate <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> s. Because they are both from Microsoft they are both based on COM, but do not use the same COM interfaces (beyond core COM interfaces such as IUnknown).  Therefore most <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> components have no knowledge of ActiveX at all -- ie: they do not use ActiveX interfaces for embedding etc.  The only <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> component that needs ActiveX interfaces is the "ActiveMovie" component that can be embedded into a web-page or VB form.
      </p>

        See <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/directx/dxm">http://www.microsoft.com/directx/dxm</a> for more information (however, the site is unusable with anything but Internet Explorer).

        <em>Nat, this is a great example of how components can partipate in a </em><a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> on one hand (e.g., <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> source) via outgoing interfaces and be subject to <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a> or <a href="ComponentGlue.html">ComponentGlue</a> on the other (e.g., any ActiveX client) via incoming interfaces.  I'll try to factor this example into some of the Component Interaction Patterns I'm submitting to PLoP'99 --<a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> components don't use a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> -- they are connected via <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a> by the programmer or a filter graph factory (<a href="AutomatedAssembly.html">AutomatedAssembly</a>).  <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> sources read media from files or HTTP connections.  I guess that one could, at a stretch, consider a multiparty <a href="NetMeeting.html">NetMeeting</a> videoconference a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> but it isn't really within the usual meaning of the term.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the subject of incoming and outgoing interfaces, <a href="DirectShow.html">DirectShow</a> bindings are an example of where <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a> is used to set up multidirectional communication between components.  Each binding establishes a flow of media frames from producer to consumer and a flow of control signals in the other direction.  I've found that most <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> s use bidirectional interactions like this: E.g. ActiveX/OLE "sites" for embedded objects, data flow in the Regent transport framework, interactions between geometry managers and GUI widgets.  It seems very rare to have a <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a>  that can be described only in terms of client-initiated request/reply invocations.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would still say it sounds like a </em><a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> even though a third party binds them.  To me, the source-sink theme (<a href="ObserverPattern.html">ObserverPattern</a>) is popularly used in component busses whether a third party binds the components via <a href="AutomatedAssembly.html">AutomatedAssembly</a> or not.  And I agree that this interaction theme is commonly used in COM where we see bidirectional interactions, including those that occur between OLE DB consumers and producers (e.g., ADO consumer, Sybase provider).  --<a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a><em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> because filters must be explicitly bound to their upstream and downstream filters.  Components talking through a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> do not have a direct connection to other components, just like electronic components that communicate through a hardware bus.  PCI cards (for example) communicate by raising and lowering voltages on the bus without needing to know what reacts to those signals or what is done to handle them.  Similarly a software component on a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> sends events to a <a href="MultiCaster.html">MultiCaster</a> or places tuples into a <a href="TupleSpace.html">TupleSpace</a> without needing to be explicitly bound to the components that react to those events or process the tuples.  It is this indirection that makes it easy to dynamically reconfigure a system built around a <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a>, compared to a system built from explicitly bound components.

        Component technologies aside, I hope that we can successfully capture present themes in uni- and bi-directional component interactions, via the "Component Interaction Patterns" sub-language I submitted to PLoP'99, that lead to living, well-designed systems.  CIP contains <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a>, <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a>, <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a>, and <a href="ComponentGlue.html">ComponentGlue</a>.  They make use of lower-level design patterns such as <a href="ObserverPattern.html">ObserverPattern</a>, <a href="AdapterPattern.html">AdapterPattern</a>, <a href="MediatorPattern.html">MediatorPattern</a>, and <a href="NullObject.html">NullObject</a> (to name a few).  I'm working on translating them to the Alexandrian form as we speak and will make sure I get them out to you when I've got something we can work with.
