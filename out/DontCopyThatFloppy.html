      <p>
        A campaign in the 1980s by the <a href="BusinessSoftwareAlliance.html">BusinessSoftwareAlliance</a> to discourage software piracy. Very dated ads and now ridiculed.
      </p>
      <p>
        The campaign has strong parallels to contemporary efforts to discourage music piracy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Software has proven very resistant to piracy, perhaps because of, or resulting in the success of the <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> movement. Whether the same is true of music and movies is unknown.
