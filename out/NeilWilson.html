        Slightly disillusioned "Computer person". After a degree in <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> and 10 years in the industry looking at moving into Sandwiches. I figure people will always need lunch :-)

      <p>
        Based in Halifax, UK (That's between Manchester and Leeds and a long way from <a href="LondonTown.html">LondonTown</a> for those with inadequate atlases).
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm here looking for inspiration
      </p>

        <em>And a very fine thing </em>SandwichMaking is, too. But I suspect you might regret it when it comes to <a href="PayDay.html">PayDay</a>. --<a href="RogerBrowne.html">RogerBrowne</a><em></em>

        Yes, but think of the satisfaction of knowing that you have fulfilled a vital role in society. And GordonBrown won't be able to say you aren't a ProperBusiness.

        Hi Neil. I was disillusioned once myself. I got my inspiration from <a href="RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode.html">RefactoringImprovingTheDesignOfExistingCode</a> and <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplainedEmbraceChange</a>.
