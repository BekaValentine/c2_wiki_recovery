        Taxonomy Of Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        On <a href="PatternsAreDead.html">PatternsAreDead</a>, it was written:
        <em>There's no taxonomy of patterns. Oh there are some filiations even in </em>GoF, but it's not hierarchical. So how do you know that you have a new pattern to document? You don't unless you read through all the pattern literature to see if it's already there or not. That's onerous. <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So how does that get fixed?  Is there a taxonomy building here on Wiki that will solve the problem?  (If so, who publishes it, and where, to get it exposure?)  Is there another book in the works?  Or is this not important?  (If not, why not?)
      </p>

        Discussion moved to <a href="LimitsOfHierarchies.html">LimitsOfHierarchies</a>

        Regarding worthiness of a tree-shaped taxonomy:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Personally, I have my doubts that such a relation exists, but one never knows. In any case, must the taxonomy be hierarchical? Is there a hierarchical taxonomy of mathematics or engineering? Are existing non-hierarchical taxonomies good enough?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Perhaps it's something like the </em><a href="NpComplete.html">NpComplete</a> problems (minus the formal definitions), where people usually think of a new problem as 'kind of like the <a href="TravelingSalesmanProblem.html">TravelingSalesmanProblem</a>' or whatever seems closer. Maybe more cross-referencing of patterns would be the answer.<em></em>
