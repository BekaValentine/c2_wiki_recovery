        Somebody who marks and signs their stuff in another author's contribution.
        Instead of intrusive editing, they give some <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a> to the original author.
        They do this by marking stuff to be edited and give some explanation or motivation for change.

        I think that this is in the right spirit but that it has too much ceremony attached to it <em>[I now deleted ceremonial redundancy in my page intro by refactoring it. -- fp]</em>. There is clearly some editing that can be done without the original authors permission and clearly (to me anyway) some that shouldn't and there is a fairly large grey area as well. I think that there ought to be different rules for editing <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> discussion and <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> <a href="OpeningStatement.html">OpeningStatement</a><em></em>'s. <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> editing should be done by collaboration using <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> (in my most humble opinion). <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> ought to be edited a little more freely but you should still <a href="RefactorWhileRespectingSignatures.html">RefactorWhileRespectingSignatures</a> and avoid <a href="UnethicalEditing.html">UnethicalEditing</a>. Good thread mode should be separated into sections. Really good <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> should get its own page. Some thread mode really ought to be deleted and some should just sit there waiting to either grow or die.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I don't think that this is the best way to edit <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> because I think <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> is better for that. Thread mode presents some interesting problems: How do you deal with redundancy; how much can you reword what someone else has written; how to you separate out inlined commentary; how do you make anonymous contributions make sense etc... This suggestion might be helpful for dealing with redundancy or for asking for approval for major edits. In those cases the amount of ceremony is swamped by the amount of work being done anyway. It's still unlikely to be effective in most situations, however, because this kind of communication has too much time sensitivity and too vague an audience. If you don't know for sure that someone will read a suggestion like this, then it's probably better to find some other way to collaborate. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        Phil, you gave a nice example, how to undermine the <a href="FriendlyPeerContributor.html">FriendlyPeerContributor</a> concept: You deleted the original signature and then freely deleted the InsertHint part. I see the problem behind it. Others may see it too. I see the blessings of a FriendlyWikiMasterContributor , who summarizes, moves, links and gives other useful service to enhance the value of original contributions.  But that's a daunting task that could be made easier in accordance with the primary authors, on whose contributions friendly <a href="WikiMaster.html">WikiMaster</a><em>s</em> operate. A very subtle point for <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s. Cordially -- Fridemar

        A lot of pages have <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> stuff on the top and <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> at the bottom. I thought that you had made a mistake while trying to follow that style so I tried to fix it. For what its worth what you have here is not correct english -- it's pretty hard to read in fact. You also misspelled "felt" above, by the way. Normally I'd just correct it, but... There has to be a middle ground between Richard's wanting to delete everything in sight and your wanting to do an intricate dance everytime you want to do the simplest little thing. -- <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>

        <a href="PhilGoodwin.html">PhilGoodwin</a>: Thanks for the ReplaceHint 'felt'. It is a good example for a simple thing. 
        Taking the spirit of your friendly meant implicit DeleteHint for
        deleting the middle item, you could have made it explicit by saying: "You can omit this redundant part, because each insert-operation is a special case of a change-operation". Another <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a> could be : "What about eliminating the change-operation, because each change is a sequence of deletes and inserts".
        It's really a pleasure, when friendly people help each other to learn. The signing author thinks: learning and working by gentle hints is more enjoyable and more efficient in the long run, than learning by getting forcefully changed.
        Some <a href="EditHint.html">EditHint</a> <em>will do the magic</em>. <em>Being changed forcefully is a trick</em> that could do harm the original author, the external change-maker and the whole Wiki.
