      <p>
        Mac user since 1988 (after my first time using a Mac in the fall of '88, I remarked to our computer lab supervisor how it was really easy to use--"It's just like GEOS!" I said...)  In high school, I did three separate term-paper style projects as <a href="HyperCard.html">HyperCard</a> stacks to help demonstrate for the school district the feasibility of using technology in the classroom; ultimately I had to demonstrate one of them in front of a teacher in-service (my ultimate Lisa Simpson moment).  Still have my LC, plus my B/W G3, a PB 150, and a PB 5300 (reconditioned for fire safety), and my MessagePad 100 and a QuickTake 100 to boot.
