        Wiki Uncertainty Principle

        I'm not certain that this will ever be a valid contribution to Wiki.

      <p>
        If other people contribute to it you've been validated!

      <p>
        <em>But the contribution has now totally changed</em>

        <strong>Warning:</strong> the mathematical formalism underpinning the following is still in early alpha.
      </p>
      <p>
        To derive the <a href="WikiUncertaintyPrinciple.html">WikiUncertaintyPrinciple</a> from the <a href="HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple.html">HeisenbergUncertaintyPrinciple</a> for quantum mechanics take {particle, position, momentum} and substitute {contribution, authorship, value}.

        <strong>Populist explanation</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        When I first saw Wiki I assumed that I would be able to measure the value of my contributions to it over time.  The paradox that has since emerged is that any time I measure the 'myness' of a contribution I lose all knowledge of its value, and once I measure the value I can no longer know how much is down to me.

      </p>
      <p>
        So, collaborative contributions, those written and changed by multiple people, have more value than individual signed contributions, leading to the dreaded <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>. I like that.  -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        <em>This suggests, perhaps, the founding of </em>QuantumWiki being as it subtly alludes to Schroedinger's cat. (see: <a href="http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/cat/Default.htm)''">http://www.emr.hibu.no/lars/eng/cat/Default.htm)''</a> --<a href="DaveMorgan.html">DaveMorgan</a>
