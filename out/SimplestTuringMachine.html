        Simplest Turing Machine
      </h1>
      <p>
        The definition of a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> includes the idea of a translation table, a symbol dictionary, and commands to move the tape head left or right (or builtin to the commands for read or write).  What is the simplest Turing machine conceivable?
      </p>

      <p>
        Define the <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a> thusly:  A tape, a wheel to move the tape FORWARD or REVERSE, an overwrite head to READ or WRITE symbols from or to the tape, and a translation table or function to transform the symbol into another.
      </p>

      <p>
        Then a 1-bit adder with carryover allowing arbitrary length (but then, how to specify data vs. instructions?)
      </p>
      <code>
        consisting of a move (forward: 1, reverse: -1), a binary symbol (1,0), and a transition function <em>f</em>.  Such can then be specified with a tuple of (move (1 || -1), symbol: (1 || 0), transition function: NAND):<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Two options.  Define a word size, built into the r/w head that always moves a fixed amount on every READ.  Or, a special character could be used indicating separate words of arbitrary length.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A computer without a program (0 bits long) is in the HALT state.
        </li>
        <li>
           The 1-bit program "1", moves one square FORWARD and reads the symbol there and continues.  The program "0" outputs a 0 and halts.
        </li>
        <li>
           The 2-bit program "00" stops .... jumps, adds, comparison, datasize definition... 
        </li>
      </ul>
