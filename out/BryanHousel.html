        I am a freelance consultant in the New York City area, specializing in Law Manager - a software platform for building large-scale legal information management systems. The software is used by many of the biggest government, corporate, and legal organizations in the world. Over the past 10 years, I have worked with many of these clients to design, develop, and maintain their Law Manager systems.
