        I now openly question the following from <a href="GoodWikiCitizen.html">GoodWikiCitizen</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Don't refactor live threads.</strong> When people are still going at it hot and heavy, let 'em be. When they all get too disgusted with themselves to contribute any more, still let 'em be. Give it a few weeks for the dust to settle. Then try to fix it. (Hint: if you got there from <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, the thread is probably live.) <em></em><a href="BrainStormFirstCleanLater.html">BrainStormFirstCleanLater</a><em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I've begun to disobey this, first in small ways, more recently in much bigger ways. It's time I came clean.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't even apologize.

        <em>Don't refactor live threads.</em> Is this perhaps a practice to reject now that we've seen its effects, a reason <a href="WhyWikiWorksNot.html">WhyWikiWorksNot</a>? If people are continuously refactoring sprawling <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> into coherent <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, no great <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> ever accumulates. More importantly, when virtually every page on Wiki is a <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>, people come to think of Wiki as a purely <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> discussion forum. "Sure, what the hell, I'll toss a rude little barb onto this page. Everyone else is doing it." Letting <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> run without continuous refactoring teaches people a bad way to Wiki. Continuous refactoring never lets people forget that beautiful <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> is the goal. -- <a href="BenKovitz.html">BenKovitz</a>

      <p>
        Why not build a <strong>parallel document</strong> that attempts to improve the organization? Why dinker with the original if its still changing? We can then rename or remove the original after the dust settles.

           I also agree. I've often been in project meetings which made me wish I could refactor a recent comment onto a new page. -- <a href="DavidSaff.html">DavidSaff</a>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you're impatient, you won't have enough perspective to refactor and delete.
        </li>
        <li>
           If you're involved in an <em>active</em> thread, you might be biased when you remove text.
        </li>
        <li>
           You can squash any potentially interesting tangents by being too focused.
        </li>
        <li>
           Many times some tangential fluff is created to answer some incidental question that doesn't deserve its own page. People shouldn't delete it because the intended recipient and lurkers may not have had a chance to read it yet. See <a href="DouglasHofstadter.html">DouglasHofstadter</a> for a discussion of <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org">http://www.pulitzer.org</a> and <a href="RecentChangesSignature.html">RecentChangesSignature</a> to see what happens when you prematurely delete something (someone asks). <em>is the comment on </em><a href="RecentChangesSignature.html">RecentChangesSignature</a> still there?<em></em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Actually, lately it seems people are moving fluff onto their own pages anyway. This is really aggravating. Each <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> is just like a <em>class</em> in, say, Smalltalk or Java. Apply <a href="MeaningfulName.html">MeaningfulName</a>s and avoid <a href="RavioliWiki.html">RavioliWiki</a>. <em>See </em><a href="RavioliWiki.html">RavioliWiki</a> for various views on <a href="RavioliWiki.html">RavioliWiki</a> - avoidable or unavoidable, tasty or inedible<em></em>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Because you're going too fast, you have to use <a href="RefactoringNotes.html">RefactoringNotes</a> because you aren't feeling confident enough to make the change. There's a rule in writing/editing/programming: If you aren't sure, you're wrong. I'm being overly harsh here, but take it easy. You can't make good decisions if you're hyped up on adrenaline. <em>The motivation for this page is the (to me obvious) fact that nothing like enough </em><a href="WikiRefactoring.html">WikiRefactoring</a> has gone on. Criticising adrenaline here is like saying the water's dirty when you reach the only oasis for 1000 miles in the Sahara. It may be that we only have the required energy to refactor shortly after being involved in a page. All of these criticisms strike me as the work of someone who hasn't refactored much of any real complexity but has been upset that a few words of his own have recently been lost.<em></em>

        Previously in the list of "Nays":

           It turns <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a>s into tail chasers. I write something, the rabid refactorer goes and refactors it right away before I'm done thinking through my contribution. Then, someone refactors the refactoring. And so on.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If they're refactoring things "away" then they're discarding information. If information is discarded then there is a problem with the refactoring, not with its timing.

        Makes sense to me. After all, the XP people don't wait until a certain part of the program "has settled down" before they refactor, on the contrary, they refactor <em>before</em> adding new stuff.

        <em>XP doesn't work when you want to do exploratory work. You know, to go off on tangents and see where takes you.

        Churning old pages is a great feature/misbug. It works like your mind when something triggers an old memory that launches you into a new direction. However, with <a href="NewNotification.html">NewNotification</a>, that's kind of broken now. :(

        There is a problem with <a href="DeletionInWiki.html">DeletionInWiki</a>. It seems to me that refactoring is meant to capture the essential essence, distilling it in places, reorganizing it in other place, and removing non-contributory elements to another place or removing them. Deletion should be reserved for segments or pages which in the view of the community (not an individual) are not wanted, or are not helpful. It is well to be cautious in refactoring to be sure to reflect and retain as much of the original essence of the page as possible. (See <a href="TrustAndResponsibility.html">TrustAndResponsibility</a>)
