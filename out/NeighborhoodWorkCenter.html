        This would be an Office Center, composed of Offices for Neighborhood Use. Where workers who are <a href="WorkingFromHome.html">WorkingFromHome</a>, can meet managers, clients, co-workers and team-members for coordination and face-to-face interaction. While virtual face-to-face meetings can take place electronically via networks, there are times when, for whatever reason, only a real meeting in real-time and possibly under special control or security conditions, is the best alternative for the meeting's purposes.

        This would fulfill one of the many goals of moving work to the workers instead of moving workers To The work Program, designed to cut down the wasted time as well as in limiting the need for commuters and the supporting transportation infrastructure and significant rather than token reduction of carbon footprints, thought by some to be desired to reduce the <a href="HumanFactors.html">HumanFactors</a> of climate change by reducing climate change agents.
