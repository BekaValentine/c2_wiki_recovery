        Oz Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Oz is a <a href="MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage.html">MultiParadigmProgrammingLanguage</a> supporting <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a>.
        The book <a href="ConceptsTechniquesAndModelsOfComputerProgramming.html">ConceptsTechniquesAndModelsOfComputerProgramming</a> uses Oz to teach programming.
        The web site is <a href="http://www.mozart-oz.org/">http://www.mozart-oz.org/</a>

      <p>
        <a href="OzLanguage.html">OzLanguage</a> is in some ways inspired by <a href="ActorLanguages.html">ActorLanguages</a>.

        Oz is a really slick language that suffers from being way too academic. It's got some awesome <a href="ConstraintProgramming.html">ConstraintProgramming</a> features, but unfortunately, it doesn't really talk to the rest of the world. :/
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It has a </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> <a href="ForeignFunctionInterface.html">ForeignFunctionInterface</a>, networking libraries, etc. What more do you want? On the "too academic" point, see <<a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD611.html">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD06xx/EWD611.html</a>>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It also suffers from having an implementation that's tightly coupled with <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a>.  Anyone not an Emacs user is going to stay away.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The </em><a href="MozartProgrammingSystem.html">MozartProgrammingSystem</a> development environment is somewhat dependent on <a href="EmacsEditor.html">EmacsEditor</a>, but the compiler, <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a>, etc. are not.<em></em>

        I've been playing around with Oz for about a month, and quite like it. The base language encourages declarative and functional styles of programming, but the extended language supports many different paradigms, including <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>.

        Too academic? Commercial software development could stand to learn a bit more from academia, without a doubt, and vice versa. I almost wish I'd learned to program by starting with a language with the formal rigor of Oz. -- <a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>

        I'll try the "academic" language, as a programming toy, have fun!
