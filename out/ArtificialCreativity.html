        Artificial Creativity
      </h1>
      <p>
        Artificial Creativity is the making of computer systems that can themselves create things. It is the unwanted sibling of <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a>. It is also the other half of <a href="ArtificialIntelligence.html">ArtificialIntelligence</a>. Think of AI as the analysis side, and AC as the creative side. AI analyzes the world and AC creates things in the world. A system can not create if it does not have enough AI to analyze the domain it is working in, and a system is sterile if it can analyze but not put its analysis to good use. They are two halves to the same coin.

        Artificial Creativity is used in games, art, music, architecture, poetry and the artificial production of invention ideas. It could be used in many more areas if people would just think in terms of 'what can I get my computer to create?' --<a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>

        Another goal of the field of artificial creativity is in the study of human creativity. <a href="ArtificialCreativity.html">ArtificialCreativity</a> is also called ComputationalCreativity and is related to ProceduralGeneration.

        On PBS I heard a story about a music professor who decided to learn programming one day because he felt he was going to through a creativity slump and wanted to find a way to make the computer help him. Eventually he got the computer to automatically generate hundreds of songs in the same style as famous computers such as Bach. However, to his disappointment none of them received any lasting acclaim. "They sounded like Bach's rejects", said one critic. He did prove that the style could be reproduced, but so far not the quality. He claimed he erased all copies of the software in a fit of frustration. Too bad, it was still a historical milestone. He still uses computers and the old generated songs (old output) to assist his composing, but uses human intervention to prune and shape. -t

        I once thought it would be a good idea to call this field ArtificialCreativityAndEnhancement because lower level artificial creativity can provide input to higher level human creativity just like the professor is doing with his old programs and then the higher level human creativity can be used to provide specifications to lower level artificially creative programs to flesh things out. You see the idea is that artificial creativity comes in various levels and if we are really serious about creating high level artificial creativity, we should probably start by getting lower level artificial creativity to work first. --Jon Grover
