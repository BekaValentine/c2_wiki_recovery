        <a href="TeamNavanax.html">TeamNavanax</a> (<a href="http://www.navanax.org)">http://www.navanax.org)</a> was an ad hoc collection of people led by <a href="RobSartin.html">RobSartin</a>. The team assisted non-profit organizations in creating and maintaining an accessible web presence. We were initially formed to compete in AirAustin, an event run by <a href="KnowbilityInc.html">KnowbilityInc</a> to create accessible web sites for non-profit organizations. We also worked on creating a small JspCustomTags library to make it easier to produce accessible web sites.
