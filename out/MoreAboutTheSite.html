        What about a download?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>See </em><a href="WikiMirrors.html">WikiMirrors</a> for downloads of selected sections and <a href="WikiBase.html">WikiBase</a> for getting the code. Incidentally, I'd love to be able to download the whole thing (and diffs of it) to read offline on the train and so on. I guess Wiki is somewhere between 30-120Mb now (guessing 4k-16k per page); zipped that's 6-20Mb. Ward probably wouldn't appreciate us taking so much of his bandwidth!<em> </em>

        Actually, the current DB size (Jan, 2001) is 62 Meg. Zipped, this could easily fit on an external storage site (<a href="GeoCities.html">GeoCities</a>, etc.) for the craving masses to download and enjoy. -- <a href="BryanTurner.html">BryanTurner</a>

        Doesn't this type of thing devolve into total chaos and information overload?
        Have wikis been growing enough of a culture and the associated mores to keep things under "control?"
