        Delete Mockery
      </h1>
      <p>
        Mockery isn't a metaphor or an analogy. It isn't constructive or useful in any way. It's just as destructive and antisocial an activity as vulgar insults. Given that, it's long been a convention on the wiki to just <a href="DeleteInsults.html">DeleteInsults</a> ....
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Isn't mockery a form of insult?</em>
