        Does Doing The Simplest Thing Mean Ignoring User Stories
      </h1>
      <p>
        Suppose we are working on implementing a <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a>. Then we realise that some other <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> needs something that we don't want to deal with right now. What should we do?
      </p>
      <p>
        Do we <a href="DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork.html">DoTheSimplestThingThatCouldPossiblyWork</a> right now and ignore the future requirement? (Ignoring a documented requirement is not the same as ignoring something you haven't been asked for).
      </p>
      <p>
        Or should we make allowances for it right now?

        Implement the current user story. Worry about the other one when you get to it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you go off on a tangent and implement part of another story, it is all too easy for that to lead to another tangent, etc. so that the original story doesn't get completed on time. And neither do the others.

        Amen.  Try to get the current story finished before you worry about other stories.  Sometimes this seems dumb, and sometimes it is, but usually it works out better in the long run.  It bugs me when I hear folks clamoring for "reuse" before they even have "use".  Once you've done both stories, refactor the common bits if necessary. -- <a href="EricHodges.html">EricHodges</a>
