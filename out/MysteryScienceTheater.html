        Mystery Science Theater
      </h1>
      <p>
        "Mystery Science Theater 3000": a classic cable show where a guy and his robots were forced to watch bad movies by an evil scientist. Now defunct, but appeared on Comedy Central and the Sci-Fi Channel in the USA.

        Often abbreviated "MST3K". Fans of the show call themselves "MSTies".

        Also released as a movie of the same name -- which is the only episode I've ever seen, not being in the US.  -- <a href="GavinLambert.html">GavinLambert</a>

        One of the few shows I miss a lot. Of course, we MST3K a lot of movies, but it's not quite the same.

        This show was awesome, I really miss it. I'm hoping that they'll release all of 1st through 5th season collectors' edition dvd's with Joel and the bots commenting on themselves commenting on the movie. - A Joel Fan.

        <em>Regrettably, they don't have the rights to release a lot of the movies they riffed in that way; the Rhino videos that they sold were movies that they were able to secure the rights to sell on video.  -- </em><a href="MattBehrens.html">MattBehrens</a>, who named his computers megaweapon, kalgan et al. on <a href="NamesGivenToComputers.html">NamesGivenToComputers</a><em></em>

        Resurrected by Mike Nelson and MST3k writers as RiffTrax (<a href="http://rifftrax.com),">http://rifftrax.com),</a> audio files you can buy (download) and play along with your copy of the movie, take to the theater or anywhere.
