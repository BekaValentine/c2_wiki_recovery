        Classes Are Context
      </h1>
      <p>
        I just thought that <a href="ClassesAreContext.html">ClassesAreContext</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WhyIsTheFirstArgSpecial.html">WhyIsTheFirstArgSpecial</a>? What does <a href="MultipleDispatch.html">MultipleDispatch</a> have such a different syntax? What is common?
      </p>
      <p>
        The interpretation that <a href="ClassesAreContext.html">ClassesAreContext</a> means that we have functions (OO: methods) that are applicable in a certain context (OO: class). 
        This can best be seen when the object the method is called on/sent to/dispatched on is left out ('inferred from context"). I.e. when we write
      </p>
      <code>
        f(x,y) <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        instead of
      </p>
      <code>
        this.f(x,y)<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        the "this." can be inferred 'from context' - namely the surrounding class.
      </p>
      <p>
        Multiple dispatch in this setting would then look like this (making the context explicit):
      </p>
      <code>
        (shapes,printing).printAt(figure, printer, center);<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Where figure is from shapes and printer is from printing (meaning roughly figure instanceof shapes and printer instanceof printing). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course multiple dispatch is typically not written this 'first arg special' way, but it could.
      </p>
      <p>
        What remains is how the functions/methods are declared. The usual way with OO is to group methods "in their"  context (aka class). 
        <a href="NiceLanguage.html">NiceLanguage</a> (and other) skips this grouping. But grouping is only one way to specify implicit context.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe the old with(x){} syntax deserves a revival?
      </p>
      <p>
        What do you think?

        <em>Classes might act as contexts when operating in a role as namespaces (though allowing classes to act as namespaces violates </em><a href="OneResponsibilityRule.html">OneResponsibilityRule</a> and is poor language design), but I'm not certain what you see as being special here. In the sense of <a href="ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext.html">ExplicitManagementOfImplicitContext</a>, which I see you mentioned below, <em>all</em> parameters are equally part of (explicit) 'context' (excepting possibly the 'this' identifier which may be implicit within a method handler).<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        But the 'this'-parameter was exactly what I meant. I made this explicit with an example above. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With this view classes do not have a special role but are a special case of context - <a href="SyntacticSugar.html">SyntacticSugar</a> in a language which supported more general contexts. 
        So using them cannot violate the <a href="OneResponsibilityRule.html">OneResponsibilityRule</a>. -- .gz
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>In most languages the use of 'this' makes the object the context, not the class. In particular, 'this.f(x,y)' or 'f(x,y)' might refer to a function defined in some subclass of the calling class. Based on what you're saying above, I believe it would be more accurate to say "method handlers are executed in a context implicitly associated with an object" than it is to say "classes are context".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. Great. That is a good summary and clarifies my <a href="ThinkingOutLoud.html">ThinkingOutLoud</a>. Can we make this into a short <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        But doesn't it follow from this that classes (which are associated with the object) are at least part of the relevant context? Would ClassesArePartOfContext or ClassesAreSpecialCsaeOfContext do?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Class could be considered part of implicit context when accessing properties associated with the class (as a whole) rather than the instance/object. Static variables, constant data, </em><a href="MetaObjectProtocol.html">MetaObjectProtocol</a>, various forms of <a href="TemplateMetaprogramming.html">TemplateMetaprogramming</a>, etc. would fit in here. OO in general doesn't need classes, of course, so I wouldn't look for anything fundamental here.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't think that this is a new concept either. Rather that it is a small insight which places the role of classes in the larger context of contexts (sic). It also might show an easy migration path for developers used to classes as such. -- .gz

        Classes provide a context for their members. each member is tightly coupled to the other members of the class. I call this <a href="TightFieldCoupling.html">TightFieldCoupling</a>. The context can also be considered hard coded context. When the class is used as a component of another class, then that other class provides additional context for a member. When you serialize into XML you can actually see the context of each member in a hierarchical relationship to the other members. My research is focused on providing LooseFieldCoupling for members using <a href="InformationOriented.html">InformationOriented</a> techniques based on <a href="EnDemes.html">EnDemes</a>. This will allow us to go beyond hard coded context. -- <a href="JonGrover.html">JonGrover</a>
