        Foreign Key

      <p>
        A column or set of columns in a table whose values are required to match at least one <a href="PrimaryKey.html">PrimaryKey</a> values of a row of another table, or (in some interpretations of the term) be a distinguished <em>null</em> value.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be noted that the <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a> concept is not part of the fundamental <a href="RelationalModel.html">RelationalModel</a>, but is only a special (and very common) case of a DatabaseConstraint involving two tables. Database management products often provide explicit, convenient support for this type of constraint.

        <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>s don't like to hear this (it is often claimed that RelationalHasNoPointers), but the <a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a> is the relational database equivalent of an object reference.  While operating at a higher level then a physical address (<a href="ForeignKey.html">ForeignKey</a>s say nothing about the underlying physical representation of the database), they serve the same purpose--<em>to allow data in one entity to reference another</em>.  Note the word reference, not pointer.
