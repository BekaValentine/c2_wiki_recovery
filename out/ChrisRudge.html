      <p>
        I live in London, England. I'm very new to wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you want to know who I am, the best bet would be to read some of the comments I've written, or to contact me in some way; I don't think that introductions written by people about themselves are the best way of getting to know much about a person... :~)

        My interests are in computers, mainly programming / scripting. I know <a href="TurboPascal.html">TurboPascal</a>, C, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>, and a little Perl. I also do HTML and CSS reasonably well. I would like to help on code Wiki, maybe. I also enjoy reading.

        I am also known in some other places as Continuity - the nickname is from a <a href="WilliamGibson.html">WilliamGibson</a> novel called Mona Lisa Overdrive - ISBN 0553281747.
