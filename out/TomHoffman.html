        as part of a comprehensive program to integrate learning at Feinstien with the Web.  What follows is from what <a href="TomHoffman.html">TomHoffman</a> had to say on the former home page of Feinstein High School cerca June, 2002:

        <strong>Zope, Zwiki & Squishdot</strong> The first version of the new Feinstein High School website was created during July 2001. In typical FHS form, I was given 10 days notice to prepare 3 days of professional development on technology for part of our new incoming staff. I hastily assembled a site to illustrate and demonstrate basic ideas about creating and using dynamic content on our website, using the Zope web application environment, and two well established zope modules or "products," the Squishdot weblog, and Zwiki, a wiki implementation. I created accounts for each teacher on the site, which allowed them to create and edit wikis and contribute news to the weblog.

        Here is the wiki deployed at Feinstein High School which is open to the world on the web in the spirit of wiki:  <a href="http://www.feinsteinhs.org/FHS/home/zwiki/FrontPage">http://www.feinsteinhs.org/FHS/home/zwiki/FrontPage</a> <a href="http://andreweweww.wordpress.com/">http://andreweweww.wordpress.com/</a>
