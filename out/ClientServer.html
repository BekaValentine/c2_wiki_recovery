        Client Server
      </h1>
      <p>
        Every communication book I ever saw had a page of topology
        diagrams that showed the StarNetwork as a starting point
        from which to generalize to truly interesting configurations.
        My peers and I have always looked down our noses at anything
        labeled client-server without actually realizing that the
        issue has nothing much to do with topology.

        The real issue is division of responsibility in
        the presence of two masters.  Consider business:
        The business put in the first computer and expected
        it to serve business needs.  These were largely related to enterprise
        integrity.  Now forward-looking businesses provide employees
        with personal computers.  These computers serve their users
        by increasing personal productivity.  It is important to 
        understand this fine distinction.  The client computer serves
        the user who serves the business.  The client computer does
        not serve the business directly.  With this distinction
        clearly in mind it becomes much easier to allocate 
        responsibilities and design protocols in client-server 
        systems.

        I always considered "client/server" architecture to be <a href="FatClient.html">FatClient</a>s with at least network/remote RDBMS access via queries instead of file-based table access (such as "LAN databases" that came before). Most of the business logic happend on the client, but "large-scale" processing was done on a database server using either queries or <a href="StoredProcedures.html">StoredProcedures</a>. This differs from web-apps, which has most of the business logic on the server and uses web browsers. They had rich GUI's, but difficult deployability. --top
