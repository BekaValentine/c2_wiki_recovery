        This Is Management

        An anecdote by <a href="TomDeMarco.html">TomDeMarco</a> in <a href="PeopleWare.html">PeopleWare</a> (p.34) about caring for people - one of the essential aspects of <a href="LeaderShip.html">LeaderShip</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently in his early years as a developer, <a href="DeMarco.html">DeMarco</a> had to come in to work from his sick bed, on a snowy day, to pull together a demonstration for users of a system that was "shaky".  His manager came in, found him propped up at the console, disappeared, and came back with a container of soup.  He asked her how she found time to do such things, what with all of the management work she had to do.  She smiled and said, "Tom, this <strong>is</strong> management."  She knew that her function was not to make people work, but to make it possible for people to work.
