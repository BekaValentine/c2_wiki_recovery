        I am currently working as part of the Web Development team at Network Masters, Inc.  I've just finished e-commerce projects in ASP, (one using Site Server, Commerce Edition), and I'm looking forward to working on Java development projects in Unix and Windows.  I'm new to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> concepts, but I can appreciate some of the ideas like constant refactoring and pair programming.  I'm interested in learning more and am looking for a quick way to get a sense of these techniques.  I'm also interested in learning about testing techniques.
