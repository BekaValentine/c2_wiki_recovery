        We're happy to announce a guest visit from Bjorn Freeman-Benson at August 2003's monthly meeting of XPDX.
        Bjorn presented at this year's Agile Development Conference speaking about YP, the XP like process specifically adapted to the politically charged environment of urban planning. We've invited Bjorn to present excerpts from this talk along with whatever else he would like to share with us.
