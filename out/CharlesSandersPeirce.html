        From 1879 to 1884 he was a Lecturer in Logic at John Hopkins University, where John Dewey was a graduate student. His contract with Hopkins was not renewed because of a scandal involving his divorce and remarriage.

        In 1891 he was force to resign from the Coastal Survey. After the failure of a number of business ventures, he retired to Arisbe, his home in Milford, Pennsyvania, where he spent his last years in poverty and illness, supported in part by the charity of James and producing an enormous quantity of unfinished and unpublished manuscripts.
