        Call Of Cthulhu

      <p>
        One of the best <a href="RolePlayingGame.html">RolePlayingGame</a>s of all time, <a href="CallOfCthulhu.html">CallOfCthulhu</a>, was based on the writings of <a href="HpLovecraft.html">HpLovecraft</a>. Its rule system did as much as any to embody the gameworld's ideology. You had a Cthulhu Mythos knowledge skill, ranging from 0% to 100%, and your maximum Sanity was 100-Cthulhu Mythos. So as you learned more, you became more deranged, and a character with full understanding of the Mythos had exactly a 0% chance of being sane.

        (Non-RPG-players and non-anime-fans, you may skip this paragraph.)  So there's this doujinshi RPG, based on dating sims.  It incorporates the Call of Cthulhu insanity rules.  Yes - high-school romance can drive you literally insane.  (You may now cackle evilly.)

        WizardsOfTheCoast have recently re-released <a href="CallOfCthulhu.html">CallOfCthulhu</a>. WOTC is famous for <a href="MagicTheGathering.html">MagicTheGathering</a> and bought out <a href="DungeonsAndDragons.html">DungeonsAndDragons</a>. Also, there's a long history of id Software cherrypicking talent from WOTC. Paul Jaquays also went to id from <a href="RolePlayingGame.html">RolePlayingGame</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        That is to say that WOTC have published the D20 version of Call Of Cthulhu - Chaosium is still the license holder.
