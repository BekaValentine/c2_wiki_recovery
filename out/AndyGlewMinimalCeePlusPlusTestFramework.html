        Andy Glew Minimal Cee Plus Plus Test Framework
      </h1>

        Header only.

        Designed to be easily adaptable to other test suites.
      </p>
      <p>
        Test cases are either free void functions
        or classes with a test() method.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="TestCollector.html">TestCollector</a> script simply greps for simple patterns
        of each, and creates a .c file that builds a testsuite.
        That testsuite can use any test framework you like,
        such as <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>.  I.e. my stuff can be considered
        just a simple interface to <a href="CppUnit.html">CppUnit</a>, although it also 
        works with other test frameworks.

           Sorry, I work or have worked for companies that make it difficult to make code public. I nevertheless hope that simply describing it may be useful to others.

           I have been using this framework "in production" since 1996.

           Latest addition: the script that greps and counts events such as "TEST STARTED", "TEST PASSED", and "TEST FAILED" has been made into a GUI widget using Python/Tk. Thanks Hank Pellerin!
