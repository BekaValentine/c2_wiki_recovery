        Once a <a href="CodeFork.html">CodeFork</a> from <a href="NetBsd.html">NetBsd</a>, <a href="OpenBsd.html">OpenBsd</a> places an emphasis on security and code correctness. Nearly all of the code base has been subjected to rigorous code audits, including versions of Bind and Apache. The <a href="OpenBsd.html">OpenBsd</a> project claims to have only had two remote root vulnerabilities on a default install since 1996.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the 4.2 release they decided to make their first complete install ISO ready to burn for everybody. They did not provide that in the past because they thought people should understand <a href="OpenBsd.html">OpenBsd</a> before they install it.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is said that
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="OpenBsd.html">OpenBsd</a> responds faster than any other <a href="BsdOs.html">BsdOs</a> (like <a href="FreeBsd.html">FreeBsd</a>) to security issues.
        </li>
        <li>
           updates to releases come in tiny source code patches, with which you could recompile tiny parts of the tree to fix your problems.  
        </li>
        <li>
           It includes audited versions of <a href="ApacheHttpd.html">ApacheHttpd</a> and <a href="LynxBrowser.html">LynxBrowser</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           It has a stellar documentation (there's a man page for almost everything, and <em>they make sense</em>).
        </li>
      </ul>

        This claim <em>they make sense</em> is in my view a touch on the conservative side. I had never before installed a Unix or even been root admin on one, or been a power user. I installed <a href="OpenBsd.html">OpenBsd</a> easily, if only I had read the all the nice email it sends you and followed its advice I would have had no trouble at all. While sitting there reading man page, my intelligent but unix illiterate son looked over my shoulder, he noticed in the first 10 seconds of reading (he reads *very* fast), "Hey that makes sense, it is trying to help you". I checked and made sure that I found out what he meant. Other documentation he had read (on windows  applications) sort of mumbles around, this man page seemed to be <em>trying</em> (in an active sense) to be both clear and helpful. I know your mileage may vary and that at times it is very hard to convince any UNIX like man to give you the right page, but "Hey that makes sense, it is trying to help you" is the most outstanding praise I have ever heard a help system receive. -- contented new user

        For those interested in security, there is also <a href="BastilleLinux.html">BastilleLinux</a>. Like <a href="OpenBsd.html">OpenBsd</a>, it is meant to be highly secure on a default installation.
