        Hy Time
      </h1>
      <p>
        A rich hypertext facility used in SGML (<a href="StandardGeneralizedMarkupLanguage.html">StandardGeneralizedMarkupLanguage</a>) documents. XLink is to <a href="HyTime.html">HyTime</a> as XML is to SGML.
      </p>
      <p>
        From <a href="http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/hytimeKimber9701.html">http://www.oasis-open.org/cover/hytimeKimber9701.html</a> :
      </p>
      <p>
        "<a href="HyTime.html">HyTime</a> is an application of SGML: to oversimplify, <a href="HyTime.html">HyTime</a> defines a set of
        element types that you can use with your existing SGML document types to
        provide hyperlinking and other facilities in a standardized way.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, <a href="HyTime.html">HyTime</a> effectively extends SGML by defining a standard set
        of facilities for doing hypertext and multimedia presentations.  
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="HyTime.html">HyTime</a> does not compete with or change SGML in any way--it simply builds on
        the basic facilities SGML provides.  In particular, <a href="HyTime.html">HyTime</a> provides the
        following hypertext-related facilities:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           A general model of hyperlinks and syntax for hyperlink representation using SGML elements.  This is much more than simple ID/IDREF.
        </li>
        <li>
           Facilities for addressing things other than elements with IDs in the local document: cross-document ID refs, references to elements without IDs, references to data characters,references to multiple objects at once.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These are facilities that all hypertext applications need.  <a href="HyTime.html">HyTime</a> provides
        a general and robust mechanism for adding them to SGML documents and SGML
        processing applications.  <a href="HyTime.html">HyTime</a> can also be integrated with other
        mechanisms, such as TEI extended pointers or HTTP URLs."
