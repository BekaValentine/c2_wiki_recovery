        Is The Term Process Problematic
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="ProcessImprovementTools.html">ProcessImprovementTools</a>...
      </p>
      <p>
        Even calling software development a "process" is problematic.  Maybe calling software development (or parts of software development) a "skill" would help.  Then we could borrow "skill improvement tools" and "skill improvement techniques" from other endeavors.  See <a href="WhatRecursEverySoftwareProject.html">WhatRecursEverySoftwareProject</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Would you care to expand on why the term "process" is problematic?  I see a "skill" as something an individual may possess, while a "process" is something that a business may do.  I think it is also important to distinguish between a "process" and a "project."  A project is bounded in terms of budget, resources, and schedule.  A process has none of these bounds.  A lot of CMM, ISO, and the like focus on software development as a project, not software development as a process.</em>

        In my opinion, I don't think the term <em>process</em> precisely captures what software development is.  I prefer terms such as <em>skill-based endeavor</em>,  <em>human-activity system</em>, <em>group-of-humans activity</em>, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        The term <em>process</em>, to me, infers something that repeats day after day.  It applies well to an assembly line.  But I would group software development with business, leadership, economics, politics, etc.  These activities have some repetition, but it is not day-after-day repetition, and it is not identical repetition.
      </p>
      <p>
        Things <em>sort-of</em> repeat, <em>sort-of</em> regularly.  Again, see <a href="WhatRecursEverySoftwareProject.html">WhatRecursEverySoftwareProject</a>.  Skill, expertise, and experience are used to react to these <em>sort-of</em> repeating things, rather than a recipe that trained monkeys can use.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, I think that when you write down what good software development is, you get a set of skills/experience/expertise/patterns/rules, rather than a step-by-step process.
