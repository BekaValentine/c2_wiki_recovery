      <p>
        Groove.Net at <a href="http://www.groove.net">http://www.groove.net</a> is the new company by <a href="RayOzzie.html">RayOzzie</a>. Its first
        product is Groove, a <a href="PeerToPeer.html">PeerToPeer</a> collaborative environment that is built on a XML transaction engine that can distribute changed content to connected, and occasionally connected participants.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's <a href="WikiLike.html">WikiLike</a> in nature, because it basically allows everybody to create a space, to invite people into that space and everybody in a space to edit the contents. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A space is made up of a number of GrooveTools (like FileLibrary, Discussion, PictureAlbum, <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>, Outliner and more)
      </p>
      <p>
        Tools can be created by hacking some XML, HTML and <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> (if the tool uses the basic functionality that Groove supports) or with Java, C++ etc. that support COM. Groove fully supports the <a href="ModelViewController.html">ModelViewController</a> way of doing things.

        I have used the Preview Edition of <a href="GrooveNet.html">GrooveNet</a> for several weeks now. It's great! What do others think about it? Is there any alternative which provides the same ease of use?

        My dream would be to have a <a href="WikiClone.html">WikiClone</a> right inside of <a href="GrooveNet.html">GrooveNet</a> as a GrooveTool. -- <a href="FrankGerhardt.html">FrankGerhardt</a>

        As people start working in a virtual sense (as opposed to physically being there) then collaborative tools that people want are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           shared calendar
        </li>
        <li>
           project/tasks management
        </li>
        <li>
           file repository (much better than flinging attachments to and fro)
        </li>
        <li>
           threaded discussions
        </li>
        <li>
           IM - instant messaging
        </li>
        <li>
           shared notes and chat
        </li>
        <li>
           document review
        </li>
        <li>
           contact management
        </li>
        <li>
           non-adversarial writing (e.g. wiki)
        </li>
        <li>
           workflow
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The options that we have to work in this way are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Paid and free hosted based <a href="VirtualOffice.html">VirtualOffice</a> application services. Are they still there?
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="GrooveNet.html">GrooveNet</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           WindowsTerminalServices or CitrixMetaframe
        </li>
        <li>
           Remote Control like PcAnywhere or LapLink
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        As this page is about Groove, it would be good to produce some GrooveFaq for evaluators / users - the <a href="WikiWay.html">WikiWay</a>.
