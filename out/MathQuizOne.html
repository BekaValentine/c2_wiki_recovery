        <strong>Q3:</strong> Consider the three mathematical tasks below. How many can be accomplished? (To avoid helping others, <strong>do not give any comments yet on the individual tasks</strong>, but those who submit the correct total may be asked for such details later!)
      </p>
      <p>
        Task 1: Using only the digits 1, 2 and 3 (exactly once each) and standard mathematical symbols (but no letters), form a mathematical expression with value exactly 19. Please note that a symbol which rounds (or truncates) a non-integer value is not allowed for this task (not sufficiently standard). (I apologize for not mentioning this rule originally.) Note: generalizations of the factorial function are taught in some countries, but I doubt if they are widely known elsewhere, so they are not allowed (except during May 2002 for the one emailer who alerted me to them). 
        (See also note at end of page.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Task 2: The expression 9*7-4*8-2 (where * is the multiplication operator) has value 29 (since multiplication takes precedence over subtraction). Now suppose you evaluate using a calculator of the older type which implements add, subtract, multiply and divide in the order they are entered, so that the expression has value 470. Replace each multiplication and subtraction symbol with a mathematical symbol of your choice (without using letters, brackets, or digits) so that the value of the expression becomes 29 again. See <a href="MathQuizRuby.html">MathQuizRuby</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        [<a href="NicholasBasso.html">NicholasBasso</a> asked if use of 10^x (which is on his calculator) is allowed. He did not say which task he had in mind. 'No letters' bars the function for both T1 and T2. I didn't ban the '%' symbol for T1 because I could see no way to use it to obtain 19. For most calculators, '%' is not available or acts as an expression terminator, so it would not be acceptable for T2. You cannot invent new symbols for T1 (because defining them would require letters, and new symbols could hardly be called standard). General exponentiation (eg., 2^3) is allowed for T1, but not for T2 (because most calculators with a key for it label the key using letters). -- <a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a>] 
      </p>
      <p>
        Task 3: Given that v is a function (of t) satisfying the differential equation
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           
        </li>
      </ol>
      <code>
        t  dv/dt = 5 + 4 sin(v) + 3 cos(v) (t < 10),<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and that for t = 2, v is zero, prove that when t is the negative square root of 3, v is a rational multiple of pi.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Could you be more precise about the terms "standard mathematical symbols" and "a mathematical symbol of your choice"? (I can give examples of constructions that might be dubious, but I don't want to give any games away if they are part of what you intend...)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I certainly didn't mean symbols not usually seen in school textbooks. Indeed, for the second task, it would not be acceptable to use a symbol that cannot be found on most calculators. If still in doubt, email me.

        An email from <a href="DavidLong.html">DavidLong</a> prompted me to revise T1. He had used "ceiling". Although this uses letters, he assures me there is a standard symbol for this function. However, I had difficulty finding it in textbooks so I have barred it explicitly. -- vk
      </p>
      <p>
        Ceiling looks like [n] except that the brackets are only the vertical bars and the topmost horizontal bars. Floor has the bottommost horizontal bars. I can do it using funky notation too, but it simplifies to BEDMAS.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acknowledged, but it's simply a matter of whether the symbols are included in a published standard (eg., for schools), and have also been accepted by authors of textbooks (other than of books on number theory).
      </p>
      <p>
        Ceiling and floor are also commonly used in numerical analysis and computer science, and are crucial in the notation of common algorithmic analysis.

        I have now answered all three parts of Quiz Three and mailed Vicki. I am deliberately not putting my count of do-able tasks on this page, because I know that I have been loth to read it for fear of getting information I didn't want from other people's counts. (As it turns out, no one has submitted an answer that satisfied Vicki, so my worry has been unnecessary, but even so...) -- <a href="GarethMcCaughan.html">GarethMcCaughan</a> [<em>See note above. -- vk</em>] [Please read your mail again. -- gjm] <em>Your opening paragraph is within the rules.

      </p>
      <p>
        I don't understand in what relevant respect I have not "taken the plunge". I am content for the two e-mails I have sent you (one before and one after your latest clarification of the rules) to be "binding". I prefer not to say how many of the tasks I think can be done, because that would (if I'm right) give other readers of this page information that they would prefer not to have.

        <strong>I don't</strong>, but I'm going to guess it has something to do with harmonics and waves. It's 180 as in 180 degrees (pi radians). However, that sounds wrong because the ratios don't match the musical scale properly. On the other hand, the sequence is roughly the inverse of the harmonic sequence. -- anon
      </p>
      <p>
        OK, I got it now, but I don't see how graphing the sequence would have been of any help. -- <a href="StephanHouben.html">StephanHouben</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a general heuristic to solving sequences. The sequence is solved if you can find a transformation that makes it linear with one of the axes (preferably the x axis) being n and the other being T(n). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Also, graphing the sequence gives you a lot of information about its form by visual-pattern recognition. In this case, it seems as if the sequence is either bell-shaped (like a sine curve) or asymptotic to some y=c. In the latter case, it seems to be some sort of flipped decay curve, so you have to find the decay rate and the means to flip it. I got the recurrence which I later solved to give the actual formula. -- anon

        Q3 T1) (1+2)^3 in base 18 :) -- soobedaar [<em>No "8" allowed! -- vk</em>]
      </p>
      <p>
        No 8 used! The expression is (1+2)^3 but the base used is 18 (as against 10) -- soobedaar
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You are not allowed "8" in "forming the expression". That includes specifying a non-standard base. Anyway, you're supposed to give a count, not individual solutions. -- vk</em>

        Q1 and Q2 Have been solved (see <a href="MathQuizHistory.html">MathQuizHistory</a>) so that only leaves Q3. Q3 says <strong><em>How</em></strong> <strong>many</strong> tasks can be solved, so there could be four people; one says 0 tasks can be solved, one says 1 task can be solved, one says 2 tasks can be solved, and the last one says all 3 tasks can be solved. One will be right.
        So Q3 could easily be solved. -- <a href="KevinKostlan.html">KevinKostlan</a>

        Quite correct, Kevin. However, to get in the Hall of Fame, you need not just the right answer, but the right <em>reasons</em> (by email) why it's the right answer. -- vk

        Two can be done. Use [hint removed by vk] & easy calculus. I had to learn about differentials before saying that. Mail follows. -- <a href="MichelDauchez.html">MichelDauchez</a>

        Hall of game: vk. I did make 2 mistakes, once giving hints (I was proud and supposed I solved all); then reading rules too quickly. I got shot. Second chance? If only I had ... time, or ideas, or what misses to us all - success.

        I sent my solutions to Q3. Each had a different stupid trick to it, and I am not sure that you will accept a couple of the tricks that I used. (Update: My answer was that all three can be done.) -- <a href="BenTilly.html">BenTilly</a>

        Ben, you ignored the "no digits" stipulation for task 2, and slipped up in your trigonometry and substitution for task 3. -- <a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a>

        Are the shift operators << and >> allowed for Q3, part 1?
      </p>
      <p>
        That's a good question. It's about time someone asked about such symbols. My answer is that <, <<, >, >>, ++, --, etc. are specialized symbols related to some programming languages or used in number theory, but are not symbols commonly found in school mathematics textbooks, so they are not allowed. -- vk

        This is just silly. <a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a> should explicitly enumerate all of the allowed operations for Q3:T1 and Q3:T2. When she says that she will "accept answers" based on {+,-,*,/,!,%,sqrt} (for Q3:T1, right?), rather than volunteer the full list of acceptable operations explicity, <a href="VickiKerr.html">VickiKerr</a> is pointlessly making the problem drag on, with questions followed by one clarification after another. Having unspecified rules which are divulged a little bit at a time, upon violations,
        wastes everyone's time. It is irresponsible to present a problem for which you have not specified all of the rules, and you should consider how people might possibly misinterpret the rules when you are writing the specification.

        If only software manuals were all well-organized, with everything beautifully clear! I know the answers, and I'm certain the quiz is fair (and quite easy to boot). As already stated near the top of the page, "no-one is failed due to minor interpretation problems", so quit grumbling - you don't need to be spoon-fed. -- vk

        No credit for partial solutions - please take note of the instructions (at the top) for solvers, and hence avoid spoiling things for others. -- vk

        Ok for the Hall of Shame. They are all definitely doable. Although I used a sledgehammer for the last one so I may have blundered. -- <a href="AndrewCates.html">AndrewCates</a>

        You must have read the question, which makes it clear that Q3 calls for a count, with justification supplied by email. So I await your email, on receipt of which you will be considered to have submitted "3" as your answer. -- vk
      </p>
      <p>
        Email sent - how do you get back to me? Incidentally, you are a bit of a rule-changer. Above, you only said "but those who submit the correct total may be asked for such details later"; now, apparently, I need the details up front.
      </p>
      <p>
        That assumes you submitted the correct total! You made some mathematical slips, at least one of which was crucial. A good attempt though. -- vk
