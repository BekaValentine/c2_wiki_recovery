      <p>
        C. J. Cherryh is a very good <a href="ScienceFiction.html">ScienceFiction</a> writer. Her most popular universe is the Alliance-Union universe, also known as the Merchanters universe. Books in this universe tend to be spread out over lightyears and centuries, so it's not really a series. Another good universe is the Foreigner universe which has a <strong>very</strong> interesting alien race.

        Her novel <em></em>DownbelowStation<em> won a </em><a href="HugoAward.html">HugoAward</a>.

        The above was written by me. I've currently read <em></em>DownbelowStation<em>, </em>Cyteen<em>, and </em>MeregovinNights<em> in her Alliance-Union universe, and all the books currently published in the Foreigner universe. They're very good. -- </em><a href="JonathanRosebaugh.html">JonathanRosebaugh</a>

        According to the author, the 'h' at the end of her last name is silent.

        I read <em>Hammerfall</em>, and it was great!

        I seldom had a book, in which the language got so close to a poem. 
        It flowed all the time, never stopping but always with fluctuating power.
