        Refers to those who indiscriminately destroy Wiki content by removing or rearranging it. Those who indiscriminately destroy Wiki content by adding to it are called something else.

        <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a>s start at the top of <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> and work their way down. <a href="WikiButcher.html">WikiButcher</a>s just pick some page or bunch of pages they dislike, or some correspondent or topic they dislike, and commence <a href="DisagreeByDeleting.html">DisagreeByDeleting</a>.

        Many Wiki participants keep locally archived copies of material on Wiki. Your attempt to destroy the conversation will prove futile. If you have anything to say, contribute; otherwise, go play somewhere else.

        <em>To what extent does this conflict with </em><a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a>? If someone has to keep a backup to prevent a page being butchered, does this mean that Wiki only works because people have to struggle to make it work? I assumed that Wiki works because <a href="WikiButcher.html">WikiButcher</a>s were rare.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki works both because the butchers are rare and because those who care exist. In the end, we will outlast any <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a>s.

        How do people save pages? Do they just paste them into their favorite word processor? Do they have programs that archive them automatically?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Simple text file, named accordingly.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Whenever you contribute something that you think of value you can copy and paste the text of a page and keep it yourself in a safe place. Next after the <a href="WikiVandal.html">WikiVandal</a>s have gone away, you can easily restore anything.
      </p>

        <em>Ok, but if I deleted this page now, nobody could see it for minutes/hours! I still hardly can believe that this works, but it seems so... And if it really does, it means a victory of democracy to me.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <em>Ever hear of </em><a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a> and <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>?  Shows up instantly...<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It <strong>is</strong> a little victory. See <a href="WhyWikiWorks.html">WhyWikiWorks</a> or learn how to <a href="RefactorMercilessly.html">RefactorMercilessly</a>.

        Sometimes content gets moved, not deleted.
        The contributions of <a href="SchizoidGibberishWikiAuthor.html">SchizoidGibberishWikiAuthor</a>, for example, are so unique and special that they may be moved to that page just to make them more easily accessible for analysis.
