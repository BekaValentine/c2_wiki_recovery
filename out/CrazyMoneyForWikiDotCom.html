        <em>We also got wind of a potential blockbuster deal that is in the works. Dynamo.com has agreed to sell Wiki.com to John Gotts of Searching.com for $2,860,000. The contract (which we have seen) calls for Gotts to make six monthly payments of $10,000 each, followed by a huge balloon payment of $2.8 million before the domain is transferred. Gotts made the first 10K payment this week and Dynamo has pointed the nameservers to his host to allow Gotts to start using the domain. Gotts could walk away from the deal before making the balloon payment, but would forfeit all payments made if he does so before the deal is completed.</em>
