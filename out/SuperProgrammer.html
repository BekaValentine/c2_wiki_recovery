        <a href="SuperProgrammer.html">SuperProgrammer</a>s look just like ordinary programmers but are 2, 10 or 100 times more "productive", depending on who you read, which <a href="SuperProgrammer.html">SuperProgrammer</a> you're looking at and how you're defining productivity.

        Note: you might well be two times more productive than the next guy, but you better not expect to <em>earn</em> twice as much... -- <a href="JayBell.html">JayBell</a>

        <em>Why not?</em>

        Take two programmers X and Y. Assuming X and Y have similar experience and seniority, they'll probably earn similar salaries. If X happens to be a <a href="SuperProgrammer.html">SuperProgrammer</a> and twice as productive as Y... well perhaps he's got a better chance of promotion. Or a bonus. It's unlikely he'll ever earn twice as much as Y, though. <em>In my experience</em>. If yours is different, please tell me where you work!

        <em>I agree with your experience, but the question was more rhetorical - in other words, why is that not a reasonable expectation? On the other hand, if you really *are* 2 (or more) times as productive as the next guy, you ought to be able to make a killing in contract work (just don't charge by the hour)..</em>
