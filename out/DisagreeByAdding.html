        You find something on a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> that you disagree with.  Excellent.  Maybe you've got something valuable that others would like to read.
      </p>
      <p>
        So add it.  Or start a page that asserts a contrary idea.

        No need to <a href="DisagreeByDeleting.html">DisagreeByDeleting</a> or <a href="DisagreeByDistorting.html">DisagreeByDistorting</a>.

        Try this also.  You find something on a <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a> that you disagree with.  <em>Hold on right there.</em>  What assumptions are supporting your theory of disagreement?  Question some of those assumptions, and for any interesting questions that pop out, consider sharing those on the page in question.  This technique has two benefits, the avoidance of <a href="PissingMatch.html">PissingMatch</a>es and the discovery of interesting overlooked detail.
