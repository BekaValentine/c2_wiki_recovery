        "Darth Vader Strikes Back"
      </p>
      <p>
        There's going to be an extra scene included in the 
        DVD release of EMPIRE STRIKES BACK coming up next year! Basically, it expands 
        on the scene where Vader reveals his fatherhood to Luke, and ties up some loose 
        ends created with the release of Episode 1...

        The Empire Strikes Back: 
        Extra-Special Edition

      <p>
        INT: BESPIN GANTRY - MOMENTS LATER:
      </p>
      <p>
        A furious lightsaber duel is underway. DARTH VADER is backing LUKE SKYWALKER towards the end of the 
        gantry. A quick move by Vader chops off Luke's saber-hand! It goes spinning off into 
        the ventilation shaft. Luke backs away. He looks around, but realizes there's 
        nowhere to go but straight down.
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: Obi Wan never told you 
        what happened to your father.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke: He told me enough! He told me you 
        killed him!
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: No... I am your father!
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke: No, it's not true! It's 
        impossible.
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: Search your feelings... you know it to be true...
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke:  NO!
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: Yes, it is true... and you know what else? You know that brass 
        droid of yours?
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke: Threepio?
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: Yes... Threepio... I built 
        him...when I was 7 years old...
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke: No...
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: Seven years old? And 
        what have you done? Look at yourself, no hand, no job, and couldn't even 
        levitate your own ship out of the swamp...
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke: I destroyed your precious Death Star!
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: When you were 20!  When I was 10, I single-handedly 
        destroyed a Trade Federation Droid Control ship!
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke: Well, it's not my 
        fault...
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: Oh, here we go... "Poor me...my father never gave me 
        what I wanted for my birthday... boo hoo, my daddy's the Dark Lord of the 
        Sith...waahhh wahhh!"
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke: Shut up...
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: You're a slacker! By the 
        time I was your age, I had exterminated the Jedi knights!
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke: I used to race 
        my T-16 through Beggar's Canyon
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: Oh, for the love of the Emperor...10 years old, winner of the Boonta Eve Open... Only human to ever fly a Pod Racer... right here, baby!
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke looks down the shaft. Takes a 
        step towards it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: And at your age, I'd made out with a member of the Senate who <em>wasn't</em> also my sister.
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke gets a confused look on his face.
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: I was wrong... You're not my kid...I don't know 
        whose you are, but you sure ain't mine...
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke takes a step off the platform, hesitates, then plunges down the shaft. Darth Vader looks after him.
      </p>
      <p>
        Darth Vader: Get a haircut!   
      </p>
      <p>
        Luke shouting back from the shaft - his voice is fading - : at least I don't use a respiratory machine to make me sound like JamesEarlJones!!!
