        Ray Ozzie
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="RayOzzie.html">RayOzzie</a> is now more famous in Nov05 for his leaked memo, a situation review for <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a> and its directions.
      </p>
      <p>
        A copy of the purposefully leaked email can be found at <a href="http://www.scripting.com/disruption/ozzie/TheInternetServicesDisruptio.htm">http://www.scripting.com/disruption/ozzie/TheInternetServicesDisruptio.htm</a>  It is clearly intended to be nothing but advertising -- i.e., its purpose as an objective "situation review" is questionable -- but it may be interesting as an insight into Microsoft's marketing strategy.

      <p>
        In late 05 Ray became the one of three people to hold the title of ChiefTechnicalOfficer at Microsoft.

        In 2006, he took on the role of Chief Software Architect, the position previously held by <a href="BillGates.html">BillGates</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        He was previously the head of <a href="GrooveNet.html">GrooveNet</a> before its acquisition in 05 by MS, and before that the architect of <a href="LotusNotes.html">LotusNotes</a>.
