        Don't believe it. We don't want you to believe it. SkullAndBones is just a fraternity. That stuff on your money is just decoration. And you are all citizens. No, really! Your problems are your own. Don't come crying to us. We don't exist. --<a href="BavarianIlluminati.html">BavarianIlluminati</a>

        According to some <a href="GrandConspiracy.html">GrandConspiracy</a> theories, e.g. in <a href="TheIlluminatusTrilogy.html">TheIlluminatusTrilogy</a> by RobertShea and <a href="RobertAntonWilson.html">RobertAntonWilson</a>, the <a href="BavarianIlluminati.html">BavarianIlluminati</a> control the world. <strong>Fnord</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        They do, indeed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Rumor has it, <a href="JohannWolfgangGoethe.html">JohannWolfgangGoethe</a> was one of them, and <a href="JohannSebastianBach.html">JohannSebastianBach</a>, too. Start to see a pattern here?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So Lectroids are Illuminati?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It's all terribly clear - Johanns form the Illuminati, Roberts oppose them!</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Exactly. Also note that they seem to be involved in JFK's <em>assassination</em> <strong>Fnord</strong>. A word directly evolved from the word <em>hashishim</em>, the name of the ancient predecessors of the <a href="BavarianIlluminati.html">BavarianIlluminati</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        If I'm not mistaken, the hashishim were middle eastern assassins that frequently used cannabis, hence both derivatives: assassin and hashish.

        Synchronicity! I was off work sick yesterday and reread the first two-thirds of <a href="TheIlluminatusTrilogy.html">TheIlluminatusTrilogy</a> in bed... I come back in today, check <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>, and there they are, right at the top of the list! It's all true! Or, at least, something is...

        John! A Johann! Don't listen to him. -- RobertRoberts

        And Masson is surely a thinly-disguised Mason. He must not be trusted. -- <a href="PaulTevis.html">PaulTevis</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        But doesn't the movie BobRoberts imply that the protagonist is Machiavellian enough to be one of the Illuminati?

        Just think. How much food has been canned in Mason jars? I won't even mention the pyramid-with-an-eye thingy on the dollar bill. (Uh-oh, I just did...)

        <em>All of those names derive from the Roman god "Ianus"/"Janus"(derived from Latin "ianua", meaning door), who had two (fnord) heads.  He was the ruler of Latium(the area where those who spoke Latin lived) and brought it into its "Golden Age".  He also reportedly saved the life of Romulus(the mythical founder of Rome), thereby making it rather believable that Ancient Rome was the original Illuminati(also notice which language "Illuminati" comes from)!</em>
