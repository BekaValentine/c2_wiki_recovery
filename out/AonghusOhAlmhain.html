        My name should read Aonghus Ã“ hAlmhain, but even <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>s cannot be comprehensive... or is this another example of <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>?

        I've worked in embedded software since 1990, and have become passionate about better processes through being both the perpetrator and victim of <a href="HeroicProgramming.html">HeroicProgramming</a> and suffering from <a href="AnalysisParalysis.html">AnalysisParalysis</a>. But I still see myself as a <a href="SoftwareEngineer.html">SoftwareEngineer</a> rather than <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a>. I've programmed mostly in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> and <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>, especially for a Motorola DSP, and mostly due to memory and timing constraints.

        I worked for ten years in Germany for a company which is now called Bombardier, but was AEG when I first joined.

        This train was one project there - motor control in <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> (with some <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>) on a 80C166 Microcontroller.

        I also worked for <a href="http://www.captec.ie,">http://www.captec.ie,</a> a small Irish Space related software company.

        I'm a native Irish Speaker, hence <a href="WikiLaistighDeNoimead.html">WikiLaistighDeNoimead</a>.
