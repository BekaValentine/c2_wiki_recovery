        Here Document
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <em>here document</em> refers to a way of embedding one document, formatted in one way) into another enclosing document, often formatted in a different way, where the two document formats would clash.  The term originated (I believe) with the <a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a>, which uses two left-angle-brackets followed by a sequence of characters, followed by the content, followed by a line containing nothing but the sequence of characters, i.e.
      </p>
      <code>
        Usage()<br/>
        echo <<FOOBARHELP<br/>
        This program rearranges the foobars installed on your computer <br/>
        system.  To use, invoke with the following options:  <blah blah blah><br/>
        FOOBARHELP          <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Lots of other programming languages--most notably scripting languages and markup formats, have here documents.  <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> uses a syntax very similar to <a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> uses three double quotes to begin and end here documents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ExtensibleMarkupLanguage.html">ExtensibleMarkupLanguage</a> uses CDATA sections.
      </p>
      <p>
        Within a here document, the formatting of the enclosing (host) language is generally disabled; other than searching for the end tag (and possibly an EscapeSequence).  EscapeSequences may or may not be provided to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Quote the end tag, if it must be part of the enclosed text
        </li>
        <li>
           Drop back into the host language (kind of like the comma in <a href="CommonLisp.html">CommonLisp</a>--though quoted and QuasiQuoted blocks in Lisp are not <a href="HereDocument.html">HereDocument</a>s as they must be well-formed <a href="EssExpression.html">EssExpression</a>s.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If escape sequences are not provided; then it is not possible to quote any text containing the end tag.  Some languages (<a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a>, Perl) allow you to specify the end tag; so that an end tag which <em>isn't</em> in the quoted document can be chosen.  (In <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a>, the three double quotes can be quoted if need be; with XML CDATA sections you are screwed...I think).
      </p>
      <p>
        Some languages (embedding files in mail and Usenet posts and HTTP posts and <a href="BourneShell.html">BourneShell</a>) allow you to specify not merely an end *character*, but an end *string*.
        This makes it possible to put *anything* in the enclosed text without having to escape it (with one exception mentioned at <a href="QuineProgram.html">QuineProgram</a>). As long as the enclosed text is less than 17 KB long, you're guaranteed that there is at least one 3-letter "word" that does not occur anywhere in it. As long as the enclosed text is less than 1 terabyte long, you're guaranteed that there is at least one 9-letter "word" that does not occur anywhere in it.
        (I saw one ClientHttpRequest implementation pick a random 64 bit number in radix-36 every time, hoping that particular string of 12 letters and digits doesn't occur in the text).
