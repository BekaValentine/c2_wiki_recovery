        Refactor Move To Front
      </h1>
      <p>
        When someone makes a complaint that something is difficult to find, find it yourself and move it to the front of a page that such a person would likely visit on their search for the topic.

        <strong>Examples</strong>

      <p>
        A while back, someone complained that the <a href="ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap.html">ExtremeProgrammingRoadmap</a> page (which is a common entrypoint to Wiki and <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>) was devoid of links that started from the basics. Placing the current greeting at the top of that page is an attempt to <a href="RefactorMoveToFront.html">RefactorMoveToFront</a> so that future visitors don't get frustrated in the same way.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the <a href="WhyWikiWorksNot.html">WhyWikiWorksNot</a> page, someone mentioned that they didn't <a href="UseSignatures.html">UseSignatures</a> because they didn't know how to. After a <a href="RefactorMoveToFront.html">RefactorMoveToFront</a>, future people who reference that page (after presumably visiting it at least once) will not have the same problem.
      </p>

        See <a href="MoveToFront.html">MoveToFront</a> and <a href="MoveToFrontLists.html">MoveToFrontLists</a>.
