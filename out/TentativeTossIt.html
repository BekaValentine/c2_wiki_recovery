        Tentative Toss It
      </h1>
      <p>
        As described under <a href="TossIt.html">TossIt</a>, it's wise to discard things that you aren't using, or clutter will accumulate. However, if the items are difficult to replace, a wise strategy is to "toss" them someplace out of your way for a while, but still keep the option to get them back. Perhaps development machines need a "Junkbox" directory somewhere to store the bits and pieces we aren't sure we want to permanently eliminate yet. Thus you "toss" on a trial basis. If some appropriate amount of time passes and you find that you don't miss having them, then finish the job.
      </p>

        The "trash can" of desktop GUIs and email programs is a nice instance of this pattern. You can delete files and email messages without worrying that you might want them back. It takes a second action ("emptying the trash") to finish the job. For instance, under <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> you'd look at the Recycle Bin, sort by date, then point-and-click on the files you wanted to permanently ashcan. When files are deleted from the Recycle Bin they are <strong>gone</strong>. Such systems would be even better if they had a command like, "Permanently delete all files from the trash can that are more than one month old." Windows provides a point-and-click solution, but no easy way to automate such a task (?).

        As an aside, it may be wise to keep a log of one's development efforts in a "Road Not Traveled" collection of some kind. (See <a href="TheRoadNotTraveled.html">TheRoadNotTraveled</a>) Use it to store algorithms, design sketches, even entire sets of functional code. It's nice to have something that Johnny-come-lately can look at so that he doesn't reinvent the square wheel.

        The "Road not traveled" idea saved me a lot of trouble recently when I took over maintenance of a project involving some technologies that I wasn't very familiar with. The code was sprinkled with bits of code, commented out, with notes to the effect of "Didn't work. Darn!"

        I do something similar fairly regularly:  I seem to be moving house quite often these past few years.  When I move to the new house, I don't immediately unpack everything.  Eventually, I'm left with one box containing things that I've not used in 9 months to a year.  I try to simply throw this box out once it's been unused for this long.

        <em>I was thinking about refactoring </em><a href="TossIt.html">TossIt</a>.  Checking for backlinks brought this page up.  Are you guys planning on continuing the the work you started here?  Need a hand?  Want me to help/back off?<em></em>

        If you think it would be a good idea to refactor <a href="TossIt.html">TossIt</a>, <a href="PerpetualNow.html">PerpetualNow</a>, <a href="TheRoadNotTraveled.html">TheRoadNotTraveled</a>, <a href="JunkBox.html">JunkBox</a>, this page, and anything else you think fits, then sure -- give it a try. Please, first create a new comprehensive page before axing all the old stuff. And don't forget the backlinks.
