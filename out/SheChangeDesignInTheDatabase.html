        She Change Design In The Database
      </h1>
      <p>
        An old friend of mine, a veteran of many programming campaigns, approached me the other day seeking tips for using a library, and we discussed how our careers had progressed ever since we had parted ... company.
      </p>
      <p>
        He told me a hushed secret; for a long time now he hadn't been able to kill any bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        This worried me, because we all know bugs are a fact of programming life. Our job is to write code, find bugs in it, make a list of them, and remove them one by one.
      </p>
      <p>
        When pressed on the matter he confessed the reason he hadn't been able to kill any bugs was because he (and his project's QA team) could never /find/ any bugs.
      </p>
      <p>
        I advised him to look harder, but of course his disclosure made me fear for his sanity. He's either not writing hard programs, or he's delusional and debugging without realizing it.
      </p>
      <p>
        His project is the kernel of an object database; everyone knows such an endeavor requires many long nights and weekends debugging. I inquired, obliquely, about his sleeping and recreational regimen, and he assured me that all his vacation time was used up and that he worked only 7 hours a day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Faced with someone clearly delusional of course I did not attempt to berate him or confront him with the evidence of his disease. But I advised we meet to discuss this at some future date, after he had the opportunity to have more (or possibly less) vacation time.
      </p>
      <p>
        When we met at the agreed upon location and time he arrived accompanied by the San Diego rock band Sprung Monkey, who proceeded to play a cover of Harry Nilsson's song [Put the Lime in the] Coconut, but with these lyrics:

        As my friend is clearly demented, I'm asking this Wiki (widely regarded as a bastion of sanity) how to disabuse him of the notion that writing programs without any debugging whatsoever is possible.

        But seriously, folks, an absolute 0 bug count might indicate your detector is broken. And >never< underestimate the value of a <a href="HairyArm.html">HairyArm</a>!
