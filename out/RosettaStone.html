        Rosetta Stone
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Rosetta Stone has become something people talk about. I had the chance to see the real thing recently, in the BritishMuseum in <a href="LondonTown.html">LondonTown</a>. Here are some facts as background. -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>

        <li>
           The <a href="RosettaStone.html">RosettaStone</a> has the same inscription in three languages (Greek, Demotic, and hieroglyphics). It was not written as a comparative text, or with an eye to the future. The inscription is a decree about the relationship between the Greek king and the Egyptian priests at the time, 196 BC.
        </li>
        <li>
           The <a href="RosettaStone.html">RosettaStone</a> was not originally at Rosetta. It ended up there after having been reused in a building.
        </li>
        <li>
           It was rediscovered by French soldiers in 1799, and then captured by British soldiers.
        </li>
        <li>
           The inscriptions were used in the nineteenth century to decode the Egyptian hieroglyphic script. This is the event which has led to the fame of the stone.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The point of this is that there was no <em>intention</em> by the originators to provide a parallel text as a crossindex. That is an accident of the survival of the stone.
