        Interfaces Vs Classes
      </h1>
      <p>
        Inspired by some discussions in <a href="DontDistinguishBetweenClassesAndInterfaces.html">DontDistinguishBetweenClassesAndInterfaces</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I like to say that interfaces are different from classes in at least two important ways (at least in Java):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They don't have class, and
        </li>
        <li>
           They don't have a life
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>They don't create the diamond inheritance problem that classes do</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        They don't have class in the sense that you cannot do anything useful at the class level with interfaced objects - in Java terms, there are no static methods.
      </p>
      <p>
        They don't have a life in the sense that the lifecycle of an interfaced object must be managed by another object.  Or, at least the creation must be.
      </p>
      <p>
        Should one use factories universally?  I've been tempted to think so.  There are some real limitations with public Java constructors, but I haven't had enough pain yet to pitch them entirely. If one does that, then the creation difference between interfaces and classes disappears.
