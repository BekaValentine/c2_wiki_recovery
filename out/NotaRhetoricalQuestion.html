        Nota Rhetorical Question
      </h1>
      <p>
        There's a habit of speech that many people from an anglo-saxon influenced cultures find quite confusing: asking questions because you want to know the answer. This confusion sometimes extends to written English. It occurs with speech, too, sometimes, if the listener is not attuned to the speaker's inflections.

        Given the "inflection free" nature of text, might it not be wise to avoid rhetorical questions?
