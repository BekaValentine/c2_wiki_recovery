        Learn Anew Metaphor

      <p>
        In order to flatten the normally steep learning curve associated with software, there seems to be a tendency to make it fit some existing metaphor.  The most common is paper; we also have cute little yellow file folders, among other things.

        They succeed in their initial goals sometimes -- like the <a href="AppleMacintosh.html">AppleMacintosh</a>.  Sometimes they fail miserably (insert your own example here).  But what they (almost) all have in common is that you are not <em>really</em> dealing with the object that was the inspiration of the metaphor, but a crude simulation.  Sooner or later, the metaphor breaks down; you can only take it so far.

        To avoid this, software may have to be written so that the user has to <a href="LearnAnewMetaphor.html">LearnAnewMetaphor</a>.

        (An aside: when I start talking about the paper metaphor I can't help but think about the <a href="XanaduProject.html">XanaduProject</a>.  It's only fitting that I link to it here.)
