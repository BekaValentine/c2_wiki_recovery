      <p>
        A wiki written in PHP. It has a great deal of flexibility, using a file of <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a> rules for the raw wiki text -> html and CSS for themes. It hasn't been around long, and any suggestions/improvements are welcome.

        <em>Hi, Ian - you need to change the text box definition so that 'textarea' becomes 'TEXTAREA' and adding 'ROWS=18 COLS=80 wrap=soft' (or similar). Similarly, replace 'input' by 'INPUT' for the 'restore from backup' facility.</em>

        XHTML documents must use lower case for all HTML element and attribute names.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, the HTML standard doesn't require capital letters for tag names. But it does require the rows and cols, so I'm adding them now.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe not, but wrap=soft is a good idea anyway as two-way scrolling is very inconvenient. Without wrap=soft, Netscape Communicator seems to need the capitals.</em>

        <em>Nice wiki, you may want to make it so that there is some difference between empty links and links with content.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The way of defining rules at the moment doesn't allow that, but I'll make something a bit more powerful once I get around to it. Ed: Now Using <a href="DokuWiki.html">DokuWiki</a>...

        "Bonjour! Interesting wiki. So simple that I might choose it to practice PHP and random generated CSS. May I transform it as I want? And even translate it? Actually, I would only be a start to make a french Database-free CMS. :-)   sourcelibre@yahoo.ca"

        This is so far the best and easyiest wiki I have found! Just great! Simple and well laid out. I am very happy!

        An easy to set up wiki, but has some serious issues with conflicting formatting rules.  For example, try //italics// at the start of a line, or // <a href="http://mylink.com">http://mylink.com</a> //
        <em>Hm.  This is easy to fix: I just need to reorder it so it parses the urls before the italics.</em>
