        To Factor Is To Automate
      </h1>
      <p>
        Factoring a piece of code (I deliberately conflate factoring and refactoring) is the same thing as automating.
      </p>
      <p>
        Factoring means taking a piece of repeated code like this (example in C++):
      </p>
      <code>
        myArray[i].structField.x = 1;<br/>
        myArray[i].structField.y = 2;<br/>
        myArray[i].structField.z = 3;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And factoring out the repetition like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        StructType & s = myArray[i].structField;<br/>
        s.x = 1;<br/>
        s.y = 2;<br/>
        s.z = 3;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        That's the same thing as automation, because the computer is doing the repetition for you as a result of the factorization.
      </p>
      <p>
        New programming languages give you new ways to factor your code, which also means you are being given new ways to automate the task of programming.
