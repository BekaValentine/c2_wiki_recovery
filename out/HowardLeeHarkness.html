        I may be reached at howard.lee.harkness@gmail.com, or at the email addresses listed on any of my websites.  I have 'wiki' in my whitelist, so please include that in your subject line if you email me.

        In May of 2013, I landed a contract doing embedded systems programming in C/Linux, which I hope will last until at least November 2013. Upon completion of my contract, I will probably seek a similar contract position. Plan B is to expand my violin teaching schedule.
