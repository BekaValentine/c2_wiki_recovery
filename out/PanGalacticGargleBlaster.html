        The recipe for the <a href="PanGalacticGargleBlaster.html">PanGalacticGargleBlaster</a> has been passed down for years at the 'Beach from one bartender to the next. The legend goes something like: 
      </p>
      <p>
        First pour in the juice of a bottle of the Ol' Janx Spirit, then add a measure of water from the Seas of Santraal V (Oh, that Santraal seawater! Oh, those Santraal fish!). Allow 3 cubes of Mantovin Mega-Gin to melt into the mixture (make sure it's properly iced, or the benzine will be lost!). Allow 2 1/2 liters of swamp gas to filter through, and, over the back of a spoon, float a measure of Algorian Mega-Mint, reminiscent of the Algor Regions... sweet, subtle and mystic. Finally, add the tooth of a Rakasta, watching it dissolve, spreading the red flames of the Second Sun deep into the heart of the concoction. Add an olive. Drink... but... veeerrrryyy carefully.....

        It's from the first book/chapter 2/page 17.  It's pretty much the first half of the whole chapter which is maybe five pages long.

        Specifically created by Zaphod to create the following effect:  When drunk, it feels exactly like having your brain slammed by a slice of lemon wrapped around a large gold brick.
