      <p>
        James J. Wagner...
      </p>
      <p>
        Apparently, I can't use my middle initial because I can't use two capital letters adjacent. If so, it isn't a <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> word. :-(
      </p>
      <p>
        Before I started at <a href="DigitalEquipmentCorporation.html">DigitalEquipmentCorporation</a>, I didn't really use my middle initial. I started there because the company had 100K+ employees, and, of course, there was another James Wagner. In fact, he worked in the same town and I used to get his mail once in a while. In fact, once he quit, I got ALL his mail.

        I now work for WorldCom, and there are 3 James Wagners and one other J. J. Wagner. I start many mail messages with "I'm James J. Wagner, not Jim Wagner". :-)

        I'm a <a href="SoftwareArchitect.html">SoftwareArchitect</a>, although after reading the Wiki page on that... I'm not sure if that is viewed as a good thing. I guess my best title (how I see myself) would be <a href="ArchitectAsKeeperOfTheFlame.html">ArchitectAsKeeperOfTheFlame</a>. I left <a href="DigitalEquipmentCorporation.html">DigitalEquipmentCorporation</a> to work at MCI (and still like to think of it as MCI, rather than WorldCom, for obvious reasons) on the Sheriff project. I've been there since day one (fall 1995) and am one of the few original people left. Probably one of the reasons that I am the <a href="ArchitectAsKeeperOfTheFlame.html">ArchitectAsKeeperOfTheFlame</a>.

        Went to school at UofM in Ann Arbor. Graduated in 1987 and went to work for <a href="DigitalEquipmentCorporation.html">DigitalEquipmentCorporation</a> in Marlboro MA. Worked there two years on a great team and got indoctrinated with the DigitalCulture... and loved it. For family reasons, transferred from MA to CO in 1989 and worked at DEC's Customer Support Center, doing tool development, until 1995 when I went to work at MCI.

        Wrote DWM for <a href="DecWeb.html">DecWeb</a>, an excellent PlayByEMailGame written by DaveTenny. Won game number 1, and a few after that. Any other <a href="DecWeb.html">DecWeb</a> players out there?

        Spoke at a few RationalUserConferences where I discussed <a href="RationalRose.html">RationalRose</a>. Checked out its wiki page... Wow... not too many fans here.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also spoke at a few other conferences on <a href="PublishAndSubscribe.html">PublishAndSubscribe</a> on behalf of Talarian, whose SmartSocket product is now handled by TIBCO.

        Guess that's it for now. :-)
