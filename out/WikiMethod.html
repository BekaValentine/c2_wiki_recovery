        Wiki Method
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is the process part of people, process and technology.  It's not enough to simply build a wiki and send out URLs.  It's not enough to book a band and a ball room... you actually have to send out an invitation list, to market it a bit, to get some early adopters, to get the word out, to use it for a purpose, to design it with some meaning, to fill a niche.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's very important to consider things <em>other</em> than the technology when making a wiki available... that is if you want it to be adopted.
