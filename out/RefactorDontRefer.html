        The wiki will end up containing a page for each different way of spelling each title? All of these pages will point back to the original? This seems like a horribly redundant practice. I hate having to wade through "pointer pages" to get to the content.

        The next guy who tries <a href="TruckFactor.html">TruckFactor</a> will have his text <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a>ed as well. I don't see the harm in that. When he comes back, he'll see what I've done and that will be that.

        I don't think we need to keep pages like ExceptionHierrachy just because maybe somebody will make the mistake. The <a href="ExceptionHierarchy.html">ExceptionHierarchy</a> page contains similar but not identical information. These two should be combined into a single page with the title spelled correctly. The remaining page should be deleted as it no longer serves a purpose.

      <p>
        <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> the incorrect page so that it is correct - whether that means correcting the spelling in the title or merely editing a few backlinks. Remember, WikiForgets.

        <em>("</em>ExceptionHierrachy" is just plain offensive and confused. I just voted my opinion with heavy-handed use of the edit button. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>, <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a> ;-)<em></em>

        Notes from one <a href="VolunteerHousekeeper.html">VolunteerHousekeeper</a> (the one who wrote <a href="ReferDontDelete.html">ReferDontDelete</a>) to another (the one who wrote <a href="RefactorDontRefer.html">RefactorDontRefer</a>):

           I never wanted to keep things like ExceptionHierrachy. I'm talking about arbitrarily-chosen names, such as the Truck{Factor,Number} ones. In fact, even now, after having spent the last thirty minutes writing about the two different pages, I can barely remember which is the official name and why.
        </li>
        <li>
           I never wanted to use the non-official names except in a temporary way. Their purpose is to increase <a href="HappyCollision.html">HappyCollision</a>'s, and then to be re-edited to the better name.

        What about all the pages with entries like:
        <a href="WikiPages.html">WikiPages</a> 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Plural of <a href="WikiPage.html">WikiPage</a>. - Great Explanation 
        </li>
        <li>
           Granularity of Links on Wiki (no links to parts of pages) 
        </li>
        <li>

        <em>That last one [the convention of keeping short pages] to keep appears counter-intuitive. For example, if a page is just the plural form of another page, and only contains a link to the other page, then it seems a bit much to have two pages. I'm imagining that you're saying that there's no sense in deleting a page that is a small start to an (important) new topic. -- </em><a href="JohnStoshMuczynski.html">JohnStoshMuczynski</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes it can be valuable to keep the short pages that just redirect to another page. Often the pluralized form is more commonly used in a sentence, while the non-plural form actually contains the content. Most people (especially newbies) will automatically link to the plural form instead of the non-plural form. If there was no redirection page then you'd just end up with someone creating the plural page as a new topic, and you'd then end up with (for example) <a href="FooBar.html">FooBar</a> and FooBars both having meaningful content, but developed completely independently. That's just irritating and wastes disk space. On the other hand, a short redirection page won't use very much space and it avoids all those problems.
