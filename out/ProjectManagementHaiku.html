        A few gems from the developer's craft:
      </p>
      <code>
        Our project was late,<br/>
        so we added more people.<br/>
        The problem got worse.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        When requirements changed,<br/>
        the schedule did not -- were we<br/>
        headed for trouble?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        We were doing fine,<br/>
        'til they reduced the budget.<br/>
        Now we're overspent.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        We think about risks.<br/>
        We have contingency plans.<br/>
        Oops ... but not for that.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I gave estimates.<br/>
        They cut all of them in half.<br/>
        Next time I'll pad them.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        We can't get it right<br/>
        and still come in on schedule.<br/>
        Why can't we do both?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        We hired consultants<br/>
        who told us how to fix things.<br/>
        They don't understand.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        There is no more time,<br/>
        but the work is unfinished.<br/>
        Take more time from Test.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        The module failed Test,<br/>
        so first we changed all the Tests.<br/>
        Now the requirements.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        If a project fails<br/>
        but no one reports it has,<br/>
        has it really failed?<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Schedule, people, scope<br/>
        Which one is least flexible?<br/>
        The boss says, "All three!"<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        I need to go pee<br/>
        But the PERT chart says that I<br/>
        Must wait until lunch<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Our project's timeline<br/>
        Was written by <a href="StephenKing.html">StephenKing</a><br/>
        Terrifying fiction<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Project's almost done<br/>
        Whoops!  The V.P. just got canned<br/>
        Now we start again!<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        <a href="MicrosoftProject.html">MicrosoftProject</a><br/>
        Lets the pointy haired boss make<br/>
        Ten-thousand task Gantts.<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        Work has proceeded<br/>
        Spring, Summer, Fall, and Winter.<br/>
        Now we start over.<br/>
      </code>
