        This is another form of the answer <a href="ItDepends.html">ItDepends</a>. It is the answer to a question which has no obvious answer in that it requires assumptions on the part of the answerer about the state of the questioner. Or the answer to a question which has two parts, and you can thereby supply the answer in two parts to stay in sync. This is a way to answer questions not meant to be serious in a similar tone.
