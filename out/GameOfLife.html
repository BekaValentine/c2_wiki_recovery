        The <a href="GameOfLife.html">GameOfLife</a> is a very simple <a href="CellularAutomaton.html">CellularAutomaton</a> invented by <a href="JohnHortonConway.html">JohnHortonConway</a> and popularized by the writings of <a href="MartinGardner.html">MartinGardner</a> in <a href="ScientificAmerican.html">ScientificAmerican</a> (e.g., Scientific American 223 (October 1970): 120-123). GOL is capable of universal computation and of self-reproduction, but is vastly simpler than the first <a href="CellularAutomaton.html">CellularAutomaton</a> capable of self-reproduction, discovered in the 1940s by <a href="JohnVonNeumann.html">JohnVonNeumann</a>.

        It is possible to build Life modules that act as logical AND, OR and NOT gates, therefore a <a href="TuringMachine.html">TuringMachine</a>, and therefore any computable model (including self-awareness if self-awareness is computable). <em>(True, but with all the other interesting capabilities of the game, is seems a shame to "reduce" it a mere Turing computing engine. Seems more more interesting to discover </em><a href="NonTuringComputing.html">NonTuringComputing</a> with it.)<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, I beg to differ! Isn't this the <em>inverse</em> of "reducing" it? It seems to me that this demonstration proves that it is <em>larger</em>, and therefore more interesting.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The solution to this paradox is that </em>ReductionIsGood. It sounds like a negative term, but it isn't. For me, reduction is almost synonymous with understanding.<em></em>

        This is also a graphic demonstration that emergent behavior at one abstraction level can be used to construct deterministic systems at another. This puts to bed, in my view, the logical fallacy that underlies many arguments against artificial life and artificial consciousness. The observed presence of "order" at one abstraction level (such as when looking at the elements of a computing engine built from Life) does not imply intentional design at lower abstraction level (such as the rules of the environment in which those elements operate).

        The author says: "The design for this Turing Machine is extendible by expanding the size of the Finite State Machine part and storing different numbers in the memory cells. The maximum size is 16 states and 8 symbols. This is sufficient for a Universal Turing Machine."
