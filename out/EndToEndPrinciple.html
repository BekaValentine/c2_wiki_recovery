        End to End Testing is an application of this principle.  It is tempting, especially in large systems, to define formal interfaces and then test to the interface specifications without doing end to end testing until the last minute as a "big bang integration."  This is almost always a disaster.  Even when it seems plausible, it breaks.  I had a significant signal processing project collapse on me because the contractor had not performed end-to-end testing but instead had done only simulation testing because the end product was really the same thing NOT.  We ended up with small errors in the hardware interface code which were nearly impossible to find because two versions of the interface code had been written -- the "test code" and the "delivered code" which had never been tested and had some subtle mistakes in it.  Not only end-to-end but absolute fidelity is necessary. Otherwise, your project too can end up in the trashbin of history.  --<a href="RaySchneider.html">RaySchneider</a>

        <em>It appears that of the three types of </em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s that were applied to the main mirror, one showed OK, but the two others indicated a spherical aberration.  The passing test was trusted, and the failing tests ignored.  See <a href="HubbleTelescopeSphericalAberration.html">HubbleTelescopeSphericalAberration</a>.<em></em>
