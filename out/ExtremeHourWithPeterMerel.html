        Extreme Hour With Peter Merel
      </h1>
      <p>
        We presented an <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> at the March 28 Society for Software Quality (SSQ) meeting. Our project was to develop a gardening robot for home use. In general this worked well, but we ran out of time and didn't get to do the second iteration. Observations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the gardening robot cried out for refactoring. Unlike our mousetrap this one was all different solutions slapped together. The <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> doesn't allocate any explicit time for refactoring, and I think that's a mistake. There should be a ten minute increment at least after the first iteration to show how this is done.
        </li>
        <li>
           I tried to involve the audience by making them customers, and having a "product manager" elicit stories, priorities and qualities from them. This worked part way - it really involved the audience, but it also ate a lot of time. I'd do it again ... but I think I'd have the coach/presenter do the product managing bit. Two meeting coordinators is too confusing.
        </li>
        <li>
           I had each pair use one pen, and swap it back and forth to demonstrate pairing. Each pen was a different color, and the result was handy, but it would have been handier still if we'd had a refactoring color ...
        </li>
        <li>
           In future I don't think I'd try to do an <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a> in under 2 real hours. There are necessary questions and expositions that are too hard to do. Certainly if the presentation is expanded to include a refactoring increment it'll fill 2 hours, easy.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        I'll put the powerpoint slides we used for this one online shortly. --<a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>

        <em>Writing the </em><a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> on two large sheets of paper was easy, but manipulating the result was a maintenance hassle (kind of like real life). Next time bring a stack of 6 by 18 inch strips of Bristol Board, and write each story on one. Then sort the stack by customer priority, chop it into two iterations, and sort each one by risk. --PCP<em></em>

        <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> and <a href="PhilipCraigPlumlee.html">PhilipCraigPlumlee</a> discussed two relevant issues during a well-received and only slightly rowdy <a href="ExtremeHour.html">ExtremeHour</a>. (The Mac-Guffin was a robot that performs domestic gardening. Its Number One Requirement was "Don't kill children or pets.")

        The first was <a href="WikiSucks.html">WikiSucks</a>.

        The second issue was an excellent excuse for <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, "the most controversial principle on the list". --> the <a href="BasketballMetaphor.html">BasketballMetaphor</a>.
