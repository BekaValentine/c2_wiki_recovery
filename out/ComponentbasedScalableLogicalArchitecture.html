        Componentbased Scalable Logical Architecture

      <p>
        <a href="ComponentbasedScalableLogicalArchitecture.html">ComponentbasedScalableLogicalArchitecture</a> (CSLA) is an implementation framework using <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> products. This has been promoted by RockfordLhotka, who has written books and have active forums on discussion of his architecture (see <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/ArticleIndex.aspx?area=CSLA%20.NET)">http://www.lhotka.net/ArticleIndex.aspx?area=CSLA%20.NET)</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        He has responded to queries to the stability of his architecture in light of technological changes, see for example, an article on <a href="MicrosoftIndigo.html">MicrosoftIndigo</a> and <a href="WindowsLonghorn.html">WindowsLonghorn</a> on CSLA at <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=bfb3f6ca-ea54-4365-a497-80a7220b13c3">http://www.lhotka.net/Articles.aspx?id=bfb3f6ca-ea54-4365-a497-80a7220b13c3</a>

        Note Rockford has been a proponent of <a href="BusinessObject.html">BusinessObject</a> for many years, dating from <a href="VbClassic.html">VbClassic</a> days. He has this CSLA thing developed even then (which I missed, I was on <a href="BigBlue.html">BigBlue</a> stuff then). See <a href="http://www.lhotka.net/ArticleIndex.aspx?Area=Distributed%20Objects">http://www.lhotka.net/ArticleIndex.aspx?Area=Distributed%20Objects</a>

        <em>I would appreciate software architects frequenting this site tell us more about the essence of CSLA, whether it will likely be a significant player in the </em><a href="ServiceOrientedArchitecture.html">ServiceOrientedArchitecture</a> arena, its perceived strengths and weaknesses.  -- <a href="DavidLiu.html">DavidLiu</a> <em></em>
