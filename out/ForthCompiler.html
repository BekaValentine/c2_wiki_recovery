        Forth Compiler

      <p>
        The compiler for <a href="ForthLanguage.html">ForthLanguage</a>.

      <p>
        In the 1970s and 80s, most Forths were implemented as a <a href="ThreadedInterpretiveLanguage.html">ThreadedInterpretiveLanguage</a>, which is the fastest method of interpretation.  In the 1990s, machine code generating Forth's, using various degrees of optimization, became popular.

           Swift Forth (<a href="http://www.forth.com/Content/Products/SwForth/SwForth.htm)">http://www.forth.com/Content/Products/SwForth/SwForth.htm)</a> uses pattern-based peephole optimization.  The sequence X Y Z is replaced with code that implements XYZ in a single step, so the pushing and popping between X and Y and Y and Z isn't needed.

      <p>
        Forth has a continuum of implementation techniques spanning threaded interpreted up to machine code optimized compilation.  Having the compiler and interpreter intermingled tends to blur the distinction.  There are half a dozen different major implementation modes, and each can have varying degrees of optimization.  For instance, although gforth (GNU forth) remains threaded for portability reasons, it uses dynamic superinstructions to garner a 2-3 times speedup. (For more in superinstructions, see <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/vmgen/html-docs/Superinstructions.html">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/anton/vmgen/html-docs/Superinstructions.html</a> and <a href="http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Dynamic-Superinstructions.html.)">http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Dynamic-Superinstructions.html.)</a>
