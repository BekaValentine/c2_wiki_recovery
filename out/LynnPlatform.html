        The <a href="LynnPlatform.html">LynnPlatform</a> is a platform for implementing programming languages, licensed under the BSDLicense. It is designed to be universal enough to implement all types of programming languages within it. It consists of several <a href="ProgrammingLanguages.html">ProgrammingLanguages</a>, a unified ClassLibrary, and both a LowLevel <a href="IntermediateLanguage.html">IntermediateLanguage</a> and a <a href="HighLevel.html">HighLevel</a> Lisp like <a href="IntermediateLanguage.html">IntermediateLanguage</a> which is compiled into the former. It is still largely under development.
