        Planning Feedback
      </h1>
      <p>
        Planning Feedback is the process of review of the original planning with the real constraints of the reality.
        Pragmatically speaking, after you did a project with an original planning you must write how the planning would have been to do it perfectly.
        If you apply this technique to every project the planning process will be better next time.
