        This page is intended to be a record of my experiences in a real project (web development for a major insurer) as I try to develop the concepts of <a href="OptimisticProgramming.html">OptimisticProgramming</a>.

        <strong>The Diary</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm posting the current entry in this section; I'll archive and replace them each time, so as not to waste wikispace. These will be, I believe, on-topic thoughts; please let me know if and why you think they aren't before you take any more drastic action.

        <strong>Success that feels like failure</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I haven't posted anything here in a long time. I think it's because I feel bad about how far we've fallen: no pair-programming, forced to do walkthroughs, everybody working independently, having to fight the complexity of STRUTS.
      </p>
      <p>
        But our customer is still happy, we've pretty much made every iteration, and in spite of being way off on some <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> estimates, and losing one of our team to maintenance (there is no handoff to support groups here), we've figured our overall velocity pretty well. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The ongoing major problem has been communication with the IS bureaucracy. We can't test all our security code because WSAD/WTE needs admin rights to talk to the security server, and they absolutely won't give them to us. Now they're replacing CVS with Harvest, and it still isn't working right.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've been moved to a new web project - again, fairly simple: reports only, and from an existing data warehouse table. Half of what I'm doing is refactoring a lot of the code from the first project into a utility project, which the other guys can then pull in when they're refactoring for the second phase of said first project.
      </p>
      <p>
        It's going well, but I hate the fact that we've fallen so far from the True Whatchamacallit.

        <strong>Background</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is a performance "scorecard" for employees. There's no rocket science here, but there's a tight schedule, RUP is just coming in, nobody really knows about XP. 
        On the other hand, the IS department is really helpful and flexible.
      </p>
      <p>
        I will have to walk a fine line here to avoid any trade secret information. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm going to keep it in a log form with dated entries. Feel free to insert comments and questions, but please don't try to refactor it to <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>. That should be done in <a href="OptimisticProgramming.html">OptimisticProgramming</a> itself. -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a>

        <strong>The Environment</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's a lot like this:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>On the good side, this organization is willing to change. There's quiet interest in agile development, but not a lot of knowledge of what that means. There's acknowledgement of problems and desire to improve. The people in positions of authority are generally easy to talk to and are open-minded. -- </em><a href="ChangeYourOrganizationDiary.html">ChangeYourOrganizationDiary</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Physically, I'm two floors down and half a building away from the rest of the team. A bad sign for XP. No hope of changing it. And of course the cubes aren't designed for <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>.

        Tom, though I think this diary will be an interesting experiment, <a href="WikiIsNotYourBlog.html">WikiIsNotYourBlog</a>.  Could you post the diary elsewhere, then link to it?  Perhaps set up your own Wiki (it's easy; I've done it several times).  More in PhilosophyJournalDiscussion. -- <a href="BrentNewhall.html">BrentNewhall</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Brent - you're absolutely right. I'll move the diary to my yahoo site. I can't set up my own wiki because I don't have access to a public server, so I guess it will just become a blog - I was hoping the rest of the team could join me, but that will be impossible now. (Unless somebody wants to donate a wiki server for this purpose!)
      </p>
      <p>
        The diary will be temporarily unavailable till I move it over. -- tr
      </p>
      <p>
        Okay - moved - see URL above. I'm going to keep updating it in Wiki format in the hopes that it can find a home, but meanwhile it's going to be a little hard to read. -- tr
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="WikiIsNotYourBlog.html">WikiIsNotYourBlog</a> refers to journals that have no on-topic content.  I would like the "ontogeny" to stay here, provided that it stays on the topic of introducing a new process.  Perhaps it could focus more on high-level goals and activities than low level things like "reformatted X document."  --<a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a><em></em>

        Jim - I haven't moved OptimisticProgrammingOntogeny, which is meant ultimately to be <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, but the diary itself, which is more low-level stream-of-consciousness ThreadModeForOne/blog. -- tr

        Thanks to a <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a> for refactoring and reminding this <a href="RecentChangesJunkie.html">RecentChangesJunkie</a> that I haven't been updating this. XP is going well for us, with minor exceptions, so I'll post an entry shortly.
