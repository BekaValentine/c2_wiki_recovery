        Fuzzy Predicate
      </h1>
      <p>
        (This was mentioned once before, but I cannot find it.)
      </p>
      <p>
        A fuzzy predicate can be used to find the best match(es) based on proximity. For example, suppose we had a table like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        A:0.84, B:0.20, C:0.92, D...<br/>
        A:0.03, B:0.70, C:0.27, D...<br/>
        A:0.64, B:0.31, C:0.74, D...<br/>
        Etc...<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        and want to find the 6 closest matches based on these values:
      </p>
      <code>
        SELECT TOP 6 * FROM foo WHERE A=0.7 AND C=0.2<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        An exact match is not required, but the 6 closest matches are returned. In this data set, the factors are normalized to be between zero and one. Another potential limiter "clause" is the best matches within a given amount of time. For AI use, the time limit may not be known in advance. One may need a way to supply an interrupt signal and ask, "give me your best stuff so far". Fancier versions have importance weightings.

        <em>How about "LIKE", "Wildcards", "Random", "Less Than", "Greater Than". Databases generally have these proximity checkers. Like the brain, the database either returns a result or doesn't... if it returns a fuzzy result back like a number between one hundred and two hundred (even though we wished it could have been more precise), it is still a result. If the brain cannot answer a question and says "maybe, I do not know" then this can be represented as a string called "maybe", or an enumeration (yes, no, maybe), or even heaven forbid a null.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        No. Most off-the-shelf DBs don't have support for multi-valued proximity. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is not a </em>'yes<strong> or </strong>no<strong> question (not asking for clarification, it was a rhetorical question to make you folks think for a minute about what databases </strong>do<strong> offer.). Databases can check for less than, ranges, greater than, LIKE, wildcards. These give approximate results - they are still definite results but if you think about it.. </strong>every thought we have is definite<strong> too, not in that it is a yes or no, but that it is a </strong>result<em>' that has physical/electronic presence in some form. For example when the brain searches for something that is "good" a database query could look for 6-8 out of a 10 using a range, or using less than and greater than. A nine or ten might be defined as excellent. A five wouldn't be that good. Several queries could also be placed into a temporary table and analyzed further for more approximations. Nulls are very fuzzy in a bad way.</em>

        That is because this is difficult to index in general. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Perhaps the way indexes are designed needs to be rethought for this kind of process.

      </ul>

        There are a lot of special case database product though:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           geographical databases (called GIS for geo information system) which have efficient retrieval for values in planar or spherical domains
        </li>
        <li>
           picture databases - which can index on specially crafted feature vectors of images and provide 'alike' images.
        </li>
      </ul>

        I encountered this "fuzzy" issue when reading about "self-organizing maps" (SOM) for AI use, and wondered how to implement a similar contraption in an RDBMS. These seem closer to mimicking how humans think and retrieve memories than Boolean-expression-centric RDBMS. --top

        How about ...
      </p>
      <code>
        SELECT TOP 6 * FROM foo ORDER BY ABS(A-0.7) DESC, ABS(C-0.2) DESC<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        ... or ordering by whatever equation gives you a measure of 'closeness' that floats your boat, weighting A and C somehow. I'd much prefer something like that which expresses what I want rather than some DBMS implementor's notion of what "close" means. (This is perfectly feasible with current products.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>While it may produce the correct answer on some RDBMS, I doubt that can take advantage of indexes in most RDBMS, and thus require an entire table scan, plus some expensive sorting. Further, in Oracle it's very round-about to get the equivalent of "TOP X". "Rownum" usually doesn't apply to the sort stage, but chops before that, producing unexpected results.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have heard that Oracle has some geo indexing special feature which might answer the above query efficiently - provided the index is set up properly. But this manual index setup seems to be what Top wants to avoid. An <a href="AdaptiveCollection.html">AdaptiveCollection</a> would be nice that could infer/learn the necessary indexing automatically from the usage pattern and a laaarge library of possible indexing strategies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'd rather stick to something that at least somewhat resembles RDBMS. The indexing techniques are probably orthogonal to the query language or paradigm issues.</em>

        If the differences in the factors A and C have the same value, then a least squares function can be computed:
      </p>
      <code>
        (A-0.7)^2 + (C-0.2)^2<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The smallest values of this will give the nearest points.  -- <a href="JohnFletcher.html">JohnFletcher</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure... relative to a line in a <em>Euclidean</em> space. 'Closeness' measurements require a distance function depending on the space.  Consider the difference if C wraps around 0.0-pi, such that 0.2 is approximately equidistant from 0.4 and 2.94.   Such things are somewhat arbitrary - not even the triangle inequality always holds for all spaces.  Dealing with arbitrary clustering of data for <a href="DataMining.html">DataMining</a> purposes is the reason I came to the conclusion that something more generic, like a <a href="DataSpace.html">DataSpace</a>, is better than relational when it comes to AI and learning systems. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>As mentioned in </em><a href="DoesRelationalRequireTypes.html">DoesRelationalRequireTypes</a>, for flexibility purposes, it would be best to define relational independently of the "domain math" such that things like "distance()" functions/operations would not have to be hard-wired into the relational engine and could be defined as needed. However, it may be difficult to optimize for such because optimization usually requires a fair amount of integration. At best a kit could be produced to allow custom relational engines to be built for special/different domains (like polar coordinates and AI) without starting from scratch for each domain. It would still be custom, but using mostly off-the-shelf or pre-defined parts for the construction. --top<em></em>

        The link below has an interesting description of "quad-tree indexing", which allows for improved physical-promixity indexing. It perhaps could be extrapolated to more factors than X and Y.

        <em>Indeed, it can easily be extended. 'KD-tree' is the common name for the general extension. See </em><a href="EuclideanProximitySearchEngine.html">EuclideanProximitySearchEngine</a>.<em></em>

        It's not clear to me if factors that are complete non-matches will mess this up. The first factor could be completely wrong, and even if all the rest are close, we'd never find the best, or even a good match. How are the <strong>outright dead-ends</strong> bypassed? A purely hierarchical approach can get tripped up by one bad branch. I can envision a genetic algorithm finding groupings or chunks of variables that are a better fit, but that could be computationally expensive.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This isn't a problem. If you are looking for all objects with certain criterion, then one failed criterion or match SHOULD mess it up. If you are looking for K-closest matches (where K is 100 for example - the 100 closest points), then you use a backtracking search if you either have not found K items or cannot make a guarantee that all points on a certain branch are too far away to beat the K in your current set.
