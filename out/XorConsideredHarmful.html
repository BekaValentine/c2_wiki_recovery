        Xor Considered Harmful
      </h1>
      <p>
        Something went awry with the 1-clock cycle XOR optimization for setting the working register to 0 within assembly and it seems to be related to <a href="ConfusedComputerScience.html">ConfusedComputerScience</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What do you mean by "went awry", and how is it related to </em><a href="ConfusedComputerScience.html">ConfusedComputerScience</a>? What CPU are you referring to?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        What are you smoking. The optimization is native to all processors as there is no need for a literal 0. (BTW, sub can also be used so even if we didn't have Xor the optimization would exist.)
