        Recursive Descent Parser
      </h1>
      <p>
        A recursive descent parser is a top-down parser which basically has a function for every nonterminal. The function implements a grammar rule by calling other functions to read the right-hand side. So basically if you have a grammar rule that looks like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        statement <- begin statements end | if expr then statement<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        it turns into a function that looks like this (pseudo-Java):
      </p>
      <code>
        Statement readStatement(InputSource s)<br/>
        { if (s.peekTokenType() == TokenType.BEGIN)<br/>
        { s.read(); // read BEGIN token and discard it<br/>
        Statement[] statementList = readStatements(s);<br/>
        if (s.peekTokenType() != TokenType.END) throw new SyntaxError("END expected");<br/>
        s.read(); // read END token and discard it<br/>
        return new BeginStatement(statementList); // BeginStatement extends or implements Statement<br/>
        }<br/>
        else if (s.peekTokenType() == TokenType.IF)<br/>
        { s.read(); // read IF token and discard it<br/>
        Expression expr = readExpression(s);<br/>
        if (s.peekTokenType() != TokenType.THEN) throw new SyntaxError("THEN expected");<br/>
        s.read(); // read THEN token and discard it<br/>
        Statement statement = readStatement(s);<br/>
        return new IfStatement(expr, statement); // IfStatement extends or implements Statement<br/>
        }<br/>
        else throw new SyntaxError("BEGIN or IF expected");<br/>
        }<br/>
      </code>

        Recursive descent parsers are easy to implement, but they are limited in the languages they can handle. For example, parsing ordinary arithmetic expressions requires more work from a recursive descent parser; <a href="CompilersPrinciplesTechniquesAndTools.html">CompilersPrinciplesTechniquesAndTools</a> describes a way to refactor the grammar to accommodate them, but there are other ways.

        Bottom-up parsers such as LR(1) parsers have the ability to see more of the input and shift it onto a stack before they decide how to reduce it. LR languages are a superset of the LL languages that can be parsed by recursive descent. However, LR parser generators are considerably harder to implement.

        To interpret an expression like "5 * (4 + 2^2)", an evaluator must evaluate from the ( to the matching ) as one factor, before evaluating the * to multiply it by 5. Then, inside the (), the evaluator must evaluate the ^ first, before the +.
      </p>
      <p>
        These techniques require recursion, to obey math precedence rules, and to interpret nested parenthesis. A <a href="RecursiveDescentParser.html">RecursiveDescentParser</a> reads each token inside a recursively declared filter system:
      </p>
      <code>
        - terms +-<br/>
        - factors */<br/>
        - exponents ^<br/>
        - parenthesis ()<br/>
        - terms <em>recursion</em><br/>
        - terminal values 99.9<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        After finding a sought item and recursing thru the other possibles, the RDP then evaluates its intermediate terms, and returns them to the next layer up.

        An example of an RDP, written via <a href="TestDrivenDevelopment.html">TestDrivenDevelopment</a>, appears here:

        Question: What is LR(1)?  Every time I see it, I expect to find a Unix man page in section one.  Perhaps we need a page about <strong>LrParsers</strong>
        <em>Bottom-up parsers such as LR(1) parsers have the ability to see more of the input and shift it onto a stack before they decide how to reduce it.

        The LR(1) notation means, "LR parser with 1 token of lookahead", not a Unix man page. Grammars can be described as being X(k), meaning "can be parsed with parsing algorithm X using at most k token(s) of lookahead." LL(1), SLR(1), etc. -- <a href="ScottVokes.html">ScottVokes</a>

        From Wikipedia: An LL parser parses the input from Left to right, and constructs a Leftmost derivation of the sentence (hence LL, compared with LR parser). An LR parser is a parser that reads input from Left to right (as it would appear if visually displayed) and produces a Rightmost derivation. The term LR(k) parser is also used; where the k refers to the number of unconsumed "look ahead" input symbols that are used in making parsing decisions. Usually k is 1 and the term LR parser is often intended to refer to this case. -- <a href="ChristianFriedl.html">ChristianFriedl</a>
