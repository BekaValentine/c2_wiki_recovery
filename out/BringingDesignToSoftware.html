        [ISBN 0201854910] From the back cover: <em>In this landmark book, </em><a href="TerryWinograd.html">TerryWinograd</a> shows how to improve the practice of software design by applying lessons from other areas of design to the creation of software.  The goal is to create software that works -- really works -- because it is both appropriate and effective for the people who use it.<em></em>

        I am still digesting this book.  It is quite thought provoking (and perhaps a bit controversial).  The book consists of 14 chapters written by different authors (as well as 14 profiles of ideas and products).

      <p>
        Chapter 6 (by Peter Denning and Pamela Dargan) discusses <em>Pattern Mapping as a Basis for a Discipline of Design</em>.

        This book is a rare treat... It pays equal respect to the engineer as well as to the designer/artist.
