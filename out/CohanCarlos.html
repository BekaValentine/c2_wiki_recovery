        I am currently working on a collaboration tool that supports planning games in a distributed team <a href="AgilePlace.html">AgilePlace</a> available to the public at <a href="http://www.tryxp.org">http://www.tryxp.org</a> .  You can get an account, share your project with other team members, and collaborate on the project with them using online planning games!

        I think <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> came up with <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> by applying principles from Japanese manufacturing concepts to software engineering.  We applied the same principles to testing in the above process.
