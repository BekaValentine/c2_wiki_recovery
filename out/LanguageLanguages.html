      <p>
        Some languages have several branches of themselves. 
      </p>
      <p>
        For example there is Old English, current English (modern english?), combined Old and current english.
      </p>
      <p>
        There is C99, C Some Other Year, Ansi C, K&R C, Ada 95, Ada Something Else, Standard Pascal, Apple Pascal, Some Other Pascal, Common Lisp, Some Other Lisp.
      </p>
      <p>
        We could call them implementations, but they are languages themselves... some are branches of a language, some are Year Specific Languages, some are older versions of a language, some are modified versions (greatly or insignificantly) etc. That's why they are <a href="LanguageLanguages.html">LanguageLanguages</a>.
