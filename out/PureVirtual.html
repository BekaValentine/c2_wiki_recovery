        Pure Virtual
      </h1>
      <p>
        In C++, you declare a virtual function to be "<a href="PureVirtual.html">PureVirtual</a>" like so:
      </p>
      <code>
        class Before {<br/>
        virtual void f(); // Normal "virtual"<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        class After {<br/>
        virtual void f() = 0; // *Pure* "virtual".<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        No one knows why you use "= 0" rather than some other notation.  It's not explained in <a href="TheDesignAndEvolutionOfCpp.html">TheDesignAndEvolutionOfCpp</a>, so it's best left un-questioned. =)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Probably because "virtual foo(args)=0" is a syntax that was formerly disallowed by the language; so adding it to the grammar wouldn't break any existing programs.  Adding a keyword such as "abstract" on the other hand, is more likely to break existing code.  Might explain a bunch of other syntactic hacks in </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a>, such as <a href="ClassName.html">ClassName</a>() being the name of the constructor and ~<a href="ClassName.html">ClassName</a>() being the name of the destructor.  This syntactic <a href="FuBar.html">FuBar</a> has caused all sorts of grief; as it's OneMoreThing to change when you rename a class (<a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a>), and also because it makes providing constructors for anonymous classes impossible.  <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> inherited this silliness; where it causes even more problems due to the increased importance of <a href="InnerClass.html">InnerClass</a>es and <a href="AnonymousInnerClass.html">AnonymousInnerClass</a>es.  Nowadays, Java has YetAnotherSyntax to initialized anonymous classes...<em></em>

        <em>Wild guess: The function pointer in the vtbl of the abstract base class is NULL. (And "NULL" is really "(long)0" anyway.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I've heard that before, but it doesn't really satisfy me, because a vtbl is a run-time entity, and the error is compile-time.  You could say that the internal representation of what is to become the vtbl uses "0", but that kind of implementation detail is irrelevant to users of C++ (and, worse, it encourages <a href="MagicNumber.html">MagicNumber</a>s -- the null itself).
      </p>
      <p>
        Much to my preference would be to use a keyword, for example "pure".  I know adding new keywords is dangerous, but as long as you only add meaning for the word within a certain context then nothing is hurt.  Even if that is arguable, I consider the <a href="PureVirtual.html">PureVirtual</a> notation to use a keyword: "=[:space:]*0"
      </p>
      <p>
        Do you see why it's best left unquestioned?
      </p>

        <em>GCC, at least 2.8.x and 2.9.x, has a function called __pure_virtual or something like that, which if called does something useful (raises an exception or aborts the program).  While calling a pure virtual shouldn't be possible in a correctly built C++ program, it could happen if a base class function goes from implemented to pure virtual, and a program that uses it isn't recompiled.

        FWIW, Microsoft <a href="VisualCeePlusPlus.html">VisualCeePlusPlus</a> has a similar function, called _purecall(), which "traps" inadvertent calls to pure virtual functions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Using </em><a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> it is rather easy to "call" a pure virtual function if you export the <strong>this</strong>-pointer from a constructor or from the destructor:<em></em>

      <code>
        void f(Base&);<br/>

        For comparison, in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a>, <a href="PureVirtual.html">PureVirtual</a> methods are called "abstract methods", are declared with the "abstract" keyword, and have no body. Classes which contain abstract methods must themselves be declared abstract.

        void f() { /* stuff happens here */ } // Normal "virtual"<br/>

      <code>
