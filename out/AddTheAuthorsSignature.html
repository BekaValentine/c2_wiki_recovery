        Add The Authors Signature
      </h1>
      <p>
        A <a href="WikiRefactoring.html">WikiRefactoring</a> where an unsigned comment is appended with the "signature" of the author (or whoever is believed to be the author)--this includes adding <a href="DramaticIdentities.html">DramaticIdentities</a> or <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a>s such as <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>.  This can be done for several reasons.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To clean up a <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>--it is easier to follow messy <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> when the comments are attributed to who wrote them (so two adjacent postings don't appear to be from the same contributor).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           To attribute possibly controversial opinions to their authors, especially when someone thinks another is engaging in <a href="VoiceOfWikiImpersonation.html">VoiceOfWikiImpersonation</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, this is not always appreciated....
      </p>
      <p>
        Proper addition of the author's signature consists of nothing else but that:  adding two dashes, and the individuals name.  Adding additional editorial comments, such as "in the opinion of SoAndSo" or "SoAndSo, in a moment of obvious drunkenness, scrawled the following rant" is likely to trigger a <a href="RudenessObjection.html">RudenessObjection</a>.

        For a counterpoint, see <a href="EgolessWiki.html">EgolessWiki</a>.  Also consider use of a <a href="ContributorsList.html">ContributorsList</a> rather than signing individual contributions.

        What a bad idea. If I don't sign something, it's because I don't want it signed. Adding it would <strong>not</strong> be <em>a courtesy</em>!
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If someone uses <a href="AddTheAuthorsSignature.html">AddTheAuthorsSignature</a>, and the author objects; then the author can remove it.  At which point, the author's wishes ought to be respected.  If someone objects to the author's statement, a dissenting opinion can be added at this point.
