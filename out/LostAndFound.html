           I cannot find a topic that listed features of programming languages as if a language could be "designed by filling in a form".
          <ul>
            <li>
               It sounds like you're looking for either <a href="KeyLanguageFeature.html">KeyLanguageFeature</a>s or <a href="InstantLanguageForm.html">InstantLanguageForm</a>. It's worth noting that <a href="FindPage.html">FindPage</a> is a useful resource.
            </li>

               <em>That's it! Thanks. Strangely, Bing didn't find it: "site:c2.com instant language form". Seems they don't index titles anymore.</em>

           I'm looking for a topic something like "sharing objects is difficult" or "inter-app type sharing". It was a long debate.
          <ul>
            <li>
              <em>Something like </em><a href="CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing.html">CrossToolTypeAndObjectSharing</a> ?<em></em>
            </li>
            <li>
               That's it! Thanks! But now I forgot why I wanted it :-) I did try searching "Shar", but it returned too many results and that one never clicked during the scan. I need tools to compensate for my tired eyes.
            </li>

              <em>Something like glasses?</em>

               No. They only focus the image, they don't help one read faster or more accurately. I never did have <a href="FastEyes.html">FastEyes</a>, but my brain is losing the ability even further.
            </li>

           I'm looking for a topic that modeled neurons using relational tables. It gave sample schemas. I tried 25 different Google searches and got nothing. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               Update: It looks like somebody (perhaps me?) moved it to to <a href="TheAdjunct.html">TheAdjunct</a> under BrainSchema. Is it okay with <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> to move it back? At least my sense of semi-sanity is restored because I knew it existed somewhere with 99.9% confidence.

        Too many results.
