        Hermes Trismegistus
      </h1>
      <p>
        Hermes the Thrice Great, a legendary (as in mythological) mystic and teacher of ancient Egypt. European traditions of high magic and alchemy flow from his teachings; indeed, his name is the origin of the term 'hermetic'.

        There is no etymological connection to hermits.
