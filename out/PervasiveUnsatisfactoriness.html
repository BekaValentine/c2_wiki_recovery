        Pervasive Unsatisfactoriness
      </h1>
      <p>
        The Buddhist or Sanskrit word for suffering, <em>duh-kha</em>, which is often translated as <em></em><a href="PervasiveUnsatisfactoriness.html">PervasiveUnsatisfactoriness</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Conceding that pervasive suffering exists is the first of the <a href="FourNobleTruths.html">FourNobleTruths</a> of the Mahayana.
      </p>
      <p>
        The direct translation is so excellent! It is my favorite word: 
        in Sanskrit, <em>duh</em> means <em>bad</em> and <em>kha</em> means <em>axle hole</em>, so it means <em>eccentric, not holding your wheel of existence (Samsara) correctly at its center</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The meaning is certainly related to <em></em><a href="WabiSabi.html">WabiSabi</a>.<em> </em>
      </p>

        Is this the recognition that reality needs constant refactoring?
