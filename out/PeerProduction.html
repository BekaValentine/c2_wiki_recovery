        There is an academic word for the kind of thing that happens on <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> type sites: <a href="PeerProduction.html">PeerProduction</a>. The main idea is that instead of having formal relationships in which one person is a writer, another is an editor, another is a reviewer, etc., everybody just pitches in according to their own desires and whims, and content emerges over time. It would be nice to use this page to collect a list of interesting studies about <a href="PeerProduction.html">PeerProduction</a>. A related page is <a href="PeerProductionCommunities.html">PeerProductionCommunities</a>.
