        Glass Eye Advice
      </h1>
      <p>
        There was one very significant difference between <a href="WinstonChurchill.html">WinstonChurchill</a> and his father Randolph, another leading politician of his day. According to someone who knew him well that I had the privilege to speak to recently, Winston always maintained a genuine desire to know the opinion of ordinary people he happened to meet on the issues of the day that they felt were most pressing.
      </p>
      <p>
        Churchill not only epitomised this habit but gave this excellent advice. If you are at a dinner party and find yourself sitting next to someone slightly eccentric who makes glass eyes for a living, don't waste time making small talk or introducing your own petty interests, which are likely to be of little interest to the fellow. Ask the man about what he does, take this one golden opportunity to learn all the whys and wherefores of making glass eyes. You'll never fail to leave far better educated and entertained than you were when you started.

        Winston wisely limited himself to the duration of a dinner party. How long is a round of Geelf?

        <em>The length of a round is Pi times its diameter.</em>
