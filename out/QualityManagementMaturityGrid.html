        Quality Management Maturity Grid
      </h1>
      <p>
        Crosby's "Quality Management Maturity Grid" ("<a href="QualityIsFree.html">QualityIsFree</a>" ISBN0451625854) consists of five stages of management maturity (Uncertainty, Awakening, Enlightenment, Wisdom, and Certainty), measured against six dimensions, to complete the matrix:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Management understanding and attitude [towards quality management]
        </li>
        <li>
           Quality organization status
        </li>
        <li>
           Problem handling experience
        </li>
        <li>
           Cost of quality as a percentage of sales
        </li>
        <li>
           Quality improvement actions
        </li>
        <li>
           Summation of company quality posture
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Crosby suggests the model does not require inordinate management sophistication.  He recommends the Grid measurement be used in two ways:  (1) a comparison tool, i.e., where an organization is, where it was, and where it wants to be; (2) a directional compass, always pointing (and motivating) the organization in the right direction.

        [ Unfortunately, the matrix is very concise.  Even if <a href="FairUse.html">FairUse</a> allowed its reproduction here, there's still the issue of <a href="HtmlTables.html">HtmlTables</a> (or rather, the lack thereof). ]
