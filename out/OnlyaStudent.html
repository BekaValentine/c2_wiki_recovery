        <strong>Original Opening Remarks: </strong>There are many readers of this wiki who are presently pursuing studies in Computer Science, Software  Engineering, Computer Information Systems, Decision Systems, Mathematics, English (or Language Alternative), Chemistry, Physics, Philosophy, or other discipline, who may from time to time participate in comments on pages, or initiate pages (such as this one). It is to be remembered that they can be classified as <a href="OnlyaStudent.html">OnlyaStudent</a>, and that they represent those who have undertaken learning from the Subject Matter Experts, and will develop their own thoughts, ideas and conclusions on the validity and worth of such training as their Life Long Learning Experience continues.
