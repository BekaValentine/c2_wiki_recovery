        This include all <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages that are in the SlooowDelete process. They are marked for removal due to:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           they are walled gardens that have been abandoned
        </li>
        <li>
           they cover material that have passed used by date, and no suitable refactoring would help. (e.g. a page about IBM punch cards would be relevant in 1970s, but not in this century)
        </li>
        <li>
           page carries very little nontrivial information, or is largely a duplication of existing material, or should be folded into another page, etc
        </li>
        <li>
           in rare instances, the page has created <a href="MoreHeatThanLight.html">MoreHeatThanLight</a>, as there are existing members of the community bent on stating their views at the <strong>exclusion of other viewpoints</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           other reasons??
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This is a page to list <a href="OnTopicButNotNeeded.html">OnTopicButNotNeeded</a> pages that <strong>hopefully not contentious</strong>. For people wanting to remove controversial <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> pages please use the IsThisPageOk mechanism.
      </p>
      <p>
        Typically an <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> page make it way here because it has technical information that is only of interest to historians. Keeping it around would only diminish the credibility of <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest visitors of this page to check new additions, and if you find any redeeming value in some of the contents, <a href="MoveItElsewhere.html">MoveItElsewhere</a> and delete the page (after removing links of course). In the unlikely case where the reader feel the page should not be deleted, then I suggest the contents of the page to be throughly edited to ensure its currency.

           Costin I am equally concerned about erroneous and outdated information affecting the credibility of other perfectly good pages. I am concerned only about <strong>quick deletes</strong>, especially for pages that have been around a long time. 
          <ul>
            <li>
               No, it wasn't a quick delete. The invalid claim was challenged by me 2 years ago. Since nobody picks the task of defending the invalid claim, I think it has to be deleted.

        <li>
           I am concerned that <a href="DistributedTransaction.html">DistributedTransaction</a>, implemented in the Java environment without the use of Ejb, are only short-term solutions that have to be rebuilt. Maybe Kyle made his statements in those context. I have seen many times over that the best technical solutions do not last, due to market considerations. So please be patient with those of us who have interest in hearing different views. -- dl

        OK folks, I'm here at David's prompting.  Let's go way, way back.  In the early days of J2EE (probably before Costin is remembering) the only JTA implementations came from the EJB vendors.  You could get a JTA  implementation(that allowed full 2-phase distributed transactions) from <a href="WebLogic.html">WebLogic</a> or from IBM, or one of the other J2EE application server vendors and that was about it.  Now, of course, that's no longer true.  You can get a JTA implementation from many different places.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The real magic is in JTA, that's true.  As stated above (which is true) EJB's hide JTA.  No I seem to remember that at the VERY early stages of J2EE you couldn't even access JTA from the servlet containers in all J2EE app vendors  -- I believe the mechanism for that (the standard JNDI lookup of the TransactionManager) wasn't fully standardized until J2EE 1.2. (If someone could verify that I'd appreciate it).  I certainly remember that in the early days of <a href="WebSphere.html">WebSphere</a> (which has always hewn VERY tightly to the J2EE standards, much more so than other vendors) that this was true.
