      <p>
        <a href="UgLyPeople.html">UgLyPeople</a> try and point people to the <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> page, telling them <em>what is</em> and <em>what is not</em> <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a>. They know, because of their first hand experience with ugliness. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Many noobs (newbies) try to create single <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> pages and are quickly disciplined by the <a href="UgLyPeople.html">UgLyPeople</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This wiki software forces one to create a page that is MixedCase, and is the cause of the <a href="UgLy.html">UgLy</a> disease. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Treat the cause, not the symptoms (but that would destroy the original c2 wiki, and we'd become NotaWiki).

        What is ugly? <em>only they would know</em>
