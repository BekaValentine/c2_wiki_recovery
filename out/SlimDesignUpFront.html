        Slim Design Up Front
      </h1>
      <p>
        In introducing XP to a team used to traditional design and review techniques, I found it helpful to have a 'slim' design instead of 'no' design.  Hence, <a href="SlimDesignUpFront.html">SlimDesignUpFront</a> (SDUF).   I don't know if this is only useful to help people cope with the transition to XP or a valuable technique in it's own right.  
      </p>
      <p>
        It helped our team convince other stakeholders who were not used to XP that we had enough of our bases covered.  We could then do some XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        SDUF consisted of the simplest document that could possibly work, including 
        a) ISO boiler plate front matter
        b) A Statement of the user story (from the external user's view)
        c) A 'statement' of the Unit Test case (or reference to the code)
        d) A checklist ensuring we thought of localization, performance, migration, logging, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Developers could optionally add internal design in UML, but no one did.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was easier to give folks a lightweight design doc than to convince them to accept NO design doc.
