        Doom Sayers

      <p>
        <a href="DoomSayers.html">DoomSayers</a> are those people who explain to you why what you are doing successfully can't possibly work, usually by invoking demons from hell.

        Sometimes they are right.  Always they are a good hint that you aren't expressing yourself very well.

        <a href="BertrandMeyer.html">BertrandMeyer</a> says that reaction to a new methodology goes through 3 stages:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           "It's trivial."
        </li>
        <li>
           "It cannot work."
        </li>
        <li>
           "The's how I did it all along anyway."
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        (The order may vary). I think there's a related pattern involving industry hype followed by cynicism and DoomSaying. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
