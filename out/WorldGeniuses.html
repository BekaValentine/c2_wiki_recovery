        World Geniuses
      </h1>
      <p>
        This page was split off from <a href="BumblebeeSociety.html">BumblebeeSociety</a>, where the list first appeared. Its purpose then was as part of an argument against drugs like Ritalin. Its focus has changed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of the people listed below might not belong here, for two reasons. Firstly, their achievements might not have been great enough. Secondly, their great achievements might not indicate genius. Perhaps there should be a list of WorldContributors, to include people who changed the course of history whether or not they were geniuses.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps also to be truthful we should indicate are attributed with personally making the discovery that changed the course of history.

        <strong>The list</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        [ long list of things from prehistory that weren't "invented" in the usual sense moved to bottom of page; nobody "invented" fire, for instance, and the needle was part of a gradual evolution of tools over thousands of years (there is an obvious discontinuity between cutting and puncturing, hence the invention), etc. Things should only be at the top of the page if there's a person's name to go with them. ]
      </p>
      <p>
        Tool use and tool evolution is literally millions of years old.

However, Newton would deserve a place for other things.<em> (Or what? He stole calculus from Leibnitz? Come on, nobody seriously believes that. The idea that an invention is a unique event specifically tailored to the vagaries of the patent system is preposterous.) It is less obvious that Newton invented the calculus as a physicist and Liebnitz as a mathematician. Newton made observations that were implicitly ordered by the passing of time, so his differentials use time implicitly. Leibnitz was a mathematician seeking to invent a tool of mathematics, therefore his notation assumed a generalized notation.</em>

           JamesWatson and FrancisCrick and Rosalind Franklin <em>nothing special here.  they were first and rightly get the credit, but that doesn't mean they were good.  put another way, if they hadn't figured it out, someone else would have in short order</em>

               You could say the same thing about sports races, such as are going on right now in the 2004 Olympics, and yet strangely enough, in every race someone gets the credit for being first, even though a bunch of other people got to the same spot moments later. Go figure.
              <ul>
                <li>
                   yes, but they aren't called "world geniuses".  which is the longer list, "world geniuses" or "Olympic gold medal winners"?
                </li>
                <li>
                   Oh, I see. Well, is there evidence either for or against the notion that perhaps they were all geniuses? I mean, I don't think it is exactly trivial to reconstruct a 3D molecular shape based on the diffraction pattern its crystal makes, but maybe I'm wrong, and any average grad student of the day could have done it?
                </li>
                <li>
                   If you're talking about using Fourier transforms to solve the crystal structure from a diffraction pattern, that's not what Watson and Crick did.  The key data from Franklin's diffraction pattern was that it was (broadly speaking) X-shaped.  It was reasonably well known that this pattern corresponded to a helix.  Once they knew the overall structure was a helix, and that the GA content was always equal to the CT content (known for a long time beforehand) along with some other chemical data on DNA that was available, building a model wasn't that difficult.  They didn't need Franklin's actual data, just to see the picture of the diffraction pattern.  [interesting web site on helical diffraction data at <a href="http://www.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/~holmes/fibre/branden.html">http://www.mpimf-heidelberg.mpg.de/~holmes/fibre/branden.html</a> ]  Crick could have been a genius.  Watson is not that impressive at all when you hear him speak, more of an ego-freak than anything else.  Oh ok, put them back on the full list if you want.

Of course, stone tools were not merely hunting tools by any stretch of the imagination. It is entirely possible that the first stone tools were not.</em> Evidence also suggests that people discovered things growing where they shit.
