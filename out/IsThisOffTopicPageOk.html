        Is This Off Topic Page Ok
      </h1>
      <p>
        If you are directed to this page from another page, it means there are <strong>some contentions on the merits of the source page</strong>, which is broadly understood to be <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Please locate within this page the section where the source page is named, check out the arguments, add your own if needed, and give others a chance to form an opinion of the source page.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suggest after a week or so of inactivity (merits discussions), then either the link to this page is removed, or the source page to be marked for delete, using <strong></strong><a href="DeletedUnlessDefended.html">DeletedUnlessDefended</a><strong>.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If the source page is subsequently removed, then I request interested parties to remove the discussion section in this page as well.

           Do you want pages like ChargeCarriers stay, moved to Adjunct, or simply delete? Lately (mid 05) lots of delete first activity being practiced.

        What does any of this have to do with programming? I think this page should be deleted. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I disagree. And there are mountains of other pages that got nothing to do with patterns nor computing that should be deleted before this page.</em>
        <em>In the case of this page, this is the first time I have seen it, but it seem to have some interesting debates of interest to some programmers, who at times like to think they are not mere coding machines.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        [I'm fine with it here, but I'm tired of the argument "other offtopic pages exist, therefore this one is ok too" Any such argument as that leaves no room for improvement. Should we also not refactor a page since there are plenty of pages which are not refactored?]
      </p>
      <p>
        {That's a bad argument... this page doesn't belong because it's a brand new offtopic page, thus easier to remove than one that's been here a while and will meet with much resistance. It's far easier to kill brand new offtopic material than it is old offtopic material, so please lose that weak argument.}
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Look, it is a case of </em><a href="OneMansMeatIsAnotherMansPoison.html">OneMansMeatIsAnotherMansPoison</a>. I personally would like <a href="CategoryMovie.html">CategoryMovie</a> and related pages wiped out, and for that matter, <a href="CategoryPhysics.html">CategoryPhysics</a> is worse because my assertion that while Physicists can be programmers, most programmers do not know enough Physics to help enhance or even understand those pages. TerrorismVsGreed appear to be a page created to offload material from another page, and is therefore not really new material. Room for change of mind, or some compromise?<em></em>

        I think this page should go to <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> if it has value. We do not have the expertise to assess the value of this page, the quality of the discussions, nor relevance to <a href="PeopleProjectsAndPatterns.html">PeopleProjectsAndPatterns</a>.

        There were lots of discussions back in Feb2004, but are these people still around? Are there renewed interests, are there ongoing merits for it to stay here? (<a href="PlantsAndMirrors.html">PlantsAndMirrors</a> is an orphaned bud of <a href="CasimirEffect.html">CasimirEffect</a>)

        I like it to stay over many (not all) entries in <a href="CategoryMovie.html">CategoryMovie</a>, over <a href="StarWars.html">StarWars</a>, for example.

        Personally I enjoy reading this page. I have listed here because I am quite sure there must be others with opposing views. It is listed for purposes of sampling the diversity in the OffTopic pages that gets created in recent days

        Having learned the hard (entrepreneurial) way that an important relationship between Price and Cost is Profit, I was hoping that this page might become linked to issues such as: Value, Efficiency of (Patterns, Programs, Programming languages), Outsourcing, Offshoring, ... all of which are quite active in this community.
