        Bankers Rounding
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Bankers Rounding</strong> is an algorithm for rounding quantities to integers, in which numbers which are equidistant from the two nearest integers are rounded to the nearest <em>even</em> integer.  Thus, 0.5 rounds down to 0; 1.5 rounds up to 2.  A similar algorithm can be constructed for rounding to other sets besides the integers (in particular, sets which a constant interval between adjacent members).
      </p>
      <p>
        Other decimal fractions round as you would expect--0.4 to 0, 0.6 to 1, 1.4 to 1, 1.6 to 2, etc.  Only x.5 numbers get the "special" treatment.
      </p>
      <p>
        So called because banks supposedly use it for certain computations.
      </p>
      <p>
        The supposed advantage to bankers rounding is that it is <em>unbiased</em>, and thus produces better results with various operations that involve rounding.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>It should be noted that it is unbiased only in the limit.  That is, an average of all errors approaches 0.0.</em>
