        I met my family in San Francisco for a long weekend. Mostly we rode busses and got to know the neighborhoods. We
        spend a day at the Exploratorium and a couple of evenings at Sony's
        Metreon. This was my first visit to Metreon, an indoor theme park
        with three major exhibits based on Mcaulay's <em>The Way Things Work</em>,
        Sendack's <em>Where the Wild Things Are</em>, and Moebius's comics. I was
        especially impressed with how these concepts were translated
        to attractions. This is all very much about style, the exact opposite of
        the Exploratorium, which I thought was in decline. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        I was disappointed by the Metreon (very much about style over substance). <em>The Way Things Work</em> features an amusing but very short 3d movie, and a small exhibit of things copied or licensed from the Exploratorium. -- <a href="MarcoScheurer.html">MarcoScheurer</a>
