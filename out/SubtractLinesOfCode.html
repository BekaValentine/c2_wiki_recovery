        Subtract Lines Of Code
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many software development shops are complacent in bean counting:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They count <a href="LinesOfCode.html">LinesOfCode</a> as a measure of programmer productivity
        </li>
        <li>
           They estimate the schedule based on <a href="LinesOfCode.html">LinesOfCode</a>, etc, etc. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Many programmers believe that for the purpose of either measuring programmer productivity, or estimating the schedule, <a href="LinesOfCode.html">LinesOfCode</a> is misleading. However the reality is that many managers cannot forego this bad habit of counting the lines of code. Given that we have to give them satisfaction of bean counting, how do we improve this?

        The response comes from <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a>: lines of code should be subtracted and not added. Here's what he says in the paper "Fruits of Misunderstanding", <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD854.PDF">http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/ewd08xx/EWD854.PDF</a> :

        [...] In this respect a program <br/>
        is like a poem: you cannot write a poem without writing it.<br/>
        Yet people talk about programming as if it were a <br/>
        production  process and measure "programmer productivity"<br/>
        in terms of "number of lines of code produced".<br/>
        In so doing they book that number on the wrong <br/>
        side of the ledger: We should always refer to<br/>
        "the number of lines of code spent".<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        In other words we need to convince managers that a programmer is more valuable if he/she writes fewer lines of code for the same functionality.

        <em></em><a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s can provide a partial solution to this conundrum.  Instead of how many SLOC's (god I hate that term) produced, unit tests fulfilled can be the metric.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Perhaps a better measure of productivity would the LOCs that a programmer manages to remove whilst maintaining/increasing functionality.

        A great story about Bill Atkinson at Apple regarding negative lines of code:
      </p>

        Earl Muntz also believed that "taking things out" usually made things better, more reliable, etc.
        Some people saw that as positive:
        "What's All This Muntzing Stuff, Anyhow?"

        Others saw it as "cutting corners":
        "Earl Muntz for President"
