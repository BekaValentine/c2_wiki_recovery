        The next obvious choice for a <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a>. <a href="ShamelessSelfPromotion.html">ShamelessSelfPromotion</a> at its shamelessest. Putting <a href="HireMe.html">HireMe</a> after a comment you wrote and consider particularly incisive, would perhaps be the opposite of the <a href="KillYourDarlings.html">KillYourDarlings</a> approach.

        I wonder if anyone has ever said anything sufficiently impressive on a Wiki to warrant a hiring decision in his favor. Perhaps you wouldn't hire someone cold after reading a Wiki, but if you're interviewing someone and you recognize them from the Wiki, you have that much more respect for them.

        Heck, I'd hire ANYONE from the Wiki. Just this morning I saw someone on the Subway reading ExtremeProgrammingEmbraceChange and I wanted to strike up a conversation and give him my business card. The reason I didn't is because about a year ago I was reading the <a href="LearningPython.html">LearningPython</a> book and someone struck up a conversation with me. It was quite uncomfortable. Since then, I've accepted my inner geek, but I've realized that other people haven't yet. In that particular case, a real-life <a href="HireMe.html">HireMe</a> badge would've been helpful.

        I got hired as a result of someone finding my resume online: <a href="http://www.danpierce.net/resume.php">http://www.danpierce.net/resume.php</a> -- <a href="DanPierce.html">DanPierce</a>

        Of course, there's always the possibility that they won't <a href="HireMe.html">HireMe</a> given the quality of my posts!
