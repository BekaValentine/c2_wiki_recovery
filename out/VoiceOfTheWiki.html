        Voice Of The Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        A controversial notion.
      </p>
      <p>
        Much has been made of the difference between <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> and <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, and between signed and unsigned discussion. While there is little controversy regarding whose opinion explicitly signed content represents (it's the opinion of the author - this includes use of <a href="DramaticIdentities.html">DramaticIdentities</a> as well as <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a>s), there is some question regarding whose opinion (if any) that unsigned content represents - especially <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A couple of possibilities.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The voice of a random contributor, who did not sign. Unsigned content shouldn't be considered special or authoritative; it should be treated equally to something signed by <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a> or such.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It represents a contributor who a) wishes to remain anonymous; and b) intends to "donate" his/her content to the Wiki at large (so that it may be further edited without concerns of altering someone's statements).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It represents the <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a>; in other words, such content represents a consensus of opinion (of those <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> who care about the matter) on the subject.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is the latter case that causes controversy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Obviously, different unsigned contributions may be treated differently. Unsigned inline comments have generally been treated like <a href="AnonymousCoward.html">AnonymousCoward</a> posts; and pose little difficulty. <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> (or stuff that looks like <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>) is regarded by some to be <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The essential problem is that some users advocate that posts which are <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a> (or are likely to be construed as such) should be subject to higher standards than mere "opinion" posts. It is argued that any statement made in <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a> mode should:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be demonstrably the consensus of the community (at least at some point in time). Pages where <a href="ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode.html">ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode</a> occurs are an example of this.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be held to high(er) standards of scientific research/opinion. For example, VOW claims should be (according to this set of beliefs) "traceable" to the relevant scientific literature, or contain empirical evidence, or contain axiomatic proof, or represent the general consensus of the scientific community (or key members thereof; though this last case is disputed by some).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Not contain pronouncements on highly-controversial topics, especially <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a> things like religion or politics.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be free of inflammatory and/or insulting rhetoric, and/or abusive comments (though this sort of commentary is in general not welcome <em>anywhere</em> on Wiki, it is even more out of place on VOW posts).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Contain NeutralPointOfView.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is often claimed that some individuals attempt to "impersonate" <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a> by writing long, unsigned arguments (diatribes) in <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> style. By doing so, it is argued, these individuals are attempting to pass off their opinions on various matters as the learned consensus of the Wiki community (or the greater scientific community), whereas in reality the opinions are the consensus of nobody but the author. Sometimes, such comments are deleted, moved to an <a href="AccordingToPage.html">AccordingToPage</a>, or subject to <a href="AddTheAuthorsSignature.html">AddTheAuthorsSignature</a>. <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a> have started when the original author(s) objected to this <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a>. When this occurs, it sometimes is confirmation that the original author did indeed want to represent his/her comments as <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a>; or it can indicate objection to the concept of <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Others disagree that the <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a> exists; and see no reason why unsigned pages/comments expressing any <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> opinion should be disallowed. To these users, Wiki is a discussion forum, not an online reference - folks seeking authoritative pronouncements on any matter are better off to consult the relevant literature. In addition, some believe that a key value of Wiki is as a forum for <em>dissenting</em> opinions, a type of opinion that <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a> tends to act against. In addition, the site has long held a preference for <a href="EgolessWiki.html">EgolessWiki</a>. Unsigned content is good, not because it represents a claim to (unearned) authority, but because it represents a <em>donation</em> of the content to the Wiki. By not signing, the author implicitly gives permission for others to <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> his/her words, until it <em>does</em> represent a de-facto community consensus. (In which case it might be useful to distinguish unsigned content which has been extensively ReFactored by the community, from unsigned content which hasn't been and is newly-posted. The current Wiki software doesn't make that easy). [It should be noted that the author of this page, who has chosen <strong>not</strong> to sign it; offers this page to the community in this manner. The content of <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a>, as it sits today, should not (yet) be considered <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a>. If that doesn't confuse old <a href="NormanTheAndroid.html">NormanTheAndroid</a>, I don't know what will.]
      </p>
      <p>
        Finally, <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> has an interesting take on this issue on the page <a href="AnonymousOnPurpose.html">AnonymousOnPurpose</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        A third position is that <a href="VoiceOfTheWiki.html">VoiceOfTheWiki</a> exists, but is not conferred upon a page merely by virtue of being presented in unsigned <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> style. Instead, it only is conferred upon a page when it truly <em>does</em> represent a community consensus - when other <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> have read the page, commented on it, ReFactored it, until a consensus is arrived at by the process of constant revision and critique, much as a river creates a waterfall by slowly carving the streambed. Attempts to engage in VoiceOfTheWikiImpersonation are doomed to fail, as one cannot manufacture consensus. (Unfortunately, to the new reader who hasn't been here a while, it is often difficult to tell the difference).

      <p>
        "Others" find Neutral Point of View quite sick, and having to constantly reads "others argue" and "others disagree" to be utterly repulsive.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>It is annoying, I'll agree. Given the current mini </em><a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> going on; I am going out of my way to avoid taking sides. And in the case of this page, where both sides of an active argument are being presented, the NPOV is probably appropriate.<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        It seems that there is a simple solution, which the participants in the current <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> are ignoring. (OK, it's not so simple, because one person's <a href="ReFactoring.html">ReFactoring</a> is another person's desecration...<strong>but</strong>):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you post a page comment without signing, you are giving others implicit permission to <a href="ReFactor.html">ReFactor</a> your words. Thus (for example) others should be able to contribute <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> content to OperatingSystemDesignPrinciples, including content which disagrees with the positions of the original/primary author of that page - because that page is (largely) unsigned (or at least the first section is not signed).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you post a page or comment and sign your name (or use <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>), others shouldn't change the meaning of your words. (Content-preserving refactorings are OK, as is moving the content or deleting it if inappropriate; but words attributed to DougMerrit should only contain the opinions of DougMerrit; and not of someone else.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The gotcha in this, of course, is <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a> will still arise when two people consider <em>their</em> contributions/edits to an unsigned section to be more authoritative/correct/appropriate than the other guy's, and feel entitled to repeatedly undo the other fellow's edits and add their own two cents.

        Should the content of this page not be on <a href="VoiceOfWiki.html">VoiceOfWiki</a>? -- EarleMartin
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Maybe, though that page deals with the "tone" of conversations here; whereas this page deals with the authority (if any) that should be inferred in unsigned contributions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it should be renamed SoundOfWiki. -- EarleMartin
