        Mostly a manifesto, but it announces:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           lengthy A & D are poor investments
        </li>
        <li>
           user satisfaction is impossible
        </li>
        <li>
           abstract requirements are largely imaginary
        </li>
        <li>
           complete and unambiguous specifications are ineffectual
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Replace instead with (it says)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           always analysis (as an ongoing service)
        </li>
        <li>
           dynamic requirements negotiation
        </li>
        <li>
           incomplete and usefully ambiguous specifications
        </li>
        <li>
           continuous redevelopment
        </li>
        <li>
           adaptability orientation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A primary position is that the IS systems in an Emmergent Organization will always be changing. This causes those systems to always be in maintenance mode. As a result, the up-front analysis and design that is traditionally perform to <em>reduce</em> maintenance costs is ultimately wasted time.

        These conclusions are remarkably close to many of the new <a href="RapidDevelopment.html">RapidDevelopment</a> methodologies such as <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> or <a href="AdaptiveSoftwareDevelopment.html">AdaptiveSoftwareDevelopment</a>. However, it differs dramatically in its view of the user and user-satisfaction.
