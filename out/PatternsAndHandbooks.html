        One example of a question with conflicting answers is "How should
        generic information be treated?"
        Much of the information in our software is generic to the problem 
        domain, while other information is specific to the particular problem 
        we are solving.  How do we separate the two and encode the generic 
        information in such a way that it can be reused?  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
                 Object-oriented developers tend to encode both generic and specific
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        information in objects and classes, though not in the same ones. 
        Sometimes they use abstract classes to encode generic information, 
        and put specific information in the concrete classes.  Other times
        the classes represent generic information, and the specific information
        is in the scripts that instantiate classes, parameterize the instances, 
        and connect them together.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
                 Domain-specific software architects encode the generic 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        information in a domain specific software architecture supported 
        by special purpose languages, encode the problem-specific 
        information using those languages, then translate 
        from the special purpose languages to the final code.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
                 People working with patterns view this as an unimportant 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        question, because what is important is to discover the generic 
        patterns and document them.  The software developer can then decide 
        whether to encode the patterns in objects, to use a domain specific
        language, or to just use the patterns to write a single,
        specific, program.  The biggest gain comes from understanding 
        and making explicit the patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Again, each of these points is oversimplified.  Nevertheless they
        represent the common point of view in each camp.
