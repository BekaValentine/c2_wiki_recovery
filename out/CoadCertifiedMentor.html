        Coad Certified Mentor

        I always got asked (especially by INS) and still do: "What the ^%# is a <a href="CoadCertifiedMentor.html">CoadCertifiedMentor</a>?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Mentor -> teaching people & helping them understand.  IN this case, Java, OO, UML, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        Coad Certified -> basically this means that I was interviewed and selected personally by Peter Coad.  As <a href="TogetherSoft.html">TogetherSoft</a> grew, Peter could no longer interview everyone personally, so the were no more <a href="CoadCertifiedMentor.html">CoadCertifiedMentor</a> titles.  It was the earlier hires that got that title.  It is nice to be able to say that you were personally interviewed and hired by Peter Coad.

        As a Coad Certified Mentor I give workshops on the Together product line and how to build better object models using colour archetypes and feature driven development.

        I must say (and I can since I'm not with <a href="TogetherSoft.html">TogetherSoft</a> any longer) that the color thing is neat, but doesn't do much for me anymore.   It does add another dimension to the model, though.  --<a href="DaveAstels.html">DaveAstels</a>
