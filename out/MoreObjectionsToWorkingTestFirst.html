        I spoke with a senior QA engineer of a waterfall type shop two days ago
        that might be relevant.  Not strictly TDD, but pro automated test and 
        design for testability. Here follows some paraphrasing or our conversation:
      </p>
      <p>
        ...
        QA:  We're doing professional QA here.  Have you heard of the X company? 
        The developers there are testers as well.  They write their unit tests 
        by themselves.  ( Note: AFAIK X is not even remotely an agile or TDD 
        practicing shop, they just have allocated developers to take care of 
        some of the QA tasks )
      </p>
      <p>
        I: So who is writing the test cases at your company?
        QA:  The QA department.  We have a test plan with strategies on how to 
        test every bit of functionality.
      </p>
      <p>
        I:  Do the developers design software with testability in mind, so that 
        they can ease your job?
        QA:  No.  It's entirely the QA team's responsibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        I: Do you get many defects while testing your products?
        QA: Yes.  The bug tracking database has 500 to 800 defects listed for a 
        regular 6 month project.  A typical 20 screen installer might contain 50 
        to 60 defects.  What would we be doing without the QA team?
      </p>
      <p>
        I: Do you automate tests that show defects, so that they don't happen again?
        QA: No.  It is too hard and requires too much time.  We'd fix many more 
        defects instead.
        ...
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the most important part.  I only mentioned TDD, but did not want 
        to get into evangelizing.  Apart from the heavy process he described a 
        good team athmosphere and sound discipline - they are meeting their 
        deadlines most of the time :-).  What struck me is the separation 
        between developers and testers...  and no willingness of the former to 
        ease the job of the latter and vice versa.  I have the feeling this is
        the "We're developers - not testers.  Let the QA's write those tests and
        catch the defects." attitude.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe I should have said good intra team athmosphere and not so good
        inter team one.  This is a speculation though - I don't have further
        evidence for it.

        I think this attitude is usually coupled with an organization where
        "there's a production bug!  You've got to fix it in the next 2 hours so
        that QA can rush it through their 3 day test cycle!"

        In my experience over the last few years, I haven't had much difficulty
        getting developers/teams to see the value of having an automated unit test
        suite with complete coverage.  Once I show them a real-life example of a
        codebase with complete tests and show how effective these are as a "semantic
        compiler", the question turns quickly from "Should we do automated unit
        testing" to "OK, so how/when do we write all of these tests."
      </p>
      <p>
        Where I have had considerable difficulty is in convincing people to use TDD
        to develop the code, rather than to write the unit tests as a second step.
      </p>
      <p>
        Standard argument: <em>"I just don't think that way.  I have to get the code</em>
        written before I know what to test."<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Implication: <em>"Don't force me to do things your way--everyone has a different style that works for them."</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some points I try to make.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           TDD turns design and debugging time into test writing time, so you get the tests without any extra cost.  (This is really true for everyone I know who does it.)
        </li>
        <li>
           The psychological motivation to write the tests decreases /significantly/ once you have convinced yourself that the code works (e.g., through manual testing, etc.)  After this point, coding unit tests  feels a lot like busy work.
        </li>
        <li>
           The best is, "Look at this system which was written largely using TDD, and notice how much easier it is to maintain, enhance, understand, and write new tests for compared with some of these other ones."
        </li>
      </ul>

        This is why there are acceptance tests. What alternative are the people
        presenting this "con" considering? Not writing tests at all, or writing
        them last, is surely not better?

        I think this is the crux of where the resistence comes from.  People 
        who haven't done TDD, equate tests with drudgery because the testing 
        they have done (assuming they have done some) has been after the fact 
        in a /big bang/ fashion.  And, writing the tests doesn't have any of 
        the /fun/ factor of writing the solution.  What they are saying 
        underneath is "test code doesn't involve challenging problem-
        solving", or "nobody ever sees the end results of the test code other 
        than the QA department - all that time spent on them I don't get to 
        see in a production product - which is the real thrill of developing 
        software".
      </p>
      <p>
        TDD takes the boredom away by:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Slicing it up into little tiny bits interspersed with the fun 
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        stuff.  (Just like your Mom did with your cauliflower) In the end it 
        becomes fun stuff as well itself because it does have the /challenge/ 
        aspect (especially when working in pairs) - "What's the simplest 
        thing I can write to break what I've got so far".  Plus, let's face 
        it - breaking stuff is just fun.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Knowing when you are done.  You don't have that sinking dread
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        about those hours of tests you're going to have to write at the end
        of the project.  You know it works because the green bar told you so,
        and until the needs change, it will stay that way.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the "long time" front, it doesn't take a long time in the way that
        people think about it in traditional ways (i.e. in "subjective
        terms") -- each test takes a very small amount of time, at which
        point you get to write some more code.  You /NEVER/ have to sit down
        and spend a long time /JUST TESTING/.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the "it is hard" front, Alistair hit the nail on the head -- it is
        hard for already written code.  But in TDD, you are always writing
        the /SIMPLEST/ test possible.  How hard could that be?  (Okay,
        simple != easy, but at least the problem is bounded pretty severely)
      </p>
      <p>
        Do those hit the mark?

        So you've countered his arguments and none of your arguments have tempted
        him to *try* it long enough to *prove* you wrong?

      <p>
        That's the problem, isn't it?
      </p>
      <p>
        Some developers see the power of TDD right away.  Othere resist, and then
        finally try it.  Most (all?) of the resist/try programmers tend to be
        sold...
      </p>
      <p>
        And we classify someone as a good programmer if they are willing to try
        TDD....
      </p>
      <p>
        when someone *tries* TDD, really gives it a shot, they find they write
        better code faster (or almost as fast), spend less time in the debugger, and
        (probably/maybe) get hooked on the green bar reward loop.
      </p>
      <p>
        Seems to me that the people we can't convince that TDD is good, are people
        who won't *try* it.
      </p>
      <p>
        And when we respond to their reasons why it won't work we tell them it will
        work.
      </p>
      <p>
        And yet, what they are saying is that they won't *try* it.  So we need
        tofind ways to respond that get them to *try* it... not that tell them they
        are wrong that it won't work.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dale talks about using resistance as a resource.   And we're countering
        resistance to *try* with telling them why they are "wrong" in their idea of
        TDD, not using their resistance to try.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I'm thinking about how to get reluctant programmers to *try* TDD....
      </p>
      <p>
        That's the path I'm on with this....

      <p>
        I was thinking the same thing.  Of the three objections (takes to
        long, boring, and hard), I suspect that "boring" is the key one.
      </p>
      <p>
        After all, coding takes a long time, too, and it's hard. 
        Debugging takes a long time, and it's hard.  But coding and 
        debugging are fun!  They're fun because they are about solving 
        puzzles.
      </p>
      <p>
        Testing /after/ the fact is boring because it isn't about solving 
        a puzzle.  Writing tests before code is fun for me, because it's 
        about solving a puzzle:  What other tests would I need to write 
        in order to specify the /entire/ problem I need this piece of 
        code to solve?
      </p>
      <p>
        And once I've written the test, writing the code is still fun, 
        because now I'm solving the puzzle of how to make the code 
        satisfy the new test plus all the old ones.
      </p>
      <p>
        If someone is raising the objection that TDD is boring, plus 
        several other objections, I'd tackle "boring" first.  I'll bet 
        that if we could show that TDD is fun, more people would try it. 
      </p>
      <code>
        And once they try it, they'll be in a much better place to know <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        how hard it is and how long it takes.
      </p>
      <p>
        And I'll bet that if they found TDD to be fun, they'd judge "too 
        hard" and "takes too long" differently.  When I see assessments 
        like these, I wonder, "too hard compared to what?"  Right now, 
        they're probably seeing TDD as purely additional work, not as 
        something you can do instead of, say, debugging.  Oh, they may 
        see that it would save debugging time, but that means reducing 
        their fun, so they aren't too keen to compare TDD against debugging.
      </p>
      <p>
        But if they saw that TDD was as fun as debugging (or nearly so), 
        then their fear of losing fun wouldn't cloud their comparisons. 
        They'd be trading this fun thing for that fun thing.  Then they'd 
        be free to compare TDD against debugging (or other activities) 
        along other dimensions, such as which is harder, or which 
        consumes more time, or which creates more frustration or 
        pressure, or which gives you, your boss, and your customer more 
        confidence that the program really works as advertised, or ...

        I've been lurking on this group for about a year.  In the beginning when
        I was just trying out TDD I heard a particularly convincing idea.  I
        believe it was <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a> who articulated it at that time: "A test that is
        hard to write is a design smell".  The strange part is I did not even
        question it - just started thinking about testable design.  Of course it
        would be easier to make it testable with a pair.

        I have a possible solution path to this one.  I have found that managers are more likely 
        to "get" TDD than entry level developers.  This is specially true if the managers have a
        lot of hands on programming experience.  The above objection would go away if his
        manager asks him to use TDD.
