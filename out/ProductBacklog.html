        In the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a>, this is the prioritized list of all features and changes that have yet to be made to the system.  One way to think of it is as a project-level <a href="ToDoList.html">ToDoList</a>.  Another way is to view at as "potential software."  A third way is to see it as one of the raw materials fed into the <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> is the ultimate arbiter of what's on the list, and what the priorities are.  OneBossPlease.

        At the beginning of each 30-day <a href="ScrumSprint.html">ScrumSprint</a>, the <a href="ScrumTeam.html">ScrumTeam</a> and the <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> agree on a selection of items from the list that will make up the <a href="SprintGoal.html">SprintGoal</a>.
