        Recently dropped support for the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> binding of their product to jump on the <a href="JavaBandwagon.html">JavaBandwagon</a>.
      </p>

        We did not drop support for the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> <em>because</em> of Java.
        The main reason was that there just wasn't substantial demand for
        <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> from <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> customers.  Also, our Smalltalk
        support was based on heavily modifying the underlying Smalltalk
        virtual machine, which meant it could not be used with popular
        Smalltalk implementations.  Also, the way Smalltalk was added to
        <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> was complicated and unmodular and never worked very
        well, in my personal opinion.
      </p>
      <p>
        We added Java support because we (correctly, this time!) anticipated
        that there was substantial business to be had in selling to Java users.
        I guess I don't mind the characterization of our having "jumped" on the
        <a href="JavaBandwagon.html">JavaBandwagon</a>.  Languages, like operating systems, thrive because there's
        a bandwagon; one supports it because of the appearance that everybody else
        is supporting it.
      </p>
      <p>
        We certainly didn't write <a href="ObjectStore.html">ObjectStore</a> in C++ because we loved C++.  In
        fact, none of us had any real fondness for C++. (Most of the founders
        were Lisp enthusiasts from Symbolics.) Rather, in 1988, we
        guessed that it was going to be the dominant language for our target
        markets.  In 1988, C++ was still new and struggling, but we bet correctly
        that time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still a Lisp enthusiast even though I haven't used Lisp for twelve
        years.  Compared to programming in C++, I'm quite happy using Java these
        days.  I have read books about <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a> but have never had the
        opportunity to program in it.
