        Algol Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        A portable language for scientific computations often credited with introducing many of the common syntax and structured programming conventions found in most modern programming languages.

        ALGOL 58 was also known as the International Algebraic Language.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALGOL 60 (<a href="AlgolSixty.html">AlgolSixty</a>) was block-structured, nested, recursive and free form. These are features which the other language for scientific computations used at this time, Fortran [<a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a>], lacked. ALGOL 60 was also the first language to be described in <a href="BackusNaurForm.html">BackusNaurForm</a>. It provided <a href="CallByValue.html">CallByValue</a> and <a href="CallByName.html">CallByName</a> semantics, but no support for user-defined types or I/O.
      </p>
      <p>
        ALGOL 60 was small and elegant (see <a href="TonyHoareOnAlgolSixty.html">TonyHoareOnAlgolSixty</a>), ALGOL 68 was big and complex (and rumored not to be implementable). (Falsely rumoured, it would seem, as there are today two different Open Source implementations available.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DouglasCrockford.html">DouglasCrockford</a> described Algol60 as "the best <em>[only good?]</em> <a href="DesignByCommittee.html">DesignByCommittee</a> in the history of programming languages."
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> has a page with more information on Algol (see <a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol_programming_language).">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algol_programming_language).</a>

        If you had access to a Burroughs, you would be a happy <a href="AlgolLanguage.html">AlgolLanguage</a> programmer. I did learn to program procedural programs in <a href="AlgolLanguage.html">AlgolLanguage</a> and was quite upset when I was obliged to use <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a> and <a href="FortranLanguage.html">FortranLanguage</a> in my Engineering course. Later, <a href="PascalLanguage.html">PascalLanguage</a> was the most similar thing available, but running on <a href="MicroComputer.html">MicroComputer</a>s. This was in 1984, for you that were not born.

        There is a quite nice Algol-to-C translator at <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/marst/">http://www.gnu.org/software/marst/</a>
        Sian Leitch's Linux port of ctrans for Linux, called Algol68toC at <a href="http://www.sleitch.nildram.co.uk/algol68.html">http://www.sleitch.nildram.co.uk/algol68.html</a>

        An interesting document Google turned up: <a href="http://www.cs.ru.nl/~kees/home/papers/psi96.ps.gz">http://www.cs.ru.nl/~kees/home/papers/psi96.ps.gz</a> (cached version: <a href="http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:GyA2XlKzcQIJ:www.cs.ru.nl/~kees/home/papers/psi96.ps.gz+%22willem+louis+van+der+Poel%22&hl=nl)">http://216.239.59.104/search?q=cache:GyA2XlKzcQIJ:www.cs.ru.nl/~kees/home/papers/psi96.ps.gz+%22willem+louis+van+der+Poel%22&hl=nl)</a>

        Why did it fail (relative speaking) despite having many of the modern features we've grown to like? Ahead of its time? Too expensive? In some ways it shares a similar fate to <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>: inspired many ideas and later languages, but failed to catch on by itself. (Lisp almost has this distinction, but remains a very popular "hobby" language.)

        <em>In a way it succeeded at its original purpose, as most academic descriptions of algorithms still use pseudocode that looks more like Algol than anything else. Lack of standardized I/O and difficult-to-implement </em><a href="CallByName.html">CallByName</a> semantics might lave played a role in its fade from physical use.<em></em>
