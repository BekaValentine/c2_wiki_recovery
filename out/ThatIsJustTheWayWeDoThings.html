        That Is Just The Way We Do Things
      </h1>
      <p>
        Many places have seemingly odd conventions and practices in place. When you ask, they just say <a href="ThatIsJustTheWayWeDoThings.html">ThatIsJustTheWayWeDoThings</a> or use vague <a href="ManagementSpeak.html">ManagementSpeak</a> to wave it off. Nobody seems interested in questioning or investigating such practices. I have generally found it better (career-wise) to just shut up and go with the flow after a passing inquiry brings little. But the geek in me wants to understand the reasoning and "fix" things.
