        The Water Pots

        THE WATER POTS
      </p>
      <p>
        A water bearer in China had two large pots, each hung on the ends of a pole
        which he carried across his neck.
      </p>
      <p>
        One of the pots had a crack in it while the other pot was perfect and always
        delivered a full portion of water
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end of the long walk from the stream to the house, the cracked pot
        arrived only half full. For a full two years this went on daily, with the
        bearer delivering only one and a half pots of water to his house.
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, the perfect pot was proud of its accomplishments. But the poor
        cracked pot was ashamed of its own imperfection, and miserable that it was
        able to accomplish only half of what it had been made to do.
      </p>
      <p>
        After two years of what it perceived to be bitter failure, it spoke to the
        water bearer one day by the stream.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"I am ashamed of myself, because this crack in my side causes water to leak out all the way back to your house".</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The bearer said to the pot,
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"Did you notice that there are flowers on your side of the path, but not on the other pot's side? That's because I have always known about your flaw, so I planted flower seeds on your side of the path, and every day while we walk back, you water them.</dd>
      </dl>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>"For two years I have been able to pick these beautiful flowers to decorate the table. Without you being just the way you are, there would not be this beauty to grace the house."</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Each of us has our own unique flaw. But it's the cracks and flaws we each
        have that make our lives together so very interesting and rewarding. We
        should accept each person for what he or she is and look for the good in
        every one.
      </p>
      <p>
        To all of my "crackpot friends," I appreciate your uniqueness. Please remember to smell the flowers and to find new ways to nurture your own garden!
