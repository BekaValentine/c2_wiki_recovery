        Session Facade
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>Intent:</strong> Provides a coarse grained facade on fine grained objects to improve efficiency over a network.

        The <a href="SessionFacade.html">SessionFacade</a> pattern is also a logical extension of the <a href="GangOfFour.html">GangOfFour</a> <a href="FacadePattern.html">FacadePattern</a>, extrapolated to live in an EJB world.  I've used session facades to have various methods on a session bean control 'workflow' for a certain subset of business logic.  (i.e. a 'placeOrder' method can control several different processes needed to place an order.)  While I don't know if network efficiency was the primary intent, using the <a href="SessionFacade.html">SessionFacade</a> pattern to control coarse grained workflow does make client design and code simpler and far easier to write.

        A <a href="SessionFacade.html">SessionFacade</a> can correspond tightly to a <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> or ActivityDiagram, but one does not typically want a one-to-one correlation.  (i.e. don't have one bean - one method style of design, which the mapping might lend itself to.)  -- <a href="ChadThompson.html">ChadThompson</a>

        In a recent talk, <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> said he was renaming this as RemoteFacade for his book.

        <em>Is using session facade object oriented? It separates the business logic from the business entities.</em>  
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, I could say that it simply isolates the persistence implementation from the <a href="UserInterface.html">UserInterface</a>. In any case, I think you'll find that we always recommend that all of the business logic sits behind the facade -- where did you get a different impression of the pattern? --<a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You are right. It's not the facade, it's the session beans. Many EJB books recommend implementing the business logic in session beans instead of the entity beans.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The issue is that there are different kinds of "business logic" - domain logic, and application logic.  Domain logic is logic that is naturally associated with a <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a> - such as a recipe knowing how to compute the nutrition profile of a serving of itself.  Application logic has to do with application-specific workflow - such as sending emails, or enqueuing MOM messages, when a new recipe is added to a database.  If you put application logic in a <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>, the <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a> becomes less reusable from application to application.  If you put domain logic in some other place besides a <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>, you may have to duplicate it to "reuse" it.  If <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s are intended as a way to implement <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s, then they shouldn't contain application logic, as shouldn't <a href="PlainOldJavaObject.html">PlainOldJavaObject</a> implementations of <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a>s.  So you need another place to put application logic.  A ServiceLayer is an appropriate place to put this kind of logic, and <a href="SessionBean.html">SessionBean</a>s make a good implementation choice for a ServiceLayer.  However the intention of ServiceLayer is completely different than the intention of <a href="SessionFacade.html">SessionFacade</a>.  ServiceLayer is all about defining an <a href="ApplicationBoundary.html">ApplicationBoundary</a> and coordinating a system's transactional response to stimuli arriving in use cases.  <a href="SessionFacade.html">SessionFacade</a> is all about reducing remote invocations on <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s, and its very existence demonstrates that making <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s remotable is a dubious idea.  I wrote much more about ServiceLayer and its difference from <a href="SessionFacade.html">SessionFacade</a> in my chapter in <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a>'s <a href="PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture.html">PatternsOfEnterpriseApplicationArchitecture</a>.  --<a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>

        <em>This sounds very interesting. However, I have a bit of a problem with an architecture, which places the domain objects on the server side only. What about fat clients? Id like to implement my domain objects in a way which would allow their usage on both the server and the client. So when a cook edits their recipe, the client can immediately compute the nutrition profile and the server side recipe will be updated when the user commits their work. And of course, I want to </em>WriteOnceRunEverywhere. So how can I use <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s as a way to implement my <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a>s? I see only two possibilities: Either I implement it as a <a href="PlainOldJavaObject.html">PlainOldJavaObject</a> and let some clever generator generate the EJB and the client objects from my domain object, or I implement the domain objects as <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s and use a client side EJB container which will synchronise its state with the server.<em></em>

        Why assume distribution?  I have a bit of a problem with architectures that are distributed when they don't need to be.  The pain of distribution should be considered when choosing between a web UI and a "rich" UI.  If you have to have distribution, you can "allow usage" of domain objects "on the client" in several ways: implement them in a remotely invokable way and invoke them remotely, or make sure they are completely serializable, or use <a href="HalfObjectPlusProtocol.html">HalfObjectPlusProtocol</a>, or use <a href="DataTransferObject.html">DataTransferObject</a>s (which allow indirect "usage" at best), or find/build/use some mechanism like <a href="GemStone.html">GemStone</a>'s "synchronized replicates" (for Smalltalk - AFAIK nothing like that exists in the J2EE app server world).  --<a href="RandyStafford.html">RandyStafford</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Yes of course, all these are techniques, how to allow usage of domain objects on the client. But why should I think about about technical aspects of the system, when I am developing the domain objects? Wouldnt this reduce the reusability of my domain model implementation? Why should I think about serialization, synchronization, distribution and stuff when implementing the class Recipe?</em>

        That's a good point.  I think <a href="SeparationOfConcerns.html">SeparationOfConcerns</a> is definitely appropriate, starting with the essential aspects of the <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> - the abstractions, relationships, responsibilities, etc. - and worrying about distribution, concurrency, persistence, separately.  I think <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a> and <a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a> had a similar discussion on <a href="UnderstandingDistributedSystems.html">UnderstandingDistributedSystems</a>.  --RS
