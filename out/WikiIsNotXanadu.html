        Wiki Is Not Xanadu
      </h1>
      <p>
        [Moved from IsWikiXanadu]
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I was thinking about Wiki and Xanadu this morning.  Back when </em><a href="TedNelson.html">TedNelson</a> originally published about Xanadu, I thought it was the best idea.  I'm going to reread the book over the weekend.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>My recollection is that there were all these pages of info, and everyone's edits could be in there, and they could all be linked together.  Xanadu also had the ability to view back to versions to any previous time, which might be a nice feature for the next version of Wiki, in Ward's spare time.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        No one who actually <strong>studied</strong> Xanadu would entertain this thought for a microsecond.
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki is no more like Xanadu than is Microsoft Word (all three support editing and <strong>some</strong> kind of hyperlink; that's all, that's where the resemblence ends).
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TedNelson.html">TedNelson</a> and Xanadu both have faults, but it does them both an extremely grave injustice to say "well I never knew what Xanadu was, and I remember less now, but this here wiki thingie vaguely reminds me of what I almost remember."
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't do that. It's technically wrong regarding Xanadu, and rude to <a href="TedNelson.html">TedNelson</a>. And it can do nothing more than confuse the issue on exactly what was right and wrong with Xanadu and <a href="TedNelson.html">TedNelson</a>, which is in fact a sporadically on-going discussion here and there.

        I'd like to put some links from my web site directly into wiki. I'd like to have a wiki of my own. I'd like there to be wiki pages all over. I'd like to buy the world a Coke... but I digress.  
      </p>
      <p>
        The reason I'm going back to Ted's bizarre book is to see what ideas are there that we could actually use here.

        Wiki is the closest thing I've ever seen to Xanadu. In some ways Wiki is better  - there's no copyright, no locked text (so anyone can edit anything) and it's real whereas Xanadu is still a pipedream (but what a dream and what a pipe!). --<a href="SeanOhalpin.html">SeanOhalpin</a>

        Xanadu had a payment scheme, which as far as I know was fundamental to its vision. It had transclusion where Wiki only has cut and paste, and some deep theory about addressing and tracking moving documents etc (which may or may not have ever worked).
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki reminds me most of the World Wide Web as it was originally conceived. The WWW was supposed to be writable - the protocol has a PUT method on a par with GET. Anyway, that is what I gather from various comments from its designer. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Wiki's payment scheme is a bit weak, but at least it's consistent.  As Dave points out, however, I can't transclude Dave's comment yet, if I want to <a href="CommentOnTransclusion.html">CommentOnTransclusion</a>, but I can already link back from there.  How hard could it be ... don't ask the Xanadu survivors. -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not just payment; it's tracking authorship and credit. Wiki conventions leave some comments uncredited and communually owned, and others (like this one) signed (with the signitures easily forgable) (and deletable). -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        The difference between things which are apparently successful but with arguably weak theoretical underpinning, like DOS and the WWW, and things which attempt to be theoretically sound but which fail, like Xanadu, I find fascinating and scary. Is it better to do something wrong than not to do it at all? -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        It's better to build something small and let it evolve to be useful.  Any of us can order more than we can eat, and dream more than we can ever code.
        It should be possible to build something small and growable, so that it doesn't have evolve slowly or with too much revolution instead of evolution.  I believe that it's possible, but I can't prove it.  -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>

        The only thing WIKI misses is a good spell 'cheker'.

        <em>I had in mind, actually, "is wiki near the center of what xanadu was trying to be", but that seemed too long a name ... an essence of Xanadu was the versioning, linking, free flow.  Releasing a wiki-like thing might have kept Xanadu alive ... it still might.  --</em><a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a><em></em>

        I doubt it. I haven't read the original Xanadu articles, but Ted Nelson recently gave a colloquium here at Stanford. And what he described, which he claimed was
        his original vision ("I've always said this; I've gotten better at expressing 
        it") was very much unlike wiki. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Ted Nelson is really concerned with preserving original works, extending 
        copyright to cover online usage (the notion of TransCopyright), and enabling
        massive reconstruction of documents (by hyperlinking at the level of 
        thoughts or paragraphs, rather than "documents"). He's very much concerned 
        about authors and authorial integrity. I got the impression that
        the sort of feel-free-to-refactor notions in wiki (group authorship, 
        communal discussion, free reorganization of pages, including summarizing
        other people's contributions) haven't made it onto his radar in any 
        big way.
      </p>
      <p>
        All in all, the talk was rather depressing. I was far more impressed when I
        didn't know anything about him (other than the vague "father of hypertext" 
        title) than I am now.

        It would be simpler and still work if it didn't have the search or spell checker facilities. I've used <a href="WikiClones.html">WikiClones</a> with neither. One can also argue that it doesn't work as is, because it has so many flaws. (Eg inadaquate protection against simultaneous update, no revision history, no good way to indent text.)

        <em>Yes.  The simplest thing is a judgment call, not an algorithm.

        I read the article about <a href="TheCurseOfXanadu.html">TheCurseOfXanadu</a>... and then I said, "Hey, wait a minute, doesn't Wiki embody a lot of those values?  I mean, I can go and write something, and then link to it from lots and lots of other pages, and it's a big public forum where discourse happens and information is distilled and saved..."  You get the idea.
      </p>
      <p>
        So I was about to write something on that page about it, and then I realized that quite a few people had already thought of it.  One <a href="FullSearch.html">FullSearch</a> later and I was here.
      </p>
      <p>
        So yeah.  Here I am, writing about Xanadu on the thing that, in my opinion, is most like Xanadu in all the world...
