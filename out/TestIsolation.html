        Test Isolation
      </h1>
      <p>
        The strict definition of <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a> has some people confused about "<a href="TestIsolation.html">TestIsolation</a>". For super-high critical software, a unit test should mock out things in other units. The failure of a unit test should implicate only one unit. Most development doesn't require that level of <a href="TestIsolation.html">TestIsolation</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DeveloperTest.html">DeveloperTest</a>s don't need to mock everything, because failing a test case only implicates the most recent edits. (Better, you can revert to throw them away and instantly fix the bug. Gawd, after years of painful debugging, I never get tired of saying that.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="TestIsolation.html">TestIsolation</a>, in both realms, means that effects of one <a href="TestCase.html">TestCase</a> don't leak into the next case. A rule of thumb is test cases could run in any order (and some TestRigs enforce that.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Ideally, we would reconstruct our computers and restart our application between test cases, but naturally we can't. Resetting every global variable to its default state, and rolling back the database with a TRANSACTION, should be enough to get by.
      </p>
      <p>
        And test cases should be easy to set up. That enforces natural decoupling, to isolate things without mocks.
