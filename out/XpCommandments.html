        <em>This has been NAILED to a few places ... Just one remark :</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For non-native speakers the latest, with "kites" is a bit hard to grasp.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, "Thou shalt not document" isn't really accurate.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thou shalt not document speculatively, or about gold-plating." Now we are
        stretching the grammar just to put the "Thou shalt not" at the beginning.
      </p>
      <p>
        Those into epistemological numerology may note without this last line there
        were 12 Commandments.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Thou shalt reduce documentation burden" is closest to the (alleged) <a href="ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices.html">ExtremeProgrammingCorePractices</a>
        goal.
      </p>
      <p>
        So if we take the English phrase "go fly a kite" to mean "please don't try
        to be productive and go take a vacation; it's okay, we'll get along without
        you", and "check kiting" as "passing speculative paper", we get (deep
        breath):
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Thou shalt not replace productivity with standing around holding a string attached to a kite of speculative documentation borne aloft by hot air.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        But that throws the metre off from the others...

        The only XP commandment I know of is "Thou shalt not blindly follow commandments, especially those purported to be about XP." -- <a href="BillCaputo.html">BillCaputo</a>

        Some newbie (I think it was <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>) tried to say "I have great respect for <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a> and the others. However, it certainly appears to me that much of what is behind the <a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a> is, 'we must get these developers under control,' and much of what is behind <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is, 'we must let these developers do what they know how to do.'"
      </p>
      <p>
        This is all mystification. RUP provides no ground rules for the catherds. XP provides a set of very distinct, easily applied low-level rules that condition behavior. So the behavior within that conditioning is safe and productive.

      <p>
        <em>Thou shalt not clone thy code.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This implies <em>Thou shalt not fork thy code base</em>. see <a href="CodeFork.html">CodeFork</a>.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        So ... what if I clone my code, and then pervert the cloned code so badly I need to write documentation for it that then falls utterly and hopelessly out of date with the perverted cloned code?
      </p>
      <p>
        Am I then guilty of the sin of making an obscene clone fall? <em>;-) ;-)</em>
