      <p>
        My name is Ingo James Dettling and I am an independent software engineer.
        I studied computer science at the University of Karlsruhe, Germany.
        I graduated with a Masters in 1996. Before graduation I started to work as
        an independent software developer for DIGITAL in 1992. There I was involved
        in small CORBA projects. Since this time I am focused on OOA/OOD/OOP with a
        special interest in distributed applications. Also an area of interest are
        e-commerce applications for the finance business.

        Kent Beck, Martin Fowler and the GoF really influenced my way of developing.
        The books of these guys are a must to every serious IT professional.
