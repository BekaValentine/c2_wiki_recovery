        Unknown Programmer

      <p>
        The <a href="UnknownProgrammer.html">UnknownProgrammer</a> is like the Unknown Soldier.  A hero that we do not know.
      </p>
      <p>
        Usually a programmer who contributes superb and great work to a project - but no one knows his name.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some programmers don't have blogs, websites, or any form of public communication. The unknown programmer may be the person in charge of the most popular video game AI engine or the most popular compiler - but no one knows his name - or very few.
