        I lived in the USA for the first twenty eight years of my life, after which I lived in <a href="FinlandEurope.html">FinlandEurope</a> for three years, and then <a href="SwedenEurope.html">SwedenEurope</a> until late 2006. I now live in Florence, AL.

        I joined <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> sometime in the nineties. Could have been as early as 1995. I'm not sure.

        After reading [what is now <a href="RealNamesPlease.html">RealNamesPlease</a>], I thought I'd mention that started life as RobertBenjaminGilliam aka Ben Gilliam, and am now ShaeMatijsErisson. ChangingYourName is a very strange experience.

        I got into programming by playing a card game called <a href="MagicTheGathering.html">MagicTheGathering</a>. You'd be amazed how similar they are. If anyone considers that story content, tell me and I'll fill it in.

        Aug 3 2000 - There's been a huge surge of pro/anti religion dicussion on the Wiki lately.

        I'm a Baptist, and I'd bet money I can't change your mind on the issue. So why argue about it?

        Wiki is a semi-permanent container of the thoughts of its participants. If someone is unable to tolerate other viewpoints however expressed, they shouldn't be here. I realize that's appears somewhat hypocritical, as I myself have deleted the contents of pages on the Wiki (namely the first version of <a href="GangstaGeeks.html">GangstaGeeks</a>), but I'm not sure how to record the difference I feel between the two here in text.

        Do you ostracize people for preferring the win32 platform over any other? if not, you shouldn't ostracize people for preferring God. Right?

        Hi. I'm also Baptist. I still remember the semester in college when I finally realized that I was never going to change my neighbor's mind, and he was never going to change my mind, so trying to convince him that he was wrong and I was right was a waste of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was surprised to discover that someone with a "@webwitches.com" address was Baptist.

        I don't understand the appeal of <a href="MagicTheGathering.html">MagicTheGathering</a>, but I've played plenty of other games with funky 10-sided dice. Tell the story?
      </p>
      <p>
        After I had been using "bayesian filtering" for months to reduce spam, I was interested to discover that Baye's Rule is named after Reverend Thomas Bayes (<a href="http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes).">http://www.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Bayes).</a> Not exactly Baptist, but at least he was a "Nonconformist".

        January 2012 - I miss the conversations I had here when XP was first being created by the Ward et al.

        I've learned some exciting stuff in the meantime...
