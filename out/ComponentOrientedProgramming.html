        Component Oriented Programming

        The differences between ComProgramming and standard <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, as quoted from the foreword by CharlieKindel in <a href="EssentialCom.html">EssentialCom</a> by <a href="DonBox.html">DonBox</a>:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> = Polymorphism + (Some) Late Binding + (Some) Encapsulation + Inheritance
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ComponentOrientedProgramming.html">ComponentOrientedProgramming</a> = Polymorphism + (Really) Late Binding + (Real, Enforced) Encapsulation + Interface Inheritance + Binary Reuse
      </p>
      <p>
        Implementation Inheritance is not considered Component Oriented Programming because the idea behind component programming is limited dependence, and implementation inheritance is the strongest dependence in programming. See the <a href="FragileBaseClassProblem.html">FragileBaseClassProblem</a>.

        Do we need yet another term for <a href="ComponentBasedDevelopment.html">ComponentBasedDevelopment</a>?

        Otherwise, I have some problems with both definitions, they are overly simplisitic, and inexact. For example, I once created a specialized Delphi component, by inheriting the TDBLookupCombo implementation and modifying some behaviour, and by that definition I wasn't doing component oriented programming, and if creating components is not component oriented programming, then we really have a problem. -- <a href="CostinCozianu.html">CostinCozianu</a>

        Direct inheritance is against the idea of COP more or less. Inheritance creates a dependency, but components should be relatively independent. If they "inherit", it is through <a href="DuckTyping.html">DuckTyping</a>: they fit a predefined interface.
