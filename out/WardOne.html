        Due to popular demand, we are now taking a "wait list" for those of you with a WN-2 (i.e. you have paired with one of the WN-1 people, but not with WN-0 - Ward Himself).
      </p>
      <p>
        The wait list will be used to backfill spaces at <a href="WardOne.html">WardOne</a> conferences on a first come, first served basis. If a WN-1 is unable to attend, a WN-2 will be substituted in. This will also give them the opportunity to become a WN-1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sign up here if you have paired with anyone in the <a href="WardNumber.html">WardNumber</a> of One list above.

        In that case, Ward, can you send back my $850? ;-) -- <a href="RobMyers.html">RobMyers</a>

        BTW, <a href="FredGeorge.html">FredGeorge</a> seems to think I have a <a href="WardNumber.html">WardNumber</a> of 1, but it's really just a 2 over and over and over again with different <a href="WardOne.html">WardOne</a> participants. Next time I see you at a conference, I'll be carrying a laptop with an IDE. Better wear your running shoes.
