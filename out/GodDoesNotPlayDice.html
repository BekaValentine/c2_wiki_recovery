        God Does Not Play Dice

        Einstein's famous epigram is mostly misunderstood, like most epigrams. (For instance, Solomon's baby... but let's not go there.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Einstein's point was that "probability" is the wrong word to apply to what's going on in <a href="QuantumMechanics.html">QuantumMechanics</a>. The great man would have been unsurprised by the EPR experimental outcomes, and never expressed a preference for local hidden variable interpretations. So anyone who tells you Einstein was wrong in this particular case is full of it.

        No-one knows exactly where Einstein was going with the comment, but probably in the direction of some kind of larger-dimensional manifold basis for QM. As to whether that's the right direction to go or not, no-one knows. These days, the most popular theories - Cramer's <a href="TransactionalInterpretation.html">TransactionalInterpretation</a> and Everett's ManyWorlds - don't have God playing dice either.

        <em>What do you mean by "probability"? The word has two meanings, the popular one of a choice function, and the mathematical one of a measure. The former is random, the latter is deterministic. The latter is exactly what QM is.</em>

        Lots of philosophical assumptions in what you write.
