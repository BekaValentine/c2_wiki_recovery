        Action Specification Language
      </h1>
      <p>
        Seemingly, the <a href="ObjectManagementGroup.html">ObjectManagementGroup</a> are looking to provide precise semantics for modelling "actions" within the <a href="UnifiedModelingLanguage.html">UnifiedModelingLanguage</a>. <a href="KennedyCarter.html">KennedyCarter</a> have brought <a href="SteveMellor.html">SteveMellor</a> on board and have developed the <a href="ActionSpecificationLanguage.html">ActionSpecificationLanguage</a> to allow UML models to be animated in the way that <a href="ShlaerMellorMethod.html">ShlaerMellorMethod</a> models may be. See [1] for marketing fluff.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Please take a look at the Action Semantics Consortium web site to find out which companies and organisations are involved. It's not just </em><a href="KennedyCarter.html">KennedyCarter</a> and ProjectTechnology.<em></em>

        <em>Is ASL part of UML or on top of UML?</em> It seems to be a bit of both: proposed extention and addition, and maybe also some kind of infrastructure. A bit like the <a href="ObjectConstraintLanguage.html">ObjectConstraintLanguage</a>, but with different proportions. That's maybe not such a bad analogy: OCL is UML-does-<a href="SyntropyMethod.html">SyntropyMethod</a>, ASL would seem to be UML-does-<a href="ShlaerMellorMethod.html">ShlaerMellorMethod</a>. And ASL is probably damned to the same kind of slow suffocation in a very small niche as OCL. Unless it gets built into <a href="RationalRose.html">RationalRose</a>; OCL seemed to fail in the market partly because Rose doesn't do it.

        <dd><em>Sounds like they'll just add more cruft to the monstrosity that is UML. Very unorthogonal. Very complex. Building a language based on past standards leads you into the C runtime library. After all, who uses gets() except IOCCC winners? Sorry, I'm ranting.</em></dd>

        <dd>"Very unorthogonal. Very complex." Do you suggest that the OMG can err? Begone, heretic! More seriously, this work is in responce to an OMG RFP  [2] that has <a href="JamesOdell.html">JamesOdell</a>'s name attached, which makes me wonder...</dd>

        Actually, modulo the bloat and cruft (which might not leave much) it could be an improvement if the ASL/translation approach described here provoked a re-assessment of the <a href="ObjectModellingTechnique.html">ObjectModellingTechnique</a> style "seamlessness" idea that causes so many, err, <em>less descerning</em> OO folk to get so confused.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A perfect model must be at least as complex as what it is modeling. It's simpler to have fractal layers of abstraction. Is there any </em><a href="TuringComplete.html">TuringComplete</a> portion of UML that does this, or am I pissing into the wind here?<em> </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I doubt most heavy UML/RUP (<a href="RationalUnifiedProcess.html">RationalUnifiedProcess</a>) users (or authors) think this deeply about the question. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="CatalysisMethod.html">CatalysisMethod</a> takes this view: in Catalysis the process of moving from one layer of abstraction to another (in a, yes, self-similar fasion) is called "refinement". In my opinion, if one is going to do a lot of modelling, then translation is the way to go. Catalysis muddies the water by treating refinement as a uniform operation beteen any two levels (thus, like the recursive transformation that builds a fractal), giving the impression of seamlessness, without clearly showing that refinement <em>is</em> a translation. Which it must be to work properly, I think.--<a href="KeithBraithwaite.html">KeithBraithwaite</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The UML is not a programming language, and was never intended to be one. If the "translation" view of modelling is correct then it cannot and should not be one.
