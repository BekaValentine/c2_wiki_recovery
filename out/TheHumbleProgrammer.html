        <li>
           Those who want really reliable software will discover that they must find a means of avoiding the majority of bugs to start with, and as a result the programming process will become cheaper. 
        </li>
        <li>
           If you want more effective programmers, you will discover that they should not waste their time debugging - they should not introduce the bugs to start with. 
        </li>
        <li>
           We should confine ourselves to intellectually manageable programs. 
        </li>
        <li>
           We must not forget that it is not our business to make programs; it is our business to design classes of computations that will display a desired behaviour. 
        </li>
        <li>
           It is a usual technique to make a program and then to test it. But: program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but it is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The competent programmer is fully aware of the strictly limited size of his own skull; therefore he approaches the programming task in full humility, and among other things he avoids clever tricks like the plague. 
        </li>
        <li>
           The question: "Can you code this in less symbols?" or, "Guess what it does?" - as if this were of any conceptual relevance! 
        </li>
        <li>
           As long as machines were the largest item in the budget, the programming profession could get away with its clumsy techniques.
