        Detecting Life

        The question of "What is life" is important for space exploration. One stringent test in actual use for life-detecting spacecraft (e.g. missions to Mars) is to point them at the Earth and see if they can detect life there.

        <em>That has nothing to do with "what is life" and everything to do with "how do you detect life" which is a completely different question. Conflating these two radically different concepts is erroneous. At best, the above comment is completely irrelevant.</em>

        Huh ? What's the point of defining some category, if there's no way to detect whether something falls into that category ? -- <a href="DavidCary.html">DavidCary</a>

        Detecting life isn't the same problem as ascertaining whether or not a given entity is alive. Endolithic bacteria came as a surprise, even though we knew what they were when we noticed them. Many parasites fall into the same category - it's not always easy to tell when someone is infected, despite knowing what an infection entails. And the same applies to many other relative inconspicuous organisms.
