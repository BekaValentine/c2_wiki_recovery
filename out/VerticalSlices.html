        Like <a href="HorizontalStripes.html">HorizontalStripes</a> but this metaphor makes more sense for those of us who visualise our applications as a series of layers from the UI down to a database layer. This way when we talk about an end to end slice we mean a piece of the application that utilises the UI to manipulate the domain layer which results in different data being stored in the persistence layer.
      </p>
      <p>
        It depends on whether you are looking at a top-to-bottom stack of layers (in which case <a href="VerticalSlices.html">VerticalSlices</a>), or a left-to-right sequence diagram (in which case <a href="HorizontalStripes.html">HorizontalStripes</a>). Works from either angle.
