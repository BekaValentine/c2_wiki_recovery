        Just BTW, I was referring to <a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a> and DanielTremblay, who participate on this wiki, not people I know in real life... but ok. :)

        Oh my! People actually read my <a href="WikiHomePage.html">WikiHomePage</a>.

        July the second 2004 was the day I fell into Wiki.

        Can't remember how I got here though. But I found the concept of a place where everything stands up thanks to the support of its UserBase pretty cool.

        Has any good <a href="CyberPunk.html">CyberPunk</a> come out in recent years? Mention of other SF authors could be interesting, too; I'm always looking for ideas for reading.

        Depends on who you ask, but I consider Donnerjack a good cyberpunkish SF/Fantasy book written in recent years. But then some might say it's just fantasy with a cyberpunkish theme.
