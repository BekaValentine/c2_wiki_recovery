        Dont forget tunnels -- KarlZdero

        Completely off topic: my favourite part of Ken Burns's documentary on the American Civil War concerned Grant's march. The confederate army sabotaged bridges and rail lines in front of Grant, but Grant marched with a corps of engineers that repaired the works as Grant moved, frustrating the confederate efforts. At one point the confederates collapsed a tunnel, but one confederate soldier complained it wouldn't make a difference, "Grant probably carries a spare tunnel with him."
