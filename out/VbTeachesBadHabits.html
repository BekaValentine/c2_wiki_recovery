        There's no guidance towards <a href="ModularProgramming.html">ModularProgramming</a>. You don't even need to declare variables. This is great for small programs, but these programs grow into unmaintainable monsters very quickly.

           No need to declare variables, no guidance towards modular programming: sounds like <a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>.

        I actually think that <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a> objected at least as much to the interactive nature of BASIC. He was very big on formal proofs. I think he objected to the "hack it till it works" approach that many self-taught BASIC programmers followed.

        Every <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> programmer I have ever worked with declares their variables. The statement Option Explicit (a checkbox in the options dialog does this for you) will require you to declare your variables in much the same way that the <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a> "use strict" pragma does. -- <a href="NoahClements.html">NoahClements</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        VB is different from most other dynamic languages in that if you don't set mandatory declarations, then unassigned references are assumed 'nil' instead of a run-time error. If you wanted to avoid stealth nils, Option Explicit is just about a must. -- top

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Lest we forget how <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> promotes <a href="ActivexTechnology.html">ActivexTechnology</a>. It makes spiking (but not finishing) a huge project much easier if each coder "owns" one module, and all the modules link together thru COM (<a href="ComponentObjectModel.html">ComponentObjectModel</a>) instead of just getting bound into one EXE. This exploits VB's absolutely miserable support for the dependency management and script-based compiling that real languages take for granted. -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> <em>(at least VB5)</em> does not support putting user-defined Types (UDTs) into Collections. (VB "Type" = <a href="CeeCeePlusPlus.html">CeeCeePlusPlus</a> "struct" = Pascal "record".) So, when things get complex to the point where you'd want to do this, you're forced to either upgrade to full-fledged objects (COM classes) or downgrade to hacking (typically delimiter-separated fields in strings). Most VB programmers I know, being uncomfortable with classes, will jump right down to the hacking level. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

      <p>
        <em>Alternatives include using MS-Jet tables, or using an invisible Grid widget. The nice thing about the latter is that you can see your structure for debugging and testing. Can't vouch for machine efficiency with it though.</em>

      <p>
        That doesn't make the tool bad. It's the programmer who isn't learning the features! That's like saying a <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> programmer refuses to learn classes! -- InformedThirdParty

      </p>
      <p>
        Right, <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> programmers should really learn to accept and use COM classes, rather than do hacks with strings. But there are pervasive cultural issues in the VB community that work against that. (Like, COBOL 85/95 programmers who are still writing COBOL-68, and <em>(yes there are some!!!)</em> C++ programmers who don't know what a <strong>class</strong> is.) -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        Here's a clear cut, institutionalized example of the VB effect:
      </p>
      <p>
        If you buy this particular 4th party Code Review add-in module and plug it into VB, it will read your code and review it.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you then declare a variable inside a block, the Code Reviewer will tell you "All variables should be declared at the top of the current procedure, to ensure they are initialized properly."
      </p>
      <p>
        Translation: "VB can't do nested scopes on variables. You can use a variable outside the block that appears to scope it. Therefore you might accidentally use it before it's assigned properly. Therefore VB is not even a <a href="StructuredProgramming.html">StructuredProgramming</a> anguage. So you must learn a bad habit to overcome this."
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <a href="PhlIp.html">PhlIp</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ironic. I find that declaring variables at the top of long procedures makes it more likely that we won't initialize them properly. It's good to have initialization close to use. If declaration is separated from usage, then the range of code where the variable's value is valid can become ambiguous. (cf. <a href="DeclareVariablesAtFirstUse.html">DeclareVariablesAtFirstUse</a>) However, to avoid upsetting the natives, when programming in VB, I follow the bad practice of putting all variable declarations at the top of each function. -- <a href="JeffGrigg.html">JeffGrigg</a>

        My personal experience contradicts <a href="EwDijkstra.html">EwDijkstra</a>'s claim that <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a> ruins a programmer forever. Recently, an ex-VBer who's now doing <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> came to me for help with an object design. I sketched the UML outline of a pattern-dense design (<a href="AbstractFactory.html">AbstractFactory</a> + <a href="CompositePattern.html">CompositePattern</a>) on the whiteboard. He tilted his head one way, and said "Hmmm." Then he tilted his head the other way and said "hmmm." Then he scratched his head, said "I think I see what you're saying," and two hours later came back with very well done code implementing that design.
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't always see people catching on to that many new things that quickly. I've had positive experiences with other ex-BASIC programmers as well. I wonder what the difference is between my ex-BASICers and Ed's.
      </p>
      <p>
        I myself have started programming with BASIC V2 (yes, on an old Commodore VC20, with <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> and line-numbers!). Today, I draw UML diagrams. I don't say, that BASIC is a good programming language to begin with, but such sentences are just exaggeration.

        That's funny. I started programming with <a href="QuickBasic.html">QuickBasic</a> and wrote several games in it having no knowledge of functions, subs, or arrays.

        I started programming in Applesoft BASIC and managed to pick up first <a href="ProceduralProgramming.html">ProceduralProgramming</a> and then <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>. So I was not brain damaged by BASIC, either.

      <p>
        I too was not permanently spoiled by <a href="BasicLanguage.html">BasicLanguage</a>. I started with BASIC on a Sinclair ZX81, progressing to CBM BASIC, <a href="QuickBasic.html">QuickBasic</a>, and even a little early <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>. By that time, of course, I was skilled in proper structured and <a href="ObjectOrientedDesign.html">ObjectOrientedDesign</a>. The first couple of versions of VB turned me off to it forever, not because it was unstructured, but because I always had to resort to hacking in order to get the job done.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow, with all respect, I think Dijkstra's comment reeks of the <a href="CorrelationImpliesCausation.html">CorrelationImpliesCausation</a> fallacy. In particular, it would imply that it's also difficult for someone to be a <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> programmer and at the same time be adroit in <a href="AssemblyLanguage.html">AssemblyLanguage</a>, an hypothesis that (I hope) is demonstrably untrue.
      </p>
      <p>
        Let's assume that 90% of BASIC developers never recover. (I don't know that this is the case, but let's assume it for the sake of discussion.) This doesn't mean that BASIC "mentally mutilated" them. It could be that skillful developers quickly go on to more expressive languages, leaving only those unable to master higher concepts to remain BASIC programmers. Or it could be that unskilled programmers are inordinately drawn to BASIC, for similar reasons.

        I'm curious, Sam, and you might have an insight here. I don't have much experience with VB; most of the stuff I code for (numerical) can't run on small (e.g., winboxes) machines - and where it can it needs to be pretty close to the metal. So I may be out to lunch here. But I have followed some issues from a distance with interest, especially CORBA/COM etc. as ideas that always made a lot of sense to me. And it seems to me that VB derives pretty much all of its power and utility from the component model. So here is my question: <a href="WhyVisualBasic.html">WhyVisualBasic</a>? -- <a href="AnonymousDonor.html">AnonymousDonor</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        If I understand your question correctly, you have already given the answer. It is very easy to extend VB with new functionality using COM. I will not defend VB here, but repeat what other have said before: The chosen tool does not make the programmer. Using an object oriented tool does not make object oriented code. An exception is a tool where everything are objects. But then again, choosing such a tool does not guarantee clean or quality code. Why I use VB? Because I create pretty good code with it. -- <a href="ThomasEyde.html">ThomasEyde</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        No, that wasn't the question. IMO, none of the usefulness/value of VB comes from the <strong>Basic</strong> part. You could have all of the rad and COM stuff with some other language as a base. So the question was, why start with Basic? My contention was that it <strong>could</strong> have been a much better language, with a different starting point...

        The worst one can say about BASIC (VB) is that it is an absolutely inconsistent language.

        If a programmer only knows one language, and one way of thinking about how to solve problems, VB bad habits are probably the least of his problems. Remember, you can write FORTRAN in any language, and, conversely, I'd say, a good programmer can write good code in any language, too. [Some languages make the task harder, of course, but it can still be done.
