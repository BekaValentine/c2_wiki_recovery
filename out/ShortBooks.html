The quantum mechanical treatment is laid down very clearly and explicitly.  Has no examples (hence the shortness), but gives a very clear, rigorous presentation.

        All these books say over and over, "There's so much more to say about this, but..." When an author forces him/herself to condense, they only write important things. When you read such a book, it seems full of important things, because it is.

        My grandfather once told me that one of the marks of a good writer, is the ability to "<a href="KillYourDarlings.html">KillYourDarlings</a>" i.e. to look at the words you have slaved over, and formed until they sound just right, realise that they add nothing to your message, and then get rid of them.

        Sometime in the early nineties I came across a comment in a book that "with the availability of modern word processors, any fool can write a five hundred page book and often does."

        Writing a short book is not easier, it is in fact harder.  At one time I earned my daily bread writing technical books;  I tend to be quite snobbish about book length.  If you can't fit your book into less than 400 pages, you're either not trying hard enough, or you're trying to cram two books into one.

        When you wish to instruct, be brief; that men's minds take in quickly what you say, learn its lesson, and retain it faithfully. Every word that is unnecessary only pours over the side of a brimming mind." -- Cicero
