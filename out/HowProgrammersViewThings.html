        This page was refactored to show that participants in this wiki approach issues with a questioning and analytical mindset. This is shown by emphasizing a programming relationship to the statements. You will clearly see that they reflect programming practices and approaches. Try your hand at other such pages, leaving the original alone, while discovering the validity of this notion.  Try a page which seems to be unrelated to the purpose of this wiki, and refactor it, illustrating by attaching and grouping under an Emphasized heading, how it is a programming practice or approach. In so doing you will discover patterns of just <a href="HowProgrammersViewThings.html">HowProgrammersViewThings</a>. You need not post the refactored page, as I have done, for it is primarily a discovery process. It may then help you to see that people on this wiki are not <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a> or as I am not -- <a href="JustaStudent.html">JustaStudent</a>

        <strong>Specification: </strong>Citizens of the U.S.A. tend to call themselves "Americans". To others, particularly those we share the hemisphere with, this undoubtedly reinforces their perception of us as arrogant. I'd like to propose a post-MonroeDoctrine/ManifestDestiny basis for calling ourselves "American".

        <em>I know very few people who call themselves "European".

        <strong>Terms -(Synonyms), Separation and Isolation: </strong>If, say, Germans used the term "European" as a synonym for "German", that would be a parallel. Residents of the U.S.A. who casually call themselves "Americans" are likely to have little or no understanding of the other cultures of this hemisphere. It's a kind of know-nothing isolationism. -- tr

        <strong>Cultural Distinctions Considered: </strong>Culture's the real trouble. We Americans call ourselves that because that's what we learned. Furthermore, we don't have anything else to call ourselves, at least in English. The MexicanLanguage offers "estadosunidenses", as mentioned below, but they also refer to the nation-state as "Los Estados Unidos" exclusively, without ever mentioning "America". I think French does the same. Brits I've talked to refer to "Americans" as the occupants and citizens of the USA. Spaniards seem to use "Americanos" for that purpose. It's just a name. Notice that you don't hear me calling myself a "North American". It's a fact, but that's a continent. In English, America is a country, North and South America are continents, and together they are the Americas (plural). If you see your people as oppressed by another group whose stated name is confusingly similar to that of an entity of which you are a part, you'll take offense at the name. Witness the discord between hackers, crackers, and the media.

And I don't know <a href="LeavesOfGrass.html">LeavesOfGrass</a> by heart. And I don't understand CharltonHeston. So I haven't met the requirements for AmerIcan citizenship.

        <strong>Geographical and National Distinctions Considered: </strong> <em>Part of the problem, I suppose, is that the US is named after a continent (well, two continents). So the short form of "United States of America" is most sensibly "America", which is more descriptive than "United States", even if people know which United States you're talking about. I mean, people from the "Federal Republic of Germany" don't call themselves "Federal Republicans".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I wonder if part of the confusion stems from the fact that a) the US is a nation, but not an ethnicity or b) perhaps the name USA, by encompassing two continents in its name, speaks to the then-popular belief in manifest destiny. That's mostly just idle theorizing, though; I don't know the history of the name very well.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (That is pretty much wrong. The name 'United States of America' arose because at the time it was coined, it was the only 'United States' of anything on either continent of the Americas (the proper term for North and South America). Later on, when other countries on the Americas gained independence, they all chose names that didn't collide with America's name to avoid confusion. Therefore, 'America' is a perfectly reasonable short form for 'United States of America' and any claims to the contrary are simply wrong. Especially the absurd claim that 'American' somehow refers to any citizen of the Americas.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>At any rate, different countries care about this at varying degrees. A curious thing to note is that Latin Americans tend to be very adamant about not calling USians "Americanos" -- they use "Estadounidenses" instead. But in my experience, Spaniards just use "Americanos". Less syllables. -- francis</em>

        <em>I get the impression that Canadians disagree. They seem to be offended if I mistake one for an American, in a very similar way to a New Zealander mistaken for an Australian.  This leads me to wonder whether Canadians [that I've met] have completely swallowed this line you now reject, that America == USA. -- </em><a href="MatthewAstley.html">MatthewAstley</a><em></em>

        Yeah - just another indignity that we've heaped on our northern neighbors. So are you a Brit? -- tr

        Yes. Imagine the offence though if it turned out I was Irish! 8-)

      <p>
        I don't know, but I suspect it would just be taken as a mistake, or even a compliment on my command of English. If I were French though, you'd better not accuse me of being Belgian (or is this one the other way around?).  I wonder if there's a graph of these things, somewhere?
      </p>
      <p>
        I never got to do the experiment in the end, but I suspect that a pair of tourists in (the Republic of) Ireland could amuse themselves getting alternate warm and cold welcomes, if one were American and the other English, and they took turns in asking directions.
