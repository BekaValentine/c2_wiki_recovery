      <p>
        Mathematician and accidental software engineer/architect.
      </p>
      <p>
        Over 20 years software development, project and team management, and have realized at a visceral level that methodology is snake oil.
        During that time, I have worked at large, medium, and small companies, on a variety of projects.

        Interests?
        Frankly, I just like to build working software, that fulfils customer needs (even the needs they have not yet grokked).
        I have been working on various flavors Unix/Linux since using a Fortune 32:16 and a Cromemco Xenix in college (Dec-20, Hp-3000 also),
        though I have even built some Windows based software.
      </p>
      <p>
        Mostly using C/C++, Java, Perl, and Ruby, mixed with SQL, but I like Lua, and have toyed with Scheme.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="RealLife.html">RealLife</a>(tm) I enjoy Gaming, Larp, Car Repair, Taekwondo, Canoeing, Thrifting, and reading (Sci-Fi, Fantasy, Self-Improvement, etc).
