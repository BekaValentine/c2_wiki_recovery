        Inherently Component Based Applications
      </h1>
      <p>
        Some applications <em>do not require</em> a component-based application, whereas others seem to require a component-based environment (or at least an enivironment that
        provides very similar functionality).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Examples of inherently component based applications/systems include:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           CGI/Servlets (web server-side)
        </li>
        <li>
           Compound document systems. (e.g. <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a>, OLE, and possibly the client-side of the web e.g. Java, ActiveX and the plug-ins.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Microkernel and similar OS architectures (i.e. systems where OS parts can be "plugged in" after the OS installation)
        </li>
        <li>
           Application extensions (aka "plug-ins) (e.g. <a href="PhotoShop.html">PhotoShop</a> plug-ins, Excel plug-ins,... )
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Counter-examples:</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Very small, self-contained embedded systems. (i.e. the whole software package comes on an EPROM, so the application is the "unit of release")
        </li>
        <li>
           ...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Forces affecting this classification</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why is it necessary to build an application using components? (Discarding
        any "developer convenience" or "development economy" factors.)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Change of at least part of the application <em>after the point of a working release</em> is required.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Feel free to add examples, counterexamples and forces that affect the classification</em>
