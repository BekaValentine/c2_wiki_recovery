        Functional Vs Procedural Vs Object Oriented Programming
      </h1>
      <p>
        From <a href="TexTheProgram.html">TexTheProgram</a>: <em></em>TeX is the last hurrah of procedural/functional structured (read: non-OO) programming.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Ok, I've finally taken the time to learn smalltalk. I really like it. I've been procedural programming for years, followed by years of that OO/procedural mishmash that people use when they teach themselves C++ without the help of any C++ books. I now am trying to conquer <a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What I fail to see is why people these days are so down on functional programming. As I get better with it, I want to use it more and more. I like smalltalk, but that isn't what I want to grab when I go home at night.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps a better ideal would be to combine the two. Complex mathematical systems could be expressed as functional programming, which could then be wrapped as a smalltalk object to send messages to.

        I find that Python has the right blend of readability and availability in the average workplace. It (the latest version: 2.2) combines some good ideas from functional programming with a very appealing OO syntax. Having done perl, some lisp, lots of C++ and java, I find myself almost always reaching for a <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> solution. -- <a href="RoyMathew.html">RoyMathew</a>

        It strikes me as peculiar that no-one has mentioned <a href="ObjectiveCaml.html">ObjectiveCaml</a> yet. I find it a very pleasant mix of functional programming and object oriented programming. Here's some chit-chat with the <a href="ReadEvalPrintLoop.html">ReadEvalPrintLoop</a>:

      <code>
        # class dog = object<br/>
        method speak () = print_string "Woof!"; print_newline () <br/>
        end;;<br/>
        class dog : object method speak : unit -> unit end<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        # class cow = object<br/>
        method speak () = print_string "Moo!"; print_newline ()<br/>
        end;;<br/>
        class cow : object method speak : unit -> unit end<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I declare a class <em>dog</em> with a single method <em>speak</em> that says <em>Woof!</em>, and then a <em>cow</em>.
      </p>
      <code>
        # let rec repeat x n = match n with 0 -> []<br/>
        | n -> x :: repeat x (n - 1);;<br/>
        val repeat : 'a -> int -> 'a list = <fun><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I declare a function <em>repeat</em> that takes a value and a number and returns a list of <em>n</em> <em>x</em>es. Note that even though I have not specified any types, the compiler knows that it should expect one value of any type and one int, and return a list of the type passed first. This is called <a href="TypeInference.html">TypeInference</a>.
      </p>
      <code>
        # repeat "foo" 3;;<br/>
        - : string list = ["foo"; "foo"; "foo"]<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        # repeat "foo" 3 @ repeat "bar" 3;;<br/>
        - : string list = ["foo"; "foo"; "foo"; "bar"; "bar"; "bar"]<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        # repeat "foo" 3 @ repeat 3.14159 5;;<br/>
        This expression has type float list but is here used with type string list<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Note that a list cannot contain values of two different types.
      </p>
      <code>
        # repeat (new dog) 5;;<br/>
        - : dog list = [<obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>]<br/>
        # repeat (new dog) 5 @ repeat (new cow) 3;;<br/>
        - : dog list = [<obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>]<br/>
        # let animals = repeat (new dog) 10 @ repeat (new cow) 5;;<br/>
        val animals : dog list =<br/>
        [<obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>;<br/>
        <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>; <obj>]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        A list cannot contain values of different types, but I was able to create a list of cows and dogs! This is because the type of an instance of <em>dog</em> does not refer to the class, but its contents. Since cows and dogs have the same methods, treating them as of the same type cannot cause any runtime errors.
      </p>
      <code>
        # List.iter (fun animal -> animal#speak ()) animals;;<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Woof!<br/>
        Moo!<br/>
        Moo!<br/>
        Moo!<br/>
        Moo!<br/>
        Moo!<br/>
        - : unit = ()<br/>
