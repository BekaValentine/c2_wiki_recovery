        Comment Example
      </h1>
      <p>
        Here's a Smalltalk method with a comment, followed by a bit of rewriting using reasonable coding standards. Help me with suggestions for useful comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thanks!
      </p>
      <code>
        expRpt<br/>
        "Print an expense report consisting of the personal information<br/>
        of the submitter, the travel details with connection to the trip <br/>
        request, the detail item summary, and a total."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        self<br/>
        persInfo;<br/>
        travInfo.<br/>
        detailItems do: <br/>
        [ :each | self dtlInfo: (detailItems at: each)]<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        OK, I'd agree that this needs the comment. What if it looked like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        printExpenseReport<br/>
        self<br/>
        printPersonalInfo;<br/>
        printTravelInfo;<br/>
        printDetailItems;<br/>
        printTotal<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I wouldn't find the comment to be of much value any more ... what would be a useful one?
      </p>
      <p>
        What if some of the inner methods looked like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        printPersonalInfo<br/>
        self<br/>
        printName;<br/>
        printAddress;<br/>
        printDepartment<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        printDetailItems<br/>
        detailItems do: [ :each | self printDetail: each]<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        printDetail: aDetailItem<br/>
        self<br/>
        printDescription: aDetailItem description;<br/>
        printAmount: aDetailItem amount.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        And so on ... what kind of commenting would be needed? -- <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Can I change the formatting at all? What the hell is the format?
        Do I get subtotals or just grand totals?
        Can I attach a filter to select just a subset?
        Where will it print to? How long will it take? How do I cancel it?
        Any special printer setup like labels/checks? What size paper is assumed?
        Can I email the report and print it out?
      </p>

        <em>So I guess the generic answer is: Those responsibilities would be distributed to other classes as appropriate, with minor modifications to the current class. Very interesting. So perhaps code like this IS feasible. Comments? -- </em>DanielAborg<em></em>

      <hr/>
      <p>
        The original comment essentially duplicates what the method does (or is supposed to do: where's the total?) As such it doesn't add much to the code itself, once the cryptic naming is addressed. (Given a commenting regime, such comments can still be useful in scanning the code by reading the more readable [to some] English version, but that's a smaller matter).
      </p>
      <p>
        A more interesting comment would describe the context of the method rather than just what it does literally. For instance, the specific report form (just "Form 7256A", or perhaps,if it's the only place in this system this reference occurs, a more detailed specification of that form, or a pointer to it). Some description of how the current object gathers the requisite information might be in order (it appears to have it all right at hand, but for instance the total calculation might be a side effect of processing the detail items, which would be good to know).
      </p>
      <p>
        Of course, nobody's saying that <em>every method</em> <strong>needs</strong> a comment; this one is short, and, especially as modified, reasonably to the point. Much of the information above, even if appropriate, might well be hung on the class rather than a specific method; as long as it's <em>somewhere</em>. -- <a href="JimPerry.html">JimPerry</a>

        A category of comment which might conceivably be judged valuable is the class comment, or more generally the SummarizingComment, as in the example below from an experimental VM written in Java. Even though... please read on.

        The method itself has a lot of necessary, but distracting, syntactic noise (mostly to deal with exceptions); summarizing the "story" in a comment at the top helped me remember what was supposed to be going on <em>without</em> having to read the code, which I tended to find painful.
      </p>
      <p>
        I originally wrote these remarks about 6 months ago, prior to any experience with test-driven design and the philosophy that <a href="TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign.html">TheSourceCodeIsTheDesign</a>. Looking back, I am inclined to think that the things which looked to me as indicative of the need for comments are more properly understood as poor design.
      </p>
      <p>
        Today, I would be more cautious about relying on Java's own exception mechanism to generate the exceptions that my own VM has to throw; that's too clever by half. I would have null and bounds checking in separate small methods. I would probably think twice about generating as many flyweight classes with little responsibility of their own as the Java spec defines opcodes; too clever by half, again.

        Yup. Another thing I might do differently. There was an initializer method somewhere that went something like...
      </p>
      <p>
        public abstract class OpCode {
      </p>
      <code>
        static {<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        table = new OpCode[256];<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        //  op         len kind  pop push    name               var flags<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        op(ACONST_NULL, 1, CONST, 0, "a",   "aconst_null",      0, 0);<br/>
        op(ICONST_M1,   1, CONST, 0, "i",   "iconst_m1",       -1, 0);<br/>
        op(ICONST_0,    1, CONST, 0, "i",   "iconst_0",         0, 0);<br/>
      </code>
