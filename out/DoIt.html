        System development can be stressful for all concerned, and we believe that incremental development and relentless testing can reduce the typical Sturm und Drang (defined below).

        With Sturm und Drang,
        German authors became cultural leaders of Europe,
        writing literature that was revolutionary in its stress
        on subjectivity and on the unease of man in
        contemporary society. The movement was
        distinguished also by the intensity with which it
        developed the theme of youthful genius in rebellion
        against accepted standards, by its enthusiasm for
        nature, and by its rejection of the rules of

        I realize that the DoItStory still needs to be told....  I promised <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>, and haven't forgotten.  Bill, Carl, Larry, and Dana - feel free to jump in.  Or maybe we should just decide what the moral of the story is, and record that.

        <strong>Hmm.</strong> I use "doit" as the name of any temporary batch or command line files I am creating to get a certain complex task accomplished. Then the file gets deleted, of course. I'm not, like, saying anything here.
