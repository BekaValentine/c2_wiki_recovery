        <strong>Write the answer to your own question.</strong> <a href="PatrickMueller.html">PatrickMueller</a> wrote that he had cloned wiki. I wanted to know more. So I added "see <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a>" to his page, as if I were speaking to a third party, and then wrote what little I knew of his system in that page. Pat filled in the details that afternoon.

        <strong>Send email.</strong> It's <em>old fashioned</em>, but it still works. It's also a little like whispering in class. If you learn something this way please bring it back to the web. We'd all like to know.

        "Email? Faster than snail-mail, less intrusive than phone calls ... sorta like passing notes in class." That's been my line for years. -- <a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a>

        <strong>Links not Questions</strong> (or <em></em><a href="PromptingStatement.html">PromptingStatement</a><em>) When you have a question, try to ask it in the form of an unresolved link. I saw someone refer to a company called "Wall Data". I thought, "what's that?" Rather than post the question, I just turned it into a link - </em><a href="WallData.html">WallData</a> - trusting that someone will fill it in later. -- <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a>

        Does that actually work? I tend to interpret the question mark as meaning clicking won't help. I don't see it as a request to create the page. This may be because there are too many accidental matches to the <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a>. I also sometimes create links without caring whether the page exists, on the off-chance it does. That's what I just did with <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a>. I <em>know</em> what a <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a> is.

        Might it be better to actually create the page, but leave it blank or containing only the request for data? Or (preferably?) a half-baked guess at the answer which someone else can correct. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        I'd prime the pump by putting in a 1st cut slab of text, with the appropriate caveats. -- <a href="BenTremblay.html">BenTremblay</a>

        The community here at Millennium (where I've ported Wiki at the request of <a href="MitchellModel.html">MitchellModel</a>) finds the "accidental matches" to be an enormous benefit. These amount to automatic citations and glossary entries, especially helpful with jargon words. We find these to be useful <a href="PromptingStatement.html">PromptingStatement</a>s, that invite a response.
      </p>
      <p>
        In this community, even though you as the author might <em>know</em> what a <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a> is, many others might not. And so the presence of the <a href="PromptingStatement.html">PromptingStatement</a> of <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a> invites someone to fill in a description of the <a href="LinkPattern.html">LinkPattern</a>. Since <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a> knows what it means, he won't bother to follow it very often (unless it changes...*smile*). Newcomers, however, appreciate having it so readily available. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>

        What can also happen is that a <a href="PromptingStatement.html">PromptingStatement</a> is written, and then someone else realizes that there is already a page but with a different <a href="WikiName.html">WikiName</a>, and so they fix the <a href="WikiLink.html">WikiLink</a>. This may be a good reason not to create the empty page, as suggested above. -- <a href="EricScheid.html">EricScheid</a>

        Very true - but equally, don't let fear that a link already exists under a different name stop you from creating a new page. Certainly, some level of due diligence is required before starting a new page - but do place some faith in the notion that the same <a href="WikiCitizen.html">WikiCitizen</a> who might flesh out your new page could just as well perform the <a href="DisAmbiguation.html">DisAmbiguation</a>.
