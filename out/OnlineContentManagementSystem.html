        This is my thesis. It is non commercial so register and use the site

        This is a service based architecture. Services implemented are User Info Page, 
        Online courses, Group Projects, E-Forums,E-library, E-Contacts, E-Bookmarks. 
        Other services that may be added in future. E-Auctions, Chat, News Channel.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each service is implemented using <a href="SessionBeanWrapsEntityBeans.html">SessionBeanWrapsEntityBeans</a> pattern. Jsp 
        files access these services using <a href="AccessBean.html">AccessBean</a>. The look and feel of the jsp is 
        controlled by CSS which can be set using Configurationfile.[1] Configuration 
        file can also be used to select the services need for the application. This 
        means that I can build a new application just by adjusting the configuration 
        file.
      </p>

        Register and use the site ..it may not be up since I am using my university's 
        PC. The entire look and feel of the site can be changed. But right now, all users will have the same look and feel. I will add the ability for the users to 
        change the look and feel in few days ..just few more <a href="EntityBean.html">EntityBean</a>s. Drop your comments and suggestions at <a href="mailto:jalawam@csee.wvu.edu.">mailto:jalawam@csee.wvu.edu.</a>

        <strong>Updated and it is up</strong>
        Now each user can change the look and feel of his pages. A very cool color 
        picking tool is provided for the user. Now you can change the background 
        image,link colors,hovering effects, title bar and side bar colors , fonts and 
        many more.

        <strong>Update.. a service configurator and a channel service</strong>
        Service configurator alows the user to select and edit the services he or she wants. He can change his mind at any time and select new services.
        Channel service is a unique way of interacting and keeping in touch with other people. Create your own personal channel publish news on that channel and all the users who are subscribed to your channel will be able to read your news. For example if you are going out on a long journey out of the country ... post your latest news and your experiences on your own channel (say Trip). You can also  subscribe to other users' channels ... see who got the most popular channel.
      </p>

        <strong>Update.. On line tips for every page</strong>
        A tips ticker is added as a new service. This is a context-sensitive helper. That means depending on the page you are in the tips will change.
