        Forget The Wheel
      </h1>
      <p>
        It seems that a lot of times when we <a href="ReinventTheWheel.html">ReinventTheWheel</a> we do it just because we forget or even <a href="IgnoreTheWheel.html">IgnoreTheWheel</a> so, in our own context we might think were are inventing something really novel when in reality were are just repeating something that was done before

        <em>Maybe we </em>NeverFoundTheWheel.  Libraries of algorithms, patents, ideas, software projects, etc. are enormous.  We don't have anywhere near time to find them all, research those that might (but might not) apply to whatever problem we are solving, etc.<em></em>
