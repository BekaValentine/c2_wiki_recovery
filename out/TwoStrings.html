        Two Strings
      </h1>
      <p>
        Two strings are waiting in a line-up to a posh club. When they finally make it to the door, the bouncer stops them.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Sorry, no strings allowed. Management policy," he says.
      </p>
      <p>
        Dejected, the two strings walk away. After turning a corner, one of the strings stops and says, "Wait a minute! I've got an idea!"
      </p>
      <p>
        He twists and wriggles [wriggle around], and then unravels one of his ends [vigourously shake hands through hair].
      </p>
      <p>
        The second string watches while the first approaches the door to the club again.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bouncer looks suspicious and stops the string again.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Hey wait a second. Aren't you a string?" He asks.
      </p>
      <p>
        The string smirks and replies, "Nope..."
      </p>
      <p>
        "... I'm a frayed knot."
      </p>

        <a href="TwoStrings.html">TwoStrings</a> walk into a bar. One says, "I'd like a beer please.jj(($)&^^%!!111bbit."
      </p>
      <p>
        The other adds, "Please do pardon my friend. He's not null-terminated."

        Speaking of which, funniest null-terminator silliness?  This:

      <code>
        strcat(a_string, "\0");<br/>
