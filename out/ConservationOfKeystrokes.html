        Conservation Of Keystrokes
      </h1>
      <p>
        The design principle that suggests that a key design goal for a system (programming language, etc.) ought to be minimizing the number of keystrokes that need to be typed by a user of the system.
      </p>
      <p>
        Useful in two instances:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In instances when typing by the operator is the bottleneck - a system designed for data entry clerks certainly ought to  minimize keystrokes. (<a href="UnixOs.html">UnixOs</a> is another example - at least in the early days, when Unix systems were run from 300 baud terminals, this was a noble principle. Now, it's considered by many one of the more annoying features of Unix.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As a general design principle; certainly, a language that uses "a = b" or similar to test for equality is preferably to one that makes the user type "variable(a) is_equal_to variable(b)" or somesuch.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, this principle is frequently taken too far; many systems suffer from excessive keystroke optimization. In the domain of programming languages, it can make programs notoriously difficult to read (see <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>, <a href="WriteOnlyLanguage.html">WriteOnlyLanguage</a>) and extend.
