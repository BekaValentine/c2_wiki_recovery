        If there is a beautiful view, don't spoil it by building
        huge windows that gape incessantly at it.  Instead, put the
        windows which look onto the view at places of transition--
        along paths, in hallways, in entry ways, on stairs, between rooms.
      </p>
      <p>
        If the view window is correctly placed, people will see
        a glimpse of the distant view as they come up to the window
        or pass it: but the view is never visible from the places
        where people stay.

        This reminds me of a sculpture in Eindhoven <a href="TheNetherlands.html">TheNetherlands</a>.  In the middle of a traffic circle at the end of a long straightaway, there is a sculpture which at certain times of day looks like the Penrose impossible triangle, or "tribar", when driving towards it.
