      <p>
        <a href="WikiWatcher.html">WikiWatcher</a> is either a sociologist specializing in the analysis of the use of collaborative tools on the web or more generally an individual or corporation conducting surveys on the matter.

        A <a href="WikiWatcher.html">WikiWatcher</a> can also refer to anyone looking into a Wiki site for the purpose of learning first-hand what a Wiki is, observing communications to see what's going on in cybertalk, conducting research (as suggested by the previous wiki definition), or even having no purpose at all. The latter would more appropriately be referred to as a <a href="WikiVagrant.html">WikiVagrant</a> (not to be confused with <a href="WikiNomad.html">WikiNomad</a>). Yours truly, Hal
