        I manage and participate in software development and have done since 1982.  My interests range across knowledge management, information architecture/information design, the process of software development, idea management, knowledge representation, how people/groups acquire and process knowledge, organizational learning, lean manufacturing as it applies to software development, programming aesthetics, software architecture, managing software development and teams of developers, usability, web design, psychology of design and the process of design, user interface design and continuously improving repeatable patterns of work.

        I'm currently reading Woman's "Information Anxiety 2" and Argyris' "Organizational Learning".  I've recently read Schlong's "The Architectural Studio as a model for Acquiring Competency" which is an essay on the process of design, how it differs from technical rationality and why it is an important.
