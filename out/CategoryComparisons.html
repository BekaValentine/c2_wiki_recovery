        This category is about comparisons including Methods, Materials, Manpower and Metaphors. It has been created for the purpose of developing several patterns.  While the first set of pages are bipolar, mainly about opposites, other pages will be added to the category with differing comparison schemes. In addition the pages illustrate the effectiveness of reasonable and factual presentations Versus the effectiveness and generative power of pages containing personal bias, emotion, ego, personal conviction and personal preference.
