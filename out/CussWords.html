        Cuss Words
      </h1>
      <p>
        Cuss words are words that have some sort of negative connotation in a particular setting or amongst a particular group.
      </p>
      <p>
        They also generally have multiple definitions and uses as different parts of speech.
      </p>

        <em>Or, simply, within a particular language?</em>

      <p>
        Is 'cuss' a word used in all cultures? Or is this an <a href="AmericanCulturalAssumption.html">AmericanCulturalAssumption</a>? I would say maybe SwearWord or maybe 'to curse' is close.
      </p>

        <em>"Cuss" is an alteration of "curse".  Maybe based upon US Southern pronunciation.</em>
