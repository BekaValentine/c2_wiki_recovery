        Every so often a disagreement flares up here. It usually centers around
        some tenet of XP and it involves something like 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Do the simplest thing that could possibly work</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Members of the C3 team award a lovely FAO Schwartz </em><a href="PropellerBeanie.html">PropellerBeanie</a> to a developer who digs too deeply into the bag of tricks<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of us object to these statements as being anti-thinking and anti-experimenting. And it is immediately pointed out that the vague words are there. "dig <strong>too</strong> deeply" doesn't mean you shouldn't dig deeply when necessary. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Etcetera. Yawn. The statement as written, is correct. But statements have baggage. Implications. They carry assumptions around. And I object to the
        <a href="PropellerBeanie.html">PropellerBeanie</a> not because I view excess complexity as a good thing, but 
        because an environment where people are judging code and awarding <a href="PropellerBeanie.html">PropellerBeanie</a>s is likely to be an environment where people are 
        unlikely to dig deeply into their bag of tricks, whether or not it's appropriate. E.g. an environment where the status quo rules and common 
        practice becomes enshrined. An environment, in short, where a good 
        piece of well-understood (and complex) business software could be 
        written on time and on schedule. But maybe not such a 
        good place for tinkering at the edges and exploring just what these 
        computer things can really do for the company.

        William, in your work with knowledge representation do you often throw in machine learning, or <a href="GeneticAlgorithm.html">GeneticAlgorithm</a>s when all you really need is a tree structure?

        If that's all that is being said, then it's something that doesn't need
        to be said. The fact that it was said led me to believe that something stronger was being asserted. And I objected to the stronger thing. -- <a href="WilliamGrosso.html">WilliamGrosso</a>

        The objection is to the use of <a href="VagueWords.html">VagueWords</a>.  Tautological, relativistic phrases like "too deeply" (what is deeply?  what is too deeply? - - unanswerable, personality-based, relative terms).

        <em>This page is objecting to the use of vague words, certainly. Because,</em>

        Fortunately for us the C3 people are giving the <a href="PropellerBeanie.html">PropellerBeanie</a>s away.  They get to define what <em>too deep</em> is.  When we award our own beanies then we get to decide.

        The negation test mentioned seems to be the <a href="MeyerTest.html">MeyerTest</a>. As I noted there, one can make a case for any such statement. And actually there was made a case for "use meaningless names" when there were limits on the length of an identifier. But yes, advisory rules/platitudes that make no distinction are useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it's true that "no one in his right mind would suggest using meaningless variable names". Nevertheless, actually using names that are literally meaningless is very prevalent. "Meaningless" has a definite meaning. Sure, it is subject to some interpretation, but interpretation is not the issue when a programmer chooses "t" over "totalRevenue".
      </p>
      <p>
        That said, there <em>are</em> gray areas and degrees. Seems to me that C3 has the most effective way to deal with those. Instead of attempting to completely codify a naming standard, they work closely together and provide feedback to specific situations. So, your partner can suggest "How about totalRevenue instead of totalAmount, because it's more specific". I'm not sure how I would write that in a standards manual without resorting to yet another platitude.

        Djikstra said that you should use meaningless variable names.  He said you should always use variables with names like s and t so that programmers will not be fooled into thinking they know what the variables do.  If you use meaningless variable names then you have to look at the definitions of the variable to find out what they do.  Of course, his variable were all defined with invariants.  But it is possible to come up with a world in which "use meaningless variable names" makes sense. -- <a href="RalphJohnson.html">RalphJohnson</a>

        Wasn't intended as a sweeping criticism of all XP. XP has some good rules. But it also has some poor ones. And the issue also applies to pages which are not part of XP.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="DoSimpleThings.html">DoSimpleThings</a> is a poor one, as the <a href="ComplexIsBetter.html">ComplexIsBetter</a> page shows - the terms are defined to make it a tautology. It might be better phrased as DiscountTheFuture, or some such. <a href="AvoidExceptionsWheneverPossible.html">AvoidExceptionsWheneverPossible</a> is poor because it is so vague, and because <em>[was something lost from here?]</em>
      </p>

        Maybe they work better in a coach role, where you have continual contact with the team and can evolve an understanding, and update with judgments on the fly. Meyer was talking about rules written once in books, which a bit different. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why would someone ever use gratuitous complexity? If they put it in, they thought they needed it, or would need it, which is the same thing unless they are discounting the future. That's why I think "</em>DiscountTheFuture" is a better way to express the same rule. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I use complexity when I shouldn't. Sometimes due to not being able to think of the simple solution. Sometimes mistakenly thinking the simple solution couldn't possibly work. Sometimes due to not discounting the future, or not discounting the past. Sometimes due to underestimating how complicated the complex solution will turn out to be.
      </p>
      <p>
        To me, "gratuitous complexity" is by definition bad code. I do not set out to write bad code. A rule that says, "Don't write bad code" doesn't help me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Another term for "</em>DiscountTheFuture" might be "NeverAnticipateOutcomes". Of course, the rationale for either involves defying itself: if you count on the future, you can <em>count on</em> wasting effort. I think the paradox here suggests there is something missing in this rule.<em></em>

        No Ron you are not wrong.  I have just seen exceptions used to avoid having to code methods on classes that would just return a zero anyway.  That is, instead of making all the appropriate classes polymorphic, with some of the implementations returning a zero some jangmeister wrappered the method calls with an exception catch.  An exception catch that would catch any error what so ever.  Talk about hard to debug!  -- <a href="DonWells.html">DonWells</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>So they thought they needed exceptions and were wrong. More specifically, they thought using exceptions would make the code simpler, and were wrong.

        <em>"Rather than with what we actually wrote"</em> - I'd agree if you'd change that to "rather than with what we actually meant". <a href="VagueWords.html">VagueWords</a> invite misunderstanding. It's not necessarily the fault of the people who misunderstand.

        "<a href="CodeWithoutExceptions.html">CodeWithoutExceptions</a>" is a general, vague title. The example it leads with is highly specific; it is the <a href="ConvertExceptions.html">ConvertExceptions</a> idiom. If the page had been called, "DontConvertExceptions", there would be more scope for agreement. If it was further refined to "DontConvertExceptionsUnlessYouAreWritingAframework", which is what you actually seemed to think at one point, then I don't think I'd argue at all. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        For example, "<a href="CodeWithoutExceptions.html">CodeWithoutExceptions</a>" doesn't distinguish between throwing exceptions and catching them. It doesn't distinguish calling library routines which throw exceptions. As I said on one of the other pages, <a href="CodeWithoutExceptions.html">CodeWithoutExceptions</a> is impossible in Smalltalk because every method send potentially throws a stack overflow exception. It's so general it's manifestly untrue. You must mean something different, in which case the title is not just general but over-general, that is, vague. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>
