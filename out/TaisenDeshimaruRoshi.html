        Personally, I'd never trust a Zen master who uses the word "I" that much. -- <a href="FrancisHwang.html">FrancisHwang</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. There are no masters. There are only fools who have learned to call themselves master, and fools who have learned to call others master. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. <a href="ZaZen.html">ZaZen</a> is not a ritual to use to mourn someone's passing. It is only an ablution, like brushing one's teeth.
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes. Trust those who are trustful. And also those who are not trustful.
