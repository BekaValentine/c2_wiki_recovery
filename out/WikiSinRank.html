        I am curious to see how others would rank these "wiki sins". I rank them 1,2,4,3,5 (first is worse). I would be harder on number 3, but feel that the current wiki is not designed for a small enough granularities to factor properly. -- top

      <p>
        I would agree on 1 & 2, tie 3 & 5, and put 4 last. I base this mostly on how hard it is to fix each "sin". 1 is outright unethical, and impossible to catch once someone has touched the page. 2 is a pain unless it's caught immediately, but can usually be rectified. Duplication of ideas isn't hard to deal with in principle, but often times the duplication is hard to catch and hard to merge. Off-topic spawns huge <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a> that's usually impossible to refactor; it's a <a href="TimeSink.html">TimeSink</a> without much payoff. Putting material in the wrong topic is no problem; just go put it in the right topic.

        Let's turn this into a <a href="WikiWeightedVote.html">WikiWeightedVote</a>. You know the drill; 0-9, 9 is worst, each vote is one digit. -- <a href="JonathanTang.html">JonathanTang</a>

        I think 2) needs a bit more context. I assume it's meant as "Deleting on-topic content as an act of vandalism, personal attack, or disagreement", but there are also many instances where deletion of on-topic content occurs for good reasons (collapsing duplicated or near-duplicated content, thread mode conversion, etc.). Assuming nobody has any objections, shall we add this to the definition?

        I've also added <a href="ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode.html">ConvertThreadModeToDocumentMode</a> as its own item. I see it as a cardinal virtue; Robert sees it as a cardinal sin. Let's see what others think.
