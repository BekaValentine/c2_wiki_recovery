        I fell into Ward's Wiki a few weeks ago while searching for some info on Scheme hoping to use <a href="LispMe.html">LispMe</a> on <a href="PalmOs.html">PalmOs</a>. Having recently read <a href="WeavingTheWeb.html">WeavingTheWeb</a>, I thought the Wiki to be just what the doctor ordered.  But <a href="RossKowalski.html">RossKowalski</a> is right.  PublicEducation, at least where I teach, is not about to allow much Wiki-ing.

        I have some concerns about mucking up a professional programmer's Wiki with the concerns of a professional educator.  But not enough concern to keep me from asking about HabitsOfMind for professional programmers. Can they be taught, or at least, fostered?

        Hey! I really like the way this Wiki shows the corrections vs. the original, colors and all. Pretty slick!

        What do you mean by "Ward's Wiki"?
