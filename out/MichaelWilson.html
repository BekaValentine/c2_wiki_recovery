        Describe <a href="MichaelWilson.html">MichaelWilson</a> here.

        Hmm.  I could've SWORN I had a <a href="MichaelWilson.html">MichaelWilson</a> page out here.

        I've been writing code for 30 years and change (not too shabby at 38 if I do say so myself.)  Currently I'm working in finance, with an algorithmic trading team.

        I'm pretty sure I just got out of a meeting with <a href="MikeHill.html">MikeHill</a>, though it could be a different Mike Hill. I doubt it.

        Currently I'm in the process of moving into a role as an internal <a href="AgileProcesses.html">AgileProcesses</a> <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> coach.  Never having done any coaching this will no doubt be a bumpy ride.  Any advice you can offer would definitely be appreciated.
