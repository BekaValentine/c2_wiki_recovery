        Questions To Ask Your Xp Customer
      </h1>
      <p>
        I found a good set of questions in "Exploring Requirements: Quality Before Design" by <a href="DonaldGause.html">DonaldGause</a> and <a href="GeraldWeinberg.html">GeraldWeinberg</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here are <strong><em>some</em></strong> of the questions; can anyone else think of questions to add?  [Or comment on their relevance to XP?]
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Who is the client for this product?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>user vs customer</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What is a highly successful solution really worth to this client?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>getting an idea of what cost-structure is available for doing the work?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What is your real reason for wanting to solve this problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>for example, to sell to end-users, to solve in-house problem, to get VC funding</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        How much time do we have for this product?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>see Release </em><a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a><em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What are the trade-offs between time and value?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>see Release and Iteration </em><a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> -- number and "depth" of features.<em></em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Where else can the solution to this problem be obtained? Can we copy something that already exists?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For example, this product partially duplicates the features of Adobe Acrobat, but we don't want to license Acrobat for this project.</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What problems does this system solve?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What problems could this system cause?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>For example, internet reservations and ticket purchases creates the problem for Travel Agents who don't get some of that money... some of them go out of business. Travelers get less face-to-face advice, and may have a harder time evaluating the advice found on the internet. Could also be stated as </em>'Who loses if this system is deployed?<em>' </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally I'd find this a fascinating question, but isn't it somewhat outside of the scope of what a technical person needs to know? Seems more like a business-side question.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What environment is this product likely to encounter?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>cross-platform, web, embedded device?</em>
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What kind of precision is required or desired in the product?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>What level of rounding errors are okay? for a business app? for a game?</em>'
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Do my questions seem relevant?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Is there anything else I should be asking you?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Is there someplace I can go to see the environment in which this product will be used?

      <hr/>
      <p>
        Is there anything you want to ask me?
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        What can you tell me about other people (stake-holders? developers? consultants?) on this project?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think one of the ideas is that stake-holders not involved in forming the requirements will try to scuttle the project. The XP books avoid talking about the politics of the projects.</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        May I write down your answers and give you a written copy to study and approve?
      </p>
