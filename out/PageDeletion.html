        I would suggest unless we are dealing with spam, or pages created by personalities not previously known to the community, that we consider:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           use IsThisPageOk / <a href="IsThisOffTopicPageOk.html">IsThisOffTopicPageOk</a> to propose delete of pages, but give time for debate / negotiation. Then consider using the <a href="DeleteThisPageSomeTime.html">DeleteThisPageSomeTime</a> or <a href="DeletedUnlessDefended.html">DeletedUnlessDefended</a> tags first.
        </li>
        <li>
           use <a href="RealName.html">RealName</a> when initiating a delete for another person to second
        </li>
        <li>
           wait at least one or two days before seconding a delete, it gives a chance for the creator to <a href="MoveItElsewhere.html">MoveItElsewhere</a>, other people to disagree with the person initiating the delete, and perhaps time for negotiating differences, etc
          <ul>
            <li>
               if you are concerned about the delete rolling off recent changes, then it is only a small price to pay to note elsewhere to followup on the page a few days later.
            </li>
            <li>
               if the page being deleted is very controversial, meaning strong objections by otherwise reasonable community members, then wait at least a week, or just leave it in the limbo status.
            </li>
            <li>
               deleting pages without removing (and fixing) all <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s first is  a serious oversight.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
