        Maintain As Usual
      </h1>
      <p>
        I've been looking at Fit (<a href="FrameworkForIntegratedTest.html">FrameworkForIntegratedTest</a>) lately, and one phrase in the instructions really struck me: Maintain As Usual.  I realized that I have tendency to consider some aspects of the project to be SecondClassCode.  "Why <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> it, it's just /user interface code/temporary/test code."  So far, I've never been correct to treat code that way, my life would always have been simpler if I remembered to <a href="MaintainAsUsual.html">MaintainAsUsual</a>.
