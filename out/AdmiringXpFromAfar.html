        Admiring Xp From Afar
      </h1>
      <p>
        I thought of XPEnvy, but that didn't have quite the positive flavor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being JustAbody, I can only smuggle XP in tiny increments onto projects. I've had success sneaking in <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a> when I've mentored COBOL programmers being railroaded into Java; I'm always refactoring; I try to use <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s in the proper spirit whenever possible - and only recently got into JUnit (if I had known who created it, I would have been there sooner).
      </p>
      <p>
        I still have problems giving up on the whole UML design thing - the index cards seem so Luddite!
      </p>
      <p>
        But I have to admit I love the spirit and the humane philosophical ambience most - I read <a href="MartinFowler.html">MartinFowler</a> on Refactoring, which led me to <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> explaining XP, and I was hooked.

        And it's been a real pleasure to find this Wiki. -- <a href="TomRossen.html">TomRossen</a>

        I've been doing partial XP for a couple of years. The best steps towards XP have been:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           get <strong></strong><a href="TestInfected.html">TestInfected</a><strong>. Write the test first. Legacy code can be very hard to retrofit for unit testing, but all new code should be unit tested.</strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong></strong><a href="ReleaseOften.html">ReleaseOften</a><strong>. Every two or three weeks (even if its just to QA): with installation and some sort of user docs (even just a word file).  </strong>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Value the code. XP's best message has been to bring the focus back onto good source code. Everything builds from there.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        So what does good source code depend on?

        Re <a href="TestInfected.html">TestInfected</a> - I have a low-grade infection. Still trying to figure out how to test before coding if I can't compile the test because it refers to classes that don't exist yet..... -- tr
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's the first test. Then write just enough of the class to make the test compile. Then run the test. Then write a little more of the test to cause it to fail.  Then run the test. Then write just enough of the class to make the test pass. Then run the test....</em>
