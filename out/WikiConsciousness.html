        Compare and contrast <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> with <a href="HumanBrain.html">HumanBrain</a>.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Both contain huge databases of knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
           Both have elaborate inter-linking between pieces of knowledge.
        </li>
        <li>
           Both have "streams of consciousness".  In Wiki, these take the form of <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a>, <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, and <a href="QuickChanges.html">QuickChanges</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The "streams of consciousness" is an especially interesting similarity.  Here are some characteristics of "streams of consciousness":
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           There are one or more streams at a given time.
        </li>
        <li>
           A stream traverses the interlinked database of knowledge by following existing links.
        </li>
        <li>
           Each stream keeps a history of where it has been recently.
        </li>
        <li>
           If new similarities are discovered between the "current page", and one in the recent history, then a new link may be formed.
        </li>
        <li>
           Knowledge may be modified as it is being traversed.
        </li>
        <li>
           External actions may be taken based on the knowledge as it is traversed.
        </li>
        <li>
           External experience may create new knowledge, which becomes the "current page" for a new stream.
        </li>
        <li>
           Multiple simultaneous streams may interact and cross-link, or may proceed completely independent of each other.
        </li>
      </ul>
