        Interview With Kent
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="KentBeck.html">KentBeck</a> was kind enough to share some of his day (30-dec-1999) with me
        at his new office in Merlin. His (huge) dog Zoomer didn't even bite me.
        Here is the crux of the interview.

        Chris:
        It seems there is a role missing, that of the Program Manager. In
        a project that spans many of the functional disciplines within a
        company, the <a href="ProgramManager.html">ProgramManager</a> often coordinates and is "responsible"
        for the project to executive management. How is this done in XP?
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent:
        Yes, this role exists, but we have to be careful not to think
        this person has control of the project. Decisions are pushed down to the
        team. The program manager coordinates the commitment schedule with
        external dependencies. This role applies mainly to non-fixed price
        projects.

      </p>
      <p>
        Chris:
        We had some trouble understanding the "customer" role when
        applying XP to our business model. We have hundreds of customers
        and thus look more like a shrink-wrap business. We plan to put a
        product designer in the role of customer to represent the many needs
        and to make sure the stories form a coherent architecture. Does this sound
        right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent:
        Yes. This is another example of the difference between shrink-wrap
        and fixed-price projects. However, many companies hire an expert
        from their target market to play the role of customer. It's a question
        of which risk you want to take. A product designer that has to learn
        the problem domain, or an expert in the domain that has to learn
        design?

        Specialists/Experts
      </p>
      <p>
        Chris:
        With regard to code ownership, we have some deep technical areas that
        we tend to produce specialists from. XP says this is bad, but having
        specialists is a powerful information resouce. For example, when I
        am not in the office, no one can answer questions about product S.
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent:
        Sooo, experts are bad, right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Chris:
        Yeh, ok. Should we capture the knowledge on intranet web pages?
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent:
        Put the knowledge into the code. By using good variable names
        and comments, you can express a lot of information in the code.
        Put it into tests. The system's behaviour is expressed by the
        tests, so you can write tests just for documentation. If the system
        is based on something that has a quirk and you learn it, put a test
        in that communicates the quirk; the test case will make sure the
        quirk is still there.
      </p>
      <p>
        Chris:
        This sounds like a set of assertions about the system. Is that right?
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent:
        Yes.
      </p>

        Architecture (The guru approach)
      </p>
      <p>
        Chris:
        As with most interesting problems, the underlying model is hard.
        If we are to distribute all aspects of the project, how do we arrive at
        a strong model of the problem?
      </p>
      <p>
        Kent:
        Not all phases of the project are distributed. The distribution of
        effort in XP is about getting the most out of ourselves by concurrent
        execution on the most important parts of a system first. Determination
        of which business problems to attack in the market is a different kind
        of activity in which a smaller group of people (maybe one or two) focus.
        This is usually done by the customer (marketing on a shrink-wrap
        product). Likewise, the underlying model of a product might be
        developed by a few people. This should result in a metaphor that guides
        the whole project.
