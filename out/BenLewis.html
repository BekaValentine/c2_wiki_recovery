        I'm me... or am I?
        I'm a student at CornellCollege (not to be confused with CornellUniversity), one of two colleges in the <a href="UnitedStatesOfAmerica.html">UnitedStatesOfAmerica</a> to use the block plan. For info, go to <a href="http://www.cornellcollege.edu.">http://www.cornellcollege.edu.</a> Because this plan leaves me no free time, I'm GoodAtEverything and GreatAtNothing. I'm a Biology major and a <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a> minor, and I'm interested in <a href="BioInformatics.html">BioInformatics</a> as a possible career path. In the spare time I just told you was nonexistiant, I'm <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a>, a fan of <a href="TheMatrix.html">TheMatrix</a>, a student of <a href="KungFoo.html">KungFoo</a>, and, in general, a GeekInTraining.

        I'm about halfway through the new user documents, and I have two questions (this is a relative miracle): 
      </p>
      <p>
        A) When viewing the <a href="RecentEdits.html">RecentEdits</a> and <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> pages, some changes have names associated with them, while some have IP's. Naturally, my changes are represented by an IP, and I don't want them to be. Any suggestions?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Try </em><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        B) Can someone explain the different <a href="WikiModes.html">WikiModes</a>? <a href="FaqMode.html">FaqMode</a> and DialectMode (the easy ones) are clear to me, but <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> and <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> are apparently argued over more than they are defined for newbies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> is essentially <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a>, and is not the preferred mode of interaction on Wiki; it often degenerates into <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>. Many pages start out in <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a> and are eventually refactored into <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a>, which signals that a page has reached some sort of maturity. I.e., <a href="DocumentMode.html">DocumentMode</a> pages are to some extent static.<em></em>
