      <p>
        HSQL (formerly known as <a href="HypersonicSql.html">HypersonicSql</a>) is an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> Java database.
      </p>
      <p>
        The project is a <a href="SourceForge.html">SourceForge</a> project at: <a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb/">http://sourceforge.net/projects/hsqldb/</a>
      </p>

        There are other <a href="OpenSourceJavaDatabases.html">OpenSourceJavaDatabases</a> of which <a href="HypersonicSql.html">HypersonicSql</a> is very interesting instance.

        <em>What makes hsql "interesting"?</em> -- a curious reader
      </p>
      <p>
        HSQLDB can be used as an embedded database or as a server instance which even offers web access. HSQLDB is very fast and supports all necessary SQL commands. The database tables are stored in a simple text file (good for patching the data by hand) but can also be transformed into a cache file which improves memory usage. The performance is very good and it is very stable.

        Isn't HSQL what <a href="OpenOfficeOrg.html">OpenOfficeOrg</a> uses for its "Base" (<a href="OpenOfficeBase.html">OpenOfficeBase</a>) product (a <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a> clone of sorts)? Has anybody tested it for big joins? Being text-file based, join performance could be a concern. Also, I couldn't find a strait-forward ODBC driver for it.

        <a href="HypersonicSql.html">HypersonicSql</a> has an In-Memory mode, which can help with writing <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s for things that interface with databases (see <a href="EjbUnitTest.html">EjbUnitTest</a>).
