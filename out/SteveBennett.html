        I concur.  I'm pretty sure I'm not the same Steve Bennett who set up this page (I wasn't doing Wiki in 2001).  But he sure sounds like he knows what he's talking about.

        I am a third Steve Bennett, and I agree wholeheartedly with the other two. Collectors of Steve Bennett related trivia may like to know that there is an episode of The Simpsons in which Bart professes a desire to change his name to Steve Bennett.

        <em>There's also an episode of </em>I'm Alan Partridge<em> with a character called Steve Bennett, somewhat bizarrely.</em>

        I am yet another Steve Bennett. Like Bart, I thought it was a cool name until I slowly came to realise that half the planet seems to be called the same; this I infer from the fact that they pop up regularly in public life (UK Football referees, Rocket-launching hobbyists etc). I'm not famous yet, but when I am, you will add me to that illustrious list.

        Actually, the name "Steve Bennett" says it all - look up the origin of the name and what it means.
