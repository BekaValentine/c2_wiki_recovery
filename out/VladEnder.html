        I spend most of my company time programming in Visio/Word/<a href="PowerPoint.html">PowerPoint</a>. I would love to become <a href="JustaProgrammer.html">JustaProgrammer</a> again, but unfortunately wherever I turn I end criticizing the current state of affairs until people get sick of it and promote me. Fortunately, I can still get my hands dirty working on my own small projects, which currently include a code inspection/analysis tool (looking for smelling code?) for Java.

        My current employer is <a href="http://www.solnet.co.nz">http://www.solnet.co.nz</a> and you can try vlad.ender@myemployer if you think you have something to tell me.
