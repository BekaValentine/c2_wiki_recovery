        An Australian software architect and Kung Fu disciple. He was originally a theoretical computer scientist, but on completing his PhD in algorithms he left the temple (the University) to work in industry. Shortly afterwards, he was forever changed by a catastrophic exposure to a combination of Microsoft Visual C++ and financial markets risk management products. After this experience, he combined his Kung Fu with his design skills in order to put paid to all wrong-doers.

        If you would like to send him a message, he would be happy to receive it. Just write to alan565@hotmail.com. If you would like to send him spams or offers of breast enlargement, by all means do so because he is so used to receiving these that it won't make any difference.
