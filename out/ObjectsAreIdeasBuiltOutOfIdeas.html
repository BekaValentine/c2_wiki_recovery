        Objects Are Ideas Built Out Of Ideas

        Objects are ideas built out of ideas.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Mine are built out of bytes.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anything you can do with objects you can do with ideas. Objects are merely concepts written down in a formal language.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I can't garbage collect ideas.</em>

           I can - using OneNote -- <a href="DonaldNoyes.html">DonaldNoyes</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Is this an attempt at a definition of OO? I find it a little fuzzy. It also hints of the "OO should model the real world" point of view, which perhaps is not a majority opinion based on past debates.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are merely representations of things in the real world and have been configured to reside in a machine.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Only some objects represent things in the real world. Others don't. And all objects </em>are<em> things in the real world.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are but one concept the mind employs in Computing. The idea consists of representative Objects built in a StorageSpace, as structures which are encountered and employed by intervening procedural schemas.
      </p>
      <p>
        Objects are ideas, but ideas are not objects. Ideas are expressed using objects, but are not complete within objects or dimensional space. They exist in a space of their own - IdeaSpace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Hammers are ideas, but ideas are not hammers. Ideas are expressed using hammers, but are not complete within hammers.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I see. So the summary of this page is, if the only idea you have is a hammer, then you're going to get nailed by your objects. That explains a lot of software. ;-)

        <a href="ObjectsAreIdeasBuiltOutOfIdeas.html">ObjectsAreIdeasBuiltOutOfIdeas</a> yes? I might add ...RealizedInaKnownWayOnaPhysicalSubstrate. Otherwise they are - well - only ideas. I think these two conditions are essential:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          known structure allows to systematically reason about the structure.
        </li>
        <li>
          physically realized allows to change and interact with it. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The former is implicit in the sentence above: "written down in a formal language" is just one way to express it. But it is not exactly correct: The structure of the objects is written down, not the objects themselves (though they could) at least not in general.
