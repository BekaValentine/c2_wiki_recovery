        There is a book <strong>Random Acts of Kindness</strong>.  It basically collects a number of the such acts (that alledgely are true).  I've read several at the doctors office, and they are rather inspiring.  It looks there is a "whole line" of these books now, much like the ChickenSoupForTheSoul books.
