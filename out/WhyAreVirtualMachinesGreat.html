        Why Are Virtual Machines Great
      </h1>
      <p>

      <p>
        Because they provide an abstraction of the low level hardware without enforcing a specific language.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many real programming languages have some intermediate language anyway - why not make it explicit?
      </p>
      <p>
        If done correctly this doesn't compromise performance (too much) and can gain you a lot in return.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obvious example is the <a href="JavaVirtualMachine.html">JavaVirtualMachine</a>. But have a look at <a href="VirtualMachine.html">VirtualMachine</a> and its backlinks and <a href="LikePages.html">LikePages</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        What does (or can) a VM gain you?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Simple implementation of lots of other languages. See, for example, <a href="OtherLanguagesForTheJavaVm.html">OtherLanguagesForTheJavaVm</a>. 
        </li>
        <li>
           Simple integration with other languages (for the same VM). This is extremely obvious with the <a href="DotNet.html">DotNet</a> environment which explicitly targets different languages (but doesn't tell you that it partly cripples them).
        </li>
        <li>
           Certain safety properties which are based on <a href="TypeSafety.html">TypeSafety</a> and ByteCodeValidation... This could rid you of the performance penalty of process isolation.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There can be a price:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Performance, if not done correctly (this is very, very difficult).
        </li>
        <li>
           Specialized hardware (e.g. numeric processors) not accessible (by definition).
        </li>
        <li>
           Difficult to integrate with native languages.
        </li>
        <li>
           Loading time.
        </li>
        <li>
           Memory allocation issues (VMs are often garbage collected; this issue is due to garbage collection rather than VMs per se.)
        </li>
      </ul>
