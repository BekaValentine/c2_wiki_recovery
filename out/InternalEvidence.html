        Internal Evidence
      </h1>
      <p>
        Evidence that is not open to the reader of a topic, often AnecdotalEvidence. There is not a whole lot that can be done with such evidence other than <a href="AgreeToDisagree.html">AgreeToDisagree</a>. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Being hesitant with or skeptical of <a href="InternalEvidence.html">InternalEvidence</a> is not necessarily the same as a distrust of the other person. It may be that they have not thought of an alternative solution that would be discovered if more eyes reviewed it.
      </p>
      <p>
        Thus, neither side should take it personally. It is just the inherent nature of the beast.
