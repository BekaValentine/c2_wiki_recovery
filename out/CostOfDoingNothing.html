        Cost Of Doing Nothing
      </h1>
      <p>
        When making a decision whether to undertake a (potentially) expensive or risky activity; decision-makers should always consider the <a href="CostOfDoingNothing.html">CostOfDoingNothing</a>.  In other words, not only should the question "what happens if I do this project" should be asked, but the question "what happens if I don't?"
      </p>
      <p>
        Occasionally, one encounters simplistic decision-making processes that assume the <a href="CostOfDoingNothing.html">CostOfDoingNothing</a> is zero; and in many cases it is.  However, if it's a choice between enhancing an existing product and losing sales to a competitor; that latter option has a cost.  It may be hard to quantify, but it's there.
      </p>
      <p>
        It should be pointed out, though, that the "cost" of doing nothing is sometimes negative; in other words doing nothing (or doing something else--see <a href="OpportunityCost.html">OpportunityCost</a>) has its own rewards.  This too should be factored into any decision.
