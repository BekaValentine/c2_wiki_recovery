        Author Asks For Clarification
      </h1>
      <p>
        ... at the end of the formal review input of a
        <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a>, the author may be anxious about
        some of the things that were said.  Until now,
        the author has been a <a href="FlyOnTheWall.html">FlyOnTheWall</a>, but we can't
        have a <a href="SafeSetting.html">SafeSetting</a> unless the author is given a
        chance to speak (beyond just reading the work as in
        <a href="AuthorReadsTheWork.html">AuthorReadsTheWork</a>).
      </p>
      <p>

        <strong>Not all reviewer comments stand alone.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In a <a href="WritersWorkshop.html">WritersWorkshop</a>, reviewers are providing comments
        on-the-fly, comments that may not fully articulate the
        reviewer's rationale.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Reviewer comments can be ambiguous, confusing, or</strong>
        <strong>unclear in many ways.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        It doesn't serve the author (and the work) well if the
        author leaves before the reviewers clarify their comments.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Therefore:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The </strong><a href="AuthorAsksForClarification.html">AuthorAsksForClarification</a> after the<strong></strong>
        <strong>moderator calls an end to the formal comments.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that this is <em>not</em> an opportunity for the
        author to clarify his or her position with the
        reviewers, since the pattern must stand on its own.
        The information flows from the reviewers to the author,
        not vice versa.
      </p>
      <p>
        If authors disagree with any reviewer conclusions or
        remarks, they should take them away from
        the writer's workshop in silence.  Such disagreement
        or remarks provide information for the author, information
        the author can use to clarify the pattern on the next
        iteration.  By mutual agreement, the author and reviewer
        can discuss deeper issues (and, particularly, technical
        issues) in the afterglow of the workshop.
      </p>
      <p>

        This brings the ceremony to closure and ties up all the
        formal loose ends.  Further patterns, like <a href="ThankTheAuthor.html">ThankTheAuthor</a>,
        provide more complete emotional closure.
        The author can now take the
        feedback and iterate further on the pattern, making
        <a href="SelectiveChanges.html">SelectiveChanges</a>.
