        How Many People Use Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is there a way to determine how many people are contributing and reading Wiki?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>You can estimate the number of contributors by watching </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. But some people contribute from several different hosts, and some people share a host/gateway/proxy server. This should be easier once the new <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> becomes widely used.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>To watch the readers/lurkers, you'd have to monitor the server logs. They're not immediately available on-line; you'd probably have to ask </em><a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> for access.<em></em>

        Wiki is visited by about 5000 people a day. Most people read from 5 to 15 pages on a visit. At least once a day a site tries to read all 7000 pages in one visit. This always fails. Traffic at the site has grown slowly and steadily for five years reaching 2000 visitors a day last fall. Since then volume has grown more rapidly. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        Currently (Dec 2000) about 1600-2000 visitors have created some kind of homepage. Most of them (perhaps about 70-80%) have added one or more signed contributions.

      <p>
        <em>This raises two questions: Is this 5000 unique people, or just 5000 visits? Also, why does a read of all 7000 fail? OK, I lied... one more question... how would one go about "reading" all pages?</em>

        Ward put in a trap to prevent robots who ignore the robots.txt file from downloading the whole site (and thus causing a denial of service). After frequent enough hits, Wiki will tell the robot to "smeg off" essentially.
