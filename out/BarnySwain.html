      <p>
        Barny is a software engineer, working in the .NET realm, and is more of a pragmatist than a purist.  Life is too short to re-compile your OS kernel to make it work with the latest hardware, especially when somebody has already done it (albeit badly).

        He likes <a href="AntiPatterns.html">AntiPatterns</a> but dislikes Patterns because people use them to design software as opposed to describing solutions and when they do describe solutions, they do it badly and then it is all greek to me.  Eventually, people will learn.
