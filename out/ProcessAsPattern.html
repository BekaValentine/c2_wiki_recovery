        It seems to me that if I am going to do some job more than twice, then  the <a href="RuleOfThree.html">RuleOfThree</a> applies.
      </p>
      <p>
        To do any non-trivial job, I must accomplish a set of tasks, so the job is a process.

        Can process be separated from methodology?
        What aspects of Shlaer-Mellor, Booch, OMT, or Fusion can be abstracted up to a higher level? - <a href="KentSchnaith.html">KentSchnaith</a>

        I believe that processes are rarely amenable to pattern
        form.  Empirical research has demonstrated that for
        effective construction of large, complex processes,
        repeatable processes are a myth.
        The few places where repeatable processes seem to work
        are in organizations with very high cost and low
        productivity, those these are sometimes necessary to
        achieve ultra-high safety or reliability.
      </p>
      <p>
        The patterns of most effective
        organizations lie not in process,
        but in structure.
        See Cain and Coplien, "A Role-Based Empirical Process
        Modeling Environment," Proceedings of ICSP/2, 125-133,
        February, 1993, IEEE Computer Press.
        We still sometimes call them <a href="ProcessPatterns.html">ProcessPatterns</a>,
        though they're not about process.

        Seems better to describe the reason why after the solution.
