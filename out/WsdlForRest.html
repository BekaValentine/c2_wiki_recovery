        Wsdl For Rest
      </h1>
      <p>
        I do not like SOAP, but Ithink WSDL is great.
      </p>
      <p>
        Shudder to think of complicated <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a> without WSDL.
      </p>
      <p>
        But, WSDL is not tied to SOAP.  What us Restians need is a standard WSDL implementaion for REST services.
      </p>
      <p>
        ... except that real RESTafarians don't need a service description language, only a forms language (e.g. HTML).
      </p>

        that is when one is making the naive assumption that the only consumer of a REST resource is a GUI. Embedding hyperlinks in the output is pointless to a naive client that has no contract that the resource will persist consistent interfaces, and thus has no idea what the embedded hyperlinks or forms mean. <br/>
