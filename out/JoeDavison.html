        I was a software developer at Lucent Technologies, Naperville, IL. until July, 2001, when I got caught in the great voluntary retirement program.  Now I'm happily retired, working on improving my drawing/painting skills, and looking into open source development.

        I worked with <a href="BobHanmer.html">BobHanmer</a> and <a href="JimCoplien.html">JimCoplien</a>, among others -- Cope got caught too,  but Bob might still be there!

        Before the great vrp, we were finally doing some <a href="BackwardLookingWork.html">BackwardLookingWork</a>, 
        mining Patterns from the systems we've built.  Probably don't have time for that these days.
