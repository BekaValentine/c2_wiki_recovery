        <strong>Computer Engineering</strong> is a cross between electrical engineering and <a href="ComputerScience.html">ComputerScience</a>. It typically focuses on computational hardware, with required knowledge in <a href="DigitalLogic.html">DigitalLogic</a> and <a href="BinaryArithmetic.html">BinaryArithmetic</a>, and is often combined with study in <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a>, including <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>s and <a href="ProgrammingLanguage.html">ProgrammingLanguage</a>s.

        <em>It should be noted that, in theory, electrical engineering isn't the only path to construct a digital computer.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a study of engineering computers, it has been recognized as a field for which Graduate Degree programs have been formed in many leading Universities and Colleges.
