        Does This Work

      <p>
        A suggested phrase to take the place of "<a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>" in the 1,345,721 places it occurs in test phrases in beginner's programs or new languages. It will probably result in more returned responses from expected contacts from terrestrials and extra-terrestrials. With <a href="HelloWorld.html">HelloWorld</a>, everyone will assume someone else will answer, with "<a href="DoesThisWork.html">DoesThisWork</a>" everyone will assume they are the only one receiving the message and will more likely than not, answer you.
