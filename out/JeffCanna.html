        I have worked for several different companies. The two primary ones were Wang Labs in Lowell Mass and IBM in Poughkeepsie, NY and Raleigh, NC.

        After meeting Ken Auer at triPLUG (triangle area pattern language user's group), I learned of extreme programming. I became very excited about the methodology and, after many discussions, joined his company. Since than I've been practicing, coaching and teaching extreme programming. I've used this methodology in many different environments and continue to be quite excited about it.
