        Wiki Nature

        <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> is typing in a bunch of book titles, coming back a day later, and finding them turned into birds in the Amazon.

        Writing on Wiki is like regular writing, except I get to write so much more than I write, and I get to think thoughts I never thought. (<em>...like being on a really good </em><a href="FreeSoftware.html">FreeSoftware</a> project, where you wake up the next morning to find your bugs fixed and ideas improved.<em>)</em>

        It reminds us of minimalist Japanese brushstroke drawings; you provide the few, elegant slashes of ink, and other minds fill in the rest.

        It befuddles and enlightens. :-D)))

        Really, it's not accurate to talk about a <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>; we would do better recognizing that Nature itself, is Wiki. <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> as <a href="UniversalMind.html">UniversalMind</a>.

        But what about those who have a hard time comprehending things that aren't flashy? Anyway, I like more stylistic elements, and I created. a <a href="WikiStyle.html">WikiStyle</a> that people are free to use. It doesn't take away anything from the minimalism, but it does make the pages easier to read. -- <a href="SeanPalmer.html">SeanPalmer</a>

        The following quote (received via an e-mail from <a href="CliffordAdams.html">CliffordAdams</a>) got me thinking about <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> again: "Then again, Wiki is largely defined by people who find it valuable enough to live with its imperfections."
      </p>
      <p>
        I was tempted to respond that Wiki is, in fact, valuable <em>because</em> of its imperfections. I think that there are essential "imperfections", such as limited formatting and no security, which increase the usefulness of Wiki. Also, the lack of an obvious differencing mechanism forces me to delve into the context of a Recent Change before firing off a response which, all in all, is also a good thing. However, before I hit "save" (luckily) I realized that there are also undesirable "imperfections", such as the lack of a way of ensuring the preservation of intent while refactoring (i.e. no unit tests), which decrease the value of Wiki. The underlying code of Wiki is freely available, and Wiki itself has an <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> flavor to it which implies that the imperfections would be self-healing; but the critical role of the content at this site (independent of the underlying application) changes the nature of the stewardship role that <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a> has.
      </p>
      <p>
        I keep coming again to the idea of <a href="PhysicalCuesInSoftwareDevelopment.html">PhysicalCuesInSoftwareDevelopment</a> and wondering if there aren't changes deeper than the typical <a href="WikiWikiSuggestions.html">WikiWikiSuggestions</a> which would make <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> more obvious (and natural?) to newcomers and old-timers alike. Also, how do we effectively try out these ideas when we need the applications <strong>and</strong> the participants to find out what really works. Any thoughts?

        It is reversed on the Wiki: Knowledgeable people do talk, and Talkative people do know.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Sometimes true, but often not.</em>
        <em>Wiki attracts a few of the relatively talkative among the knowledgeable,</em>
        <em>but still attracts some of the talkative among the unknowledgeable as well.</em>
        <em>But how</em>, I whine, <em>will I ever know if what I read on Wiki was written by a </em><a href="WiseMan.html">WiseMan</a> or a talkative fool? I know I can't trust everything I read in the papers, but is Wiki a paper?<em></em>

        Ah, but you see, those who only recently realized are still flush with the excitement of the moment of illumination. While they yet burn with excitement, they MUST speak, however joyously awkward a thing it is. Criticize it how you will, it is truly spontaneous, and while this endures is one with the Tao.
      </p>
      <p>
        Later, others now more calm come along and review these words. Those which do TOO MUCH violence to the TAO of the matter are allowed to remain, those which confuse, blind, mislead are gently and silently removed.

        Remember that the <strong>TRUE</strong> mysteries are incommunicable, AKA <strong>ineffable</strong>, aka you only come to understand them by <strong>DIRECT EXPERIENCE</strong>. This 'direct experience' of the nature of a matter is named <strong>GNOSIS</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Write. Post. Read. Edit. In the doing is found the true meaning of the wiki nature.
      </p>
      <p>
        And remember, the Tao is your everyday mind.

        This does raise the interesting point that those of us who weren't around to witness the history culminating in a <a href="MindWipe.html">MindWipe</a> are doomed to repeat it, because no evidence has been left. I have no idea what XYZ stuff led up to this, as the evidence has been so effectively erased, so I have only the word of people who appear to be engaging in mass deletions (with comments like 'delete XYZ junk' on pages that appeared innocent) that they're acting the best interest of the community. My ignorance notwithstanding, all seems to be relatively well once more, so I'll stop complaining now :-) -- <a href="DarrenHobbs.html">DarrenHobbs</a>

        I think this is a side-effect of the <a href="WikiNow.html">WikiNow</a> - we have a very effective <a href="MemoryHole.html">MemoryHole</a>. With regards to this particular incident - it lasted about eighteen months, and count yourself very lucky indeed that you missed it. Best, -- EarleMartin

      <p>
        That is indeed an interesting point, and one that goes to the heart of the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a>. Aside from the aberration of the escalated <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a> in unfortunately-recent memory, the general theory is that mistakes made by those who say that they're acting in the best interest of the community, but are not (accidentally or maliciously, either way), will eventually be repaired by the slow but inexorable force of lurking <a href="WikiGnome.html">WikiGnome</a>s, usually after <a href="LetHotPagesCool.html">LetHotPagesCool</a>, sometimes long after. And that this is the more important part of the <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> than the short term noise in <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>. It's like the <a href="InvisibleHand.html">InvisibleHand</a> theory of economics, perhaps. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a>
