        Table Driven Rad
      </h1>
      <p>
        I have long had a fascination with table-driven <a href="RapidApplicationDevelopment.html">RapidApplicationDevelopment</a> for typical <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>s. Almost everyone agrees that creating <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>s over and over again can get a bit tedious after a while. It would be grand if one could copy the RDBMS schema into a <a href="DataDictionary.html">DataDictionary</a>, tweak it a bit, and instantly get usable <a href="CrudScreen.html">CrudScreen</a>s with <a href="QueryByExample.html">QueryByExample</a> capabilities. However, the dream is a bit elusive because of the <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a>. Here are some suggestions and ideas for improving the process.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One approach to extending beyond the <a href="EightyTwentyRule.html">EightyTwentyRule</a> is code generation. The generated code can be tweaked as needed. But <a href="CodeGenerationIsaDesignSmell.html">CodeGenerationIsaDesignSmell</a>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Access to screens and fields can potentially turn into a hairy set of many-to-many tables. For easier entry, perhaps one can use letter codes which are then mapped to roles or some other custom determination mechanism. For example, have 2 columns called "noAccess" and "readOnly". If the user is designated a letter that appears in one of these columns, then they are restricted accordingly. Letters are sometimes considered by self-documentation, but they are easy to enter and see. Needless to say, this needs some thinking.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           A <a href="ConstantTable.html">ConstantTable</a> would be very useful.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Have a "fieldTypes" table to define the code for developer-defined column "types".
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Mappings to the DB schema are not always one-to-one. Event snippets may need a way to split and combine target column values.
        </li>
      </ul>
