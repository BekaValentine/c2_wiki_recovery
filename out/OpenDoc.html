      <p>
        <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a> was a multi-platform, document-centric component architecture developed initially by <a href="AppleComputer.html">AppleComputer</a> in the mid-1990s.
      </p>
      <p>
        Apple enlisted the help of various partners (including <a href="NovellCorporation.html">NovellCorporation</a> and <a href="IbmCorporation.html">IbmCorporation</a>) to develop versions for non-Apple platforms, including <a href="MicrosoftWindows.html">MicrosoftWindows</a> and OS/2. A consortium called ComponentIntegrationLaboratories (CILabs) was developed to manage the licensing and distribution of the free frameworks, with the eventual goal of releasing them in a Quasi-<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> way. <a href="SteveJobs.html">SteveJobs</a> killed the <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a> project soon after he retook the helm at Apple, and the rest of the consortium quickly dismantled.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a> had a strong document-centric model, with various PartEditors able to embed other components and to be embedded by others. Communication between the frameworks and components used InternationBusinessMachine's <a href="SystemObjectModel.html">SystemObjectModel</a> (SOM), an <a href="ObjectRequestBroker.html">ObjectRequestBroker</a> (ORB) compliant with the <a href="CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture.html">CommonObjectRequestBrokerArchitecture</a> (CORBA). A rich <a href="ApplicationProgrammingInterface.html">ApplicationProgrammingInterface</a> and scripting model would have produced amazingly interactive components, if the whole project hadn't collapsed under its own weight (and some definite hard-ball pressure from <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>, who saw <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a> competing with OLE/COM).
      </p>
      <p>
        Although <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a> did not live long enough to elicit a great number of products, a few notable gems were created for it. Apple's <a href="CyberDog.html">CyberDog</a> was probably the ultimate example, but DigitalHarbor's Wav (a <a href="WordProcessor.html">WordProcessor</a>), <a href="CordaTechnology.html">CordaTechnology</a>'s charting-tool, and <a href="ThetaGroup.html">ThetaGroup</a>'s dtF <a href="StructuredQueryLanguage.html">StructuredQueryLanguage</a> middleware were also exceptional. Surprisingly, all three of these companies survived their dependence on <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a> and refactored their products to live in a <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> world.

        <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a> is one of the lost technologies I lament most.  I love Cocoa and <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a>, and when working recently on a chart in the beautiful but simple <a href="OmniGraffle.html">OmniGraffle</a> diagramming tool, I realized I needed a nice little table to be part of my diagram.  And then did I suddenly miss what <a href="OpenDoc.html">OpenDoc</a> was about - letting a simple but beautiful diagramming tool like <a href="OmniGraffle.html">OmniGraffle</a> be a simple but beautiful diagramming tool, and letting some spreadsheet or simple database component be just that, letting me use live data in my document.  Or at the very least, giving me a full featured table editor instead of requiring the brave boys at Omni group write one themselves just to satisfy my request.
      </p>
      <p>
        Take a look at [<a href="http://www.linkbackproject.org].">http://www.linkbackproject.org].</a> <a href="OmniGraffle.html">OmniGraffle</a> as well as other MacOSX apps will soon provide that kind of functionality. --aramallo

      <p>
        OLE and Windows still allow this, but the field remains dominated by using enormous apps (like Office) and occasional smaller components that plug in.  le sigh. --jps

        There was a link not so long ago at one of the mac sites, something like "ghost of opendoc lives on in OS X". [<a href="http://www.macslash.com/articles/01/10/17/028258.shtml]">http://www.macslash.com/articles/01/10/17/028258.shtml]</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        The idea was that via the "services" menu in OS X apps, it is not so important which app we a re using, it is the documents and services that count.
      </p>

      <p>
        Services were a great feature in the <a href="NextStep.html">NextStep</a> world, but there seem to be less service offering application in <a href="MacOsx.html">MacOsx</a> (at present).  Services will be great when Carbon apps can at least make use of them (the menu shows up in Carbon apps in 10.1, but doesn't do anything).
      </p>
      <p>
        But nice as Services are, they still don't give me the option of having a little table in my diagram that's serviced by some Tabular component.  Even System 7's Publish and Subscribe feature would have been nice.  Oh well.
