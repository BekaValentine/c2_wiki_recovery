        Simple Enough
      </h1>
      <p>
        According to Beck, code is simple enough when:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It runs the tests;
        </li>
        <li>
           It expresses every intention you need to express;
        </li>
        <li>
           There is no duplicated code;
        </li>
        <li>
           There are minimal classes and methods.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Extension to procedural code unknown.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would have thought it would be straightforward. The only part of the list requiring "extension" is the fourth item, and that would depend on what you consider "minimal" as well as what you consider "classes". If you used "components" instead of "classes", it doesn't need translation at all. -- </em><a href="AlastairBridgewater.html">AlastairBridgewater</a><em></em>
