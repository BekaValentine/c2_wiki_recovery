        <a href="HotSwap.html">HotSwap</a> Hardware is hardware where one doesn't need to "down" the machine to service components.  A pretty typical example of some <a href="HotSwap.html">HotSwap</a> parts is the humble hot swap disk.  All one needs to do is yank it when they want to replace it (make sure your system is backed up and that the raid has been re-silvered, please.)

        <em>When is Intel going to get </em><a href="HotSwap.html">HotSwap</a> memory and <a href="HotSwap.html">HotSwap</a> CPUs?<em></em>

        Allegedly, IBM had hot-swappable memory and CPUs for their System/370 and subsequent architectures.  I remember reading some material on this in the past, but I can no longer find relevant sources.  However, a quick Google search for "hot-swappable CPU" yields a plethora of servers, some of them even based on x86 architecture, though mostly mainframes, which exhibit <a href="HotSwap.html">HotSwap</a> processors.

        In software, the <a href="HotSwap.html">HotSwap</a> feature enables you to deploy a new or changed version of the software without restarting the process or program.
