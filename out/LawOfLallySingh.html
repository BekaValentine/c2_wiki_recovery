        Systems that start out optional and become popular often become required as alternatives bite the dust. It's just a fact of life. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Examples:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           WalMart
        </li>
        <li>
           CreditCards <em>Just try renting a car or even getting a video rental card at some places without one.  Even a debit card won't help sometimes.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
              working spouses
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Does anyone here know where did the term originated?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Google doesn't give any obvious hits; but there appears to be a Lally Singh working at Apple...
