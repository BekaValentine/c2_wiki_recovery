        Deadly Sins
      </h1>
      <p>
        No, not the <a href="SevenDeadlySins.html">SevenDeadlySins</a> from Christian theology.  These <a href="DeadlySins.html">DeadlySins</a> are taken from the book 
        <em></em>WritingInteractiveCompilersAndInterpreters<em>, Wiley 1979. by  P. J. Brown  (now out of print).</em>
        (This content grabbed from <a href="NormanRamsey.html">NormanRamsey</a>s web page--but since it originally came from a different source, I hope he doesn't mind it being replicated here on Wiki, where they can be discussed).

      <p>
        Some of these sins are rather specific to the task of writing compilers; but others (sins 1, 3, 5, 6, 8, 9, and 12) are generic to programming; and still others (2, 11, 13) can be made so by replacing the word "compiler" with "program".
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The first deadly sin is to code before you think.

        <li>
           The eighth deadly sin is to use numbers for objects that are not numbers.
