        Happy Thoughts

      <p>
        I'm a little frustrated with some code that I have to fix. There are no <a href="UnitTest.html">UnitTest</a>s and no <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s. Nobody even knows how the App was supposed to work in the first place. The code probably never worked right at all. The previous developer obviously did not understand that <a href="CopyAndPasteIsNotaDesignPattern.html">CopyAndPasteIsNotaDesignPattern</a>. If I could just find the previous developer and... Arghhh...

        Quick, get to your HappyPlace.

        Ahhhh.... much better.

      <p>
        Now, I can get back to doing useful, productive work.

        I don't know about you, but I feel much better. Cheers, --<a href="JasonNocks.html">JasonNocks</a>
