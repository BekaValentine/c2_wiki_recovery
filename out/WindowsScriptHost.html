        Windows Script Host
      </h1>
      <p>
        Windows Script Host (WSH) is a Windows administration tool.
      </p>
      <p>
        WSH creates an environment for hosting scripts. Given a script in one of the supported languages, it makes objects and services available for the script and provides a set of guidelines within which the script is executed. Among other things, Windows Script Host manages security and invokes the appropriate script engine.
      </p>
      <p>
        WSH is language-independent for WSH-compliant scripting engines. It brings simple, powerful, and flexible scripting to the Windows platform, allowing you to run scripts from both the Windows desktop and the command prompt.
      </p>
      <p>
        Windows Script Host is ideal for noninteractive scripting needs, such as logon scripting, administrative scripting, and machine automation.
