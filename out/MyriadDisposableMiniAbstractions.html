        Myriad Disposable Mini Abstractions
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm trying to find a more general way to describe why <a href="HelpersInsteadOfWrappers.html">HelpersInsteadOfWrappers</a> works fairly well in certain unpredictable and chaotic domains, and thus the topic MyraidDisposibleMiniAbstractions. Here's more detail on each feature:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Myraid - A library of lots of little tools or toolettes.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Disposible - You date them, not marry them. Using any one toolette is not a make-or-break decision and you can swap it with something else (or fix it) without too much fuss or muss.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Mini - No toolette is too big as a rule of thumb. If it's too big, then split it up. It may take practice to find good splitting seams, which is finding practical sub-concepts within concepts. <a href="StepwiseRefinement.html">StepwiseRefinement</a> is one, but not the only approach.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Abstractions - They simplify or automate common or repeating tasks
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Generally the library grows organically based on actual needs.  It may not even be a formal library, but rather a bunch of routines, modules, or classes that are working in existing apps. Perhaps a catalog database or spreadsheet can track their function and whereabouts.
      </p>
      <p>
        The linkage between them is generally via convention instead of formal gateways. I find dynamic languages friendlier to this idea, but your mileage and preferences may vary.
