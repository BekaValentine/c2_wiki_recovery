        Hallowed Procedures
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="PeterDrucker.html">PeterDrucker</a>, in <a href="ManagementChallengesForTheTwentyFirstCentury.html">ManagementChallengesForTheTwentyFirstCentury</a> said the following in reference to process optimization: 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           "A great many of the traditionally most hallowed procedures turn out to be waste and do not add anything."
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Examples? What particular procedures, and failing to add what to what? Sounds too much like a PeculiarNotion, or an excuse to me. Since when and by whom is process optimization among the most "HallowedProcecures"?
