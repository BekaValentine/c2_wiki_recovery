        Montreal Xp Calculator
      </h1>
      <p>
        The goal of this was to create a <em>simple</em> command-line calculator <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a>. We ended up getting a bonus dose of <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="IainLowe.html">IainLowe</a> wrote some <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> cards to create a calculator. <a href="VincentTence.html">VincentTence</a>, Pascal Roy and <a href="YoucefBouayad.html">YoucefBouayad</a> brought in their laptops so we could write real code. Rodrigue Cloutier, <a href="IainLowe.html">IainLowe</a> and JeanMarcHeneman acted as customers on site and sometimes as coaches.

        <strong>Stories:</strong> <em>Any "support" stories imply that the support is backported to previously completed stories</em>

        We were almost 15 people.  We created three groups of 3 to 5 people with one laptop for each team. Three clients work with the 3 teams to just do some XP style development.
      </p>
      <p>
        Each team estimated the stories briefly (15-20 minutes) and was then asked to implement a list of stories in order. We dispensed with the notion of iterations because we didn't have a lot of time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The teams were able to implement in <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> one or two <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> cards in 1 hour and a 15 minutes: Add and Sub with a command line interface. Some teams decided (or were asked by the client) to read input from files, others from keyboard.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was very interesting to see the different questions each team asked during the planning phase. Each had different concerns and plans for how to deal with issues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Acceptance tests were done manually by the customers.
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a highly interactive session !
