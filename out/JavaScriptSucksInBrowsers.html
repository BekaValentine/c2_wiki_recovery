        Java Script Sucks In Browsers
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> never ceases to disappoint. Although it was launched with great expectations and has found reasonable penetration, both <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> authors and their (sometimes unwilling) users find something to dislike about most every deployment. This is most certainly due to either the clash of titans that surrounded its birth or the wallowing of low-lifes that turn everything into spam. This page contains mostly bickering about the extent of this tragedy. A future refactoring will draw some lessons from the experience and maybe even point toward alternate futures. -- <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>

        <strong>The worst sin</strong>: Because <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> emulated Java and went with <strong>&&</strong> for <em>and</em>, and because web browsers _must_ forgive sloppy editing in Notepad, XHTML is now a dead letter, and HTML<em>n</em> will always be a broken format impersonating true XML. Permitting new <script> blocks to contain &amp;&amp; for && would break all the legacy code using <em>document.write('&')</em> instead of <em>document.write('&amp;amp;')</em>.

Its automatic type conversion is the worst idea ever. There are still browser differences that break scripts, especially between IE and the rest. There are even <em>rendering</em> differences that you can only detect by MANUAL testing, that are capable of completely ruining a Web app. There are performance differences between browsers that are so big, that there are amazing applications you can write on some browsers that are completely impossible to implement with reasonable performance on others.<em></em></dd>

However, it is not the primary cause. What is needed to stop web GUI development from sucking in my opinion is not a written behavior standard, but a C-based "gui browser" implementation at the pixel level and that ignores most OS-specific conventions. Only then will it have enough consistency and stability to be useful for GUIs-over-HTTP. This will piss off Apple and MS, but so be it. Let 'em cry. --top<em></em>

        Cons
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The lack of capacity to write easily larger applications.
        </li>
        <li>
           Serious inconsistencies in implementations and environments.
        </li>
        <li>
           Historical problems with security and privacy issues in its customary role as a client-side web scripting language. These problems induce a significant number of thoughtful people to turn <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> support off in their <a href="WebBrowser.html">WebBrowser</a>.

      <p>
        Arguments against Javascript in web browsers:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Interpreting a language in a Web browser is a bad idea. Why?
          <ul>
            <li>
               Increases code size of browser: requires more resources to run, provides more opportunities for bugs. Poor design results in security problems: cross-site scripting exploits, automatic execution of code in HTML mail, etc. However, it's here already and in all popular browsers, so that's not a reason not to use it.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Javascript provides non-programmers with an easy way to put code they don't understand into their pages. This encourages the spread of pretty but useless widgets.
        </li>
        <li>
           Another vector for malicious code, as well
        </li>
        <li>
           Encourages newbies to add spiffy rollovers and rollouts to buttons instead of having straight-up HTML links. Just like image maps, this make navigation durn near impossible for older browsers, handicapped visitors, and people who shut off Javascrapped and images to get some speed out of their 26K dialup connections.

        And why do Web designers use <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>? Because they have to!

      <p>
        <em>Basic </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>/JScript has never failed me. It was never meant to be a real programming language; rather, it was meant to be a very stripped-down, procedural language for simple Web programming. When used for that, it seems to do its job quite well. Now it's expected to perform DHTML and that's where it begins to fail.<em> How does it allegedly begin to fail?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps "basic <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>" "never failed" the previous contributor because it did so little. I suggest that it "begins to fail" long before any problems with performing DHTML. The unwillingness of Microsoft to provide any real support for developing and debugging "JScript" (their name) under IE, while Netscape continues to add Netscape-specific bells and whistles, has much much more to do with why <a href="JavaScriptSucksInBrowsers.html">JavaScriptSucksInBrowsers</a>. <a href="JavaScriptSucksInBrowsers.html">JavaScriptSucksInBrowsers</a> because it operates differently on each version of each browser on each platform and because it is virtually impossible to rigorously exercise and test - never mind debug - even the most trivial <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> program. Perhaps a defender can suggest even <em>one</em> tool that will, for example, copy the results of "document.write()" to a log where they can be examined by testing tools. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Not that I really see why you would want to, but here you go:</em>
      </p>
      <code>
        document.oldWrite = document.write;<br/>
        document.write = function (s) {<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        /* copy s to a log */<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        document.oldWrite(s);<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Not to nitpick, but the above code fragment skips the stupid part. What <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> should replace the "/* copy s to a log */"? Don't forget this is <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> running in a browser on the client, so no files are allowed (at least directly).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> doesn't have to run in a browser on a client. The limitation on modifying the client's file system doesn't come from <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, but from the browser. You'll have the same problem no matter what language you use there.<em></em>

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>The rest of this page is filled with the browser versus language argument, I don't want to repeat it here. It is instructive, though, to provide a simple code example, as we have here, to demonstrate the behavior in question. It <em>is</em> possible to write a browser plugin, used by a debugger, that bypasses the normal security mechanisms and allows a file to be written directly on the client. It <em>is</em> possible to write extensions to <a href="VenkmanDebugger.html">VenkmanDebugger</a> or some other tool that use such a plugin. It <em>is</em> possible to write tools that let me identify and change the code that is busted. Such tools exist for Smalltalk, Java, and surely others, and the corresponding support for <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is virtually non-existent. Hence my complaint. </dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        It looks to me like you have to open a plaintext document, write to it, then copy/cut/paste text from that ... something like:
      </p>
      <code>
        <SCRIPT><br/>
        var logger = null;<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        function log_write(aString) {<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        if ((logger == null) || (logger.closed)) {<br/>
        logger = window.open("","log","width=640,height=480,resizable");<br/>
        logger.document.open("text/plain");<br/>
        }<br/>
        logger.document.write(aString);<br/>
        }<br/>
        </SCRIPT><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Now, document.write looks something like this (though none of this is exercised):
      </p>
      <code>
        document.write = function (s) {<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        log_write(s);<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        document.oldWrite(s);<br/>
        };<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        All this, (don't forget the cut-and-paste hack that has to follow) just to be able to see what actually gets sent to the document!
      </p>
      <p>
        This example illustrates that <a href="JavaScriptSucksInBrowsers.html">JavaScriptSucksInBrowsers</a> because there is <strong>no</strong> support from any vendor. Even the Mozilla tools, which come closest, are woefully buggy and unreliable in comparison to any of the current commercial language environments. Embracing <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> means, for me, either developing my own tools or exposing my customers to sloppy, untested, and unoptimized code.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> doesn't suck. <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> support in popular browsers sucks. There's an important difference. If you use <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> outside the browser all of the criticisms of it go away.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Why on <strong>earth</strong> would I or anyone else use <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> outside of a browser? Do you use <a href="EmacsLisp.html">EmacsLisp</a> outside of Emacs?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The same reasons one would use any scripting language outside a browser. If Perl had lousy browser support, would that mean Perl sucked?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        To the extent that <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> ever had a purpose, it was to run in a browser "to do simple web programming".
      </p>
      <p>
        If Perl were as spectacularly bad at fulfilling its design purpose as <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>, yes that would mean that Perl sucked. If, for example, Perl behaved completely and unpredictably different on each platform that claimed to support it, it would suck. If Komodo 2.0, ActiveState, CPAN, or none of the myriad of Perl user groups didn't exist, it would suck. If each platform announced its own utterly incompatible "extensions" to Perl, it would suck.
      </p>
      <p>
        Are you saying that you use <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> outside a browser, and that you feel it is a better language in that context than Java, C++, C, Smalltalk, Lisp, Perl, Python, etc? If so - whatever floats your boat.
      </p>
      <p>
        Oh, and by the way, I <strong>do</strong> use the Emacs scripting language outside of Emacs - it's called Lisp (well, actually <a href="MockLisp.html">MockLisp</a>, but who's counting).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> isn't bad at fulfilling its design purpose. Multiple variant implementations and <a href="DocumentObjectModel.html">DocumentObjectModel</a> definitions are the problem, not <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> itself. I've used <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> outside a browser. I wouldn't claim it is better than any of those languages, but it doesn't suck. It's a powerful <a href="ScriptingLanguage.html">ScriptingLanguage</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        So let's see if this horse is dead yet. Suppose that the basic C libraries (things like stdio) worked differently on every platform and well on none. Suppose that every C compiler was buggy, crashed unpredictably, and generated code that sometimes worked and sometimes didn't. Suppose that there were no C debuggers, no user groups, and no vendors providing C compilers, libraries, and tools.
      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose one might claim, given all that, that the "language" didn't suck - after all, it would still be C (for better or worse). I think that the overwhelming majority of developers and users would find your distinction worse than useless.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why don't we try by examining the <a href="JavaScriptDesignPurpose.html">JavaScriptDesignPurpose</a>. Let's see if we can reach agreement on that. Then let's re-examine the question of how successfully the language has accomplished it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your analogy doesn't work. There are </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> interpreters that aren't buggy, don't crash and follow the <a href="EcmaScript.html">EcmaScript</a> standard. You're thinking only of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> in the browser. I have no idea what the design purpose of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> was.

      </p>

        Here is an excerpt from the ECMAScript standard:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>ECMAScript was originally designed to be a Web scripting language, providing a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        The overwhelming majority of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> programs run in browsers. I've cited the design purpose of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. Someone (I don't know if it was you) agreed earlier that "<a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> support in popular browsers sucks."
      </p>
      <p>
        You seem to be arguing that you've had a better experience outside a browser - you've said it is "powerful, useful and easy to work with".
      </p>
      <p>
        I stand by my claim that if I want "a mechanism to enliven Web pages in browsers and to perform server computation as part of a Web-based client-server architecture" that <a href="JavaScriptSucksInBrowsers.html">JavaScriptSucksInBrowsers</a> and that a several superior alternatives now exist. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a>

        <em>I'm arguing that the problems folks have with </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> aren't caused by the language but by variant implementations and DOM issues (which has nothing to do with <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> at all). The purpose of <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is as relevant to its suckage as the purpose of C.

      </p>
      <p>
        I suppose we'll have to agree to disagree.

Further, I suggest that when used outside of popular browsers, <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> suffers in comparison to virtually every other choice (save perhaps <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>).

Poor design results in security problems: cross-site scripting exploits, automatic execution of code in HTML mail, etc. However, it's here already and in all popular browsers, so that's not a reason not to <em>use</em> it.

        Limited and flakey, you can never depend on the execution environment being fully functional, the duelling implementations (<a href="ExplorerVsNetscape.html">ExplorerVsNetscape</a>) held back client side scripting for years, and given the installed base most likely will for quite a few years to come.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the other hand, there are times when not much else will do.
      </p>
      <p>
        TIP: Plan on doing two versions at least, test it on both of the 4.0 browsers, and if one doesn't work, wrap your page in a server side agent detection script and write two versions, it'll take less time than writing one that will work on both targets. <em>This is a sound use for </em><a href="PhpLanguage.html">PhpLanguage</a>.<em> Or any other server-side language.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This has nothing to do with </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a>. The fact that the environments where <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> is housed are shoddy should not be allowed to reflect badly on the language itself.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, there's the language design, and then there's the language environment. Both have an effect on how much work you have to do. Sun, for example, owns Java and can create a specification for the Java Virtual Machines - meaning that if you write standards-based Java, you can be sure that someone else with a JVM (of the right version) will be able to run. (In some ways, it seems like Sun's grip on Java is too tight for its own good, but that's another kettle of fish entirely.) <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> had no such standardization, and so suffers from these sorts of wide-spread deployment problems. The effectiveness of a language depends on more than just its syntax.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another issue is that this is generally a problem when you send code directly to the client for interpretation. End-users don't know that much about which interpreter is running in their browser - and really, why should they care? In the case of, say, a non-standard C++ compile instruction, you can at least put up a FAQ somewhere and explaining which compilers support what, and some programmers might go to the trouble of changing their environment. But try detecting the end-user's browser, then putting up a window saying "You're running the wrong sort of browser; please change to Mozilla" - you probably wouldn't get very far.

        Yes, a big problem with writing <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> for the browser is the inconsistencies of its implementation across the various browsers.

        <em>I think part of the problem is that HTML browsers (with </em><a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> and DOM) are optimized for "e-brochures" in both implementation and protocol design.

        There is still too much focus on shoddy <a href="JavaScript.html">JavaScript</a> code. Written right, it can save numerous form posts until the form has validated ok, it doesn't need to check on every form entry field, it can be written in a manner that could be considered 'GoodProgrammingStyle', and it can be designed to be optional, so that it is also validated on the server, allowing non js enabled browsers to still use it.

      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
