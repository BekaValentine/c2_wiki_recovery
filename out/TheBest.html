        The Best
      </h1>
      <p>
        A product (result, accomplishment, service, technology, whatever) that is great, or better than <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>, that completely fills the stated goal. It's the thing you know there must be there when you find and settle with something <a href="GoodEnough.html">GoodEnough</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sometimes (rather few then a lot) you stumble upon something <a href="TheBest.html">TheBest</a>, and you learn you were so close but decided not to spend more on searching something better.
