        <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> is one of the principles of the Wiki. Once you say something, once you state your position, you don't have to state it again and again; you can just link to where you said it the first time. Even better, if someone else has said what you would say, you can just link to that. -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a> (from <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnceIsNotJustForCode.html">OnceAndOnlyOnceIsNotJustForCode</a>)

        <em>There sure seems to be a lot of </em><a href="WikiOnWiki.html">WikiOnWiki</a> lately and rambling discourse. For me this is just as annoying as the Christianity pages. It seems like we are rehashing pages created long ago like <a href="WikiConversation.html">WikiConversation</a> or <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>. Maybe a little more <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> is in order.<em></em>

        <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnceOnWiki.html">OnceAndOnlyOnceOnWiki</a> Haven't I seen that suggestion somewhere before?

        Wiki lacks the HTML equivalent of "#". To truly factor concepts to a single topic requires a finer granularity than offered by page-per-topic. I have tried to break repetition up into individual topics, but some people did not like lots of small topics.

        <em>See </em><a href="PageAnchor.html">PageAnchor</a> for a crude suggestion along the lines of "#".<em></em>
