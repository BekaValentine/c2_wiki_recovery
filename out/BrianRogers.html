           [2003 July 29] Hey Brian, this is <a href="EricHerman.html">EricHerman</a>, you should put a link to the game that you developed in school on this page. Also, a friend of mine (<a href="BrettNeumeier.html">BrettNeumeier</a>) is looking for a name for a little <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a> project that he's working on: it's a filter that takes data from StandardIn and compresses and encrypts it and passes it to StandardOut. (He plans to add it as a filter to tar, but I suppose it could be of use in other scenarios.) Anyway, you're good with pop-culture, so I thought you'd be a good person to set to thinking about what would make a good name for the teeny utility. Cheers.

        I graduated from the <a href="UniversityOfWashington.html">UniversityOfWashington</a> in 2003 with a degree in <a href="ComputerEngineering.html">ComputerEngineering</a>.

        I am living in the <a href="SeattleWashington.html">SeattleWashington</a> area. Currently, I work for <a href="MicroSoft.html">MicroSoft</a>.

        In the past, I have had internships with WeyerHaeuser and <a href="ProductSight.html">ProductSight</a>.  Interestingly enough, Weyerhaeuser was where I first heard a formal description of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>.  And Product Sight was the first place [and only place, so far] I actually participated in it.

        I believe in using a variety of languages, each for a given purpose.  I've been getting into the <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a> lately (see: employer).  C# seems good for Win32 stuff, but the <a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is still the best for friendly portable code.  Although I don't use it much in practice, I still do a little <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> (or even <a href="CeeLanguage.html">CeeLanguage</a>!) for "fun."

        I happen to love the <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>.  It's not for everyone, of course (<a href="WhyHatePerl.html">WhyHatePerl</a>). In my last job, I was known as the resident PerlHacker.  If you ever need to rename 250 files or extract comments out of a series of source files ....
