        Ats User Stories

        Part of <a href="AtsGoesExtreme.html">AtsGoesExtreme</a> and the <a href="AtsDiary.html">AtsDiary</a>.

      <p>
        ATS <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> tend to be small and fairly focused.  Some of them are achievable in a matter of (ideal) hours.  This seems to be in contrast to the <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> recommendations; perhaps it's because we're in the final iteration of the project and people want minor enhancements and bug fixes rather than big features.  Perhaps its because most of the ATS infrastructure is already in place and we can reuse a lot of code as we implement the stories.  On the other hand, perhaps it's because I, not the users, wrote most of the stories.
      </p>
      <p>
        I wrote the stories because I want to make sure that all of the original plans for this iteration are represented.  That way, if the users decide not to include something that was in the original schedule, it's their decision, not mine.  But the users, for the most part, aren't asking for features that were in the original plan.  Perhaps this is because they're not aware of them, or perhaps it's because they don't need them and the original planning process was flawed.  Regardless, I've made stories for all of the original features, and the users will be able to decide which ones are important in the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Overall, I feel like the user stories have really given the users confidence in the project and a strong sense of buy-in.  I'm handing them small, easily digestible stories on index cards, not a 70 page requirements document.  I'm asking them what <em>they</em> want, not telling them to sign off on what I've proscribed.  And I'm listening to what they say, not telling them "Oh, that probably won't make it in."
      </p>
      <p>
        In turn, the user stories have given me a sense of relief.  Now I don't have to fight every feature request with the user.  Now, even though I know there's too many stories to be implemented in the time available, I know I won't have to be the bearer of bad news.  Now, I don't have to act as an intermediary between several groups' conflicting needs.  I'll get them all into a room, Jared will tell them how much time is available, and I'll tell them how much time each story will take.  When features are cut, it will be because <em>they</em> made the decision, not me.  When difficult compromises are made, <em>they</em> will be compromising with each other, not seeing me as the bearer of bad news.
      </p>
      <p>
        My biggest fear is that I'll misplace some of these cards.  I'm not being facetious here; that really is my biggest concern.  I love the cards' portability, but I tend to be a bit absent-minded, and I could easily drop an important card or two on the floor and never even notice, except for a vague feeling of "wasn't there something else we were supposed to do?"  On the other hand, I definitely don't want to have to constantly type these things into a database.  (But I should eat my words on that one -- see below.)
      </p>

      <p>
        The ATS <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a> are written down on a standard 3x5 index cards, ruled on one side, blank on the other.  We only write on the ruled side, with a few exceptions.  At the top center of the card, above the rules, is the word "USER STORY" in block letters.  In the upper right is an arbitrary ID number.  We keep track of the last number in the sequence on a post-it note in my office.  In the lower left is "Source: " and the name of the person who originated the story, so we can go back to him if we have questions.
      </p>
      <p>
        On the back of the card, in the upper left corner, is "RISK:" and "L", "M", or "H," for low, medium, and high.  We determined the risk as described in the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>, although we did it on our own, before the planning meeting, not with the users present.  In the lower left corner is "Cost:" followed by the cost of the story in ideal hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I was researching <a href="UserStories.html">UserStories</a>, I was disappointed by the lack of examples.  Therefore, for your edification and enjoyment, and as a poor archive in case I lose any, here are the stories we developed... in absolutely no order.  (Well, actually, the order I picked them up off of my desk.)  I've taken names off of the "source" line unless it was one of the developers.  Many of the stories that weren't sourced by me were nevertheless written down by me, or had small items added by me later.  As a result, even those stories that were sourced by users could sound similar to the ones I sourced.
      </p>
      <p>
        At this time, we're still determining cost.  Those cards that don't mention cost haven't been estimated yet.
