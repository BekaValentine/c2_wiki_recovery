        Freedom From Want
      </h1>
      <p>
        One of FDR's <a href="FourFreedoms.html">FourFreedoms</a>: <em>Freedom from want, which, translated into world terms, means economic understandings which will secure to every nation a healthy peacetime life for its inhabitants - everywhere in the world.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't have a problem with the other three, but I don't buy this one. The other three are "negative" freedoms, in that guaranteeing them merely involves <em>preventing</em> other people from acting to damage those freedoms. Guaranteeing "freedom from want", however, involves <em>compelling</em> other people to do something; specifically, giving up their property, to be taken away from them and given to someone else. Besides which, it's a slippery slope. Who decides when people are "free from want"?

        (interjection: When everyone is above the already defined 'standard of living' which is the threshold of poverty. This has already been studied at length by professionals and defined, I am not going to do so here. But continue, this is a good line of reasoning. -- <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a>)

        Taking Peter's property to feed Paul is <em>one</em> way to eliminate want. Is it the only way?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Well, I can't think of any other way that doesn't involve coercion. Can you?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, you just prevent Peter from exploiting Paul.
      </p>
      <p>
        (OR, teach Paul to feed Paul. A small investment to be sure, compared to the effects. Insuring all are WELL educated in general AND with a REAL trade is one of the best investments anyone can make in society - or themselves. And yes, I mean spend the money on OTHERS, not one's own education. -- <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Who steps up to define what is exploitation and when Peter starts (or stops) exploiting Paul?</em> That's just a detail. The point is, it doesn't involve coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Well, here's a test. If Peter does not pony up the sheckels to pay for paul's benefit, does something happen to Peter, or to Peter's property? If so, it's coercion. -- <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I'd say it's more than just a detail. You're implying that this "exploitation" of which you speak is the sole reason that there are poor people in the world, and I don't believe that for one cotton-pickin' minute (perhaps not the best choice of phrase for this context, I know. ;-)</em> -- <a href="MikeSmith.html">MikeSmith</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Exploitation doesn't create poverty (by itself). Exploitation often leverages it, true - but that is not the same thing. 
        (Exploitation can push people near the threshold into poverty when the exploitation begins, then a new 'steady state' prevails, at a different sverall [?] social strata distribution of the population. -- <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        The problem lies in the imbalance of power in an exploitative relationship. The powerful party often has it in *their* best interests to continue (or in fact deepen) the poverty of the powerless party.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you be more specific? How exactly do wealthy people exploit poor people? Why is it in the best interest of a wealthy person to exploit a poor person? I am not very wealthy by any means, but I have some wealth, and I don't go around figuring out ways to exploit people who are less wealthy than I.</em>

        What do you think? Suppose there was a global <a href="MinimumWage.html">MinimumWage</a>. What kind of difference do you think that would make?
      </p>
      <p>
        (One for the worse. Jobs would vanish. Sure, it's GREAT if you have a job. Or so it would seem. But many workers sweeping stairs and parking lots would be out of work. And Employers would seek ways to engineer positions out of existence to avoid the unprofitable expense. -- <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Absolutely none. You can't have a global </em><a href="MinimumWage.html">MinimumWage</a>. Different countries have different costs of living. (Also true. -- Kirk) What is a reasonable wage here in Canada is considered rich in Haiti and poor in Silicon Valley. Governmental (or economic) centralization does not solve the problem. The only solution is education. All peoples must be educated (or have access to education). This allows people to think for themselves and obviates the need for others to get involved.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        (Did anyone notice how the internet, and wiki's are a PROFOUND force to accomplish exactly that, and the resultant social change? Just checking... -- Kirk)
      </p>
      <p>
        "You can't have a global <a href="MinimumWage.html">MinimumWage</a>." - well, you're entitled to your opinion. 
        (and I am entitled to agree with it, and the reasons for it. -- Kirk)
        It wouldn't be very difficult to implement. The world would start small, say, $1USD per day per person. This would represent about a 50% salary increase for the poorest workers in CentralAmerica, but would have no effect whatsoever on Silicon Valley. Since it is the people in Silicon Valley that are paying $4.50 for a latte that comes from the Central American coffee pickers, there would be a negligible standard-of-living impact on the Silicon Valley people, but a rather large improvement in the standard of living of the Central American.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That argument does not make sense. If the wage for a Central American coffee picker is $0.50/day and the worker is worth $0.50/day then raising the minimum wage of the worker to $1/day will put the worker out of work, since the employer will not pay a worker more than he is worth. So the worker's pay will go from $0.50/day to $0/day. He'll be out of work, and the Silicon Valley latte drinker won't get his coffee. How is that a good thing?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        HOW DO YOU KNOW WHAT THE WORKER IS WORTH? -- Kirk
        (could it be 'market forces'? But price fixing (which is what wage controls are) obliviates that feedback mechanism. -- Kirk)
      </p>
      <p>
        Business doesn't work that way. Costs of doing business are passed on to the customer so instead of the coffee pickers being out of work and the Silicon Valley people not getting their lattes, the Silicon Valley people will pay more like $8 for their latte. Currently, the lack of standard of living of the coffee pickers is subsidizing the coffee price of the Silicon Valley worker's latte. How is that a good thing?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This argument ignores elasticity of demand. If the Silicon Valley people have the price of their coffee roughly double, with no increase in their income to offset it, they will drink less coffee. That equals less demand for coffee beans, and thus, those who pick them. So you end up with some coffee pickers that previously earned $.50 now earning $1, and others who previously earned $.50 now earning $0. So you've made the lives of a few pickers better while making the lives of the other pickers, and all Silicon Valley coffee drinkers worse. Congratulations.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           except that demand for coffee isn't perfectly elastic... but then you knew that before you posted your sarcastic comment, didn't you?
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>In what way is "perfect elasticity" relevant to what I said? I never specified what percentage of pickers would lose their job if the wage was doubled, only that some would. If the cost of coffee beans affects demand for those beans, which it does, my conclusion stands - raising the wage would benefit some pickers while hurting others, and also hurting all coffee drinkers.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There is a whole line of people, starting with the pickers going up through farm owners, shippers, packers, roasters, brewers and ultimately drinkers. Why not skim a little off all those middleguys and the ultimate end-user to make those that are least well off do a little better? The idea is to help people resist their natural impulses to take merciless advantage of deperation in others.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Are you just not paying attention? </em>'Because, at best, it only helps some of those "least well-off". The others become worse off, because they no longer have jobs.<em>' Why do you want to take jobs from poor people?</em>

        "Taking Peter's property to feed Paul" - the trouble with this notion is that <strong>society is not a zero sum game</strong>. If Paul is fed and educated, and if he has the opportunity, he can generate objects of value to Peter, with the result that society as a whole obtains more opportunities. This is the essence of copulism, and the logic behind ideas like <a href="SchoolsForCivilization.html">SchoolsForCivilization</a> and the <a href="WikiWikiWeb.html">WikiWikiWeb</a> itself. An economic system is completely useless if it doesn't enable people to work together for their mutual benefit. This realization became obvious during the <a href="GreatDepression.html">GreatDepression</a>, and formed the foundation of FDR's NewDeal.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Leaving aside the supposed economic benefits of the </em>NewDeal, isn't it counterproductive to coerce people into doing good deeds?<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Um, let me see: do you enjoy the benefits of living in a state? That is to say, do you enjoy its military and police protection, its system of laws, and its provision of road, sewerage, water, and other networks? Well, gee, don't you know that those things are all funded by means of coercion? You better bug out to your desert island right now, before you cause any more people to be coerced. If you choose instead to stay, you can start to make decisions about what kinds and what ends of coercion you' d like to encourage.

        <em>Libertarians like me do NOT want to have ANYONE to be cohersed above the BARE minimum to establish a limited set of basic services to preserve and stabilize society. Although some theorists claim that almost everything can in potential be privatized, the general moderate view is that Military, Police, Judicial, and Legislature are government functions, as are maintaining Standards of Weight and Measure, road building and maintence, and a few other national functions dealing with the unavoidable commonwealth aspects of nationhood.

        <em>Um, let me see: could there be such a thing as a non-coercive state, which used force only in retaliation and only against those who initiated its use?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>NO.</strong> <em>No penalty, no law.</em>- the translation of a very old maxim about law and government. Were there no excisting system of law WITH PENALTIES FOR LACK OF OBEDIENCE, they would be ignored at convience. The government would not have REVENUES, it would have DONATIONS. A 'non cohersive state' is a voluntary association of persons for some purpose, freely entered into and maintained, with resources donated by them to accomplish some freely chosen set of goals. This is not a nation as understood by mankind, although it may well be a lovefeast. -- Kirk

        <em>Let me see if I've got your logic right: Paul is fed and educated by taking money from Peter by government coercion. So according to you, Paul can now 'generate objects of value for Peter'. Where exactly is the win here? You've just moved money around. You can't create wealth by moving money around.</em>

        Money isn't wealth.

        (<em>SSHHH!!!! THAT'S A SECRET! -- Kirk)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If every dollar on the planet disappeared from every database, no objects of value would disappear. All our regulatory systems would crash, but that's a matter of dependency on money rather than money itself. The same objects of value might be managed according to some other reliable regulatory system, if we had such a thing, which we don't.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is actually what destroyed the Spanish and Portugese empires of the 17th century. They conquered the new world and imported boatloads of gold, thereby crashing their own regulatory systems and sidelining themselves from geopolitics. The English, who understood wealth, fared considerably better.
      </p>
      <p>
        The spanish inflated the gold supply and GROSSLY inflated the SILVER supply, and prices went up and up and up and up... They got to hanging merchants for raising prices, probably the second only case of governmental flirting with price controls (the Roman Empire's love affair being the first I know of... -- Kirk)

        <em>You are avoiding the question. How do you gain by coercing someone to hand over their wealth/resources/dollars/stamp collections to someone else? You have moved things from one place to another. Where is the gain?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Advantage of location? -- Kirk</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        You gain when one of three conditions apply:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the resources can be digitally replicated at negligible cost
        </li>
        <li>
           the resources are not used to capacity
        </li>
        <li>
           the goodwill that results enables further access to resources
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        For example, let's say Peter has a fishing pole. He catches his dinner and commences dining. Paul wants to borrow the fishing pole, but Peter won't let him. "Where's the gain?" he demands.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's an easy one - the borrowing of the fishing pole is not a gain. Paul gains the fishing pole, Peter loses the ability to fish - no gain there. Peter also takes on the risk that the pole will be broken or stolen - no gain there. The ability to fish for one person is moved from one person to another with an increase in risk - in all a net loss, not a gain.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Peter had his dinner, so loaning the fishing pole is no skin off his nose. And the risk of breakage or loss is minimal compared to the opportunity for mutual benefit. The ability to fish isn't moved from one person to another because Peter only catches his dinner once a day. The resource was underutilized.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Now, if Peter wants to set up a contract with Paul (it doesn't necessarily need to be written), he can do so to mitigate the increase in risk in giving up one of his assets to another person for a while. But that's his choice. There's no coercion if he does so willingly, obviously. If the government steps in and forces Peter to hand over his fishing rod to Paul against Peter's will, then we have coercion, and no gain, as noted above.)</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The only person talking about government coercion here is you. Let's talk about why you feel freedom from want requires government coercion.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Look, the main thread here is about Freedom from Want. In order to make sure that a person who wants is free from his want, you need to satisfy his want with some resources. Those resources do not magically appear, they must be taken from someone else.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        FIRST they must be created. -- <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a> again.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>If the person from whom you are taking had the desire to give the person to whom you are giving in the first place, he would already have done so. Since he has not of his own free will handed over resources to the person with the wants, it stands to reason that in order for him to part with his resources, he must be coerced.</em>

Instead, a Freedom from Want would entice a responsible government to manage the economy equitably for the populace instead of concentrating wealth in the hands of a few feudal lords or despots.

        <dd>On the other hand, you're right, it may also require in some cases the revolutionary elimination of the title owners so that land may be redistributed to the population. Whether or not that is the right thing to do is really irrelevant; it will happen to a ruling class that doesn't alleviate discontent amongst the majority population. And in some cases, like Afghanistan (especially the April Revolution), a growing dischord between an evolutionary (bourgeois) and revolutionary (proletariat) restructuring was enough to cause a civil war. Now that's real coercion, and why a libertarian society is unsustainable unless it is <em>already</em> roughly egalitarian. </dd>

        <dd>Consequently, an excellent example of legislated egalitarianism that requires government coercion is inheritance tax. In Europe, an aristocracy was born as older generations could pass wealth down to younger generations without much cost. By contrast, America <em>had</em> (repealed by Dubya) a policy of high inheritance tax ensured that wealth couldn't be passed on so readily. This greatly increased the probability of individuals of one class to move down the class ladder, thus making room for others to move up, as well as preventing capital from being permanently removed from the economy by our friends, the feudal lords. And before you complain, one doesn't <em>deserve</em> wealth because one is born into it, so it's difficult to argue against this on a libertarian axis. -- <a href="SunirShah.html">SunirShah</a></dd>

        Later on Paul fights off a marauding tiger, who otherwise would have eaten both of them. When winter comes Paul has stored up a cache of tiger jerky. Peter hasn't. Paul is rugged up in tiger furs. Peter is cold. Paul bars the entrance to his cave and hunkers down to gnaw on tiger jerky until the spring. Peter gets lost in a blizzard. The river ices over so he can't fish. He gets whole-body frostbite and dies with his fishing pole in his hands.

        <a href="FreedomFromWant.html">FreedomFromWant</a> wasn't a socialist philosophy. Roosevelt had been President through most of the <a href="GreatDepression.html">GreatDepression</a> and the nation was intimately familiar with real poverty. <a href="FreedomFromWant.html">FreedomFromWant</a> didn't mean 'equal wages for all'. It meant an opportunity to earn a living. Considering the rise in the American Standard of Living over the last 60 years, his economic recovery package was quite effective.

        Intellectual property is a special case, and deserves it's own thread on it's own page. This is about real/material wealth, and fringes of that, such as service and energy. Information is a special case.
      </p>
      <p>
        For instance, my generator sends you 1 KwH of power. It is gone from here. My server sends you a file. It is still here, nothing is deminsihsed. Information is a special case, demanding special treatment apart from the more normal sorts of wealth. -- <a href="KirkBailey.html">KirkBailey</a>.<strong></strong>

        <em>You gain when one of three conditions apply:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           the resources can be digitally replicated at negligible cost
        </li>
        <li>
           the resources are not used to capacity
        </li>
        <li>
           the goodwill that results enables further access to resources<em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Abolishing Intellectual Property laws will satisfy all 3 conditions. Copy software has negligible cost, let the software be used at a great capacity (now 2 people can use it at the same time), and having more copies around make it easier to get a copy thus "enables further access" to it. The flaw with these 3 conditions is that it does not address how it can generate more resources. Without generating more resources, you are just playing a zero-sum game.
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>You should be careful. The only intellectual property laws you are seeking to repeal are protections of copyright. Patents and trademarks are very different. You should also be careful when using the term zero-sum. Digital resources aren't zero-sum, and that is the problem.</dd>

        <strong>Not sure about inseparability of Political and Economic freedom that </strong><a href="LudwigVonMises.html">LudwigVonMises</a> asserted<strong></strong>

      <p>
        China has been trying hard to prove, and with apparent success, that economic reforms can be made with minimal political reforms.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But that statement could be correct </em>'if<em>' we accept</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           China has not got real economic freedom, they have great achievements in economic growth, but not economic freedom
          <ul>
            <li>
               only "selected few" (percentage wise) have opportunities to progress quickly in economic terms.
            </li>
            <li>
               large numbers of population were actually "enslaved" by modern economic reforms. Example: People were uprooted to make way for huge infrastructures (e.g. YangTze River project), and forced into accepting <a href="MakeUsYourSlavesButFeedUs.html">MakeUsYourSlavesButFeedUs</a> mentality.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           if we accept there is not much of freedom in China despite economic progress (of the few), are western countries getting less free as well?
