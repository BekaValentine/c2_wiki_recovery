        Dangling Pointer
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>See </em><a href="WildPointer.html">WildPointer</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        A pointer that was pointing to the right object, but the memory pointed by this pointer was then returned to the MemoryAllocationEngine, while some parts of the program still refer to it. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The memory is therefore reassigned to other parts of the program, which change it at will, so the pointer seems to dangle: The data pointed to by this dangling pointer is meaningless, and dereferencing it will normally cause <a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This can't happen when using <a href="GarbageCollection.html">GarbageCollection</a>. It also can't happen when using arena-based memory allocation with safety enforced by a type system, such as the "region" mechanism in <a href="CycloneLanguage.html">CycloneLanguage</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In some systems, for example the <a href="ObjectCapabilityOperatingSystem.html">ObjectCapabilityOperatingSystem</a>s <a href="ErosOs.html">ErosOs</a> and <a href="KeyKos.html">KeyKos</a>, deleting an arena ("zapping a space bank" in EROS/KeyKOS terminology), results in pointers that dangle, but that have well-defined error behaviour. So dereferencing a <a href="DanglingPointer.html">DanglingPointer</a> does not <em>necessarily</em> cause <a href="UndefinedBehavior.html">UndefinedBehavior</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        There are other ways to create <a href="WildPointer.html">WildPointer</a>s:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Unchecked typecasts (converting between different pointer types; or between pointers and integers)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PointerArithmetic.html">PointerArithmetic</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Pointers (with unlimited extent) into <a href="TheStack.html">TheStack</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           Uninitialized pointers
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If  a language has <em>none</em> of these (<a href="JavaLanguage.html">JavaLanguage</a> is an example), then dangling pointers aren't possible.  Elimination of manual memory allocation is <em>necessary</em> to eliminate dangling pointers; but not sufficient.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I think you meant manual memory deallocation.  See also </em><a href="ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization.html">ResourceAcquisitionIsInitialization</a> and <a href="BoostSharedPtr.html">BoostSharedPtr</a> for how to eliminate dangling pointers in C++.<em></em>
