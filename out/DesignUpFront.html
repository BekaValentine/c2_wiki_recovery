        Design Up Front
      </h1>
      <p>
        Doing <em>any</em> design up front, as opposed to beginning coding first.

      <p>
        Does writing tests count as design in this respect?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Yes.</strong> And it goes to show that you generally should do some <a href="DesignUpFront.html">DesignUpFront</a>. Just IMHO, YMMV, IANAL, and so on.

        <em>So do Whiteboard sessions and CRC card sessions.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Does design include projecting "scoping?"  That is, determining things like man loading, memory size requirements, transactions per second, etc.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Aren't those requirements?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Not necessarily.  In many cases, we as developers need to specify a target platform for a proposed system.  Here I am assuming specification flowing from the developers to the customer are not 'requirements.'  Is that a valid assumption?
