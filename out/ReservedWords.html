        <a href="KeyWords.html">KeyWords</a> used by a system which may not be used as names of variables, functions or constants.

      <p>
        Most compilers, languages, and systems maintain a list of the words in a ReservedWordList, available to the user through help or other IDE features.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Algol60 was the first programming language to have <a href="ReservedWords.html">ReservedWords</a>."
      </p>
      <p>
        ALGOL 60 had, in fact _no_ reserved words. What would be keywords in today's languages were in fact separate symbols in the language, distinguished from identifiers by a StroppingConvention. The most common ones were the use of underlining or apostrophes:
      </p>
      <code>
        'if' x < 0 'then' x := -x;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or
      </p>
      <code>
        i_f_ x < 0 t_h_e_n_ x := -x;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        However, not all ALGOL compilers implemented a StroppingConvention. Leaving symbols such as <strong>if</strong> and <strong>then</strong> unstropped meant, of course, that they had to be reserved. This was a violation of the standard, but common nonetheless.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the reference language, these symbols were most commonly denoted in boldface, so in a publication the above examples would read:
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>if</strong> <em>x</em> < 0 <strong>then</strong> <em>x</em> := - <em>x</em>;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The upshot of all this is that one could write
      </p>
      <code>
        <strong>if</strong> <em>if</em> < 0 <strong>then</strong> <em>if</em> := - <em>if</em>;<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        but I don't think it would have been encouraged.
