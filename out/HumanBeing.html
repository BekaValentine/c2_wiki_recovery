        <strong> A </strong><a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a> can only be programmed interactively.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        As a system element, a <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a> has a variety of strengths and weaknesses, when designing a system you should take this into account.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s can excel at extracting patterns from noisy data sets. <em>However, they can easily generate </em><a href="FalsePositive.html">FalsePositive</a>s, finding patterns where none exist.<em></em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s can provide instructions at critical decision points in cases where most components would fail silently. However, <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s can fail to react where automated systems would function well.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s must have a relatively constant stream of data about the state of the rest of the system; be careful if their datastreams are too bland - they can start to behave erratically.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s communicate more easily if supported by broadband communication infrastructure. On this text-based Wiki, the missing body language part gives rise to a lot of misunderstandings.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s communicate most efficiently when they can touch each other.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s don't like to work as slaves to masters.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s are annoyed if they feel themselves used as tools.
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s always exist as part of a group of <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s.  
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>A </strong><a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a> is always instantiated outside the system.<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>What usually happens is that <strong>ROOT</strong> creates a new account and one or more <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s begins to use it. Some systems have suggested that <strong>ROOT</strong> may actually be a <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a> but this concept-tree is of such low-probability that it can safely be dismissed.</dd>

      <p>
        A <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a> may be reading this, You-Who-Can-Pass-the-<a href="TuringTest.html">TuringTest</a> might see it, but it is known that a <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a> can occasionally read DataStreams in transit.

        <em>"[</em><a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s are said by some to be] ape-descended life forms... so amazingly primitive that they still think digital watches are a pretty neat idea." -- <a href="DouglasAdams.html">DouglasAdams</a>, <a href="HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy.html">HitchhikersGuideToTheGalaxy</a><em></em>

        My take on it: <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s are instantiated outside the system at random times and will act onto the system in unpredicted ways.  It is however possible to analyse the behavior of a Group Of <a href="HumanBeing.html">HumanBeing</a>s and one should take that into account when designing the system. -- <a href="ViktorRosenfeld.html">ViktorRosenfeld</a>
