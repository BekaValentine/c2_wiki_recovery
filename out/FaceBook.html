        <a href="http://thesocialskinny.com/216-social-media-and-internet-statistics-september-2012/">http://thesocialskinny.com/216-social-media-and-internet-statistics-september-2012/</a> says Twitter claims to have something like 150 million monthly users and 400 million tweets per day. At first that sounds impressive. But compared with <a href="FaceBook.html">FaceBook</a> it's pathetic. Here's why.
      </p>
      <p>
        On Twitter <a href="http://www.twopblog.com/2012/01/some-statistics-on-new-twitter-accounts.html">http://www.twopblog.com/2012/01/some-statistics-on-new-twitter-accounts.html</a> says only 10% of Twitter's claimed users do anything but sit and listen passively.
      </p>
      <p>
        Now there are 3.2 billion likes and comments on Facebook per day. That sounds like only 8 times more than Twitter but then you have to consider the topology of subscription. I mean subscription in the sense of pub/sub.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fully 50% of Facebook users have more than 100 friends. Where under 10% of twitterers follow that many people (<a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-how-many-users-does-twitter-really-have-2011-3).">http://www.businessinsider.com/chart-of-the-day-how-many-users-does-twitter-really-have-2011-3).</a>

      <ol>
        <li>
          % of 1,000,000,000 = 500 million.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          % of 150,000,000 = 15 million.

      </ol>
      <ol>
        <li>
          /15 = a total of 33 times as many brains for each Facebook comment and like to flow through.

           times as many messages. So 33 x 8 times as many user interactions.
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Which means Facebook has over 260 times more tweet equivalents per day than Twitter. 
      </p>
      <p>
        So Twitter is still influential because it has celebrities and breaking news. But almost no one lives there. If you do, you live in a backwater. If you live in G+ you live in a backwater of a backwater. If you live in C2 ... well, you're a <a href="WikiGhost.html">WikiGhost</a>.

        <a href="FaceBook.html">FaceBook</a> assigns us numbers, and numbers to all our friends, but it still feels like a big <a href="WalledGarden.html">WalledGarden</a> that invites us to to do more gardening or masonry for them.  ...
