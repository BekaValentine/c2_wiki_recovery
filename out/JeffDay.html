        Jeff Day
      </h1>
      <p>
        Jeff Day was working as a software programmer (Preferred language: <a href="BorlandDelphi.html">BorlandDelphi</a>) when he first discovered Wiki.  He is able to understand the code of any <a href="ThreeStarProgrammer.html">ThreeStarProgrammer</a> but strives to treat programming as an Art where simplicity is valued.
      </p>
      <p>
        After a long WikiHiatus, I have returned to WikiActivity and am currently using Wiki technology for my own private purposes, mostly to maintain <a href="LivingDocument.html">LivingDocument</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of October, 2003, Jeff Day became a Web Developer, with much success and broke away from his employer to form his own company in April 2004.  On August 30th, he started as a teller for Wells Fargo Bank, and will continue doing Web Development, Tutoring and Consulting in the evenings.

        I have a project "on hold" that is a <a href="WikiLikeThing.html">WikiLikeThing</a> called ThirdPage.
        Its first objective is to bring some Wiki-Like technology to the personal desktop.
        I will probably provide it as a traditional web-based Wiki as well.
        Note that it is not a <a href="WikiWikiClone.html">WikiWikiClone</a> because it doesn't use <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a>s and diverges in other subtle ways from the "standard".

        Just checking in again!  It is now February 2005, and I'm running my own web hosting business and I still use Wiki technology to keep journals and colloborate with others on projects. -- <a href="JeffDay.html">JeffDay</a>

        August 28, 2005.  I am resuming work on ThirdPage, but moving it to PHP.  I am going to use it to integrate a user maintained "Articles" system onto a few different websites.

        October 27, 2005.  I have, at a leisurely hobby pace, almost completed the PHP implementation of ThirdPage.  It has metamorphized a bit in the process.  Here are some things that have changed on its way into PHP (and on its way through my now more experienced brain):
      </p>
      <p>
        In the original ThirdPage, I used doubled symbols to turn on and off block styles, like bold, italic, monospace, and underline.  For example, :: would turn on monospace, until you turned it off again with another :: token.  My single word styles were done like *bold*, /italic/, :mono:, and _underline_.  I have now changed to using triple symbols for the blocks, to avoid conflicts with // comments in programming languages, and double-colons in other notations.  I also removed underline as a style, per common sense application of good web principles (Underlines should ONLY be links), and I instead implemented an emphasis style that can be customized per implementation to suit whatever flavor is appropriate, i'm using red lettering in my sample code.  The introduction of the ^^^ token into ThirdPage allows a reset of all block styles back to regular text.
      </p>
      <p>
        In what I believe is the spirit of Wiki's original intentions, I have tried to make it simpler and faster to add and update content by reducing the amount of study required to attain proficiency of the "markup"  I've also reintroduced <a href="CamelCase.html">CamelCase</a> as a link pattern, however, it is optional in the configuration settings, and only requires at least one lowercase character anywhere and at least one uppercase character in anywhere except the first character of the string, so CRCCard is acceptable instead of <a href="CrcCard.html">CrcCard</a>; I'm also allowing a "visual title" for each page to be specified as long as it is compatible with the <a href="WikiWord.html">WikiWord</a> excepting white space which will solve visual problems like CRC Cards.
      </p>
      <p>
        Where is ThirdPage headed?  I've got a few intended uses in mind.  One of them is for personal organization, another is for a bulletin-board style site, and yet another is to use as an enhancer to user-supplied paragraph text on other websites I develop, where the link logic will hardly be used if at all, but the other markup will allow people to easily add emphasis and style to their text without learning HTML.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll check in again soon!
