      <p>
        A <a href="BadPair.html">BadPair</a> does not work well together for one reason or other.  The makings of a include not actually working together.  This may be because of interpersonal issues or skill differences.  Usually when there is a skill variance the person with more skill becomes fustrated with the other person.  They should realize that while their technical skill may be superior the other person is, hopefully, intelegent as well and will be able to point alternative and potentially superior ways of approaching a task if given a chance.
