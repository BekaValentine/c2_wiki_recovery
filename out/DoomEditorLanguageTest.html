        Doom Editor Language Test
      </h1>
      <p>
        Relevant to the subject of <a href="LanguagePissingMatch.html">LanguagePissingMatch</a> I guess...
      </p>
      <p>
        One simple test of a programming language and its libraries is whether it can be used to write a <a href="DoomEditingUtility.html">DoomEditingUtility</a> and how hard it is. (Just to make it easier, I am referring to the Classic Dooms, not Doom 3, although certainly if a language can be used to edit Doom 3 levels, it ought to be able to edit Classic Doom levels.) What you need are random-access binary files and graphics. But you also need data structures suitable for storing doom levels and stuff.

      <p>
        Unfortunately a doom editor is a somewhat non-trivial project, which means that people aren't exactly going to be welcome to paste the source code to one on this page. And also some people try <a href="CodingAroundIgnorance.html">CodingAroundIgnorance</a> and so they have a more difficult time writing a Doom editor than they would need to, for a given language. Also, some languages have multiple implementations, such that some implementations would make it easy to write a Doom editor and others would make it very hard. And some languages require third-party libraries. DJGPP for DOS used to be distributed with graphics libraries, but those libraries had different maintainers than the compiler itself.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also unfortunately, there are a great many intriguing languages whose implementations typically fail this test. For example, <a href="GambitScheme.html">GambitScheme</a> does not allow you to seek in binary files. At least it allows you to open binary files and read and write sequentially! The Scheme standard doesn't even require that.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="DoomEditorLanguageTest.html">DoomEditorLanguageTest</a> tends to stress the libraries more than the language itself; there is nothing inherent in <a href="SchemeLanguage.html">SchemeLanguage</a> that would make it impossible to use for the construction of a Doom editor. The problem is the lack of appropriate libraries.
