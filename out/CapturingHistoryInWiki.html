        This is meant as an example of how wiki could be used to capture news and photos in a wiki. Additional editing can be performed, as in the removal of the space between the first and last name to make a Wanted Page, and the removal of a comma and a space between the city locale and the country locale. This is to make the strengths of <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>ing and search available. In a wiki which allows the mixture of letters and numbers, (as does the <a href="SmallestFederatedWiki.html">SmallestFederatedWiki</a>), additional links might be made of the capsule as SoyuzTma20 and the mission Expedition27 could also be done.

        I am not proposing the use of such on <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a>, since such would be <a href="OffTopic.html">OffTopic</a>. It is <a href="OnTopic.html">OnTopic</a> however to illustrate how something like this can be done using wiki framework, and keyboard-less, mouse enabled drag and drop.
