        I'm a Group Manager at a large database company located in California's Bay Area.  In my spare time, I dragonboat, play ultimate frisbee, and study up on becoming a more effective manager and leader.

        I have an undergraduate degree from California Institute of Technology that I rarely use anymore.  If you went to Caltech, though, you probably understand the feeling of "now that I've been through this, I can handle anything!".  Perhaps it is the rigor of the training, not the subject of the training, that makes the difference.
