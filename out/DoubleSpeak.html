        Apparently in the movie <em>1984</em>, there was a reference to <a href="DoubleSpeak.html">DoubleSpeak</a> with regards to the future.

        I've become convinced that most people's ideas of 'classic literature' is just as fad-driven as anything else; though looking at some of the early pioneers is always good for history (e.g. Shelby, Verne, Carroll, Tolkien, etc. if sticking with the beginnings of written science fiction and fantasy that survived the Dark Ages).  The book 1984 was hardly worth the read except for the allusions one learns that have entered modern language.

        <em>I suppose it's a matter of personal opinion; as a youth, </em>'1984<em>' was one of my favourite books.</em>

        Language is not meant to be <em>liked</em> as much as <em>understood</em>; in my understanding, liking a work of literature is a result of the concepts expressed resonating with the reader's thoughts. <em>1984</em> reflects the spirit of the time when it was written, and serves to tell a very simple and realistic horror story of what ordinary human beings can do to other ordinary human beings, under the same very real conditions which existed in 1948, 1984, or 2014, by means of the systematic denouncement of the mind in favor of primal instincts.
