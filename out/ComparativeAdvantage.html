        Comparative Advantage
      </h1>
      <p>
        DavidRicardo showed that (all other things being equal), it is always most productive overall for each producer to specialize in what they are best at (their relative advantage), even if some other producer has an <em>absolute</em> advantage in production of that commodity.

        <em>Example: You are an absolute God regarding </em><a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a>. I'm a beginner. You are also better at writing <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a> than I am, but not by much. We say that I have a <a href="ComparativeAdvantage.html">ComparativeAdvantage</a> over you when writing <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, because the <a href="OpportunityCost.html">OpportunityCost</a> of taking you off your <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> work is very high. So, I should specialize in <a href="VisualBasic.html">VisualBasic</a>, even though you are better at it. Sigh... :-)<em></em>
