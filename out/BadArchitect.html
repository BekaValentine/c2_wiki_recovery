        Bad Architect

      <p>
        <strong>Bad Architects ...</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           have huge Egos.
          <ul>
            <li>
              That is not inherently a problem (but it becomes a huge problem if they are incompetent)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           know what is best for you.
          <ul>
            <li>
               If he/she really knows what is best for you, then he/she is a <a href="GoodArchitect.html">GoodArchitect</a> 
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Spend more time telling you what they know than listening to what you need.
          <ul>
            <li>
              Okey, I agree, <a href="BadArchitectsDoNotListen.html">BadArchitectsDoNotListen</a>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           have all the answers in their heads.
          <ul>
            <li>
               If they really have all the answers in their heads, they are not GoodArchitects, they are PerfectArchitects! (And I do not think those exist)
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>This list is completely ridiculous. Let's see some rationale. - anon</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Prefer elegance to practicability.
        </li>
      </ul>

        See <a href="FrankLloydWright.html">FrankLloydWright</a>.  This raises the question; "Which type of Architect produces the best architecture?" in either software or buildings. History of both fields suggests that <a href="BadArchitect.html">BadArchitect</a>s are in the lead. -- <a href="ThirdWaveDave.html">ThirdWaveDave</a>
