        Absolutism Has Greater Burden Of Proof
      </h1>
      <p>
        Those who claim there is "one true way" have a greater burden of proof than those who claim a personal preference to a technique. This is because the scope of the claim of the first is much greater than the second. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I created this topic because the issue keeps coming up. Thus, I wish to factor it to one spot.

      <p>
        <em>Absolutism is not about "one true ways", it's about "truth", starting with 'true and false are distinct and not equal to one another'.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        In this context, it is about proving that software principles and related tools and techniques are "objectively better".

        <strong>Absolutism Challenge</strong> (<em>that isn't really about absolutism</em>)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I've never seen an objective proof that </em>any<em> software engineering technique is "better" than another. All past attempts eventually boil down to psychology (</em>AllHolyWarsTiedToPsychology). <strong>I challenge anybody to point out such proof.</strong> <em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It is undeniable that <strong><em>some</em> software designs and languages are objectively worse or no better at <em>ALL</em> of software properties that one might reasonably deem "good"</strong> than are certain other software designs and languages.  Trivially, one can intentionally design a language that is intended to have poor performance, to make expression of any concept non-trivial to the programmer, to compound and exaggerate errors, to introduce errors <em>artificially</em> and <em>pseudorandomly</em> (maybe based on the phase of the moon), to make security or performance or correctness guarantees impossible, et cetera.  <em>(And that language is called "Java".  Sorry, carry on.)</em>  And some people <em>have</em> designed such languages and frameworks, often for the fun of it.  One can also intentionally solve every single problem in the most bass-ackwards way their imagination can devise - and some people do so on a regular basis - see <a href="WorseThanFailure.html">WorseThanFailure</a> and such constructs as: 
      </p>
      <code>
        return (test == true)? ( (test == false)? false : true) : ((test == false) ? false : true); <br/>
        // which can be reduced to 'return test;'  <br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        It is languages and designs and software snippets such as these that <strong>prove</strong> that some software engineering techniques are <strong>objectively better</strong> than others, and thus <strong>disprove any naive insistence or belief to the contrary</strong>.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Sure, it's silly, but it is also <strong>sufficient</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        One could, of course, come up with a ridiculously twisted set of values such that "security is bad! it means I can't install a backdoor or scam money!" and "readability is awful! it harms job security!".  While I admit to finding such statements entertaining, they aren't really serious attacks against the fact that some language/framework/architecture/software designs are objectively, by all reasonable measures, strictly worse or no better than others. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When I forgot my password when I'm in a critical hurry, security certainly feels "bad" at that moment. Needless to say, every feature or technique has it's trade-offs.</em> 
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, I think you need to both 'say' "every feature or technique has its trade-offs", <strong>and then you need to prove it.</strong>  That was, after all, a very absolute statement you just made - one that must have greater burden of proof.  What, pray tell, are the trade-offs of exchanging 'return (test == true)? ((test == false)?false : true) : ((test == false) ? false : true)' technique for the 'return test' technique?  Are you going to argue that you're trading-off confusion for clarity? inefficiency for speed? what?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Lack of trade-offs is not the default if I fail to provide proof of tradeoffs. "Unknown" or "null" is the default.</em>

        <em>Barne of C++ fame says almost this very statement (regarding readability) that C++ was invented for genius/experts only, and that the entire purpose of C++ was to weed out any programmers (re: jobs etc.) who couldn't understand its syntax, notation, pointers, etc. The exact quote, is..

      <ul>
        <li>
           [Do you have a source for that?  The usual Bjarne quote about C++'s intent is "C++ was designed to provide Simula's facilities for program organization together with C's efficiency and flexibility for systems programming."

Indeed, Stroustrup has been rather vocal about wanting to make C++ or C++0x more accessible to novices.]

        <li>
           <em>And then there is:</em> Stroustrup: Well, one day, when I was sitting in my office, I thought of this little scheme, which would redress the balance a little. I thought 'I wonder what would happen, if there were a language so complicated, so difficult to learn, that nobody would ever be able to swamp the market with programmers? Actually, I got some of the ideas from X10, you know, X windows. That was such a bitch of a graphics system, that it only just ran on those Sun 3/60 things. They had all the ingredients for what I wanted. A really ridiculously complex syntax, obscure functions, and pseudo-OO structure. Even now, nobody writes raw X-windows code.

          <ul>
            <li>
               [Which is, of course, a joke.  Stroustrup gave no such interview.  Nobody would take it seriously, would they???  (I know, I know, they probably would.)]
            </li>
            <li>
               {If you actually read the whole page with the hindsight available today... It is, of course, true that Stroustrup said none of those things, but I can't help but look at it with the feeling '<a href="HaHaOnlySerious.html">HaHaOnlySerious</a>'.}
            </li>
            <li>

        But there is still no consensus objective way to measure such. A really smart person may get the hang of just about any language anyone could invent and be as productive as the average Java or PHP programmer. We can take a vote, but that only measures subjective preference.
      </p>
      <p>
        {On 'readability', indeed, there is little consensus on a proper way to measure it.  Part of the problem is that there is no clean laboratory setting - no matter what language you design, potential users of the language will be influenced by the languages they already know - we'll probably need to develop 'artificial' language-learning agents with scalable but objectively measurable levels of 'intelligence' before there is a fair test that can be applied to any language.  That said, I think inventing a language for genius/experts only is a wholly stupid idea.  The more people that can effectively, and correctly, do programming, the faster innovation will occur and the more grunt work can be handed off to people who aren't willing to dedicate the effort necessary to be creative (since creativity is, in both my experience and that of Edison, 99% perspiration).}

        </li>
        <li>

        </li>

        </li>
        <li>
           Mutability (degree to which a small change in functionality requires an equivalently small change in the source - affected by <a href="CouplingAndCohesion.html">CouplingAndCohesion</a>)
        </li>
        <li>
           Security (ability to resist <a href="DenialOfService.html">DenialOfService</a>, ability to resist granting service to those not authorized, ability to ensure privacy constraints are met, ability to detect and retaliate to security threats (active security))

        </li>
        <li>
           Resilience (ability to recover from certain forms of damage after a fault or loss)

      </p>
      <p>
        Some <strong>subjective</strong> but statistically measurable properties that are considered good:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Readability (ease with which a skilled programmer inexperienced with the code can comprehend and predict its consequences, and possibly its intended consequences)
        </li>
        <li>
           Fun (inverse of degree to which programming in system is a chore; not well defined, but see BondageAndDisciplineLanguages).

        Possible Exceptions and caveats include:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Machine performance:
          <ul>
            <li>
               Very easy to over-optimize for at the expense of other criteria (security, correctness, expressiveness, fault tolerance, etc.); over-optimizing for performance is a historically common mistake.
            </li>
            <li>
               Imperative in some domains (especially embedded systems); probably less valuable than long-term maintainability in most domains.
            </li>
            <li>
               Efficiency, utilization, scalability, lag time, response rate, etc. are reasonable metrics to consider.

               Machine performance <em>guarantees</em>, such as hard <a href="RealTime.html">RealTime</a> or strict finite-space requirements for embedded are sometimes necessary.
            </li>
            <li>
               All other things being equal, a design or technique that gives better performance is objectively better.
            </li>
            <li>
               All other things being equal, a language or framework that allows one to effectively describe and enforce performance guarantees is objectively better to another that doesn't -- it can be used in a wider range of domains.

               LOC is about as accurate and useful as GDP -- it's never more than an approximation. There are more ways to measure code volume, and LOC should not be used on its own.

        You are over-focusing on <a href="EverythingIsRelative.html">EverythingIsRelative</a>. I've found it better to <strong>find a common ground</strong> between parties and work up from there. There is no use in arguing about whether a chair exists (common exercise in Philosophy 101) if both parties agree it exists for a sake of a common issue between them. Call it "local absolutism" or "working absolutism": these are the givens we both agree on.

        For example, most people these days prefer blocks over goto's and there is little incentive for anyone to "prove" blocks are better. Thus, as a practical issue, it's usually moot. It's only an issue in an academic kind of setting or people studying or interested in evidence presentation techniques. And some <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> are indeed interested in such subjects.

           Sorry, I'm not going to fork over money to ACM. I have kids to put thru college. And it's my understanding that the controversy over the Goto article's objectivity is something that pushed them to focus on hardware and performance metrics and unique specialized algorithms instead of software idea comparisons. ACM realized early that programming is in the head and shifted their focus to avoid the head because they wanted "clean" papers, and psychology is a murky science. Programming is about <strong>communicating to the human mind</strong> first, and to computers second. You can't hide from <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> issues if you want useful software productivity metrics. Accept this and you will be liberated.

Introduce <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a> statements into a math class and your math problem becomes much harder to prove than if you had avoided <a href="GoTo.html">GoTo</a>.<em>}</em>

           So the "goto's are bad" argument model <em>does</em> assume something about the human thought process? Math indeed was designed to communicate with humans (both the author and other human beings). In other words, <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> influenced its design. However, although I may informally agree with most premises about human thought processes, it still should be empirically tested to claim it's The Truth in the absolute sense. My head may not match your head, etc. Some of the goto experts seemed to use pattern recognition also, not just up-and-down logic. And aliens from Zolob may have a very different brain from humans such that they relate to something completely foreign to us.

           [No, it depends on correct reasoning, which is a different thing (than a model of human thought processes) entirely.]

           Correct reasoning by <em>what</em>? Please clarify. Humans reading blocks and goto's is the primary issue. Humans do the "reasoning" and/or pattern recognition that "processes" gotos/blocks. That's the "system" to be optimized. (It's not even clear if pattern recognition is "reasoning", at least not in a rigorous sense.) <strong>Human mental processes are the bottleneck and it's rational to try to optimize the bottlenecks first</strong>. We are not trying to optimize primarily math, we are not trying to optimize primarily machines, we are trying to optimize the processing in programmers' heads. See <a href="GotoBlackBoxThoughtExperiment.html">GotoBlackBoxThoughtExperiment</a>. If you truly think your reasoning is solid, universal, and correct logic, then please formalize it some more with numbered clauses, etc. so the steps/components and their relationship to each other is clear to all.

        Goto's are an interesting case study in that almost everyone agrees that "blocks won" (for the most part), yet an objective proof remains elusive. Thus, if we can't do it for the "obvious" winners, then how do we do it for more contentious superiority claims?  -t
