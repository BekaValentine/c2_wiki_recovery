        I've been programming since 1977 and I've worked in financial service firms for most of that time.  I spent my first 10 years as a mainframe CICS systems programmer.  The remainder has been in application software in LAN/WAN environments.

        Lately, I've been most interested in workflow applications.  One Of These Days I will have enough time to sit down and build a system based on my ideas :-)  In the meantime, back to paying work.
