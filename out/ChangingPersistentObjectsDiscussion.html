        Changing Persistent Objects Discussion
      </h1>
      <p>
        I'm wondering how people deal with migrating persistent objects that have changed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm specifically interested in Java and serialization, but the discussion should be pretty general. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: What's the best scheme for saving objects and for migrating them when they have changed in a way that has broken serialization. 
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Some ideas include not using serialization, but then again, you have the same issues to deal with. 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        A: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Q: If you serialize the objects and their codebases change, is there a simple way to update the codebase for those objects? 
      </p>
      <p>
        A:
      </p>
      <p>
        I'd like this to turn into a set of best practices for Versioning Persistent Objects.

        <em>Possible solution bound to start a flamewar, but it is an option to consider: don't use heavy OO. Talk directly to the database instead of through object wrappers.</em>
