        Self Uses Capitalization For Syntax
      </h1>
      <p>
        It's not immediately obvious from a quick skim of the documentation, but <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> uses capitalization as a part of its syntax.

      <p>
        The syntax of the <a href="SelfLanguage.html">SelfLanguage</a> is very similar to that of the <a href="SmalltalkLanguage.html">SmalltalkLanguage</a>. One difference is that in Self, the first keyword of a message must start with a lowercase letter, and the remaining keywords must start with an uppercase letter:
      </p>
      <code>
        array at: 3 put: 'banana'.    "Smalltalk"<br/>
        array at: 3 Put: 'banana'.    "Self"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        The reason for this restriction is that it allows Self to get away with fewer parentheses. This is especially important because Self doesn't have a special syntax for assignment, like Smalltalk's := operator; Self just uses ordinary keyword messages for assignment.
      </p>
      <code>
        kids  :=  people select: [  :p|  p age < 18 ].     "Smalltalk"<br/>
        kids:     people select: [ |:p|  p age < 18 ].     "Self"<br/>
        kids:    (people select: [ |:p|  p age < 18 ]).    "Also Self, but the parentheses are unnecessary."<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Without the capitalization restriction, the second line would get parsed as a call to a method called "kids:select:". As it is, Self can parse it as a call to "kids:", passing in the result of the call to "select:".

        Wow -- I'm looking at the above explanation, and simultaneously think it's cool and a pain in the butt to read/maintain.  It's cool in that, in the simplistic case of slot assignment, it eliminates a pair of parentheses.  However, it's a pain in the butt to maintain because it opens up the opportunity for abuse in more complex expressions.
      </p>
      <p>
        From a language parsing point of view, this looks like it's really hard to parse and get right.  Does anyone have experience writing a Self parser?  What difficulties have you run into?

        This syntax has a problem if Unicode selectors are to be used. For example:
      </p>
      <code>
        array at: 3 put: 'banana'.    "Smalltalk"<br/>
        array at: 3 Put: 'banana'.    "Self"<br/>
        array 於: 3 置: 'banana'.    "Smalltalk, in Chinese"<br/>
        array 於: 3 置: 'banana'.    "Self, in Chinese?"<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Suggestion for a new syntax:
      </p>
      <code>
        array at( 3 )put( 'banana').    "NEW. Please note there is no space before the word put"<br/>
        array 於(3)置('banana').    "NEW, in Chinese."<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        youngster  :=  people aging: 8 to: 18.     "Smalltalk"<br/>
        youngster:     people aging: 8 To: 18.     "Self"<br/>
        youngster(     people aging(8)to(18)).    "NEW"<br/>
        youngster(     people 年(8)到(18)).    "NEW, Chinese" <br/>
      </code>

        It appears nice to me.  --JimGuo 郭宏
