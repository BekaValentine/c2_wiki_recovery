        <em>An idea I have been toying around with is to mount a filesystem which interprets files and provides this structured content as sub folders. The simplest case of displaying archives (ZIPs) as their content is often already simulated by file browsers.</em>
        But my idea is to also:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           expand documents into folders for chapters, pages, paragraphs 
        </li>
        <li>
           possibly providing sym-links for cross refs
        </li>
        <li>
           a folder containing all embedded images
          <ul>
            <li>
               provide sub folders for old versions (or use git for this)
              <ul>
                <li>
                   I seem to remember that there is at least one CMS which does something like this.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
               expand spreadsheets into sheets (and rows and colums)
            </li>
            <li>
               expand code artifacts into folders for classes and methods
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This way you can use your normal tools (file explorers, CLI, backup, RCS) on this structure
        This would avoid reimplementing in each application
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           versioning
        </li>
        <li>
           navigation
        </li>
        <li>
           merging
        </li>
        <li>
           backup
        </li>
        <li>
           copy/paste, structured modification
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        <strong>Alternative to traditional uses of files systems</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           I think this is a plausable approach to an alternate way of using files in a computer or from the internet
          <ul>
            <li>
