        Multi Wiki
      </h1>
      <p>
        An idea came to mind yesterday afternoon and I have been coding ever since. I am not sure if this idea is sound or sensible. Basically <a href="MultiWiki.html">MultiWiki</a> supports multiple namespaces using a dot-notation similar to Novell NDS. Its still very much work in progress, but I have an example script with some basic instructions running at:
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="http://ces.strath.ac.uk/cgi/multiwiki">http://ces.strath.ac.uk/cgi/multiwiki</a> (<a href="BrokenLink.html">BrokenLink</a> 20040122)
      </p>

      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        I have changed <a href="MultiWiki.html">MultiWiki</a> so that the namespaces build from right to left. It feels more like NDS now, but I don't know if that is such a brilliant idea, in the light of day. -- David

        <a href="MultiWiki.html">MultiWiki</a> now supports external namespace. An external namespace is an association of a namespace with an arbitrary URL. References to pages in such namespaces, make a hyperlink by appending the page to the associated URL. This means, for example, that you can make the association:
      </p>
      <code>
        c2.com -->> <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Then, a reference like "<a href="FrontPage.html">FrontPage</a>.c2.com" would be linked to:
      </p>
      <code>
        <a href="http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FrontPage">http://c2.com/cgi/wiki?FrontPage</a><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        (I knew there was a reason why I wanted NDS style namespaces)
      </p>

        Why use dots instead of slashes? Why use right to left instead of left to right?
      </p>
      <p>
        My instinct would be to make it look like a file system. I really hate the way URLs mix directions and conventions, as in <a href="http://www.bhresearch.co.uk/Pixie/Index.html.">http://www.bhresearch.co.uk/Pixie/Index.html.</a> I would prefer <a href="http://uk/co/bhresearch/www/Pixie/Index.html.">http://uk/co/bhresearch/www/Pixie/Index.html.</a> It is more uniform and hides more implementation detail. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        [Later] I'm less interested in <a href="MultiWiki.html">MultiWiki</a>, in the sense of making a big Wiki by gluing lots of small ones together. I'm more interested in making a big Wiki by letting a small one grow. Growth is smoother. That's what biases me away from discontinuous names. -- <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a>

        I guess I was thinking of Java packages, NDS trees, DNS domains and the like. As for the right-to-left style, I felt that it placed the emphasis on the name of the page rather than on the containers. I also liked the notion that external pages looked like DNS entries. Note, however, that these are all very subjective, aesthetic reasons.
      </p>
      <p>
        I now think that the pages and containers are far too tightly bound. <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a> mentioned making containers behave like categories. However, associating a page with a category is much less significant than placing a page in a container.
      </p>
      <p>
        It just occurred to me that the "belongs-to" relationship might just be one of many relationships we might want between pages and categories. Why not have relationships like "is-an-antipattern-of" and "contributed-to".

        What I read into what David says here is the idea of adding a qualifier to the link - reminds me of the old semantic network stuff popular in AI about 20 years ago (has it really been that long?!?). I guess the question here is, what extra semantic applies to links of these formats? What makes 'em act like more than just, well, a link? -- <a href="PeterMerel.html">PeterMerel</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Hmm. I'm not sure if I was suggesting that we qualify the existing links with extra semantics. I was thinking that we could provide a separate mechanism which overarches the standard page/link structure.
      </p>
      <p>
        The point <a href="DaveHarris.html">DaveHarris</a> makes above is valid, and I am beginning to understand Ward's call for simplicity on <a href="WikiConsortium.html">WikiConsortium</a> (I am always a couple of weeks behind the pace). -- David

        Some of the ideas here sound very similar to InterWikiLinks , which are already working on <a href="MeatBall.html">MeatBall</a>, <a href="CommunityWiki.html">CommunityWiki</a>, <a href="WikiFeatures.html">WikiFeatures</a>, and several other wiki.
