        Wiki As Object For Open Source Teamwork
      </h1>
      <p>
        Quite a lot of ideas are hovering in this wiki that could be focused here. I could imagine a <a href="WikiWithProgrammableContent.html">WikiWithProgrammableContent</a>, growing to an open large-scale Web Wide Project with zillions of integrated special applications, distributed over a growing number of linked wikis:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           WikiAsObject with static and instantial properties and methods.
        </li>
        <li>
           WikiAsInfrastructure (technical and social)
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiEngine.html">WikiEngine</a> As <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> for TeamWork
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiForum.html">WikiForum</a> for a <a href="WikiWayOfLife.html">WikiWayOfLife</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WikiFarm.html">WikiFarm</a> 
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="WorldWideWikiWeb.html">WorldWideWikiWeb</a> (<a href="InterWiki.html">InterWiki</a>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        An important step seems to be to make the textual and programmable content independent of the initial implementation. Although there are <a href="WikiFarm.html">WikiFarm</a>s where each visitor can create his own wiki with a free chosen theme, these usually don't have the features yet that can be found in some highly specialized wikis. For example: free DHTML use, up/downloads, big enough pages for scripts.

        The <a href="ApacheSoftwareFoundation.html">ApacheSoftwareFoundation</a> has a growing <a href="ApacheWiki.html">ApacheWiki</a> for its community at <a href="http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi.">http://nagoya.apache.org/wiki/apachewiki.cgi.</a> We also have a quickly growing wiki for ApacheCon (Nov 16-19, 2003) at <a href="http://apachecon.com/wiki/.">http://apachecon.com/wiki/.</a>

        Ambitious goals of the kind we need to think through as Wiki evolves.

        Are the parts of Wiki which directly relate to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> a kind of <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> effort to define a Methodology? That is to say, <a href="TheThreeExtremos.html">TheThreeExtremos</a> act as integrators and version managers, and the XP Community as whole acting as <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> developers.
      </p>
      <p>
        This would be interesting because it would imply another use for <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>, i.e. the ability to use <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> to define something as complex as a Methodology (as if Linux wasn't complex enough ;).
      </p>

        <em>I've even heard of an effort to produce </em><a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> legal arguments for a case regarding <a href="CopyRight.html">CopyRight</a>. I can't recall where I heard about it though. If anyone has a link or reference to this, <a href="PleaseComment.html">PleaseComment</a>.<em></em>

        OpenLaw (<a href="http://eon.law.harvard.edu/openlaw/)">http://eon.law.harvard.edu/openlaw/)</a> comes to mind.
