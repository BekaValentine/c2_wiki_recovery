        Hi friends, <a href="LongTimeNoSee.html">LongTimeNoSee</a>.  Partly I think I lost touch with the C2 Wiki community due to your /success/ -- after an explosive participatory growth stage a couple of years ago I recognized that we had pretty much said all that we /could/ say of substance about the various areas of software design, and I felt that the Wiki was drifting into non-software areas and postings of significantly less consequence.  Oddly enough the success of C2 spawned a whole series of /other/ Wikis (most notably <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a>), and so as technology marched on my interests did as well.  So I spent the last couple years of my free time posting to the mighty <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> (okay, playing online Bridge too ... another vice brought about by the increasing ability of various technologies).  I found <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> a better platform for explicating some of my other, non-software related interests.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="WikiPedia.html">WikiPedia</a> though has now pretty much reached the same level of attainment with respect to worldly matters as C2 reached with respect to software development when I left.
      </p>

        Enough about me though... my intention of even setting up this page has more to do with a larger sociological question (well, you already know how I'm bent).  Any time a new technology comes along, grows, gets fully adopted, assimilated into the culture, and explored to the limits of useful capabilities, what happens next?  What is the path of a technology /after/ it has matured?  And especially in the case of educational or entertainment resources, what is the breakpoint between retention and usefulness?  We keep old movies around, or transfer them to new recording media.  People still enjoy pinball.  Not many people buy the Encyclopedia Britannica any longer though.

        Well, I'll still check in once in a while.  Some of the pages I left previously have mushroomed into pages of commentary on their own; that dialectic will encourage me to rethink and repost some differing perspectives.  But maybe it is also time to talk about a different direction for C2 in its entirety.
