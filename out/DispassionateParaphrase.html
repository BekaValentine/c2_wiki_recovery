        Dispassionate Paraphrase
      </h1>
      <p>
        An example made up for the occasion. We have two folks engaged in a discussion, Jeff and Tony. Tony starts the <a href="DispassionateParaphrase.html">DispassionateParaphrase</a> page:
      </p>
      <p>
        On Some Other Page, Jeff, you said:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There is no possible way that building new Components makes sense in a real application. Too much time is spent building things you don't need, while the poor customer sits in a corner wondering where the business value is going to come into the equation. Use existing components exclusively. Anyone who does otherwise is a tiny fool.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Let me try to pull the idea out of the passion here. Here's what I get:
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>There's a risk that too much time will be spent investing in building new Components, while the actual problem to be solved waits. It's better to use existing components exclusively.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Now let's explore a few notions here:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Under what circumstances does component-building investment pay off, and when does it not?
        </li>
        <li>
           Is there a way to grow components incrementally, reducing the risk? <em>I think so. See Component Growing page.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           What about components you <em>seem to</em> need but they don't exist in the market? How can you be sure you need them? What do you do then?
        </li>
        <li>
           What if your company seems to have infinite money for programmers but none for buying software?
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Let's start discussing these dimensions separately here and see whether we can bring them back together. If the sections get too large, we'll split them into sub-pages.
