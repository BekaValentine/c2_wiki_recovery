        Cold Fusion Components
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="MacromediaColdFusion.html">MacromediaColdFusion</a> Components (or CFCs) were introduced to CFML with the release of ColdFusionMX. They bring all the great things <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a> has to offer to the <a href="MacromediaColdFusion.html">MacromediaColdFusion</a> language.  A CFC is basically a class with methods and properties allows for better encapsulation of logic within a traditional CFML application.

        <em>I don't think this deserves a topic of its own and goes under </em><a href="MacromediaColdFusion.html">MacromediaColdFusion</a> instead. Personally I think too much OO is ruining the declarative nature of much of CF. What does everyone have to go and try to copy Java? If you want Java, then go there rather than butcher alternative approaches to look like Java.<em></em>

      <p>
        I don't see what is wrong with progression and programming language or framework evolution. People want efficiency and ease of use. There is no reason why <a href="ColdFusion.html">ColdFusion</a> should not exist and also no reason why it should not be based on Java.
