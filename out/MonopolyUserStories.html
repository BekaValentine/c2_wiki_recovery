        <em>I have a question for the customer: User Story #11 says something about drawing a "Go to Jail" card ... What do you want us to do if Story #11 is scheduled before Story #19? Should we Split out some of Story 11 into its own Story #20?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I don't know if these stories were arranged with dependencies in mind. It seems that the "Go to Jail" story #11 cannot function without the concept of a card pile in story #20. The developer player would most likely have to move #20 into pile 1 and #11 into pile 2 -or- ask for a split, as you propose, if both are planned for the same iteration --<a href="MichaelLeach.html">MichaelLeach</a>
