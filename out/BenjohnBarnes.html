        I'm a part-time Ph.D. student at Warwick University, UK.

        My research is for a company called Improvision; we are working on visualization of biological data. Yes, it's fascinating :) Out of work, my interests include ... everything interesting, and lots besides, but particularly SCUBA diving.

        I found out about Wiki in the first place because I wanted our diving club to have a useful web page. It tends to get rebuilt every few years. People have great intent for it, but no-one adds content, so it just molders until someone rebuilds it again.

        I'm now convinced that we should use a Wiki-like system. It would be invaluable for providing information and resources. Its dynamic nature would allow it to grow, and would make it a stunning tool for planning club trips. Long term, it could become a useful resource for other diving clubs, and could allow organization of joint activities.
