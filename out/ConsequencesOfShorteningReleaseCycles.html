        Consequences Of Shortening Release Cycles
      </h1>
      <p>
        Software is on a steady path to shorter release cycles. While there will always be software that releases annually or longer, the median release cycle is dropping steadily.
      </p>
      <p>
        One way to look at <a href="AgileSoftwareDevelopment.html">AgileSoftwareDevelopment</a> is to look at what qualitative changes are required to enable the quantitative change of a shorter cycle. This page is intended as a place to gather and discuss these changes. Please feel free to add your experience to the structure below.

      <p>
        <strong>Annual -> Quarterly</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Concurrent planning -- in three months there isn't enough time for a complete specification before beginning coding, so the specification has to be delivered in pieces just in advance of implementation
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Quarterly -> Monthly</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Incremental design -- in one month there isn't enough time for a complete design for larger chunks of functionality, so the design must evolve
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Monthly -> Weekly</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Concurrent QA -- in a week there isn't time for any but the most cursory post-development QA, so QA must be spread across development
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Weekly -> Daily</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           One-button deployment -- any manual steps in deployment will be both tedious, expensive, and error-prone when done daily
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Daily -> Hourly</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Automated rollback -- because of the frequency of deployment, the system must detect error conditions and roll back to the previously deployed version automatically
        </li>
      </ul>
