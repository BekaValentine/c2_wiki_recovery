        Open Systems Interconnect
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="OpenSystemsInterconnect.html">OpenSystemsInterconnect</a> (OSI) model is a top-down analysis set. There are 7 (academically) distinct layers in the Model:
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           PhysicalLayer
        </li>
        <li>
           DataLinkLayer
        </li>
        <li>
           NetworkLayer
        </li>
        <li>
           TransportLayer
        </li>
        <li>
           SessionLayer
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="PresentationLayer.html">PresentationLayer</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <a href="ApplicationLayer.html">ApplicationLayer</a>
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        These layers are "stacked" one on top of the other in a cascading fashion. Each layer is dependant and builds on the layer(s) below it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong></strong><a href="FourLayerArchitecture.html">FourLayerArchitecture</a><strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The most practical implementations of the ISO/OSI model have 4 layers, which merges some of the layers together, splitting them by logical distinctions.
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
           Link 
        </li>
        <li>
           Network 
        </li>
        <li>
           Presentation
        </li>
        <li>
           Application
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        <em>Do these layers actually correspond to the listed four layers in the </em><a href="FourLayerArchitecture.html">FourLayerArchitecture</a> page? I am finding that they are different: View layer, <a href="ApplicationModel.html">ApplicationModel</a> layer, <a href="DomainModel.html">DomainModel</a> layer and Infrastructure layer.<em></em>

        The long and the short of it is that nobody believes in the OSI protocol stack. People believe in the TCP/IP protocol stack, but not OSI. Hell, the OSI model was only made packet-oriented at the last minute. -- rk

        <em>OSI model has succeeded if only it has served as a reference for start of debate on implementation aspects. Moreover, I have seen a lot of mapping of </em><a href="SecurityManagement.html">SecurityManagement</a> material to this model -- dl<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        The real reference is the Unix implementation of TCP/IP. The OSI model isn't a reference for anything and the notion that it triggered debate of implementation is absurd. The OSI model wasn't made until long after TCP/IP was a resounding success. You've got your history backward.

          It's like the Library of Congress cataloging system.  Books (and even other taxonomies for knowledge) were around long before such a system was developed; but, after it was developed, it started informing the categorization of all future publications. --<a href="MarkJanssen.html">MarkJanssen</a><em></em>

        <em>If you like to tell us why ISO started an OSI model "LONGAFTER" the TCP/IP stack became popularised, and yet have nothing useful to contribute please do so. I would also advice you to take a look at </em><a href="http://www.sans.org/rr/papers/44/1309.pdf">http://www.sans.org/rr/papers/44/1309.pdf</a> as an example OSI model is quoted as reference, for purposes of information security.<em></em>

        By the way, the OSI model is sometimes referred to as "the seven layer salad."
