        Unilateral Assured Destruction
      </h1>
      <p>
        With the development of Tactical Missile Defense (which violates the ABM agreement with the Russia) and the willingness to initiate nuclear strike at non-nuclear states (which violates the nuclear non-proliferation treaty in UN), the <a href="UnitedStates.html">UnitedStates</a> is aiming at <a href="UnilateralAssuredDestruction.html">UnilateralAssuredDestruction</a>. Namely, the destruction of target of the next US aggression will be assured.
      </p>
      <p>
        The only possible response to this will be a race to build nuclear weapons and to build a lot of them to maintain its deterrent power in face of TMD.  As one columnist commented in 1999, if Yugoslavia has nuclear missiles, NATO will not dare bomb it.
