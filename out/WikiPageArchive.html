        Every once in awhile someone gets it in their head to make drastic edits to a page -- such as replacing its entire contents with a witty one line joke. Some pages are more vulnerable to this than others through being both valuable and controversial. If you value such a page you may choose to place it in a <a href="WikiPageArchive.html">WikiPageArchive</a> so that you can replace it or view it privately in the event that it becomes damaged or destroyed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here's how to do it:
      </p>
      <p>
        Create a directory on your local machine to hold the archive. Click <a href="EditText.html">EditText</a> on any page that you wish to archive. Select everything within the edit window, copy it, and paste it into a text document that carries the same name as the page that you are saving. Finally, save the text document in the directory that you created. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Restoring from a <a href="WikiPageArchive.html">WikiPageArchive</a> can be difficult because there may be new material on the page that you want to preserve. If you have access to a three way file merging tool that is probably the easiest route to go. If not, having three open windows in a normal text editor can help to ease the pain of merging the new with the old to produce an effective composite.
