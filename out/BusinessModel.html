        <strong>We have framework, architecture, and model. Are they ever useful? More Questions </strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        What is a <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a>? Why should people care about having a <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a>? Is it one of those <a href="BusinessPatterns.html">BusinessPatterns</a> that can be successfully transplanted elsewhere? To some, it may remain a kind of <a href="MeaninglessDoublespeak.html">MeaninglessDoublespeak</a>. But I can assure you a few practitioners in the arena of <a href="BusinessProcessManagement.html">BusinessProcessManagement</a> care about <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a>s.
      </p>
      <p>
        So is <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a> a <a href="StrategicManagement.html">StrategicManagement</a> concern? If so, is it a concern of those engaged in activities related to <a href="StrategicAlignmentOfItProductsAndServices.html">StrategicAlignmentOfItProductsAndServices</a>?

        How does <a href="InformationTechnologyFrameworks.html">InformationTechnologyFrameworks</a> link into a <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a>?

        Other questions:

      <ul>
        <li>
           Do we accept assertions made in <a href="BusinessArchitecture.html">BusinessArchitecture</a> (e.g. far too complex to model) in regards to <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a>?

        A researcher, who participated in significant projects in a few different continents, came in for a presentation at our workplace and argued the process of doing <a href="BusinessModeling.html">BusinessModeling</a> facilitates communication within the company as one benefit. I will try to get more of his thoughts but I have nothing to contribute; maybe the collective wisdom of this <a href="WikiCommunity.html">WikiCommunity</a> will provide sufficient enticement for him to provide more information and details.

        Meanwhile, I have to resort to research to add content to this page.

        The above expert did say from his work with various organizations he got to recognize a <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a> can have significant change within a short time period. (Gives a bit of a hint on his "vision" of <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a>.) He also recognizes multi-year IT projects do not change their course quickly (e.g. large <a href="EnterpriseResourcePlanning.html">EnterpriseResourcePlanning</a> package implementation, BTW <a href="WhyIsPayrollHard.html">WhyIsPayrollHard</a> is a good reading for those of us wanting not privileged with the <a href="BigPicture.html">BigPicture</a> of <a href="WhyAreWeAllHere.html">WhyAreWeAllHere</a> looking at <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a>).

        A proper <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a> will need consideration of the limited amount of capabilities that exist in the <a href="HumanResources.html">HumanResources</a>, and the limited speed that an <a href="OrganizationCulture.html">OrganizationCulture</a> can change.

        <strong>BusinessModel Equals Function</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        If you consider a particular business as a system, the BusinessModel corresponds pretty exactly to the function of that system. The business in operation is a combination of function and performance. As with many complex systems, it can sometimes be difficult to distinguish between the two. The <a href="BusinessModel.html">BusinessModel</a> includes the raw function of what economists refer to as its "industry" (it's a bank or an airline, a retailer or a newspaper, for example), but can also include particular ways of operating the raw function (a mortgage bank or low-cost airline, a discount retailer or a "quality" newspaper, for example). Thus the BusinessModel "function" can shade into "performance" when particular approaches to types of customer, levels of service and brand ethos are considered. As a general rule, it may seem easier to change the more peripheral "performance" aspects of the BusinessModel than the core "function"; it is more usual to add new "function" or remove existing "function".
