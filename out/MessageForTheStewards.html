        Message For The Stewards

      <p>
        <strong>As of 11-Oct-2006 6:15 p.m. </strong><a href="NewYorkCity.html">NewYorkCity</a> time, this page is "read-only" because I say so. Read it and ponder. Read it and weep. But don't contribute to it. Starting now, I will personally revert <em>all</em> contributions to this page until a consensus about how to refactor it is reached at the <a href="WikiWikiWebMessageBoard.html">WikiWikiWebMessageBoard</a> or elsewhere. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a><strong></strong>

        It was originally a message <em>for</em> the stewards, but is now effectively a message <em>from</em> the stewards, who are content-controllers as well, it seems, starting with this page!
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I see no evidence that the Stewards are controlling content. The Stewards endeavour to control undesirable and unsocial behaviour, in order to reduce unproductive conflict. Since this is a Wiki, behaviour is only manifest through changes to content, so the two can become confused. However, anyone who is familiar with the history here should be aware that the problem is Anon, not the Stewards.</em> -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      <p>
        [Funny, I thought Dave said he wasn't going to reply to Anon. Also, he is repeatedly reverting other changes which were not originally made by Anon, and removing a response (not to Anon, and mistakenly thought to be to Dave) signed by Earle. That is strange, as whilst the stewards wish to prevent edit wars, Dave is actively participating in one. Of course, Dave's now busy amending his own reply as well!]
      </p>
      <p>
        I can respond to whomever I like, and amend any of my own content however I like. My "rules" are my own to break, it's a Wiki, and I'm not banned. The <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> will stop the instant the banned user ceases to participate in it and goes away. I only engage in <a href="EditWars.html">EditWars</a> to enforce <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>s already in effect. Furthermore, I have endeavoured (perhaps not always successfully) to preserve the latest changes of any non-banned participant. Think of me as a non-Anon filter that permits edits from non-banned participants to pass unhindered, whilst extracting all banned contributions. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           The content of this page is not the point. Indeed, I've somewhat arbitrarily chosen this page to make a stand. The point is that Anon is banned and the ban must be enforced or it's meaningless. Would you rather he badgered you and changed the meaning of your contributions until you felt compelled to leave, and then wouldn't let you remove your <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> like he did to Colin? If a ban can't be enforced, what's to stop him? You might be next.
        </li>
        <li>
           If technical means of banning Anon are not forthcoming, then there is one and only one way to deal with Anon, and that's to show him that any attempt he makes to edit is utterly futile. Otherwise, you might as well let him run rampant. Hell, in that case you might as well invite RA back, for all that a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> means. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Doesn't this page make obvious that a <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> is ineffective as a wiki management tool? The efforts to enforce the <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>, their good intentions notwithstanding, are efforts in reinforcing failure. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
              <ul>
                <li>
                   I don't disagree, but do you have a better solution? We're caught between a rock & a hard place here, and I'm choosing the rock (manually enforcing the <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>) because the hard place (it becomes Anon's Wiki) seems worse. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
                  <ul>
                    <li>
                       I suppose we could start by the technically-enforced disallowing of editing of signed contributions, by other than the signee. Since putting your name after text essentially makes it "quoted material", it seems that it should stand with its creator, warts (if any) and all. I'd be in favor of allowing outright deletion of signed material as necessary, however, to reduce <a href="ThreadMode.html">ThreadMode</a>. I believe the implied ownership of signed contributions tends to make the originator "fall in love with their text". Falling in love with text seems counter to <a href="WikiNature.html">WikiNature</a> and may be a large part of the friction generated on this and other pages. -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                       Nice idea, but I think we can state with some assurance that a "technically-enforced" anything is not likely to be implemented on this Wiki any time before the heat-death of the universe, and probably not any time after that, either. Also, what you're describing sounds like a typical Web forum, e.g., PHPBB2. Nor does this have anything to do with "falling in love with text." It's entirely to do with the simple fact that an individual user referred to as "Anon" has been banned, mainly for reasons I've listed below. As a result, he is not permitted to edit. Period. Full stop. Etc. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
                    </li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Can we reach simple agreement with Anon on this point then without the need for technical enforcement? We formally lift the <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> on him in exchange for his agreement to not correct direct quotations or directly signed material? -- <a href="AndyPierce.html">AndyPierce</a>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           No. Point of history: A few days before the <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a> was announced in January, Doug and I tried to get Anon to agree not to edit contributions signed by either of us. Anon did not agree. -- <a href="ElizabethWiethoff.html">ElizabethWiethoff</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Indeed. I notice Anon has not jumped in to agree with this idea. In the past, offers of compromise have been met with arguments. It would appear that while we regard Anon as a problem for the reasons enumerated at the bottom of this page, Anon regards us as a problem because we do not give sufficient (i.e., utmost) priority to correct spelling, grammar, punctuation, spacing, order of lists, and other minutiae. Therein lies a fundamental clash of views, and Anon appears to be unwilling to compromise on his. Though, to his credit, he has indicated that he tries to confine batches of corrections to slow periods. However, his treatment of Colin was reprehensible. Any compromise after that would be tantamount to a slap on the wrist.</em> -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In other words, if Anon doesn't edit this page you won't know which edits to revert. Hence, this page really is useless. At best, it exists to tempt Anon to edit it, implicitly revoking the ban.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If Anon doesn't edit this page, I won't revert anything. And temptation or not, Anon is banned. You think we should tiptoe around Wiki, being careful not to awaken the sleeping Anon who might edit a page? I should be able to dangle the fat, tasty Carrots of Infinite Mispeling in front of his drooling maw, and he shouldn't bloody edit them. <strong>HE IS BANNED!</strong> Banned. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

               Some people reacted with the most <strong>extreme</strong> of moral outrage at this statement (6 months ago), as if it were inherently unforgivable to say such a thing, as if such a position were inherently and obviously the sheerest of evil. Unfortunately for them, it is simply the truth. Rather than arguing the point in regard to c2, simply observe that the very reasonable wiki site <strong>wikipedia</strong> has an official policy identical to that ("Wikipedia is not a democracy").

        It is not an "<a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>" in the traditional sense when the war is against the stewards. The stewards represent the owner of this wiki, whether one likes that or hates that.

        <em>You wrote: "Anyone who resists the stewards is putting themselves on the side of the bad guys, and that is a fact </em>'regardless<strong> of delusions of good intentions.

I therefore read your comment to mean that anyone, specifically like myself and Andy, who feels that this page should be deleted is taking the side of the "bad-guys" and delusional. I therefore think you are mistaken to suggest that I'm being unfair in applying my comment to you. The dichotomy, whether true or false, is yours. Your comments are surely not "neutral", and therefore neither are my responses. In my view, I am clearly NOT "on the side of the bad-guys" (as if there are only two sides) and I clearly disagree with the stewards about the status of this page. I therefore argue that your dichotomy is false. I suggest that your presentation of this false dichotomy in context at least creates the appearance of being the sort of polarizing demagogery that so plagues the US executive branch and its supporters. Surely you agree that when you offer a such a provocative contribution, you increase the likelihood of an equally provocative response. Not all of those responses come from "bad guys". That's about as neutral as I can make it. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

      <p>
        I'm going to respond to this, and I don't care if it's from Anon or someone else.
      </p>
      <p>
        Except for Doug, Earle, and others who have fought Anon in the past, you're right. I can't say I'm surprised, though. I'm sure most of you would just like me and Anon to go away so <a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a> won't be cluttered with crap. I've certainly felt the same way at times. I felt the same way when Elizabeth was reverting Anon's edits. I helped for a little while, and then I gave up. I thought it wasn't worth the effort.
      </p>
      <p>
        But I've changed my mind, and now I'm sorry I didn't help Elizabeth more.
      </p>
      <p>
        It <em>is</em> worth the effort, because if Anon isn't banned, history has shown that he will initially confine himself to minor changes, but will slowly escalate his activity until another crisis point is reached, like the one that happened most recently with Colin. Then another valued participant will leave, and another, and another. Left unchecked, eventually I suspect only Anon and the occasional wandering visitor will be left.
      </p>
      <p>
        If technical means can't be found to block Anon, then Ward might as well hand the Stewardship over to him. In fact, why stop there? Ward might as well give him <em>root</em> on the box, because that's effectively where we wind up. If every edit is subject to Anon's stamp of approval or an <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a> ensues, then it's no longer a collaborative forum, composed of people who cooperate as equals. It's simply Anon in charge. It becomes Anon's Wiki.
      </p>
      <p>
        I still believe in the notion of a collaborative forum, where folks voluntarily cooperate, communicate, collaborate, and where necessary, compromise. Anon has proven incapable of these things and even actively works against them. I think they're worth fighting for. That, as far as I can see, means reverting Anon's edits on sight. If someone has a better suggestion, I'd be delighted to hear it, as long as it doesn't mean handing the reins over to Anon. As far as I am concerned, that would be intolerable.

        <li>
           It followed a period of increasing volume of trivial edits, some with comments (complaints, mostly) injected into the material.

        <li>
           I don't know whether Dave had this in mind, but the ban also came a few days after Anon admitted to Doug and me that Anon used to be 217.137, who had gotten into horrendous <a href="EditWar.html">EditWar</a>s a year and two earlier. It's because of those wars that Wiki came to a halt in the spring of 2005 and we now have <a href="NewRecentChanges.html">NewRecentChanges</a>, <a href="WardsWikiStewards.html">WardsWikiStewards</a>, <a href="CodeWord.html">CodeWord</a>s, and the whole screwy security shebang. -- Eliz

        Anon is not the typical troll who deliberately seeks attention.  Anon is <em>something else</em>.  What that might be, I can only speculate, but this page and its history provides ample evidence of the problems he causes.  You might note that Anon is now actively spoofing <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>s in order to sustain edits.  Doesn't that disgust you?  Rather than complain about the existence of this page and let it be deleted -- presumably so we can effectively kiss Anon's ass and get back to the business of collectively being his bitch -- it would be nice to see more people take an active stand against his grossly unethical and anti-Wiki behaviour. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        <em>Dave, I started reading this wiki about this time of year nine years ago, in autumn of 1997. Some of the text from that period is still here. I'd like you contemplate what image of you a visitor of 2015 (nine years from now) will take away from this page, and whether phrases like "presumably so we can effectively kiss Anon's ass and get back to the business of collectively being his bitch" enhance or detract from the image you intend to convey to that future visitor. Now I'd like to remind you that so long as this page stays at or near the end of </em><a href="RecentChanges.html">RecentChanges</a>, you convey that same image to each 2006 visitor. Are you certain this is the way you want the wider world to know you? I share your disgust with the behavior of this particular anon. As your own frustration with this disgusting behavior demonstrates, the current approach isn't working. However that problem gets solved, you are now part of the problem. Your own behavior is far easier to change than whoever this anon is. In this page, it is YOU and, for example, <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a> who are attacking and insulting ME. I came within a hairsbreadth last night of doing my own <a href="WikiMindWipe.html">WikiMindWipe</a> of the 400-odd pages I'm mentioned on, and I promise that if I do reach that point, I'll be much less gentle than Colin was. Your insults, and this kind of immature cat-fighting, is just as problematic as the behavior you seek to prevent. When you attack those who want this page deleted as you did above, you make yourself far more personally offensive to me than anything anon has done to date. Please try and keep that in mind as you perpetuate this exercise. -- <a href="TomStambaugh.html">TomStambaugh</a><em></em>

        As I'm sure you are all aware, the person who used to post as 82-44-94-98.cable.ubr04.croy.blueyonder.co.uk, sometimes known as Anon, sometimes known as BlueYonder, is now using OpenProxy addresses to continue to post here, despite the announced <a href="HardBan.html">HardBan</a>. Currently he is using ge1-0.cc1.cpt1.alter.net (a confirmed OpenProxy) and is, for example, constantly removing the list of addresses he is using from <a href="ReverseIpLookup.html">ReverseIpLookup</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        The recent withdrawal of the <a href="CodeWord.html">CodeWord</a> was obviously intended to stop this sort of behaviour, only allowing trusted parties to post. This clearly isn't working, as he continues to post. Either:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           he has the "back-door" <a href="CodeWord.html">CodeWord</a>
        </li>
        <li>
           the code word withdrawal is not blanket, and he is not caught by it.

      </ul>
      <p>
        I have long admired the spirit of openness and trust, cooperation and collaboration that <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> has fostered. I have seen vandals, <a href="WikiPuppy.html">WikiPuppy</a>s and excited newbies of all flavours come and go, and this wiki has survived. No doubt it will survive the current edit wars. I just wish the problem would go away so we can get back to being constructive.
      </p>
      <p>
        The obsessive behaviour that first drew our attention to this individual - the insistence on <strong>One True Spelling</strong> and <strong>One True Grammar</strong>, the mindless adherence to rules, and the unwillingness or inability to engage in any meaningful dialogue - probably mean that he won't go away. I recognize that there is only so much that can be done with someone who constantly abuses the freedoms given, especially when it is those very freedoms that make this wiki what it is.

      </p>
      <p>
        That would be useful, but it wasn't the obsessive gnoming of itself that led to the problem. It was the inability or unwillingness to listen when people asked him to back off a little. That, combined with editing signed personal comments when directly asked not to. The gnoming itself was OK, except for the remorseless and relentless application of "rules" that were not universally accepted.

        Wait a mo! How can a wiki with a constantly changing pool of editors have content rules which are universally accepted? Even a straightforward rule asking for politeness will soon be ignored when any two people are mutually convinced that their own views are correct, but the other's views are completely wrong. They may not call each other ignorant jackasses straight away, but the debate will tend to progress in that direction. Also, what happens if someone objects to universally accepted rules, so that the basic concept itself isn't universally accepted?

        <em>There's no way you can count how many good new people you turned away from wiki, and how many old contributors no longer bother to be active. Now let me explain this extremely simple thing to you, cause you guys seem too hard-headed to even think about it:</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Ward is a very nice guy, but he is extremely busy. Never mind, he's a personality. Not only that, but his inbox would be full even without "help, my IP is banned." traffic, but many good people don't even find the courage to write to Ward. It's understandable if you step outside your "way too important" (wiki steward / old guy's club) shoes. Even for people who write to him, it's not unlikely that Ward reads his email with 2 weeks or more delay. He is simply too busy a person for you to pretend that such a mechanism works for a wiki community who respects itself.
        </li>
        <li>
           You guys are a bunch. And you are not personalities. Some of you might even have plenty of time to kill, judging by energy spent and reaction time. So you guys can together monitor a group email much more efficiently.
        </li>
        <li>
           Obviously now for me it is easy to send an email to those whom I know, eventually copy Ward, but that's beside the point. The point is that a willing visitor who might have something valuable to say <strong>will not email Ward</strong> (I personally know two instances of this case from my private email, although I tried to encourage the persons in question), but such people could email to a group address. Even if they email Ward, they may just give up because of the reaction time.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Now why do I have to tell you all the obvious stuff? And why do you always have to come up with all the lamest excuses, instead of thinking just a little bit more. You've got the power to ban, and anything beyond that, you could not care less, or at least it doesn't show at all.</em>
      </p>
      <p>

      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Then you can shut up, </em>'take responsibility<strong>, and assume it is </strong>your<strong> lack of understanding. And because you are not willing to communicate, you cannot break the vicious circle of the self-righteous, know it all, but who does not quite know it. Tragic though it may be, it is entirely your choice to defend this absurdity when you really cannot. Ward gave you power to be exercised with discretion. Nobody really controls how much discretion you exercise, and it is bloody obvious that you exercise </strong>none<strong>. Not you, </strong><a href="DanMuller.html">DanMuller</a>, but the group as a whole. And that is disgraceful.<em></em>

        For all Costin's hyperbole, since the current system was introduced, Wiki has spent <em>more</em> time than ever before with <em>less</em> barriers in place. The current situation is just like previous ones, to wit: 1) we go ShieldsUp for a while 2) whatever nerd is causing trouble gets bored and goes away 3) shields go down again.

I can see that you relish your self-appointed position as the voice of the howling oppressed masses, but you need to bear these things in mind: firstly, IP blocks are transient. Secondly, being unable to edit wiki is simply not that important. It may be to you, but this is not actually the centre of the online universe and the Acropolis of internet communities. Life does not come to a halt if you are unable to edit. If being unable to edit makes someone feel that it does, I suggest they take a deep breath and switch the computer off for a while. -- EarleMartin

By the way, who was that brave dude claiming to speak in the name of the "community" and claiming to be a steward? I mean, it could have been somebody masquerading as a steward, but that's highly improbable cause he had to know within minutes that David Liu was really being banned? He was not brave enough to reveal to me who he was, so now instead of trusted stewards, it looks like we have a group with show offish personalities, and that's why I am willing to bet that at least part of the blanket IP blackouts could have been easily avoidable, should you have exercised more discretion.

It took god-damn <strong>forever</strong> for this site to respond meaningfully to R*****A****** (and no, "please leave, Robert" in a chat doesn't count, when dealing with a nutbar like Abitbol). The current solution - which none of us know what it is as TheStewards ain't saying - seems to be little better; BlueYonder is still running round, thinking he's RobertDeNiro in <em>Brazil</em>, and more than a few innocent users seem unable to access the Wiki.

           And I'll stick my neck out, and I'll claim there are most likely two types of IP patterns, one that are permanently banned (requires manual intervention to unban) - that these exists is bloody obvious and disclosing the contents of this category would create no security breach whatsoever. And the other category of IP patterns (and possibly domain name as well) are likely those that expire automatically after a certain time. If it were my system, the time would be configurable on per-pattern basis. They fear that publishing the second category would allow a script-kiddie to cycle and select the available web proxies according to the dates when they are automatically unbanned. And because they're not willing to discuss details (such details <strong>can</strong> be discussed without compromising security, unless you chronically lack imagination).

        <li>
           In any case, the security by obscurity <strong>does not work</strong>. Blueyonder will get half the Europe and a quarter California banned because stewards probably ban one class B pattern (or larger) at a time. And even if those bans are allowed to expire, the damage to wiki's image when so many newcomer and old contributors alike faced with some silent, impersonal, and patently absurd denial is irreparable.

That's all I'm going to say about it. I think the email idea is good. I wasn't opposed to that.

        I agree beyond a certain point the "excesses" need to be dealt with. And back to the edit which I reverted. Did persistent public "name calling" by itself achieve anything useful? Take for example the <a href="PissedOffAndExtremelyAngry.html">PissedOffAndExtremelyAngry</a> page, I respect the author, and his feelings as well, and beyond that, I sometimes feel similarly towards excessive petty edits. But has that page, and its discussions, resulted in anything useful? I am assuming the named "Anon" person has been operating for a year or longer, and is still around doing similar things.

      <p>
        <em>I've long since lost track of who edited what page when. The issue with anon is distinct from the </em><a href="PissedOffAndExtremelyAngry.html">PissedOffAndExtremelyAngry</a> page. I don't know whether that page and its discussions have resulted in anything useful. I'm reasonably sure that this wiki has dozens and perhaps hundreds of pages less useful. The <strong>behavior</strong> of anon, like RA before him and some others, is what is pathological -- and pathological in a way that harms the community. That's why he was banned. Wiping a restaurant table with a sponge isn't harmful. A person who, on the other hand, wipes the same table with the same sponge continuously for hours, without regard to whether anyone is sitting there, should be removed from the restaurant. Telling the manager about the behavior isn't advocating sloppiness, no matter what the table-wiper might say.

        In each case, the community standards that are implicitly understood and accepted by the majority, and which have apparently supported effective collaboration for over a decade, were flouted by a handful of individuals and led to conflict. Hence, these individuals were banned.
      </p>
      <p>
        While some may complain that one or more bans have occurred without warning, it must be emphasised that <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> is a privately-owned service that provides public access. That access is a privilege extended by Ward and enforced by the Stewards; it is not a fundamental right. Therefore, it is no more unfair or unjust to ban a troublesome user from <a href="WardsWiki.html">WardsWiki</a> -- without warning -- than to evict and permanently bar an unruly patron from a restaurant, pub, store, or theatre. In every case, the banned parties received ample warning that their behaviour was disruptive and undesirable long before any ban occurred, whether a ban was explicitly threatened or not. Therefore, they have only themselves to blame for being banned. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some banned individuals have persisted in circumventing bans via various means, even to the point of continuing the behaviour that led to their bans in the first place. For obvious reasons, I would encourage <a href="WikiZens.html">WikiZens</a> to delete contributions from banned individuals whenever there is a reasonable assurance that it is, in fact, a banned individual.
      </p>
      <p>
        Cooperative and collaborative behaviour is easy and rewarding. One can only speculate on the reasons why a small handful of individuals expend an enormous amount of time and unproductive energy opposing this, thereby making productive and pleasant interaction significantly difficult for themselves and slightly difficult for others. -- <a href="DaveVoorhis.html">DaveVoorhis</a>

        I would like to applaud the efforts that the stewards apply to try to solve this sticky problem. I know it can be tough and frustrating and that there are back-seat drivers who are never happy about the techniques you all try. So, I wish to give you some kudos in appreciation. -- top
