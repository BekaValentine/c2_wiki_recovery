        Capture Requirements For Implementation
      </h1>
      <p>
        When all we are trying to do is <a href="CaptureRequirementsForPrioritization.html">CaptureRequirementsForPrioritization</a>, they can be LowPrecision. But when we want to build the system, we have to <a href="CaptureRequirementsForImplementation.html">CaptureRequirementsForImplementation</a>, and these have to be HighPrecision. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="UseCase.html">UseCase</a> is the classical way to do this, filling in all of the sections on one of the more complete templates. (I recommend the excellent one that <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a> has made available on his website.)
      </p>
      <p>
        With the <a href="BigDesignUpFront.html">BigDesignUpFront</a> approach, we would probably complete <a href="RequirementsAnalysis.html">RequirementsAnalysis</a> before moving into design. 
      </p>
      <p>
        With the ExecutableArchitecture approach from <a href="GradyBooch.html">GradyBooch</a>, you pick the ArchitecturallySignificantUseCases and fully elaborate these prior to designing the system Architecture. The rest of <a href="RequirementsAnalysis.html">RequirementsAnalysis</a> would occur incrementally in Construction phases.
      </p>
      <p>
        With the ExtremeApproach, after picking the <a href="SystemMetaphor.html">SystemMetaphor</a>, elaboration of the Requirements is very incremental. Using the prioritized <a href="UserStory.html">UserStory</a> as a reminder, the Users get to explain what they really meant and then they get to design the tests.
