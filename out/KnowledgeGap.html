        In RAFAEL I learned a 4-level system of <a href="KnowledgeGap.html">KnowledgeGap</a>-s used for assessing <a href="TechnicalRisk.html">TechnicalRisk</a>-s:
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 1 - We have done this before.</strong>
        In hardware, this means fabricating again the same thing. In software, it means reusing almost all the code, maybe with some minor adjustments (like fonts and colors).
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 2 - We have done similar things before.</strong>
        This is the gap involved in most new projects. For example: Porting an existing system to a different environment. The system is not new, the environment is not new - only the combination is new.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 3 - Someone else has done this before.</strong>
        Getting into a new business or technological field. For example: Adopting OO technologies.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Level 4 - It has never been done before.</strong>
        The good stuff :) The first space shuttle would be a good example.
      </p>
      <p>
        Risk was assessed based on the level of <a href="KnowledgeGap.html">KnowledgeGap</a> and the project estimated complexity.

        This looks vaguely similar to the so-called <a href="OrdersOfIgnorance.html">OrdersOfIgnorance</a>.

        <em>The knowledge gap theory was first proposed by Tichenor, Donohue and Olien at the University of Minnesota in the 70s. They believe that the increase of information in society is not evenly acquired by every member of society: people with higher socioeconomic status tend to have better ability to acquire information (Weng, S.C. 2000). This leads to a division of two groups: a group of better-educated people who know more about most things, and those with low education who know less.</em>
