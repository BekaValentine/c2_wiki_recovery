        Was once an online bookstore for techies, but it has been acquired by Barnes & Noble.  The website now redirects to <a href="http://www.barnesandnoble.com/">http://www.barnesandnoble.com/</a>

        All the Computer Literacy stores are closed. I miss them a lot. Can computer related book stores make money any more?

        OK, sidenote: I just spent a couple days at <a href="IntelCorporation.html">IntelCorporation</a>'s SC5 building in SantaClara. Across the street the building's sign said <a href="FatBrain.html">FatBrain</a>. I forgot what they do, or did, and don't know whether the sign is still there because the name is alive or no one thought to take it down.

        I don't tend to remember any Intel locations, since I've never been inside one, but as for Computer Literacy/Fatbrain: The biggest brick and mortar was actually north San Jose I believe, but close to Santa Clara, in a business complex at N. 1st street and Trimble, in an area unusual in that it was close to 237, 880/17 <strong>and</strong> 101, a couple miles north of the airport. Was that it? The original rather small location was off Lawrence Expressway close to freeway 101, in either Sunnyvale or Santa Clara. If there was a third location it's slipped my mind.

        Anyway, either of those sound right? <strong>Yes, third location was in Apple's HQ building in Cupertino. They also had a store in suburban Washington, DC, I think on the Virginia side.</strong>
