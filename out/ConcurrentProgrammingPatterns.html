        Concurrent Programming Patterns
      </h1>
      <p>
        I think that the standard concurrent programming material
        would be easier to understand if it were presented in
        pattern form.  You are welcome to watch while I stumble
        around and figure out whether I am right.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've heard people claim that concurrent programming is
        actually easier than sequential programming.  Moreover,
        they didn't seem to be joking!  In spite of spending
        several years thinking of concurrent programming, it has
        always seemed a lot harder to me.  Concurrent programming
        is programming with multiple processes, which implies that
        several things can be happening simultaneously.  Of course,
        "simultaneously" doesn't necessarily mean that they happen at the same
        time, it just means that you don't know which happens
        first, and that they might be happening at the same time.

        One key pattern of concurrent programming is <a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a>,
        which is what you use to keep processes from interfering
        with each other.  You can think of <a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a> as what
        you use to keep from having too much concurrency.  But
        unwise use of <a href="CriticalSection.html">CriticalSection</a> can lead to <a href="DeadLock.html">DeadLock</a>,
        <a href="LiveLock.html">LiveLock</a> (or Starvation, but that can't be a name here),
        and <a href="ResourceContention.html">ResourceContention</a>, which are all problems that lead
        to other patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        These patterns work in a variety of
        <a href="ConcurrentExecutionEnvironments.html">ConcurrentExecutionEnvironments</a>, each with its own
        <a href="ConstellationOfForces.html">ConstellationOfForces</a>.
