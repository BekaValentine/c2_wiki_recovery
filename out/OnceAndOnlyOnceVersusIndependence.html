        Once And Only Once Versus Independence
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> seems to sometimes conflict with black-box independence. Factoring out repetition sometimes results in the need to create global or module-level variables. Examples:

        Independent version:
      </p>
      <code>
        function stuff() {<br/>
        declare glab, zob;<br/>
        ...<br/>
        foo(glab, zob, 10, "nog");<br/>
        foo(glab, zob, 2, "17");<br/>
        foo(glab, zob, 47, "gloop");<br/>
        foo(glab, zob, 8, "toog");<br/>
        foo(glab, zob, 242, "n");<br/>
        foo(glab, zob, 532, "bork");<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
        function foo(glab, zob, nork, bling) {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        x = something(glab, nork);<br/>
        y = somethingAlso(zob, bling);<br/>
        ...<br/>
        } <br/>
      </code>

        Dependent version:

      <code>
        declare glab, zob;  // module-level vars<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        function stuff() {<br/>
        foo(10, "nog");<br/>
        foo(2, "17");<br/>
        foo(47, "gloop");<br/>
        foo(8, "toog");<br/>
        foo(242, "n");<br/>
        foo(532, "bork");<br/>
        ...<br/>
        }<br/>
        function foo(nork, bling) {<br/>
        ...<br/>
        x = something(glab, nork);  // note use of "glab"<br/>
        y = somethingAlso(zob, bling);  // note use of "zob"<br/>
        ...<br/>
        } <br/>

      <p>
        Another variation would be Pascal-like nested routines that can nest scope, but it is fairly close to the second example as far as consequences.
      </p>
      <p>
        Another possibility is to put the parameters into a structure(s), but that is often over-engineering and many languages don't make such very easy.
      </p>
      <p>
        I tend to lean toward the second style if there are more than 6 or so calls, especially if the "foo" routine is something specific to the given module rather than intended to be a generic library function. Some suggest that every function should be designed to be generic or reusable. But I lean toward <a href="YagNi.html">YagNi</a> on that: wait until it is clear that something is going to be reused. Only about one in ten end up reusable anyhow, even with re-work.
