        Persistence In Delphi
      </h1>
      <p>
        Somebody said <a href="PersistenceInDelphi.html">PersistenceInDelphi</a> was tricky compared to other languages. They may be right.
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyway, there is the open source Techinsite persistence framework that you could use. See <a href="http://www.techinsite.com.au">http://www.techinsite.com.au</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Or if you have $3000, there is Bold. See <a href="http://www.boldsoft.com">http://www.boldsoft.com</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        These are both big beasts. Bold is huge and does a lot more than just object persistence.

        Basically, creating a TPersistent and then making sure you cannot make it persistent
        (only TComponent can be used with a TStream). Stephan Eggermont

        Stephen, You're assuming that everyone wants to persist stuff to a stream. What TPersistent does is two fold - it ensures that all Published declarations show up as <a href="RunTimeTypeInformation.html">RunTimeTypeInformation</a>, and it introduces the Assign() method for assignment compatibility.
      </p>
      <p>
        You can build everything else you need on top of that foundation. Yes, it would be nice if Delphi came with more predefined mechanisms, but I suspect that even then people would be asking for more. After all, if I remember correctly, <a href="CeeSharp.html">CeeSharp</a> has 7 (or is it 9?) distinct persistance mechanisms as standard.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you haven't looked at it, look at the RTTI units that get installed with Delphi - they make it reasonably simple (well, not horrendously complicated) to write generic routines to load and save most any object, even those with cross references.
