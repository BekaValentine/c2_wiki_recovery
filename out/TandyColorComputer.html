        Tandy Color Computer
      </h1>
      <p>
        Home computer sold through Radio Shack in the 80's. Sometimes referred to as TRS-80 Color Computer, which is a misnomer because it used the Motorola 6809 CPU instead of the Zilog Z-80 used in the monochrome TRS-80s. <em>Tandy referred to it as "TRS-80 Color Computer". That was printed on the box. They used the "TRS-80" brand on many different computers, regardless of CPU.</em>

        Known as the Co<strong>'Co (short for Color Computer) by users. It was a popular hobbyist machine, but lagged behind the like of the Atari (400 and 800) and Commodore 64 as a games machine. The Color Computer lacked dedicated sound hardware, sprite support, and, ironically, didn't support as many colors (until the Color Computer III was released in 1986).</strong>

        There were three models Color Computer I, II, and III. There wasn't a significant difference between I and II as far as architecture and hardware were concerned. The Color Computer III represented a leap forward, supporting 16 colors from a palette of 64, and a memory manager unit that enabled swapping in and out memory "pages" to circumvent the addressing limit of 64K.

        Coco I & II could run <a href="MicrowareOsNine.html">MicrowareOsNine</a>. Color Computer III was capable of running <a href="MicrowareOsNine.html">MicrowareOsNine</a> Level II.

        <em>How can you leave out it's infamous nickname, the TRaSh-80? Which makes even more sense, as TRS stands for Tandy/Radio Shack???</em>

        I beg to differ. The Trash-80 referred to the original TRS-80, which was a monochrome machine that looked suspiciously like a VT-100 terminal. The Color Computer was a completely different machine that didn't wear the same moniker.

        [I had a Coco and all my friends called it a Trash-80. Anything with the TRS-80 logo on it was fair game. (The original Color Computer had a TRS-80 logo on the little plastic button on top of the case.)  And who can blame them? <a href="RadioShack.html">RadioShack</a> was not hip.]
