        Instanceof At Layer Boundaries
      </h1>
      <p>
        We're told that use of instanceof is a <a href="CodeSmell.html">CodeSmell</a>.  But we're also told that a <a href="FourLayerArchitecture.html">FourLayerArchitecture</a> is the way to structure systems.  How do we prevent use of instanceof at layer boundaries - especially between the application and domain layers?  I see a lot of things like: if object is of this type, show this corresponding form, etc.  Just a thought...

        Use polymorphism.  That's what it's for.  In particular, you're not usually looking for a specific type as much as you are a particular behavior.  So you may choose to have yor domain objects implement things like "String formType()" that returns a generic name that might correspond to a form class.  Your Form Generator could then use an if statement to look that up, or look it up in a <a href="HashMap.html">HashMap</a> of keys to Form types read from a file.

        Another option is to use double-dispatch. For instance, a Form generator sends "getDisplay()" to the domainObject. The <a href="DomainObject.html">DomainObject</a> sends "displayFor(self)" back to the Form generator.  The Form Generator has a bunch of displayFor() methods each overridden for a particular domain object type.  That returns the display type, that is then returned back to the domain object message and thus back to the Form generator. --<a href="KyleBrown.html">KyleBrown</a>
