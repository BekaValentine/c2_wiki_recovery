        Provide Customer Value
      </h1>
      <p>
        Perhaps you have a wheel-barrow full of cash burning a whole in your pocket that you'd like to see turned into a mountain of cash or perhaps you think you can convince someone with a wheel-barrow full of cash to lend it to you.  You aren't sure how to turn this mole hill into a mountain.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Therefore...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Provide customer value.
      </p>
      <p>
        Provide a product or service that, in some way, improves the lives of some group of people.  Ensure that your product/service either saves people time or makes their existing available time more fun.  This ensures that you are providing your customers with an increase in the amount of their enjoyable time.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>But...</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Make certain that the amount of enjoyment you provide your customers is at least equal to the amount of joy that you give up in order to provide the product/service.  If not, you will quickly grow to dislike your own life and begin blaming the very customers you intended to help in the first place.

      <p>
        <em>Consequences...</em>

           The net joy in the world increases
        </li>
        <li>
           Competitors are attracted to providing a similar product/service forcing you to either increase the joy that you provide your customers or decrease the joy which you give up to produce product/service.
