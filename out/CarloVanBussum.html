        <em>Dude, as far as I can see, you haven't created anything.  If Etc isn't just a hoax, where can I download a compiler/interpreter from, or find something more enlightening than a tutorial on "transclusive folds" and "quadrant leverage"?  I mean, it's </em>'almost<em>' funny...</em>

        I believe etc these days is included in most linux distributions. I believe it's in my debian at least.

           In fact, the Linux system is very dependent on the etc distribution.  I tried removing it and the system would no longer start!
