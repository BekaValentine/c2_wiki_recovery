        Problems With On Site Customer

        At my last contract, the other guy on the project and I introduced a couple of practices at a time (eventually getting up to about half). Some were easy to sell: for <a href="PairProgramming.html">PairProgramming</a>, I just dragged my partner over to my cube and started programming with him. Once we were started, it was hard to stop. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Some were harder to sell, such as the <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a>. Our manager was our <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a>. He really did know more about what the program should do than anyone else in the building. When we went to him with a bunch of estimated <a href="StoryCard.html">StoryCard</a>s that we'd created from his list of features, his first reaction was, "This is too hard." But we kind of dragged him through it: we made him sort them into "Now", "Later", and "Maybe Never" piles, then asked him about rearranging one or two stories so the "Now" pile would fit in our first two-week iteration. It took about forty-five minutes, and while we didn't ask him if he still thought it was hard, I think we'd changed his mind.

        Maybe this is a general pattern for selling <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>: <a href="TasteTheSoup.html">TasteTheSoup</a>.

        <em>"Our manager was our </em><a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a>"<em> Doesn't sound like XP to me. </em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Well, doing only half the practices hardly counts as XP either. So keep a caveat in mind for what follows: This may not apply to you, your project, or any XP project; your life may be vastly improved by never reading it at all. But I think it's probably broadly applicable, and it raises some interesting issues, so: 
      </p>
      <p>
        The guy we had as our <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a> was a mechanical engineer by training who knew a lot about the problem domain and how actual engineers got actual work done in it. When I say he was our "manager", I mean he was the one who got us our budget, fought the rest of the organization to keep us from getting cannibalized, asked us to fill out various legume-enumeration reporting devices, etc. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The company had no sales or marketing organization, which is usually where you'd find an internal <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a>. Additionally, the product was being developed for a sister company, rather than some big external market (though, in my opinion, management never realized how broadly applicable the product is). 
      </p>
      <p>
        So was he the ideal <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a>? No: he didn't have to use the software to get his job done. Was he better than some random MBA? Definitely: he'd done the things the software was supposed to help with, and had a theoretical knowledge of the area to go with that practical knowledge. Did the fact that he was formally our "superior" hamper him in his role as Customer? No: we had a very free hand in how we got things done. As I said, we even got him to do some XP things. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Would one of the actual users of the software have been a better <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a>? Yes, but there really was no chance in hell we could get one of them to our location for the project; we couldn't even get down to their location to orient them to the software. (You'd think the fact that the users were in a sister company would make this easier, wouldn't you?) 
      </p>
      <p>
        The lesson I learned (but see caveat, above): One of the ways a big, rigid organization hampers <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> is by making it hard to get a good <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a>. 
      </p>

        I would say that the <a href="OnSiteCustomer.html">OnSiteCustomer</a> is the biggest shortcoming of XP. It simply is not practical for the vast majority of projects and a better requirements gathering and evaluation is needed. [I raise this as a problem in its implementation; the presentation of XP to "non-believers" has a lot of other problems.] -- <a href="WayneMack.html">WayneMack</a> 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"It simply is not practical."</em> I think this is one of those places where something new and different looks impractical, even if it isn't. <a href="CodeUnitTestFirst.html">CodeUnitTestFirst</a> didn't look very practical to me at first, nor did <a href="TestEverythingThatCouldPossiblyBreak.html">TestEverythingThatCouldPossiblyBreak</a>, or even ConstantRefactoring. If you want to do XP, you have to re-examine ideas about what's practical and what's possible. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my case, I think it would have been pretty easy for a multi-billion-dollar company to take a mechanical engineer and put him up in a different state for a couple of months. If that would blow the project budget (hard, given that it was in the hundreds of thousands of dollars, but still possible), here are some alternatives: 
      </p>
      <p>
        Tell one of the (off-site) users that his top priorities are answering the developers' questions over the phone and specifying <a href="AcceptanceTest.html">AcceptanceTest</a>s; fly him up for <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> sessions. Ditto, but fly the developers to the customer location for <a href="PlanningGame.html">PlanningGame</a> sessions. Assign the project to a development group that's closer to the customer (with being in the same room the ideal).
      </p>
      <p>
        These are all clearly within the abilities of the company in question. So it's not a question of "practical, given our resources", but rather, "practical, given our politics and managerial will and commitment to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>".
