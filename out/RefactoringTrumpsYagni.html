        Refactoring Trumps Yagni
      </h1>
      <p>
        This is my take on the less-aggressively-phrased argument in <a href="OaooBalancesYagni.html">OaooBalancesYagni</a> or <a href="SimpleDesignTrumpsYagni.html">SimpleDesignTrumpsYagni</a>
        (Yagni = <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a>).

        From <a href="http://www.purpletech.com/xp/bootstrap.txt">http://www.purpletech.com/xp/bootstrap.txt</a> :
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>
          /6/2002: The past three sessions, my pairs and I have been refactoring the
        </li>
      </ol>
      <p>
        Library and Item classes to be more object-oriented.  This follows one
        of my big revelations, which I'm sure every Extreme Programmer must
        learn, and must constantly relearn:
      </p>
      <p>
        Simple Design trumps YAGNI
      </p>
      <p>
        meaning that writing clean, clear, object-oriented code is very
        important, and that if you have a choice between (a) leaving your code
        smelly and implementing a new feature, or (b) refactoring and letting
        the feature wait a little while, you should refactor.
      </p>
      <p>
        Unfortunately, if you let your refactoring duties slip, you will end up
        needing to perform a lot of refactorings with fairly large scope.
        See <a href="NoseJobRefactoring.html">NoseJobRefactoring</a> for one technique for accomplishing this.
      </p>
      <p>
        The bigger lesson, of course, is
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't Check Your Brain At The Door
      </p>
      <p>
        and that we should have been doing these OO refactorings all along.
        Maybe even as soon as we got the code to work using "String title", we
        should have taken half a step back, applied the "Replace Value With
        Object" refactoring, and been satisfied that we had made the code more
        aesthetically pleasing and therefore better --
      </p>
      <p>
        -- <em>even though</em> it wasn't to satisfy a user story.
      </p>
      <p>
        In other words, refactoring is a <em>technical</em> decision, not a business decision,
        and the customer has no right to tell us not to do it (even if he does
        so implicitly, or if it's just our own puritanical super-egos saying
        "Work!  Be more productive!  Don't refactor, write a new story!").

        My take on <a href="YouArentGonnaNeedIt.html">YouArentGonnaNeedIt</a> has always been that it applies to
        <em>additions</em> to functionality (including under-the-hood ones).
        Under this understanding, one would never even think to skip
        refactoring (or other <a href="SimpleDesign.html">SimpleDesign</a> activities).
      </p>
      <p>
        I know Yagni is one of those hammers that makes everything look like a
        nail, and once the scales fall from your eyes it's tempting to find
        lots of things you don't really need to be doing now.  Still, I don't
        think it's intended to apply to anything but <em>added complexity</em>
        (which is clear if you read a lot of the arguments for Yagni, with
        their references to carrying costs and the like).
      </p>
      <p>
        Perhaps it's time to rename it: YouArentGonnaNeedThatFeature,
        or YouArentGonnaNeedThatInfrastructure,
        or YouArentGonnaNeedThatComplexity, or
        YouArentGonnaNeedThatComplication, or maybe
        YouArentGonnaNeedThatYet....
