      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Problem:</strong> Databases are a drag.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Solution: Don't use a DB until you really need it. When you think you
        really need it, you probably don't, so hold off some more. When you
        are completely sure that you need a DB, get a second opinion. When the
        second opinion agrees that you need a DB, ask a contrarian like Ron
        Jeffries for a third opinion. When everyone agrees that you really
        need a DB, start with the most agile (Prevayler) and then work your
        way down (Flat file, Object DB) until you hit rock-bottom (Relational
        DB).  <em>Love it!</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Problem:</strong> Databases are expensive.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Solution: For the love of Cher, if you need a relational DB, start
        with a free one and gradually work your way down to a non-free one
        when it starts to make financial sense.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Problem:</strong> Relational databases are fundamentally incompatible with Object-Oriented design.  (This is not an insult; they use fundamentally different data models.)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Solution: Use a truly robust object-relational mapping tool.  Everyone
        seems to be saying great things about Hibernate these days.

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Problem:</strong>  Database schemas are traditionally difficult to change.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Solution: Design for change.  See Fowler's article

        Speaking of this problem, I know of at least one gent in the Atlanta XP group who was talking about making a database refactoring tool. Aside from waiting on that, there is an extent project to help with continuous integration and database changes at <a href="http://migratosaur.dev.java.net">http://migratosaur.dev.java.net</a>

      <ul>
        <li>
           <strong>Problem:</strong> Stored procedures are difficult to change for some of the same reasons as database schemas (especially the reasons related to corporate policy and politics). Additionally, since they are process, rather than data,  they are more likely to require change, and there aren't any great tools, such as refactoring tools for working with them. --<a href="DougSwartz.html">DougSwartz</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Solution: Don't use stored procedures.

        <em>Problem: Databases are a drag. </em>
      </p>

        I like databases. I agree that some vendors make them a pain, but I do not find them a drag as a tool. They are a high-level tool (if you use them right), just like a high-level programming language. -- A <a href="RelationalWeenie.html">RelationalWeenie</a>
