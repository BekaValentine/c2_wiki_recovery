        This page was created because <a href="ComponentDesignPatternsDiscussion.html">ComponentDesignPatternsDiscussion</a> is too big.  The intent of these discussion pages it to allow folks to discuss issues related to the <a href="ComponentDesignPatterns.html">ComponentDesignPatterns</a>.

        A meme born from re-reading the <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> pattern allowed me to establish the following taxonomy:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Where do you get them?
          <ul>
            <li>
               Component reuse patterns
            </li>
            <li>
               Component development patterns
            </li>
            <li>
               Component acquisition patterns
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Where do you put them?
          <ul>
            <li>
               Foreign space patterns
            </li>
            <li>
               Domestic space patterns
            </li>
            <li>
               Component deployment patterns
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           And how do they interconnect?
          <ul>
            <li>
               Creational connection patterns
            </li>
            <li>
               Structural connection patterns
            </li>
            <li>
               Behavioral connection patterns
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        What do folks think about this?  For example, <a href="ComponentBus.html">ComponentBus</a> helps you in the component interconnection creational and structural ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        --<a href="PhilipEskelin.html">PhilipEskelin</a>
      </p>
      <p>
        Can you explain what "creational", "structural" and "behavioural" mean in the context of component connection patterns? --<a href="NatPryce.html">NatPryce</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        "Creational" connection patterns are design patterns that can help you do connections between components better.  For example, when many smaller components running on a desktop in the same process or virtual machine access the same component on a remote server, <a href="ConnectionSingleton.html">ConnectionSingleton</a> helps you manage connection resources better by allowing all components to share a single created resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="ConnectionFlyweight.html">ConnectionFlyweight</a> and ConnectionObserver are some patterns that are more structural and behavioral with respect to connections between components.  Recently in <a href="ConnectionPatterns.html">ConnectionPatterns</a>, comments were made regarding additional connection patterns, so there are probably more that can be helpful in the component-based context.
      </p>
      <p>
        And with slightly higher-level patterns like <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a>, I see that <a href="ConnectionSingleton.html">ConnectionSingleton</a> and ConnectionObserver would be useful in the resulting context in terms of the way each component manages its discovery, joining, and participation in the bus.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Since connections and interactions are a big part of component-based efforts, I'm sure this area deserves more attention.
