        CASE Tool nirvana: change your model yamp press the button, your code is changed; change your code, press the button, your model has changed; and so on and so on...works about as well as you'd expect.

        Often touted by the <a href="UmlCaseVultures.html">UmlCaseVultures</a> as one reason why <em>traditional, programmer-centric approaches</em> are dead in the water.

        <em>There is no model. Only code.</em> -- Yoda on modeling languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, its quite the opposite. <em>There is no code, only models</em>. Unfortunately, modeling languages don't provide enough information to replace programming languages <strong>yet</strong>. But, to quote someone else, TheDesignIsTheDesign. One of the problems is that we need programming languages at all! If we didn't, there would be only design. --<a href="RobertDiFalco.html">RobertDiFalco</a>

        I've been thinking about this lately and I'm no longer sure I don't like it.  I have some thoughts on WhatWouldMakeRoundTripEngineeringUseful:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          built-in refactoring support
        </li>
        <li>
          built-in versioning system with superior visual indicators
        </li>
        <li>
          built-in design critiquing system with superior visual indicators (<em>can you tell I just got back from an interface refinement study?</em>)
        </li>
        <li>
          allows customizable code editor
        </li>
        <li>
          make it faster and smaller (<em>which is the main reason why I don't like it now</em>)
        </li>
      </ul>

        Then it's no longer a <a href="RoundTripEngineering.html">RoundTripEngineering</a> UML CASE tool, it's another type of IDE. -- <a href="JasonYip.html">JasonYip</a>
