        Proxy Deletion
      </h1>
      <p>
        A flaw in this Wiki's deletion technique.
      </p>
      <p>
        To delete a page without anyone's help:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Replace the contents with "delete"
        </li>
        <li>
           then: Use a web proxy to second the "delete"
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Result: Page is now gone, the deletion seemed to have community support, and chaos is increased because it's difficult to see why it was deleted.
      </p>
      <p>
        Also: Don't forget to pretend you are a gnome (never mind that gnomes don't delete pages unless they are spam/empty).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Don't forget, now that I shared the tip about how to restore your </em><a href="UserName.html">UserName</a>, I can use 217.137's technique and simply change my name to double edit a page like he always does. No need to burn two proxies at once.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Hrm. Using an IP, then a <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> allows a seconded deletion? . . . that seems like a flaw.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Or using one <a href="UserName.html">UserName</a> and then another.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        There are some possible ameliorations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Any deletion shows the ip/username of both deleters.
        </li>
        <li>
           Require two explanations per delete - since the delete must be seconded.
        </li>
        <li>
           No two IP addresses may second each other more than once per day (for the first 3 bytes of the ip address, wildcard the fourth).
          <ul>
            <li>
               Remember though that spammers often add many random pages to this wiki. So this idea would make it harder to remove those pages.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Good luck with that.</em>
      </p>

           I take it you made the comment because you couldn't think of any solutions on your own?
          <ul>
            <li>
               No, that is not why I made the comment. Actually I and others have written up some good ideas, too, see <a href="WikiVandalismSolutions.html">WikiVandalismSolutions</a> and <a href="WikiSpamSolutions.html">WikiSpamSolutions</a>. You might consider moving your ideas over there. But I have yet to see anything done to stop vandals or spammers on this wiki, other than occasionally blocking an IP address.
