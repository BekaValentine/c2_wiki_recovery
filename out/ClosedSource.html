        There is <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software, and there is non-<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software.  Some non-<a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a> software has source available, but under a license that doesn't qualify as <a href="OpenSource.html">OpenSource</a>.  And some non-Opensource software has no source available to you at all.  That is <a href="ClosedSource.html">ClosedSource</a> software.
