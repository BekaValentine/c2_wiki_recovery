        Richard Arkwright
      </h1>
      <p>
        Born 1732. Originally a wig manufacturer, he met JohnKay, who had invented a horse-powered spinning machine. Unlike its contemporary rival, the "Spinning Jenny", the machine that would come to be known as the "Water Frame" did not require skilled workers. Arkwright hired him to develop the machine. It did require substantial power supplies - originally by water-wheel, later with steam engines, but many operators could spin a hundred yarns simultaneously. Arkwright's first factory was built in Cromford, Derbyshire (and still stands). It was run 24 hours a day, 6 days a week. Arkwright developed a water-powered carding machine to further automate yarn production - to the extent than in a few years the UK went from a net yarn importer to a net exporter. Arkwright built more factories, was Knighted, made High Sheriff of Derbyshire and when he died in 1792, was worth more than half a million pounds - over $30million by today's figures.
