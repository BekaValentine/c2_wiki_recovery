        Direct Draw
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="DirectDraw.html">DirectDraw</a> is the component of the Microsoft <a href="DirectXlibrary.html">DirectXlibrary</a> family of multi-media APIs. <em>It is basically a game programming API.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It provides an abstraction of video surface(s) that should permit high-performance access and update of video displays that is portable across operating systems and environments (Microsoft operating systems and environments that is).
      </p>
      <p>
        What it really was, is a way for Microsoft to finally drop <a href="DiskOperatingSystem.html">DiskOperatingSystem</a> from the game development picture.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I would say that goal was reached several years ago, though not really by </em><a href="DirectDraw.html">DirectDraw</a>.  The major nail in the coffin came when <a href="IdSoftware.html">IdSoftware</a> started using <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a> for its games, and then Direct3D really slammed it shut.  Modern graphics cards support <a href="OpenGl.html">OpenGl</a> and Direct3D acceleration natively.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        BUT! how does it work??
