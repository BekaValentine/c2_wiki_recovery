        Supersedes both RubyUnit and RubyLapidary. Essentially, a matured Lapidary with an optional RubyUnit compatibility layer. Included in Ruby 1.8 and higher.

        Ruby is a great language for testing with <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s. Because you can define new methods for individual objects, you can easily mock up an object that checks that your tested object observes the preconditions of the objects it interacts with. Something like this:
      </p>
      <code>
        # Assuming that the object to test has been created in the setup method<br/>
        # and is called @tested<br/>
        #<br/>
        def test_something<br/>
        mock = Object.new				# create a mock object<br/>
        mock.extend( RUNIT::Assert )			# pull in the assertion definitions<br/>
        def mock.method_called_by_testee( arg1, arg2 )  # define a mocked method<br/>
        assert_equals( some_value, arg1 )<br/>
        assert_not_nil( arg2 )<br/>
        # etc<br/>
        return expected_result<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        @tested.do_something_with( mock )<br/>
        # assert postconditions and invariants<br/>
        end<br/>
      </code>

        <em>Ohh I was looking for this example all over the web. I knew I've seen it somewhere, but couldn't remember where. - Actually what I wanted is some kind of 'thing' where I don't have to pass my </em><a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> into the Objects and pass it around only to block the call onto another system and track the calling. I'm using <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a>s mainly to test and block the calls to other systems, like a telnet or db connection. Now I have to pass my Telnet <a href="MockObject.html">MockObject</a> every time into the code to have it passed around only to make sure that my calls are getting blocked and I can track what happened. What would be a nice solution here? I add this page to <a href="CategoryMockObjects.html">CategoryMockObjects</a> as well, so I'll find it next time much faster... :-) -- <a href="DanielFlueck.html">DanielFlueck</a><em></em>
