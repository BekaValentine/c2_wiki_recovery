        <a href="XpLite.html">XpLite</a>, as proposed,  is a heavier methodology than XP.  The name <a href="XpLite.html">XpLite</a> implies XP with something taken out and is misleading.
      </p>
      <p>
        Derivative related names water down the XP message.  We must find other ways of <a href="TransitioningToExtremeProgramming.html">TransitioningToExtremeProgramming</a>.

        On the other hand, having Xp in the name should make it harder for <a href="XpLite.html">XpLite</a> to be seen as a serious alternative to Xp, as it might if it had a completely different name.  Do you use Sunos or Solaris?  If it has a different name people might think it is something different.  The names <a href="XpLite.html">XpLite</a> or <a href="XpJr.html">XpJr</a> stop that from happening, and <a href="XpLite.html">XpLite</a> is the less childish of the two.  IMHO.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why shouldn't it be a serious alternative for alternative situations? Then again, I don't really know what this <a href="XpLite.html">XpLite</a> is. If it is at all like XUP, it should be pretty cool. I didn't think Xper's had a monotheistic view of the world? Isn't it possible to (just as Xp did with other methodologies) take from Xp and end up creating a different but equally good alternative? 
      </p>
      <p>
        Personally, I dont' think Xp should be in the name because, then, it will always be compared to Xp in a way that will inhibit its individual growth. I would like to see an alternative to <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a> called something like CogentDevelopment -- this takes the emphasis from extreme to rational and from programming to development. To be honest, other stakeholders in a project really feel left out when the process name makes the programming roles seem most important. In my world, the customer and QA technician, even the build master is as important as the programmer.

        Should we call this page "AlternateNamesForPrettyAdventuresomeProgramming" (<a href="PrettyAdventuresomeProgramming.html">PrettyAdventuresomeProgramming</a>) or "AlternateNamesForAlmostExtremeProgramming" (<a href="AlmostExtremeProgramming.html">AlmostExtremeProgramming</a>)?
