      <p>
        Ken Cooper and Ted Peters were one of the great programming teams of Smalltalk.  They wrote the original Window Builder, which they then sold to <a href="ObjectShare.html">ObjectShare</a>.  Later they teamed up again and wrote the first real programmer's editor for Smalltalk (one that had colors, grep-like functionality, etc.).  They then developed some way-cool Java Technology and were bought out by Microsoft.  I haven't heard a thing from them since they disappeared into the maw of Redmond.
