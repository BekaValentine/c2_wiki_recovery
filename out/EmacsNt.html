        Gnu emacs for NT is at:

        There's a little snippet on the Xemacs Faq:

        What they don't tell you about installing Emacs for NT:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Define an environment variable HOME, with a path to wherever you want your .emacs file to go.  I think this will default to your profile directory (for example, <em>c:\winnt\system32\profiles\wconrad</em>)
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>This isn't strictly needed.  I never did it at school, and emacs was just happy.</em>  I think this might be needed for Cygwin (Bash under NT), which I always install at the same time as Emacs.  I got them mixed up. <em>I think you're right.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You have to create an empty .emacs file, or Emacs won't be able to save your customization settings.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           If you want to associate files with emacs, you will need to download and install an NT version of gnuserv.  It is not included in the XEmacs distribution (although it may be with the Gnu Emacs distribution, please change this if you know one way or another).
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Uhm, maybe XEmacs does something funky here, but I didn't have to do anything special to associate files with emacs on my home win95 computer (a few years ago before I went all linux at home).</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You can associate emacs or runemacs with files, but that starts an additional emacs process each time you open a file.  If you install gnuserv, then you can associate files with gnuclientw, which sends messages to the emacs process informing it to load files, come to the front, open a new frame, or whatever you configure.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Oh.  I don't think I ever tried using the association once a copy was already open.</em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           You need to download additional packages to support printing, such as Ghostscript or a Win32 version of lpr.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <em>Gnumacs 20.4 works fine on 95, at least when a </em><a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> printer at the other end of the (netbeui) network is set up as the default Windows printer.  I've never tried it with a local or non-PS printer.<em></em>
