        Hamcrest provides a library of useful, self-describing matcher objects (also known as constraints or predicates) allowing 'match' rules to be defined declaratively, to be used in other frameworks.
      </p>
      <p>
        Hamcrest was originally implemented in jMock and has been spun off into a library that can be used by other projects.  It is now also used by <a href="JavaUnit.html">JavaUnit</a>, <a href="WindowLicker.html">WindowLicker</a> and many other testing libraries.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, it is not a testing library: it just happens that matchers are very useful for testing.  Hamcrest has also been used for validating user input, defining event subscription and filtering rules, and other non-testing applications.
