        Multi Tear Architecture
      </h1>
      <p>
        A project which:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          requires at least 2 otherwise competitive organizations to cooperate
        </li>
        <li>
          expects a basic change in human nature
        </li>
        <li>
          undermines the political position of those needed to implement it
        </li>
        <li>
          no one is willing to take responsibility for
        </li>
        <li>
           is paid for by one group, but acceptance tested by another group -- and the two groups disagree
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>It'll end in tears.</strong>
