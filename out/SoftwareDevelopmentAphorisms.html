        <em>I'd like a page with </em><a href="SoftwareDevelopmentAphorisms.html">SoftwareDevelopmentAphorisms</a>.

The idea in the aphorism is the silence that follows, letting your mental maps overlap and crumple.<em> -- </em><a href="ChristopheThibaut.html">ChristopheThibaut</a> [<a href="DeleteMe.html">DeleteMe</a>]
