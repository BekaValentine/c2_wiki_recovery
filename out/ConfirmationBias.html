        <a href="ConfirmationBias.html">ConfirmationBias</a> is basically seeking evidence, granting greater weight to evidence, and better remembering evidence that supports whatever preconception or hypothesis we favor. This is a nearly universal blind spot in humans. Rationalists will make efforts to compensate for the bias. Related to the cherry picking fallacy (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_%28fallacy%29)">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cherry_picking_%28fallacy%29)</a> and <a href="WishfulThinking.html">WishfulThinking</a>.
