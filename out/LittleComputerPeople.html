        Little Computer People
      </h1>
      <p>
        An entertaining pseudo-AI program. The player had a single character who lived in a house shown in cut-away. They could type arbitrary sentences, e.g. "please play the piano" and use key combinations to generate events like filling the water-cooler, delivering food to the door etc. The arbitrary sentences could be used to encourage the little person to do exciting things like dancing... but only if the player didn't get too "bossy".
      </p>
      <p>
        Possibly more entertaining was the way that after many hours of unattended activities, the little computer person would become ill due to the lack of food and water, take sick and die.
