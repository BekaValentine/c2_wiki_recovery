        Important Free Cell Lessons
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a> is a lot like life - it has its easy deals and its hard times. Occasionally, you move yourself into a corner and run out of options. But playing <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a> often enough has left me with an accumulation of winning lessons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Be aware of long-term problems.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes a key color-number combination, such as both black 10s, can be near the bottom of separate piles. This inhibits your ability to complete long strings of builds in any column. If possible, avoid making the problem worse by burying the color-number combination deeper. You can also end up with two of the same color-number card in the same pile, such as both red 8s. Don't just focus on one of the long-term problems: be aware of both of the long-term problems.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Take advantage of short-term opportunities.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        It is probably a good idea to face an ace (or one of the next cards for the home pile) by just moving one card up to a <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a>, as long as you have other moves afterward.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use mid-term strategies.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Don't focus on the long-term problems (although be aware of them) and don't focus on recklessly moving cards up to the home pile. Rather, take the mid-term strategy and capitalize on long builds and emptying columns. Push down stacks with intervening bad cards. Keep variety in your hold cards.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Maximize flexibility.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Given the choice between moving cards home and gaining the flexibility of an empty column, choose greater flexibility. Think twice before choosing to leave yourself only one open <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a>. Patience is a virtue.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Think ahead.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Plan ahead for what a move might enable - does it allow you to open up another <a href="FreeCell.html">FreeCell</a> or work you away from your long-term problems?
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Use the hidden force.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes, the answer lies with forcing cards home biasing a single suit. This might be alright if it increases your flexibility elsewhere.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Situations where this works are very rare.</em>
          <ul>
            <li>
               Be persistent.
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When you are stuck, take a break and do something else so that you can return later with a fresh outlook.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Know when to bail out.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Sometimes a deal is just too difficult. Know when you are "in over your head" and bail out so that you don't waste your time.
