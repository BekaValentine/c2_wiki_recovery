        New Query Language Pressure Level
      </h1>
      <p>
        Why do we have gazillion application programming languages, but only one practical relational query language choice: SQL? There are plenty of gripes about <a href="SqlFlaws.html">SqlFlaws</a>, so it's not like SQL is the pinnacle of query languages.
      </p>
      <p>
        Why haven't the same pressures that produced gazillion app languages also produced more choice in query languages? I find it an odd puzzle in terms of "technical sociology". I realize databases are more complicated than app languages, but so much so that the ratio of in-use app languages to query languages is something like 1000 to 1? That's hard to swallow.
      </p>
      <p>
        (Variants of <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> are about the only alternative that seems to have any current momentum. I'm pushing for <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a>, but am too lazy to implement it so far. I'd like to see <a href="TutorialDee.html">TutorialDee</a> variants target type-heavy approaches, and <a href="SmeQl.html">SmeQl</a> target dynamic and type-light approaches, just like we have Java, Ada, and Eiffel on one hand for type-heavy or "compile-heavy" uses; and Python, Perl, and <a href="SmallTalk.html">SmallTalk</a> on the other for type-light, dynamic, or type-flexible uses.)
      </p>
      <p>
        I'll float a list of the possible reasons:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           SQL has been "good enough"
        </li>
        <li>
           Most developers don't know enough about relational and database theories to propose something else
        </li>
        <li>
           Difficult to implement because very few "tool kits" analogous to Lex and Yacc exist for building database engines and parsing queries.
        </li>
        <li>
           Very few evangelizers.
        </li>
        <li>
           Hardware and performance issues still dominate databases such that language features take a back seat.
        </li>
      </ul>
