        I love history. I can forget about reality that way. See <em>overinvested causes</em> quote in <a href="SelfDeceit.html">SelfDeceit</a>.

        A lot of communities, including but not limited to organised crime and other secret societies, religious cults, etc, fit the diagnosis <a href="StartedAsaGoodCauseSyndrome.html">StartedAsaGoodCauseSyndrome</a>. These communities went over to the dark side and cause more problems than solutions they originally sought to solve.

           <em>I </em>'know<strong> you mean well, but look, that's such a strong statement that I can't help but resent it (onlookers: he and I have been talking, so I have reason to think he includes me, there). Lighten up, will you? I, and the others you are addressing, are not evil-doers, no matter what your reservations are. Look at it this way. I mean well...you mean well...but you don't believe that, you think that only </strong>you<strong> are in a position to be the one who worries that the future, that </strong>I'm<strong> going over to the </strong>DarkSideOfTheForce? With you making such strong statements, shouldn't <strong>I</strong> worry about <strong>you</strong>? There is such a thing as a just war. Look at world war II, the last obvious such, not at the horrors of some more recent wars. It just is not true that only the passive non-combatants are the only ones with the moral higher ground. There is such a thing as <strong>defense</strong>. -- <a href="DougMerritt.html">DougMerritt</a><em></em>

        An individual is a community of one. And in this instance <a href="SelfTalk.html">SelfTalk</a> determines the directions taken by the community.

        Some communities do seem to come out with their integrity intact over many years. Is the Salvos a good example of a <em>persecuted band</em> that turn out good? Or maybe the lucky country Australia :)
