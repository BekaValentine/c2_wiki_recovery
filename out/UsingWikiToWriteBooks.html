        Using Wiki To Write Books
      </h1>
      <p>
        Is it true that books have been written using wikis? If so is there usually a preexisting goal or aim such as "let's produce <a href="ExtremeProgrammingExplained.html">ExtremeProgrammingExplained</a>"?

        I believe that using a wiki to write one of the proposed XP books seemed to work well, for a short period while all the authors were in the same building and intensely focused on the task. After that I heard that it didn't work so well. Is that right? -- <a href="RichardDrake.html">RichardDrake</a>

        Last edited October 2000.  Now that wikis have been around even longer, does anyone here have any comments to contribute on this question?

        Currently this page is an orphan - is there anywhere that should link to it?
