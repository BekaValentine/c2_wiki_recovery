        Thru three tax trees a fee freeze flew.<br/>
        So three fax fleas had a shredder cheese chew.<br/>
        Their bennies bought them sound bites on the N.B.C. News<br/>

        When RDBMS tables tattle on your navel it's called<br/>
        navel tattle table data. And when data tables tattle<br/>
        on your navel with a label, it's a navel label tattle<br/>
        table. And when data tables tattle on your navel with<br/>
        a label in a haven, it's a haven navel label tattle<br/>
        table. And when you swear on the Bible and babble about<br/>
        your data table tattle, and your navel with a label's in<br/>
        a haven in the islands, that's what they call a <br/>
        babble Bible island haven navel label table tattle!<br/>
