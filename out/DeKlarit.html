        <a href="DeKlarit.html">DeKlarit</a> is a Visual Studio .NET Add-In that helps the developer build the data and business layers of the applications (i.e., in a 3 tiered architecture application, the 2nd and 3rd layers). It is like a RAD for the middle tier components and the database. It is developed by developed by <a href="ArTech.html">ArTech</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        In <a href="DeKlarit.html">DeKlarit</a>, you define structure and business rules for your 'real world entities' ('Business Components' in <a href="DeKlarit.html">DeKlarit</a>). These Business Components are defined in an unnormalized way (i.e., the Invoice has a Customer Name), in such a way that they match exactly what the real world entities look like. <a href="DeKlarit.html">DeKlarit</a> infers, in real time, a normalized database schema to support them, creates the schema, and the .NET typed Datasets and Data Adapters to work with the components you defined. This is called <a href="NormalizationBySynthesis.html">NormalizationBySynthesis</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        When the structure of your Business Components change, <a href="DeKlarit.html">DeKlarit</a> creates a new database schema and spreads the data from the old schema to the new one. This lets you refactor your data layer classes without worrying about writing the data migration scripts. Also, it regenerates the Datasetsata Adapters to work with the new schema. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the Datasets' structures match the unnormalized structure of the Business Components, when the database schema changes but the Business Component structure does not, the code you wrote using the Datasets do not need to be changed. This minimizes the impact that database schema changes have in your application.
