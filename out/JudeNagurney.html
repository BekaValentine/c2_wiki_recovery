      <p>
        I'm a "Computer System Analyst, Lead" at CACI in Fairfax Virginia.

        I do some C++ programming, but lately I've been doing a lot of small process support tasks, mostly centered around doing custom source code and database schema generation from Rational Rose models.  Fun stuff.  I use a lot of Perl and Visual Basic to accomplish this.
      </p>
      <p>
        I've also been thinking about toying around with Haskell, especially since it's got an OLE interface now, though I'm afraid the rest of the world won't catch up with functional programming for another 10 years or so.  Sigh.

        I'll write more when I have more time.
