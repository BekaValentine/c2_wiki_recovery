        Object Oriented Landscape
      </h1>
      <p>
        After analysis of the many Wiki <a href="ThreadMess.html">ThreadMess</a>, there has become a clarity that allows some order to be placed on the notion of "the Object".
      </p>
      <p>
        There are two poles to the Object landscape within <a href="ObjectOrientedProgramming.html">ObjectOrientedProgramming</a>, both of which misinform the theorizer and ProgrammerWhoWantsToUnderstand.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the <a href="CeePlusPlus.html">CeePlusPlus</a> way (named since <a href="BjarneStroustrup.html">BjarneStroustrup</a> came up with the example, not because it is typical), one has been trained by the idea of modelling computer-world artifacts (cf. <a href="CircleAndEllipseProblem.html">CircleAndEllipseProblem</a>). As such, one has been trained by the SimulatedWorld object mindset. This SimulatedWorld mindset, encompasses games, but I argue, no one models such objects in practice. So this model fails to <em>generalize</em>.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In the Python way (post v2.2 type/class unification), one has been trained by the <a href="EverythingIsAnObject.html">EverythingIsAnObject</a> mindset, where there is no attempt at a SimulatedWorld, there is only a pure abstract Object from which every other object derives. This conceptualization has failed to create inter-operability, one of the promises of OOP (see <a href="ObjectOrientedRefactored.html">ObjectOrientedRefactored</a>), because by being so abstract there is no common point in which people actually want to operate from.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        In between these two poles or <em>extrema</em>, and since ultimately <a href="AllDataRelatesToOtherData.html">AllDataRelatesToOtherData</a>, there is proposed the possibility of a <a href="UnifiedDataModel.html">UnifiedDataModel</a> encompassing most of what programmers <em>*actually*</em> do, when they aren't thinking of abstract theoretical <a href="ToyProblem.html">ToyProblem</a>s. See <a href="DataEcosystem.html">DataEcosystem</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not to be confused, by the way, with the mathematical idea of <a href="TypeSystem.html">TypeSystem</a>s, which is also in between these two extremes, but in the <em>opposite</em> direction -- into the Platonic realm of mathematics. This unconscious conflation has confused and unintentionally alienated the <a href="ComputerScientists.html">ComputerScientists</a> from the ComputerProgrammers who tend to employ the same terminology for different purposes. Despite the two sharing a mathematical commonality, one deals with logic gates and <a href="BooleanLogic.html">BooleanLogic</a> while the other deals with Symbols.
