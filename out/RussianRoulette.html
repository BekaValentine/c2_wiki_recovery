        Russian Roulette
      </h1>
      <p>
        I had a nice little chuckle yesterday. I was having trouble opening a <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> file using the Ghostscript interpreter. Not sure of what was wrong, I went into the application directory using a file manager and started double-clicking on every executable in the hopes that I could use one of them to open the <a href="PostScript.html">PostScript</a> file.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I double-clicked on "Gsv16spl.exe" a window came up with the message:
      </p>
      <code>
        Playing Russian Roulette are we? GSV16SPL is called automatically from<br/>
        GSview or Ghostscript.<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        This put a smile on my face and reminded me that I have done this more than once - opened executables without knowing exactly what would happen in the hopes that what would happen was what I wanted, or simply something interesting if I was just mumbling about on my computer looking for a thrill.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>one imagines there are better ways to get a thrill from a computer than randomly opening executables</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Since I do this mostly with old applications that I authored, but have forgotten what they do, I encounter minimum danger. However, doing this with untrusted applications certainly fits the phrase <a href="RussianRoulette.html">RussianRoulette</a>!
      </p>
      <p>
        When was the last time you played it, and did anything notable occur?
      </p>
      <p>
        Kudos to the authors of the Ghostscript package for including this neat response - it certainly gave me a nice feeling and they are probably cool fellows to get some pints with!

        This <em><ahem></em> activity of executing random .EXE files is reminiscent of another phrase sometimes used in certain circles -- "Russian Roulette with an automatic."

      <p>
        There was, at one point, a Unix "utility" complete with a <a href="ManPage.html">ManPage</a>, called "rr"--a terse abbreviation (in the grand Unix tradition) for <a href="RussianRoulette.html">RussianRoulette</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        This utility randomly selected a program out of /bin, and executed it with the arguments "-rf ~".  If the user is the <a href="SuperUser.html">SuperUser</a>, it instead used the arguments "-rf /"

        Might have been an AprilFoolsJoke; not sure if such was ever written.
