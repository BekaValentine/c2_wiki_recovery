        Moved from <a href="NodeJsAndHofGuiDiscussion.html">NodeJsAndHofGuiDiscussion</a> because discussion grew away from GUI's.

      <p>
        As far as "evidence", see <a href="LetReaderDecideEvidenceAgreement.html">LetReaderDecideEvidenceAgreement</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>The claim that HOFs and lambda expressions cause confusion is yours alone.  If you want "agreement", retract your claim until you have evidence to back it up.</em>

      <p>
        Again again again, evidence based on personal experience is acceptable on this wiki. I am not doing anything "wrong". I know you are personally frustrated by the lack of formal studies, but complaining repeatedly is not going to fix that. My personal observations about what confuses staff or doesn't confuse staff are just as valid as yours. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Absolutely, evidence based on personal experience is reasonable.  However, whilst you have had your personal experience, we the </em><a href="WikiReader.html">WikiReader</a> haven't had your personal experience.  Thus, you need to relate your personal experience in the form of anecdotes.  Merely asserting that evidence exists, but not providing it, is neither personal evidence nor rational argument.  It's just hot air.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           It's hot-air that parsimony is the only thing that matters.

        The default is NOT that they don't confuse developers. See near <a href="TopVsOthers.html">TopVsOthers</a> on why our experience may vary. -t
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's right.  In the absence of evidence, the default is <null>.  Whether lambdas and HOFs confuse programmers or not simply doesn't enter into the picture until there's evidence one way or the other.  Equivalently, lambdas and HOFs might cause increased energy consumption, increased memory errors, greater load on hard drives, increased global warming, premature hair loss, male impotency, and furballs in kittens.  Until any of these bad things have evidence behind them, they're irrelevant; to discuss them in the context of lambdas and HOFs would be pure speculation, and therefore a pointless waste of space, time and energy.  Likewise, until there's evidence that lambdas and HOFs confuse programmers, discussing it as if it does -- or even as if it might -- is pure speculation, and therefore a pointless waste of space, time and energy.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's your opinion. You WANT this to be about math and code parsimony, and ignore <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> issues because you are smart at math and stupid at people. To bad, <strong>you don't make the wiki rules</strong> here. Fuck off, reality-detached <a href="IvoryTower.html">IvoryTower</a> fat-tuition lobbyist! The bottom line is that <a href="WetWare.html">WetWare</a> anecdotal evidence is allowed on this wiki.

        AND, just because a factor is difficult/expensive to measure is NOT a reason to skip discussion on it. <a href="SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple.html">SovietShoeFactoryPrinciple</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        IT'S A DAMNED FALLACY THAT PARSIMONY IS THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR <strong>JUUUUST</strong> BECAUSE IT'S THE EASIEST TO MEASURE!!!!! (Similar applies to other automate-able code analysis techniques.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <a href="LetReaderDecideEvidenceAgreement.html">LetReaderDecideEvidenceAgreement</a> is fair and reasonable, but you pissed all over it.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>A factor that is difficult/expensive to measure is certainly worthy of discussion, as long as there is evidence that it is an influential factor.  You've provided no evidence that lambdas and HOFs confuse programmers.  Anecdotal evidence is certainly allowed, but you haven't provided any.  Until you do provide evidence that lambdas and HOFs confuse programmers, there's no more point in discussing it than, say, discussing the power consumption of lambdas and HOFs or their inclination to cause furballs in kittens.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I have too provided it. You just have an undocumented and vague personal view of what anecdote means that is probably not satisfiable by mortals. And <strong>if you don't want to participate in discussions that only use anecdotal evidence then leave</strong> the discussion rather than make your evidence preference a <a href="PersonalChoiceElevatedToMoralImperative.html">PersonalChoiceElevatedToMoralImperative</a>. Your complaints about it are quite repetitive and annoying. You KEEP complaining about it over and over and over and over and over and over and over.

        <em>I've provided examples of anecdotes.  The only "evidence" you've provided to suggest that lambdas and HOFs confuse programmers, is your claim that lambdas and HOFs confuse programmers.  That's not an anecdote, that's not evidence, that's just stating the hypothesis.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        You did not finish your examples of acceptable anecdotes; they are too vague for me to process. It's still unclear to me what is acceptable to you. (Not that you are a standard vocab reference source anyhow.)

        It is too evidence, by most accounts, and is a permissible form of evidence on this wiki. I will agree it is weak evidence, but weak evidence is all we have without formal studies being done. If you don't wish to discuss weak evidence, then don't; it's that fucking simple! <strong>You would rather complain than leave. I suggest you reverse that preference.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Stating a hypothesis is not evidence of any kind.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It's not merely stating a hypothesis. You are wrong.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's exactly what it is.  A statement of presumed truth, sans evidence, is a hypothesis.  See "science".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Re "Database Gazes" link above, I'm still not sure how people writing bad code can be related to evidence that HOF's confuse staff. Your example said nothing about WHY the code was bad. I still see no clear connection to anything relevant.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>No specific connection is intended.  It's just an anecdote, intended to illustrate what anecdotes are like since you appear not to know.  Why the code is bad can be trivially inferred, and should be obvious.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Anyhow, I did not write down specific events with specific code and have no such diary to present. But that does NOT make the evidence non-evidence.
      </p>
      <p>
        If Jane Goodall stated, "I observed that gorillas get into more physical fights during high humidity." That's "evidence" by most accounts, that fight frequency is related to humidity. Weak evidence, yes, but STILL "evidence" to most humans. It's comparable to "I observe that using JS API's with more HOF's tends to stump programmers more often." I agree it would be better if Jane logged specific dates and times, specific humidity readings (from a device), number of fist movements, ID of gorillas involved, etc. But that's pulling an <a href="IwantaPony.html">IwantaPony</a> evidence level request. You are not going to get your pony from me. Weak evidence is still evidence and is allowed on this wiki. If you want to call it a "mere hypothesis" or a "fabblemoof", that's fine, but I don't have to agree to that terminology application. If you do not wish to participate in discussions with weak evidence or fabblemoof's or whatever you wish to call it, then I recommend you ignore it. If you wish to complain and THEN leave, factor your complaints into a topic and type in that topic name and then leave. Simple. Your repetitious complaining is not helping anything and makes you look a baby crying <a href="IwantaPony.html">IwantaPony</a>. Do you WANT to look like an immature stubborn repetitious spoiled brat?
      </p>
      <p>
        {Jane Goodall, being a scientist, would very likely have done the stuff you are labeling as <a href="IwantaPony.html">IwantaPony</a> requests before she made such a claim.}
      </p>
      <p>
        That may be true, but not relevant here. Goodall-ness personality-wise was not the key point. Hypothetically, assume she was killed before finishing her writeup and we only had that quote to work with. Most would still consider it "evidence". By the way, pay me a scientist wage, and I'll conduct FP grokking research for you and make a detailed diary with dates, times, people, code, and error messages. Goodall didn't do it for free (although may have sacrificed other more lucrative alternatives because of her love of the subject). Not only do you want a pony, but want it for free. It appears you didn't think through that snarky reply before you made it, failing to consider what brings about good research.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your Jane Goodall example is a </em><a href="StrawMan.html">StrawMan</a>.  Given that Jane Goodall didn't make any unsupported claim like "I observed that gorillas get into more physical fights during high humidity" (before being killed, no less; as of 2014, she's alive and well), and in fact maintained notoriously meticulous notes which serve as excellent evidence, your fictional statement is the basis of a nonsensical argument.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        It was a hypothetical example, as "If" indicates. Change the name if it makes you feel better. You appear to be obstinate for the sake of obstinance.
      </p>
      <p>
        Fental Wipperstein stated, "I observed that gorillas get into more physical fights during high humidity."
      </p>
      <p>
        Most normal humans would consider such statement "evidence" if they heard Mr. Wipperstein state it. I don't care what your PERSONAL criteria is for "evidence". Such evidence is acceptable on THIS wiki. If you wish to change the wiki rules, DO NOT bring it up with me.

        <em>Where do I "dick with English"?  You simply have no evidence that HOFs and lambda expressions confuse programmers, any more than HOFs and lambdas increase carbon emissions.  Why don't we argue for pages about whether lambdas and HOFs increase carbon emissions?</em>

      <p>
        Your hype blabbering over HOF's releases carbon via your hot breath. QED. 
      </p>
      <p>
        And <strong>I respect the right</strong> of any Wikizen to propose a personally-observed relationship between HOF's and carbon. If I disagree, I'll say so <a href="OnceAndOnlyOnce.html">OnceAndOnlyOnce</a> and move on instead of bitch about it 3,472,027 times. YOU ARE DOING IT WRONG.

      </p>
      <p>
        I am not sure what you mean. If your appreciation repeats existing material, please factor it into a topic/link. Likewise I may factor my counter-criticism into a topic/link.

      <p>
        We keep discussing new examples/scenarios (which is not a problem), but your evidence complaints fit the same OLD pattern.
      </p>
      <p>
        {That's because your failure to supply evidence for your assertions fits the same OLD pattern.}
      </p>
      <p>
        We disagree over what constitutes "evidence".  Further, we can <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> which staffing pattern fits their own shop and apply per match such that we don't need to keep re-bickering that. If my observations don't match their shop, they can simply ignore them. Simple Dimple self-solving problem. But you don't appear satisfied with that.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That's right, I'm not.  If you wish to use your limited "evidence" as the basis for an occasional comment that you suspect HOFs and lambdas might confuse programmers, that's fine.  However, such limited "evidence" -- which consists solely of your unsubstantiated assertion that HOFs and lambdas confuse programmers -- is certainly not justification for arguing over page after page that HOFs and lambdas should not be used.  If you don't like HOFs, lambdas, or other aspects of </em><a href="FunctionalProgramming.html">FunctionalProgramming</a>, that's fine -- you can ignore the discussions about them.  The rest of us can then get on with discussing the evolution of programming without your interference.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Re: "arguing over page after page that HOFs and lambdas should not be used. " -- That's not directly what I do. I pretty much present alternatives to HOF's <strong>IF</strong> the reader, shop, or API/language maker wants to likewise avoid them. YOU then have a fit for the mere suggestion that somebody may not love HOF's/FP and then bitch about "evidence". <strong>You are over-protective of your pet paradigm.</strong> Admit it and seek therapy. The problem is with YOU, not me.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I don't see a lot of presenting "alternatives to HOF's" here, or anywhere else.  I see a lot of quibbling based on an undefended claim that HOFs and lambdas confuse programmers.  When you do present alternatives, the only legitimate alternative is a </em><a href="FunctorObject.html">FunctorObject</a>.  The other presumed alternatives are isomorphic to "write all the code differently", which is always an option but rarely an alternative.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Your opinion is noted.
      </p>
      <p>
        And <strong>what's wrong with presenting alternative designs</strong>/APIs/code-styles? REGARDLESS of whether there is an absolute or clear need for alternatives? Let alternatives be presented. If you personally don't want to see alternatives, then don't read them. But don't pre-filter them for every other potential reader.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>When "alternatives" reach the point of being isomorphic to "write all the code differently", it's pointless to present them.  You can </em>'always<em>' use "write all the code differently" as an alternative to anything.  For example, offering SQL as an alternative to HOFs is essentially "write your program in a different language", which applies equally to (say) FOR loops as it does to HOFs.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Sorry, I'm not understanding your point.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Some of your proposed "alternatives" to HOFs -- SQL, for example -- are "alternatives" to everything.  They are not specifically alternatives to HOFs.  Thus, they are no more helpful than "rewrite your program".</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm still not following your point. Presenting alternative implementations to specific examples is not a sin. See <a href="CategoryInManyProgrammingLanguages.html">CategoryInManyProgrammingLanguages</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Presenting examples that are specific enough to be useful is fine.  For example, showing how a specific HOF-based example can be replaced with equivalent SQL, or even as a general pattern, would be useful.  You merely proposed SQL as an alternative, without explanation.  That's not useful, and it's too vague to be meaningful.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        This is not the place to ask questions about examples. Please do it at the allegedly offending example page.

        <em>I'm not asking questions.  My comment is relevant to this discussion about alternative implementations.  If you like, feel free to move this whole threadlet to where you feel it is more appropriate.</em>

      <p>
        I don't know where the "without explanation"-ness is happening. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Elsewhere, you suggested SQL as an alternative to HOFs.  You didn't explain how SQL could be used as an alternative to HOFs.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        If I encounter such spots, I'll review them. It may have been related to parallelism and concurrency claims around HOF's. For example, "SELECT * FROM foo WHERE x > 7" doesn't have execute in parallel (one row at a time). The RDBMS may split up the work to multiple cores, servers, etc. -t

        <em>I recommend looking up "evidence".  A typical definition is that evidence is anything that supports an assertion.  By obvious implication, that means it isn't the assertion itself.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Statements of such observed patterns (X tends to happen when Y is high) are often referred to as "anecdotal evidence". Assertions don't have to be observations, and it may also be possible to be both an assertion AND evidence. Thus, they are not necessarily mutually exclusive, but English is too fuzzy to say for sure. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Loose use of language is no reason to either perpetuate misinterpretation of assertions as evidence or erroneously conflate them.  If that were acceptable, a statement like "the moon is made of cheese" would constitute evidence that a lunar body is composed of fermented dairy products.  Obviously, it does not.  Logically, a predicate does not constitute evidence of its own truth value.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There is a big difference between "the moon is made of cheese" and "I tasted the moon, and it tastes like cheese". Strawman strike.

        <em>With no mention of circumstances -- e.g., language, application, requirements, specific code, programmer experience, etc. -- it's a comment worth exactly what we paid for it.

        Multiple non-newbie programmers were confused by FOR loops? Anyhow, if you don't wish to discuss a given piece of evidence, then simply DON'T. Ignore it and go away.

        I would note that C-style FOR loops <strong> <em>are</em> ugly and unintuitive</strong>. BASIC has a leg up in that department:
      </p>
      <code>
        FOR i = 1 to 400 STEP 2     '// "STEP" is optional, defaults to 1 without<br/>
        PRINT "i = "; i<br/>
        NEXT i<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I'll give the C-style points for parsimony perhaps, but not human intuitiveness.
      </p>
      <p>
        If C-style is ever overhauled (<a href="ItsTimeToDumpCeeSyntax.html">ItsTimeToDumpCeeSyntax</a>, <a href="AlternativesToCeeSyntax.html">AlternativesToCeeSyntax</a>), then perhaps something like this can be the replacement:
      </p>
      <code>
        for(&i, from=1, to=400, step=2) {...}  // "full" keyword version<br/>
        for(&i, 1,400,2) {...}  // positional version <br/>
        for(&i, from=400, to=1, step= -1) {...} // reverse looping example<br/>
        // both version could be allowed, similar to how VB.NET and C# do it<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        [Personally I'd sooner deprecate numerically-indexed for loops entirely, instead providing foreach loops plus standard-library support for producing iterators (internal or external, doesn't matter) over numeric ranges. <a href="PythonLanguage.html">PythonLanguage</a> took that approach. It's pretty effective. However, that's something of a digression. Programmers have been confused by FOR loops at times. Programmers have been confused by function calls at times. Programmers have been confused by variable assignment at times. Should we really be making blanket declarations -- "this construct confuses programmers" -- based on a few isolated incidents? Should we really be deeming particular constructs too confusing and abandoning them on the grounds of a few isolated incidents? -DavidMcLean]
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As far as FOR loops, like I mentioned elsewhere, a simple base library function used inside a WHILE may also suffice:
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        while(for(&i, from=1, to=400, step=2)) {...}  // "full" keyword version<br/>
        while(for(&i, 1,400,2)) {...}  // positional version <br/>
      </code>

           Most sorting is done by the database, not in RAM. Some RDBMS do offer the ability add custom collation modules. In practice if the RDBMS doesn't give one the collation needed for a particular need, then one generates a parallel "work column" (in the DB or in RAM) that tweaks the character set or characters to fit intended ordering, and then sorts on the work column (using built-in collating). But I have not seen a wide need for such. And "Now let's imagine that the compare() method needs to make reference to the external environment" makes it even rarer.

           The "work column(s)" approach mentioned would work just fine for SKU's, and has the side benefit of one being able to study the contents of the work column(s) for debugging, testing, etc. That's easier than intercepting and back-tracing RAM. As far as "faster than DB speed", I don't get a lot of those, as mentioned in other topics. And one usually doesn't need mass swappability of the comparing algorithms even if they did. Conditional/CASE statements are plenty fine most of the time to select among a relatively fixed set of comparing algorithms for RAM-centric processing. Thus, your "improvement" would take two conditions to be true at the <strong>same time</strong>: 1) Too fast for database usage, and 2) mass swappability of comparing algorithm needed. -t

           Further, the pattern of variations-on-a-theme would likely be smaller than a function level, and <strong>interweave</strong>. For example, whether we ignore punctuation for comparing may end up being independent from case insensitivity. Modelling it as separate functions or function-like blocks would probably limit you in many cases. If it's "boxed" commercial software, then power-users would typically select features via a front-end and select the combos and filters and groupings they want, not unlike existing Email filtering interfaces. They wouldn't be coding HOF's. Thus, your mass comparer swapping is either unrealistic, or only the best solution in a very very narrow set of situations and circumstances.

           [Why would variations-on-a-theme ever be "smaller than a function level" when a given function can do as little or as much as is necessary? Any aspect of a higher-order function's operation can be "pulled out" as a distinct argument, after all, no matter how tiny it is. In the case of comparison modifiers, like case-insensitivity and ignoring punctuation, there're a few options: You might have a factory that produces appropriate comparison functions, allowing options like case-insensitivity and disregarding punctuation to be toggled on and off using parameters. This is reasonably straightforward to implement but sadly not particularly extensible if new modifiers are necessary. Alternatively, and far more extensibly, you can simply exploit function composition to construct appropriate comparison functions where necessary; this approach is extremely common in <a href="HaskellLanguage.html">HaskellLanguage</a> for example, where you'd write something like "sortBy (comparing $ map toLower)", or "sortBy (comparing stripPunctuation)", or "sortBy (comparing $ map toLower . stripPunctuation)" when you need both. This approach is trivially extensible, and the transformation functions used are also available for other purposes besides comparison-for-sorting. How would these approaches "limit you in many cases", exactly? What cases do you have in mind? As for commercial software configured by power-users, that's certainly a viable product to build, but why wouldn't it involve higher-order functions? Sure, power users don't have to use higher-order functions -- or any code at all -- but there has to be an implementation sitting behind that front-end. Why wouldn't the front-end act as a factory spitting out comparison functions, to be dropped into sort functions, filter functions, and so on elsewhere in the application? -DavidMcLean]

           YOU make them lengthy by complaining about inconsequential things. And I am not changing practices, many developers already do ignore FP if not forced on them by the language or API's available. Software engineering is already a flimsy discipline anyhow because too little solid research is done and available. Before Mars was explored by probes, many books were written about it based on telescope and spectrograph observations, which didn't supply very much. That's how fields typically work: many speculative alternatives are explored based on the limited early evidence. As more evidence comes in, less speculation is needed.

        What surprised me is that heavy factoring into "too many functions" (regular functions) also stumped or slowed down programmers with a good standing. At first I thought it was just outliers having the problem and kept up the factoring in subsequent orgs. But the same complaint kept rolling in.
      </p>
      <p>
        [Programmers that can't handle "too many functions" are not in fact skilled programmers. Lots of little, composable functions (and classes and objects and modules) is fundamentally the essence of good program design. -DavidMcLean]

        As explained in <a href="IndividualExperienceShapesPerceptions.html">IndividualExperienceShapesPerceptions</a>, they are often not the best "code jugglers" around, often because they are selected by many criteria, raw coding being one of multiple. Good coders do exist in such environments, but you are expected to cater toward the average, not the current or best staff encountered. (Often the best coders have the poorest people skills.) One guy was a pretty good coder, but unfortunately he didn't comment anything because he believed in self-documenting naming. He took self-documenting as far as it could go, though. Most coders are a trade-off of traits, including quirks. If they were masters at everything, they'd probably be making buko bucks somewhere else rather than be an average-paid coder in an average company. I am surrounded by Salieri's, not Mozart's.

        <em>It sounds like you work in an environment that is at least somewhat influenced by what is often called end-user computing -- technical work, especially programming, done by relatively non-technical people who would not consider themselves to be professional programmers.  Don't such developers normally use domain-specific languages, such as Qlikview, Cyberquery, Excel macros, VBA, and so on?  Perhaps rather than limiting general-purpose language features to suit such developers -- which would limit what professional programmers can do -- there should be more development and promotion of domain-specific languages that target a relatively "I'm not really a programmer" audience.</em>

        <em>I'm not saying particular language features such as HOFs are necessarily more confusing than any other feature, but I do suspect the overall complexity of general-purpose programming languages may represent an aggregate difficulty level that professionals -- who are not professional programmers per se -- can find overwhelming.

        You seem to imply a definitive dichotomy between "professional" and non-professional, which is not what I find. It's difficult to explain how and what they do without witnessing it for years. They are perfectly capable of producing custom applications to solve specific organization needs. But if you look at their ability to work with code in terms of code alone, they are far from the cream of the crop, on average. As long as one does not use certain structures, techniques, and patterns that confuse them, they can absorb it well enough to do the job at hand. They can drive cars, but not race in NASCAR. Some are otherwise quite productive if they are in their comfort zone. Sure, it takes more typing if you don't factor well, but they can indeed type fast and copy and paste fast and re-copy-and-paste fast to undo their last copy-and-paste job to make changes. <strong>If you practice copy-and-paste coding long enough, you do get pretty proficient at it</strong> such that you can approach the productivity of factoring and high abstraction.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Your response confirms my view.  "They can drive cars, but not race in NASCAR" is a good analogy.  General-purpose programming languages, like Python/Ruby/Javascript/C/C++/C#/Java/Perl/etc. are equivalent to NASCAR race cars -- tools for professional drivers/programmers.  Qlikview, Cyberquery, Excel macros and VBA are like passenger cars -- tools for professionals, but not professional drivers/programmers.  Perhaps we are in </em><a href="ViolentAgreement.html">ViolentAgreement</a>.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Those tools you mention are generally not powerful enough such that C#, Java, etc. are used instead. It's true the programmers usually don't leverage the full power of such languages. If you start out in a wimpy half-ass-programming tool, then it <strong>doesn't scale</strong> if you later need to expand it and you have to start over. If you use say C# or Java, then you have the <strong>option of hiring skilled consultants or cream-of-crop experts</strong> if and when you need to ramp up features. The ability to ramp up features/complexity if and when needed is highly valued in the biz world. This DOES mean that typical programmers are using tools with features beyond their abilities, but that's the price a typical org wants to pay to gain future potential scaling.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Then the price (for lack of a better term) that your typical programmers will have to pay for using C#, Java, etc., is having to deal with advanced features and overall complexity.  Perhaps effort should be devoted to developing languages -- perhaps even as a subset of full Java/C# functionality -- targeted at non-professional developers.  Perhaps that's something you could develop.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        I generally agree that such a language(s) should be explored, but it's usually not a problem having the features as long as somebody doesn't over-use them. Plus, having an "X lite" may create a stigma that developers want to avoid and could make hiring more difficult. We are dealing with human beings and their egos here, not robots. One learns to pay more attention to such factors in cubicle-land over time in order to understand the preferences of managers and HR.

        <em>How do you distinguish using a feature from over-using a feature?</em>

        Perhaps something somewhat along the lines of a <a href="DualTypingLanguage.html">DualTypingLanguage</a> where certain language constructs can also be required and/or "locked off". Thus, if a shop didn't want anybody to use HOF's, they could lock that feature in the master config file(s).

           I never claimed it "superior"; only reasonably competitive in terms of code size (within say 10%).

Grokking often overrides parsimony, in my economic opinion. As far as <a href="InAppQueryExample.html">InAppQueryExample</a>, I don't know what its actual production use and change pattern would likely be such that I cannot recommend an OOP API design tuned for the (unknown) need.

As for <a href="InAppQueryExample.html">InAppQueryExample</a>, you appear to have started it and stopped part way.

I thought it was the latter.  Even if it's the former, if you're going to successfully leverage "existing developer knowledge", doesn't it make sense to implement approaches that are general-purpose and independent of "actual production use and change pattern" -- so that they remain consistent, and thus genuinely leverage "existing developer knowledge" -- rather than varying with each "actual production use and change pattern"?<em></em>

           The "existing language" issue is addressed below. As far as the second half, it appears there is a mix-up between API design and language design. API design is typically heavily influenced by intended use. A super-duper flexible "query interface" will essentially resemble or reinvent a database.

      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>What is the mix-up?  Did you intend to illustrate API design or language design?  The point isn't the "query interface"; it's merely a familiar illustration.  It could as easily have had nothing to do with querying data structures.</em>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Familiar illustration of what practical or common issue? There's plenty of lab-toy-like illustrations out there showing all kinds of meta-programming and abstraction tricks. The problem is applying and/or evaluating them from the standpoint of typical ("real") applications and application developers. We don't need more lab-toy examples, that's not the bottleneck. In practice code won't juggle that many aspects at the same time because either the domain <strong>constrains some</strong> or the application is partitioned in a way as to not overwhelm developers. <strong>Excessive indirection confuses</strong> typical developers, for good or bad. Some dimensions will be nailed to the floor (hard-coded or copy-and-pasted) to avoid too many "free variables" at the same time. For example, the division between application and database sometimes creates artificial boundaries, but those boundaries also allow <a href="DivideAndConquer.html">DivideAndConquer</a> among staff so that database experts can focus on the database-ish things and app developers can focus more on behavioral or UI aspects. A perfect brain probably wouldn't need such partitioning.

           I don't believe the "child method" issue was a significant one. We were already comparing apple designs to orange designs at that point such that a direct parsimony score-card is not possible. It was mostly meant as an illustration that OOP could be made more flexible in general. And I have already surrendered on the "existing language" issue multiple times and am wondering if our revisit here is due to forgetfulness. But remember that the limits of existing languages could be very well the reasons we find FP constructs in them. It appears to be <strong>a fad to plug OOP gaps with lambda's and HOF's</strong>. Focusing on OOP makes a language management party look like legacy fogies. OOP is no longer hip like it was a decade ago.

It sounds like another planet. <a href="LetTheReaderDecide.html">LetTheReaderDecide</a> which profile fits their own org to apply algorithm 376.

           Your (fictitious) dichotomy between "professional" and non-professional. That's a vast over-simplification. There are a variety of skills, both code and non-code that they are typically evaluated on, and high-abstraction or all-paradigm coding is one of many. [Changed recently, after reply below written.]

           <em>I didn't claim anyone was "professional" vs "non-professional".  It's possible to be a professional accountant or professional business analyst, say, and not consider yourself (or be considered by others) a professional programmer even if you write code all day.  Of course "professional programmer" vs "non-professional programmer" is a simplification, but so is almost any other single adjective used to identify a large collective.  Would "trained programmer" vs "untrained programmer" serve any better?  It's certainly no worse than your use of "typical programmer", and much less deprecatory or discriminatory than the abilities you claim the "typical programmer" doesn't have.  Furthermore, there is nothing particularly "high-abstraction coding" about </em><a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a>s and <a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a>s.  In terms of abstraction level, a <a href="HigherOrderFunction.html">HigherOrderFunction</a> or <a href="LambdaExpression.html">LambdaExpression</a> is a function, differing only from non-HOF/non-lambda functions in that the former can receive or return a function and the latter doesn't have a name.  These are minor differences in characteristics, not greater abstraction.<em></em>

        It doesn't matter anyhow, the reader can apply algorithm 376 to find the best match for THEIR situation such that asking for confusion proof is mostly moot. You are just being an obsessive dickhead due to a personality defect. This obsessiveness causes you to argue about the same thing over and over again redundantly and repeatedly redundantly because your obsessive personality defect causes you to to argue about the same thing over and over again redundantly and repeatedly redundantly.
