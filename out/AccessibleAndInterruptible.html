        Accessible And Interruptible
      </h1>
      <p>
        Most technical work is best done by people who are able to focus exclusively on a task for long periods of time without distractions.  However, there are certain technical roles that are require the holders to be <em>accessible</em>, meaning that other people can contact them, and <em>interruptible</em>, meaning that they can shift between tasks as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being accessible and interruptible is especially important for these roles:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           manager
        </li>
        <li>
           architect, technical lead, lead developer
        </li>
        <li>
           analyst, customer, customer representative
        </li>
        <li>
           technical support, network support, on-call service
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you hold one or more of these roles, but also hold one of those heads-down roles, then the roles are going to have conflicting time-management needs.  You will either face continuous interruptions that interfere with your focused work, or you will have to lock yourself away somewhere and leave others without access to a necessary resource.
      </p>
      <p>
        If possible, try not to give yourself conflicting roles.  If conflicting roles are unavoidable, some steps you can take to minimize the conflicts are
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           share information with as many people as possible, or make it available in written form, so that you are not the sole source
        </li>
        <li>
           delegate responsibilities to others
        </li>
        <li>
           try to get everyone to use e-mail and other asynchronous means of communication
        </li>
        <li>
           set up a regular schedule so that people know when is a good time to talk to you and when is not
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        When deadlines approach or other stressful events occur, many people make themselves less accessible.  The stated reason is often "So I can actually get something done".  However, this is often counter-productive, as crises are better resolved with more communication between people, not less.  It is usually better to make yourself even more accessible and interruptible, rather than isolating yourself.
