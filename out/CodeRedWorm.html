        Code Red Worm
      </h1>
      <p>
        Code Red is a ComputerWorm, discovered in July 2001.  It only infects Windows machines running MicrosoftIis Web servers.  It exploits a <a href="BufferOverflow.html">BufferOverflow</a>, which was by no means new when the worm started to spread.  However, still many Web servers were infected.  Code Red starts a distributed server attack against an IP of the US American WhiteHouse.  However, this threat was easily neutralized by assigning a new IP to the Web address.

        What is this and why do people keep telling me that I need to protect my Linux, BSD, and sunos and dunix boxes from it?
      </p>
      <p>
        You can't protect your own box.  You can only hope that other people stop their boxes from attacking yours.
      </p>
      <p>
        Actually, you can protect your own box... just pull out the network plug. Some might see the solution as worse than the disease, though.
      </p>
      <p>
        Alternatively, you can sacrifice a single box as firewall to prevent packets destined for port 80 from ever reaching your other boxes.  This assumes you're not running a Web server of your own, of course.  A more complex firewall/proxy setup could allow you to run an externally accessible Web server on a protected box; have the firewall/proxy accept the port 80 connection, read enough of it to see if it's a Code Red style probe, and only pass requests through if they're not.  (Unfortunately, some ISPs doing this sort of proxying have had troubles with their proxy servers dying under the load, because they were accepting connections even for machines that didn't exist.)

        There is something on <a href="http://www.linux.org.uk/diary/codered.shtml">http://www.linux.org.uk/diary/codered.shtml</a> on what to do if you are running <a href="GnuLinux.html">GnuLinux</a> and an <a href="ApacheHttpd.html">ApacheHttpd</a> Server.

        People who are running an IIS server under Windows NT or 2000 should be concerned about being infected and inadvertantly adding to the problem. A patch from Microsoft is available.

        From <a href="BruceSchneier.html">BruceSchneier</a>'s CryptoGram:

      <dl>
        <dt> </dt>
        <dd>My network is regularly probed by Code Red-infected computers, trying to infect me.  I can easily generate a list of those computers and their IP addresses.  This is a list of computers vulnerable to the particular IIS exploit that Code Red uses.  If I wanted to, I could attack every computer on that list and install whatever Trojan or back door I wanted.  I don't have to scan the network; vulnerable computers are continuously coming to me and identifying themselves.  How many hackers are piggybacking on Code Red in this manner?</dd>
      </dl>
      <p>
        Hmmm... theoretically, couldn't you also <strong>dis</strong>infect these computers by attacking them with a vaccine?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>That is a little bit illegal, isn't it?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Is it? I'm not sure. You're not damaging the computers. In fact, you'd be fixing them. If I'm given root access (which is basically what's happening), then as long as I play nice I'm not really doing anything illegal, am I?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Whether or not it is or isn't technically legal, this is not the kind of thing I'd care to try explaining to Secret Service agents when they sequester all my gear and then lose it in their evidence room.</em>

        Thank god I live in Canada! ;-)

        <em>Wouldn't this just be an example of a </em>GoodVirus. Disinfecting their computers sounds more like community service than illegal...<em></em>

        Strangely, there is also a new cherry-flavored variety of <a href="MountainDew.html">MountainDew</a> being test-marketed in a few places, including where I live. It is called <a href="CodeRed.html">CodeRed</a>. -- <a href="EdwardKiser.html">EdwardKiser</a>

      <p>
        Nothing strange about that.  The people who first identified the Code Red Worm named it that because that's what they were drinking at the time they found it.  The originator(s) of the worm have not been found and didn't seem to supply it with a name.
