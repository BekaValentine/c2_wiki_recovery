        English Orthography
      </h1>
      <p>
        <em>Orthography</em> literally means "straight writing." Of course, anyone who speaks English knows that its orthography is anything but straightforward.

        Note the effect works best with the British pronunciations:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Pall Mall</em> a location in London, pronounced "pell-mell." Don't ask me about the brand of cigarettes.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>lieutenant</em> in England is pronounced "left-tenant".
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Job, Job</em> the second <em>Job</em> is the Biblical one.
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>victuals</em> is the correct spelling of "vittles."
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Ralph</em> is pronounced "Rafe" across the pond, as in <em>Ralph Vaughn Williams.</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>groats</em> is the correct spelling of "grits." <em>Kiss my grits!</em>
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>clerk</em> is pronounced <em>clark</em> 
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        All of which goes to prove that English is not a language - it is a stew of languages!
        example: <em>lieutenant</em> is French and means someone who holds the place of.
        <em>Pall Mall</em> comes (again from French) paille maille and is a game which was the ancestor of croquet.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Many thanks for that tidbit! Evidently, Pall Mall is not etymologically related with "pall" or "mall". Never thought of that.</em>
