        In my workspace (my BuiltHomeOffice), many things are going on at one time and when concentration is not on the  simple thing as "where should I put this so I can find it at an AtArmsLength proximity - or at least - I can roll my chair there proximity", .

      <ul>
        <li>
           The Large Screen Tv (Monitor reachable via HDMI) (Media Player - which can play "ElevatorMusic" which I like, or can serve to play InternetVideos from <a href="YouTube.html">YouTube</a> and elsewhere) is configurable using two different remotes, 1) my UverseRemote, and 2) My Large Screen Tv Remote.

        Where to put the remotes, each time, every time can be fixed and preserved for browser-reachability by taking a DigitalPhoto of them where you want them to be, and then filing in My Pictures (the image part of <a href="WhereShouldItBe.html">WhereShouldItBe</a>) or other easily clickable place (the linking part of <a href="WhereShouldItBe.html">WhereShouldItBe</a>). for me it is the Desktop. When using <a href="NysLte.html">NysLte</a>, the prefix I use is WsIb: (followed by the ArtifactName).  [See <a href="NysLte.html">NysLte</a> for information and links]
