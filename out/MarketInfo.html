        A clarification: in the whole project, the average underestimation error against the first estimate has been measured as 15.68%.
        Limiting the measurement to the last 3 months showed a value of 0.61% ==> in the first part of the project we had an underestimation error of 30.56% 
        ==> therefore the reduction was from ~31% (in the first 7 months) to ~1% (in the last 3 months).

        A few questions from <a href="KenBitskoMacLeod.html">KenBitskoMacLeod</a>:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           <em>Were the estimates produced by the developers themselves improved to that accuracy?</em> ==> Yes
        </li>
        <li>
           <em>Or were the developer's estimates adjusted by an error factor?</em> ==> No: we tried it in past projects, but it really didn't work as good as exposing estimates without adjustment. Actually, this is the subject of a paper that I will present at XP2003.
