        <strong>The problem:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A programmer wants to learn how to program in Microsoft Visual Basic for Applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>The context:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The programmer has seen Visual Basic and VBA code, but is not very familiar with the syntax, and is not very familiar with the objects that are commonly used in VBA code.  The programmer has seen some <a href="TestFirst.html">TestFirst</a> code, but has not learned how to test her own code first.  The programmer is not familiar with VBA's environment for trying out individual lines of code, and does not have much practice stepping through VBA code in the debugger.  The programmer does have experience identifying a problem, identifying what a solution to the problem should be capable of, and verifying that the solution matches the problem requirements -- just in other contexts.  The programmer has reference material for VBA (including VBA's help, the help within each Microsoft Office application, Google, and a very thick reference tome).  The programmer has access to the Refactoring book, which unfortunately only has Java examples.  The programmer has access to an experienced VB and VBA programmer, whom she can ask questions of.  The programmer has access to <a href="MicrosoftOffice.html">MicrosoftOffice</a>, including <a href="MicrosoftWord.html">MicrosoftWord</a>, <a href="MicrosoftExcel.html">MicrosoftExcel</a>, and <a href="MicrosoftAccess.html">MicrosoftAccess</a>.

      <p>
        <strong>What this page tries to do:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        This page will present a series of programming exercises.  Each exercise will allow the programmer to become familiar with one feature of VBA.  By the time the programmer is done with the exercise, the programmer will be able to explain the concept, when it is useful, when it is not useful, and what some common problems are with it.  The programmer will have used the concept to solve a problem of her own devising.  The exercises will build on each other, and let the programmer continually refresh and cement her knowledge of the earlier concepts.  In other words, it will use the SaxonMath approach, not the CramStudying approach.  This page will not present the answers to the problems -- those are left as exercises for the programmer.  (Per the context, the programmer can get the information she needs to solve the problems.)

      <p>
        <strong>Recommended Coding Conventions:</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        In each of the exercises, it is a very good idea to follow these guidelines:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Always use <strong>Option Explicit</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Always explicitly state whether a <strong>Sub</strong>, <strong>Function</strong>, or <strong>Type</strong> is <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Private</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Always explicitly state whether an argument to a <strong>Sub</strong> or <strong>Function</strong> is <strong></strong><a href="ByRef.html">ByRef</a><strong> or </strong><a href="ByVal.html">ByVal</a><strong>.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
           Use the line continuation character to explicitly wrap long lines.  This lets you see all of your code in the IDE, and see it the same way when you print out.
        </li>
        <li>
           Whenever possible, declare variables with a datatype; avoid implicitly declaring them as Variant.  If a variable needs to be a Variant, know why it needs to be a Variant.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <strong>Exercise 1:  The Excel VBE</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In Excel, launch the VisualBasicEditor (VBE).
        </li>
        <li>
           Configure the VBE so that any new modules you create start with <strong>Option Explicit</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           In the VBE, show these features:
          <ul>
            <li>
               The Project Pane
            </li>
            <li>

          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
           Write a line of code in the Immediate Window that computes something.  For example, if you have 3 spoons and 4 forks, how many pieces of flatware do you have in all?  Make VBE show you the result in the Immediate Window.
        </li>
        <li>
           Optionally, exit VBE.
        </li>
        <li>
           Optionally, exit Excel.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>

               What is the purpose of the Immediate Window?
            </li>
            <li>
               What is the purpose of the Locals Window?
            </li>
            <li>
               What is the purpose of the Code Window?
            </li>
            <li>
               What are the two ways you can tell the Immediate Window to show you an answer in the Immediate Window?
            </li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>

        <strong>Exercise 2:  The Access VBE</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Perform Exercise 1 in Access.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>

        <strong>Exercise 3:  "OK" Message Boxes</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In a VBE, write a line of code in the Immediate Window that computes something.  For example, if you have 3 spoons and 4 forks, how many pieces of flatware do you have in all?
        </li>
        <li>
           Make VBE show you the result in a message box.
        </li>
        <li>
           Change the title of the message box.  (It is often a good idea to have the title briefly indicate the name and version number of the program you are writing.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Add one of the standard icons to the message box, such as a question mark, an information icon, a serious warning icon, or no icon.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Questions about Exercise 3:
          <ul>
            <li>
               What argument(s) to the <a href="MsgBox.html">MsgBox</a> command do you have to use?
            </li>
            <li>
               What argument(s) are optional?
            </li>
            <li>
               Are there any argument(s) that you did not use in this exercise?
            </li>
            <li>
               What does each argument do?
            </li>
            <li>
               In the programs you expect to write, which arguments to you expect to use often?  Why?
            </li>
            <li>
               In the programs you expect to write, which arguments to you rarely expect to use?  Why?
            </li>
            <li>
               What are the "magic numbers" for each kind of standard icon?
            </li>
            <li>
               Does VBA have any global constants that correspond to these "magic numbers"?
              <ul>
                <li>
                   If so, what are they?
                </li>
                <li>
                   If so, which is easier for you to look up or remember?
                </li>
                <li>
                   If so, which is easier for you to understand when you are reading code?
                </li>
              </ul>

        <strong>Exercise 4:  Trivial Functions</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In Excel's VBE, write a function that takes one input (of type Variant), and returns the exact same value.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make the function a <strong>Public Function</strong>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make sure to indent the code inside of the function.
        </li>
        <li>
           Call the function from cell(s) in Excel.
        </li>
        <li>
           Try out the function with several kinds of data (such as strings or numbers).
        </li>
        <li>
           Save your work.
        </li>
      </ul>

            <li>
               What is the difference between a <strong>Function</strong> and a <strong>Sub</strong>?
            </li>
            <li>
               Why can't you use a <strong>Sub</strong> to solve this problem?
            </li>
            <li>
               What is the difference between a <strong>Public</strong> and a <strong>Private</strong> routine?
            </li>
            <li>
               Why can't you use a <strong>Private</strong> routine to solve this problem?
            </li>
            <li>
               If you do not specify <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Private</strong>, what does VBA default to?
            </li>
            <li>
               Why should we always explicitly specify <strong>Public</strong> or <strong>Private</strong>?
            </li>
            <li>
               How do you tell VBA what value should be returned by a function?
            </li>
          </ul>

        <strong>Exercise 9: Select Case</strong>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           In Excel, write a VBA function that performs the choice in Exercise 7.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Use the <strong>Select Case</strong> feature.
            </li>
            <li>
               Note that Visual Basic's <strong>Select Case</strong> feature is very powerful.  It can handle numbers, strings, and ranges of values.  It can also handle expressions.  Other common languages' <strong>Case</strong> statements have many fewer options.
            </li>
            <li>
               If appropriate, include a <strong>Case Else</strong> statement.
            </li>
            <li>
               It is often a good idea to put comments in some of the <strong>Case</strong> statements, especially the <strong>Case Else</strong> statement.
            </li>
            <li>
               Make sure to indent your code so that it is easy to understand.  Two examples are on the <a href="SelectCaseExamples.html">SelectCaseExamples</a> page.

        <li>
           In an Excel workbook, choose two cells that you want to always have the same value.
        </li>
        <li>
           Make it so that updating the first cell automatically updates the second cell.  (This is trivial -- just have a formula in the second cell that gets the value from the first cell.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Make it so that updating the second cell automatically updates the first cell.  (This is trivial, if you are willing to give up the ability to manually change the first cell -- just have a formula in the first cell that gets the value from the second cell.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Create Worksheet_Change() event(s) for each cell.
          <ul>
            <li>
               Have each Worksheet_Change() event call a subroutine -- but do not make the subroutine set the value of the other cell yet.  (If you do, you risk an infinite loop).
            </li>
            <li>
               Use a static variable inside the subroutine to make sure that the guts of the subroutine do not get called (indirectly) by the subroutine.  You will need to use a <a href="GuardClause.html">GuardClause</a>, as discussed in Exercise 10.
            </li>
            <li>
               Now it is safe for the guts of the subroutine to set the values of both cells.

        This is the "heavy typing" view of things rather than the scriptish "keep code short and clean" philosophy. Perhaps the verbose approach is good during the learning phase, but dynamic coding is a useful and powerful skill and this should be pointed out. (This doesn't apply to "option explicit", which MS screwed up badly on.) --top

        Well, okay. I just think the beginner should know about both styles and that they both have their place. Even if you personally "hate" one or the other, a beginner has to at least be ready for the different expectations and requests of the marketplace.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>True, but I'd encourage beginners to especially avoid implicit Variant variables in order to discourage questionable practices, such as using the same variable for multiple, differently-typed purposes in the same code block.  Arguably, "scriptish" approaches using dynamic implicit typing should be considered an advanced programming technique -- a sharp cutting tool for the expert, rather than a shortcut for the beginner.  New VBA programmers are all too likely to cause run-time type errors due to careless or naïve "beginners" coding.  Manifest static typing may help reduce the likelihood of this, whilst encouraging discipline and focusing the developer's mind on the type and purpose of a given variable.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Students should be exposed to dynamic typing at some point. Perhaps VBx is not the best language for such because of its messy rules and limiting declaration options.
