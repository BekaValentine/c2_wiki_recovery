        Dont Sweat The Exceptions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Find the rule of thumb.
      </p>
      <p>
        You know, the one that works most of the time.
      </p>
      <p>
        The time you save in the vast majority of cases will leave you with an extraordinary amount of time to deal with the exceptions.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>"But what about (insert special case here)!?"</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        Yes?  What about it? 
      </p>
      <p>
        The time to optimize (and deal with the special case) is when there is a proven need for it.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Not before.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        Optimizing is very different to dealing with special cases.
        A lot of (most?) bugs occur in special cases.  If you don't consider the special cases, you're letting bugs in.
        Going back and checking for special cases on line-by-line on a huge body of code might possibly be effective, but it's no easier than getting it right the first time, and I bet in 99% of cases, that checking gets omitted.  Of course, in theory, your unit tests and assertions are checking those special cases anyway, right?  (c.f. the <a href="MetaFont.html">MetaFont</a> test file) Perhaps you mean something different when you say "Special case".  Can you give a concrete example? --<a href="AnAspirant.html">AnAspirant</a>

        I was going to write a paragraph or two explaining how the special cases I was talking about differs from the one you were talking about.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Then I realized that I had forgotten what I was originally talking about (oops... next time I'll add more context).  
      </p>
      <p>
        And then I noticed that I had forgotten before I had finished writing the piece in the first place.
      </p>
      <p>
        I'm not talking about the act of writing code or other such 'hard' (concrete?) tasks.   I'm talking about the 'soft' tasks.  
      </p>
      <p>
        Managing people.  Leading programmers.  Dealing with management.  And so on.
      </p>
      <p>
        Although I'm sure some sort of case could be made for this in 'hard' task, what I'm getting at is the people related problems, where you can <em>always</em> find another exception.
      </p>
      <p>
        Just find a solution that works for the brunt of the problem.  And treat it as a rule of thumb... if there's a valid reason in some situation not to follow it, then deal with it then.  Don't try to deal with it when you create the solution.
      </p>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        As a concrete software example, I'm currently working on a bond analytics library.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most bonds follow easy-to-understand rules when going from a yield level to a price.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Then you get the Dutch perpetual bond, whose last coupon has a funny interest accrual convention.
        </li>
        <li>
           Then you get the French OAT bond, where interest payments are rounded to the 5th decimal place.
        </li>
        <li>
           Then you get South African bonds, where interest payments and discounting use different conventions.
        </li>
        <li>
           Then you get...
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, if I had tried to deal with all of this from the start, I would still be attempting to construct an appropriately generic framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        Instead, you start with the simple stuff, and then extend outwards. Progress is a lot quicker. <em>And</em> you end up with a better abstraction at the end of it, since you're constructing things as you go and not adding <a href="GoldPlating.html">GoldPlating</a> up front.
