        Planguage Concept Glossary
      </h1>
      <p>
        The <a href="PlanguageConcept.html">PlanguageConcept</a>Glossary contains the master definitions of the fundamental Planguage [PlanningLanguage] concepts. Its central purpose is to define <em>concepts</em> not words.  <a href="TomGilb.html">TomGilb</a> has given permission to quote from it freely, and partially, when suitable credit is given to origin. Notification of your use would always be interesting to him and may result in useful updates and feedback to you (Notification of use, reference, and Â© credit to Tom@Gilb.com (which is sufficient credit annotation)).
      </p>
      <p>
        The full glossary is available for download from <a href="http://www.gilb.com/Download/Glossary.zip,">http://www.gilb.com/Download/Glossary.zip,</a> but it unzips into a 4Mb (523 page) MSWord document.
      </p>
      <p>
        The new, improved Gilb website has a fully hyperlinked version of the glossary, which enormously improves its browsability:  <a href="http://www.gilb.com/community/tiki-page.php?pageName=Competitive%20Engineering%20Glossary.">http://www.gilb.com/community/tiki-page.php?pageName=Competitive%20Engineering%20Glossary.</a>  There is still a large download on opening this page, however.

        As of November 2013 we are hard at work creating a fully website friendly, linked up version of the Planguage Concept Glossary. Go to: <a href="http://www.gilb.com/Glossary">http://www.gilb.com/Glossary</a>
