        Kibo Number
      </h1>
      <p>
        One's Kibo Number is meant as a measure of degrees of separation from <a href="JamesKiboParry.html">JamesKiboParry</a>.  Your Kibo Number is 1 higher than the lowest Kibo Number of anyone you've received e-mail from.  If you've received mail from Kibo yourself, your Kibo Number is 1.
      </p>
      <p>
        Not quite as important since, by now, more people know about <a href="AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs.html">AllYourBaseAreBelongToUs</a> than about Kibo.
      </p>
      <p>
        Proclaim your <a href="KiboNumber.html">KiboNumber</a>, if applicable:

        <li>
           BrianHampel: 2 (I correspond with his sister; I must assume she's a 1.)

        <li>
           MattThompson: 1 (Newbie, 2001.  It was about Manos!)

        If you corresponded with him in 1988, you might be even more elite than the members of Club '91: people who posted to AltReligionKibology in its first year.  --<a href="NickBensema.html">NickBensema</a>
