        Component Framework
      </h1>
      <p>
        <strong>What is a Component Framework?</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> defines a set of <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a> that define the protocols by which components cooperate -- each component takes on roles in various <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a>.  The <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a> defined by a <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> provide a conceptual framework in which to think about solutions to the problem domain addressed by the framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        The <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> also defines the <em>packaging</em> for components so that they can be instantiated and composed into legal configurations by <a href="ThirdPartyBinding.html">ThirdPartyBinding</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        For ease of use, a <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> can provide <a href="ComponentGlue.html">ComponentGlue</a> to make it easy to connect components that play roles in incompatible <a href="AbstractInteractions.html">AbstractInteractions</a>.  Scripting is an especially flexible form of <a href="ComponentGlue.html">ComponentGlue</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        To help framework users up the learning curve, a <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> can provide <a href="PrebuiltFunctionality.html">PrebuiltFunctionality</a>, such as useful components or <a href="AutomatedAssembly.html">AutomatedAssembly</a> functions that automatically instantiate and compose components to perform common tasks.
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> is used as a <a href="BlackBoxFramework.html">BlackBoxFramework</a> when composing components. However, a <a href="WhiteBoxFramework.html">WhiteBoxFramework</a> (or other OO techniques) can be used to support programmers implementing new components. 
      </p>
      <p>
        A <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> is often implemented as <a href="LayeredFrameworks.html">LayeredFrameworks</a> to manage complexity.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>How does a </strong><a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> differ from an Object Oriented Framework?<strong></strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        The main distinguishing feature seems to be that an application is constructed from <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> by <em>composition</em>, 
        and from an O-O framework by <em>customisation</em>.
      </p>
      <p>
        An O-O framework will provide a lot of behaviour.  The application programmer
        customises this behaviour for a particular application by extending or altering the classes by inheritance (e.g. <a href="TemplateMethodPattern.html">TemplateMethodPattern</a> or TemplateFactoryPattern) and by plugging application-specific objects into particular points of the object-web created by the framework (e.g. <a href="StrategyPattern.html">StrategyPattern</a>).
      </p>
      <p>
        An application is built using a <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> by instantiating prebuilt and application-specific component types and connecting compatible elements of their interfaces so that they can cooperate.  The component framework provides support for instantiation and composition, rather than for application tasks.  The application tasks are encapsulated within the components.
      </p>
      <p>
        However, there is no clear dividing line between a <a href="ComponentFramework.html">ComponentFramework</a> and OO framework.

And a web page on  ComponentBasedBusiness is 2001 (based on its news items). See <a href="http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~rxv/cbb/index.htm">http://www.users.globalnet.co.uk/~rxv/cbb/index.htm</a>

        <em>Is a component framework distinct from an operating system?</em><br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        <strong>A</strong> It is a system, but not classified as an <a href="OperatingSystem.html">OperatingSystem</a>. Discussion reopened 200812130650.m05
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>A</strong> I postulate that not much discussion occurs related to component frameworks these days (ca. 2008) because I think most feel it's now a solved problem.  The widespread deployment of frameworks like Spring in the commercial sector seems to suggest, however, that the golden age of component frameworks is far from over.
