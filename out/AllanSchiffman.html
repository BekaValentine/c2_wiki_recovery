        Allan Schiffman
      </h1>
      <p>
        Allan was LPD's (L. <a href="PeterDeutsch.html">PeterDeutsch</a>) sidekick (initially) and (later) boss. He worked on both PS and HPS, responsible for creating all the buggy parts. He was at <a href="ParcPlace.html">ParcPlace</a> 1986-1991, in charge of the Smalltalk product when it was changing its name all the freaking time.  
      </p>
      <p>
        This is a good place to mention that HPS stood for <a href="HighlyPortableSmalltalk.html">HighlyPortableSmalltalk</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        After 1991, Allan lost his way and went into Internet security stuff. He moved to Tahoe in 1996  but recently was resurrected as Executive Director of CommerceNet (<a href="http://www.commerce.net).">http://www.commerce.net).</a> You could try sending to him at ams at ieee.org.
