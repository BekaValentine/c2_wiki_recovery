        Wiki Stalker
      </h1>
      <p>
        A term I coined after visiting (<a href="WikiStalking.html">WikiStalking</a>) dozens of the pages I found in the <a href="BackLink.html">BackLink</a>s of a friend of mine, and left small comments on a few of them in response to comments he had made. I didn't have the term in mind at the time but afterwards, when I tried to name what I was doing, the term suggested itself. -- <a href="PeterHansen.html">PeterHansen</a>

        Presumably, this sort of behaviour could start to feel pretty creepy if you did it to someone you didn't know. It probably already happens a little with "famous" types like, say, <a href="RonJeffries.html">RonJeffries</a>, or <a href="WardCunningham.html">WardCunningham</a>, or <a href="AlistairCockburn.html">AlistairCockburn</a>. (Not that I mean to send any potential stalkers their way by putting their names here or anything! :-)

        But, is it better to be stalked than to simply have all your entries in a Wiki ignored? In the latter case, the implied criticism can be quite severe (nothing I have said is worth commenting on). -- <a href="SteveHolden.html">SteveHolden</a> (<em>who really isn't stalking </em><a href="PeterHansen.html">PeterHansen</a><em> ;-)</em>

        Oh, no, I just realized it's now only a matter of time before the StalkBot arrives. -- SH
