        Arch Linux
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="ArchLinux.html">ArchLinux</a> is a fast, technical linux distro made by Judd Vinet. It has a wonderful package management system (pacman) and is easier to configure through configuration files compared to other distros (because it does not have any GUI based configuration tools). <a href="ArchLinux.html">ArchLinux</a> embraces the <a href="KissPrinciple.html">KissPrinciple</a> (Keep It Simple Stupid) but that does not mean you miss out on things like KDE; instead they clean up KDE so it has everything you can think of but not what you can't. Also, the automatic dependency solving is a great help. I would say this is the undoubtedly best Medium to Advanced Linux distro there is. Unfortunately, hardly anyone knows of it.
