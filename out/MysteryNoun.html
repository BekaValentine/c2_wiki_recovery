        Impress the public by replacing a verb phrase that clearly expresses what you are doing by a <a href="MysteryNoun.html">MysteryNoun</a>. A mainstay of cult leaders, politicians, IT consultants and other charlatans.

        Maybe I'm just too skeptical, but I've often seen this in presentations by high priced consultants:
