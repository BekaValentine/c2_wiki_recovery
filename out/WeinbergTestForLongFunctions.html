        Weinberg Test For Long Functions
      </h1>
      <p>
        Suggested by <a href="JerryWeinberg.html">JerryWeinberg</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Pick one chunk of code. (I don't think it matters if it is a separate and named syntactic chunk, such as a function, or embedded within other code ; the rest of the test will take care of that.)
      </p>
      <p>
        Understand the code, what it's supposed to do, how that is accomplished.
      </p>
      <p>
        Memorize the code.
      </p>
      <p>
        Then, close the file, and without looking at the original again, write the chunk of code into a new file from memory.
      </p>
      <p>
        If you've made a mistake, the chunk was too long, or otherwise too complex. (If you've actually improved on the original, keep the improved version.)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>I like this test, this is the point the </em><a href="LotsOfShortMethods.html">LotsOfShortMethods</a> people are trying to make, code should be simple, and methods should be small enough to grasp without half an hour of study.<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        There are ways to make digestable "chunks" without creating named units (methods/functions) -- See <a href="HeadlinesTechnique.html">HeadlinesTechnique</a>.
      </p>

        Of course, this is a rule of thumb. Some things have a minimum amount of complexity, and then it depends on each person's memory. How many people still remember the precise details of the quadratic formula and could re-implement it from memory without making a mistake?
      </p>
      <p>
        (Yes, yes, I know that <strong>you</strong> can, but how many others?)
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>This is not about reimplementing from memory. It's about committing a manageable amount of detail to short-term recall, then reconstituting that. Look up an </em>implementation of<em> the quadratic formula, close the file, rewrite the same implementation. If you fail, that is no reflection on your memory, but on the clarity of the implementation you chose.</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's what I'm talking about. Not everyone's <strong>short-term</strong> memory (perhaps you thought I meant long-term, but I realize that is a different issue) is sufficient to do that, regardless of the clarity of the implementation, because that particular example has a lot of details that don't tend to have any mnemonic value for most people.

        A good argument for <a href="SevenPlusOrMinusTwo.html">SevenPlusOrMinusTwo</a> "sub-chunks" per chunk.
