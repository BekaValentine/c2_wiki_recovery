        I polled developers on a variety of newsgroups and forums and it would seem that practically nobody is doing <a href="VanillaXp.html">VanillaXp</a>. On the whole (more than 60% of the time) they do some of the practices some of the time. I have also observed that some teams who claim to be doing XP <a href="ByTheBook.html">ByTheBook</a> quite simply are not. As with so many other methods, its almost impossible to judge the effectiveness of the method as a whole because so few teams are doing the whole thing.
