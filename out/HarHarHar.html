        Har Har Har

      <p>
        A derivative form of "ha ha ha" (signifying laughter), usually used in one of two ironic contexts.  
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           As a response to an unfunny, tasteless, insulting, or offensive comment by someone else.  The comment is offered in jest or as a joke, not as a serious insult; this is known to both.  One would not respond with <a href="HarHarHar.html">HarHarHar</a> to a deliberate insult or slur.
        </li>
        <li>
           Pre-emptively, by the speaker of such a comment--often to signify that the comment is offered in jest.  i.e. <em>English is an easy language to learn--even Americans can learn it.  </em><a href="HarHarHar.html">HarHarHar</a><em></em>
        </li>
      </ul>

        On Wiki, we can use <a href="HarHarHar.html">HarHarHar</a> as a <a href="WikiBadge.html">WikiBadge</a> to identify such a comment....
