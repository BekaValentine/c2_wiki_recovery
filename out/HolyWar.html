        Holy War

      <p>
        The result of a controversial topic that tends to create long, recurring debates in wikis or <a href="UseNet.html">UseNet</a> groups in which both sides can't reach a mutual agreement. Often cause <a href="FlameWar.html">FlameWar</a>s.
      </p>

        A war declared or fought for a religious or high moral purpose, as to extend or defend a religion.

        <dd><em>holy wars</em> n. [from Usenet, but may predate it; common] n. flame wars over religious issues. The paper by Danny Cohen that popularized the terms big-endian and little-endian in connection with the LSB-first/MSB-first controversy was entitled "On Holy Wars and a Plea for Peace". Other perennial Holy Wars have included EMACS vs. vi, my personal computer vs. everyone else's personal computer, ITS vs. Unix, Unix vs. VMS, BSD Unix vs. USG Unix, C vs. Pascal, C vs. FORTRAN, etc., ad nauseam. The characteristic that distinguishes holy wars from normal technical disputes is that in a holy war most of the participants spend their time trying to pass off personal value choices and cultural attachments as objective technical evaluations. See also theology. </dd>

        Tragically the term is reverting to its original meaning, instead of being used as a metaphor. <em>Crusade, Jihad; the only difference is who holds the scimitar.</em> So you noticed.

        The most annoying thing about holy wars in a forum such as Wiki is that they tend to spread into every page.  Every topic related to text editing becomes a vi vs Emacs discussion; every topic about programming becomes a Java vs C++ discussion; every topic related to Windows software development becomes a tirade about the evils of the <a href="MicrosoftCorporation.html">MicrosoftCorporation</a>, etc. If you want to advocate or discuss the relative merits of technologies, tools, and methodologies, <em>please</em> confine your contributions on the pages devoted to those purposes, instead of putting them everywhere. If you see out-of-place holy-war contributions, please move them or refactor them so that they are in some way related to the whole of the page where they reside.

        It is my opinion that in many cases the benefits of something are subjective. What helps or bothers person A may not help or bother person B. The problem is that it is hard to discuss technical issues if such psychological issues keep creeping in. <a href="SoftwareEngineering.html">SoftwareEngineering</a> is more about psychology than math.

           They are poorly educated or ill-informed.
        </li>

           Just differences in personal preferences; no two brains are alike.
