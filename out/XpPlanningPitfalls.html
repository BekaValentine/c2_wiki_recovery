           <strong>Problem:</strong> People outside your project -- but who have the ear of the <a href="GoldOwner.html">GoldOwner</a>s -- get hold of the iteration or release plan, causing your team to have trouble re-prioritising stories and making the developers feel bad for not implementing stories as fast as was originally projected.

           Solution: make it clear that your estimates are just estimates and that things are going to change.

           Solution: release very often. If someone was hoping for a feature to be released this week, they probably will barely notice if it comes out next week. But if your next release is a month away, they'll probably notice and start causing trouble.

           Solution: learn some lessons from <a href="ScrumProcess.html">ScrumProcess</a>, especially the use of the <a href="ProductBacklog.html">ProductBacklog</a> and <a href="ProductOwner.html">ProductOwner</a> to control external influences on the team.
