        Alternatives To Regular Expressions

        I am not much of a fan of <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s. It is too hard to remember what the symbols stand for, for one. Asterisk for 0 or more repetition, plus for 1 or more repetitions, question mark for 0 or 1 occurrences, brackets surrounding a set of characters -- who's got time to memorize this kind of complexity? Besides, grammars are more complex than regular expressions, so they're simpler.
      </p>
      <p>
        I would like to see an alternative developed based on BNF grammar, as used by all language parsing kits. Here is an example BNF grammar for a "toy" Lisp:
      </p>
      <code>
        statement -> "(" command params ")"<br/>
        statement -> "(" command ")"<br/>
        params    -> params param<br/>
        params    -> param<br/>
        param     -> constant<br/>
        param     -> variable<br/>
        param     -> statement<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        or, with one extra symbol,
      </p>
      <code>
        statement -> "(" command params ")"<br/>
        params    -> params param | param |<br/>
        param     -> constant<br/>
        param     -> variable<br/>
        param     -> statement<br/>
      </code>
      <hr/>
      <p>
        This looks like a ContextFreeGrammar. This is great for <strong>parsing</strong> tasks, which is what Bison and Yacc are meant for (they implement rules very much like this). <a href="PerlLanguage.html">PerlLanguage</a>'s <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s have become bloated compared to the "classical" definition (by allowing backreferences and zero-length assertions) which makes them (as far as I can tell) as powerful as ContextFreeGrammars are (CFGs indeed are more powerful than traditional REs).
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Actually, </em><a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s embellished with such (backreferences etc) are <em>more</em> powerful than CFG's; they can be used to do some context-sensitive stuff as well.<em></em>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           They're not a strict superset unless some kind of recursion is added.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        However, you still have to know what kinds of sequences of characters make up a "constant", etc. Interpretation at that lower level is usually thought of as <em>scanning</em> or <em>lexing</em> which is what Flex and Lex, and traditional REs, are meant for. The sort of notation presented is (so the material was presented to me) rather overkill for this task, and the notation can be quite verbose - and may also use those symbols (.*?|) that you hold in such low regard. I don't see how you could do without at least |, in any case.

        The above notation, or something similar to it, is known as <a href="BackusNaurForm.html">BackusNaurForm</a>. As mentioned above, it is used to describe ContextFreeGrammars. It can also be used to describe <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>s; with the caveat that no recursive terms can be present in a <a href="RegularExpression.html">RegularExpression</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Lots of good stuff on this topic in the literature; see <a href="TheDragonBook.html">TheDragonBook</a> for example.

        Actually, the above example has lots of ambiguities. A better CFG for Lisp might be as follows; special forms are not treated specially here (the SemanticAnalyzer can handle that). Literal characters are enclosed in quotes. Comments follow //:
      </p>
      <code>
        Expression -> Literal                          // A string, number, punctuation, etc.<br/>
        Expression -> "`" List                         // quoted list.<br/>
        Expression -> List                             // unquoted list<br/>
        Expression -> "(" Expression "." Expression ")" // cons node syntactic sugar<br/>
        List       -> "(" Expressions ")";          // non-empty list<br/>
        List       -> "(" ")"                       // empty list<br/>
        Expressions -> Expression                   // two rules for Expressions; equivalent to Expression+<br/>
        Expressions -> Expressions Expression<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        I may have made an error there, feel free to correct. I'm also assuming that a LaLr parser is being generated; if you want to build a top-down parser, replace the last rule with
      </p>
      <code>
        Expressions-> Expression Expressions<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Go read <a href="TheDragonBook.html">TheDragonBook</a> to find out why that's important.

        Of course, any <a href="SmugLispWeenie.html">SmugLispWeenie</a> worth his/her salt will tell you that while LISP grammar is context-free; a parser stack is not needed to parse <a href="LispLanguage.html">LispLanguage</a>. All you need is a counter to count parentheses.

      <p>
        For those who didn't really get this, Lisp is unique in that there's really no conversion to a parse tree. Lisp <em>is</em> a parse tree as written.

        Trees with pointers, as said above. <a href="ImplementingLisp.html">ImplementingLisp</a> is possibly a good page for further questions.

        You may want to look at the <a href="RebolLanguage.html">RebolLanguage</a>. It has parsing built into the language, using a syntax that looks like the one you described.

        I've been kicking around another alternative that replaces the symbols and punctuation with function-like expressions. For example, this pattern string will check to see if a value is a positive number such as "17", "0.95", "123.456", "23.", etc.
      </p>
      <code>
        numpat = "rpt(dig,1,inf), rpt('.',0,1), rpt(dig,0,inf)";<br/>
      </code>
      <code>
        numpat = "rpt(dig,1,inf), '.', rpt(dig,0,inf)";   // if decimal required<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Some basic reserved items:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           rpt([charpat],[min],[max]) - Repeat controller.
        </li>
        <li>
           inf - Infinity, to represent open-ended repeats or counts.
        </li>
        <li>
           dig - Digits, same as "any('0123456789')"
        </li>
        <li>
           any([charpat]) - A given position can be any of the given characters.
        </li>
        <li>
           letters - All letters of the alphabet, upper or lower case
        </li>
        <li>
           uplets - Upper case letters
        </li>
        <li>
           lowlets - Lower case letters
        </li>
        <li>
           punc - ASCII punctuation such as $,#,%, etc...
        </li>
        <li>
           Perhaps we can barrow some operations from <a href="http://kobesearch.cpan.org/htdocs/Regexp-English/Regexp/English.html">http://kobesearch.cpan.org/htdocs/Regexp-English/Regexp/English.html</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <code>
        any('abc')  -  matches any a, b, or c.<br/>
        'abc' - matches only 'abc' in that literal order.<br/>
        rpt('abc', 2, 3) - Example matches: abcabc, abcabcabc<br/>
        rpt(any('abc'), 2, 3) - Example matches: ac, ba, bcb<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Nesting should also be possible:
      </p>
      <code>
        mypat = "rpt(pat(rpt(dig,1,inf), 'x'), 1, 3)";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Here "pat" specifies a pattern group. It would also be nice if there was a way to define patterns with names to break expressions into smaller and reusable chunks:
      </p>
      <code>
        mypat = newArray();<br/>
        mypat.integer = "rpt(dig,1,inf)";<br/>
        mypat.intWithX = "integer, 'x'";<br/>
        mypat.main = "rpt(intWithX, 1, 3)";  // same as prior example<br/>
        matchCount = isMatchArray(mypat, '1234x99x');<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        Assume that myPath is either an associative array or dynamic object. Also assume that "isMatchArray" looks for "main" as its starting point, using other array slots for defined patterns.
      </p>
      <p>
        Note that these two are equivalent:
      </p>
      <code>
        mypat.intWithX = "integer, 'x'";<br/>
        mypat.intWithX = "pat(integer, 'x')";<br/>
      </code>
      <p>
        "Pat" is just a more explicit way to indicate we are defining a pattern list.
      </p>
      <p>
        Maybe we can also have an "or(...)" operation to match variation branches.
      </p>

        I have in the past tried to be open to these sorts of ideas, but I have found it easier to simply memorizing the meaning of * (zero or more) and + (one or more) and [a-z] (the set of characters constituting the lower case latin alphabet) and | (OR) would take you about ten minutes, compared with hundreds of hours spent thinking about supposedly simpler approaches to save ten minutes.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is really no more tedious than memorization that "1 + 1" means addition and "2 * 2" means multiplication, so instead you are going to invent an "easier" system that requires less memorization, like "add(1, 1)" and "multiply(2, 2)".

        Each line is essentially an "OR" of possible character sets. It attempts to make the patterns more visual. Devising AND's and NOT's may take some thought.

        This page is incorrectly named. Grammars are not "alternatives", they are supersets of the semantics of regular expressions, and in some implementations, of the syntax as well.
      </p>
      <p>
        This depends on whether we are talking about the semantics of <a href="RegularExpressions.html">RegularExpressions</a> or their syntax. The semantics of regular expressions differs vastly (long since they accepted only <a href="RegularLanguage.html">RegularLanguage</a>). So the question rather seems to be how to write them more readable.
