        Insult Bit
      </h1>
      <p>
        When conversations or communications descend into name-calling, insults, or profanity, invoke this bit and terminate any further interaction with the instigator or the page.

        If something in the page is worthwhile, recover it and store in on your local computer. Otherwise consider the matter closed and disregard further communications there.

        As tempting as it might be to respond in kind, further attention is often exactly what the offending party wants.  Withholding attention is the best way to calm things down.  No matter how rational, clever, witty, convincing or scathing your intended response might be, a person who resorts to insults has passed the point of being rational.  He or she is not likely to respond to, or with, rationality until he or she has had time to cool off.
