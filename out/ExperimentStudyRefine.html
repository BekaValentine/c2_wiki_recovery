        Experiment Study Refine
      </h1>
      <p>
        What if your OO programming job requires the leverage of large amounts of
        third-party code or third-party techniques, outside of the realm of your team's knowledge and experience?  How do you acquire the expertise necessary, while sticking to the spirit of <a href="ExtremeProgramming.html">ExtremeProgramming</a>?
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Experiment</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        Attempt to incrementally create a capability that leverages some portion of the third-party technology in service of your requirements. 
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Study</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        After acquiring, through experimentation, greater knowledge of your requirements and the third-party technology, enter a (short) phase of deeper study of the related technology, in an attempt to answer questions raised by experimentation.
      </p>
      <p>
        <strong>Refine</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        After experimentation and study, refine (refactor) your existing testbed to 
        prepare for future experimentation and study, as well as the eventual fielding of the resultant system.
      </p>
      <p>
        ...and repeat.
