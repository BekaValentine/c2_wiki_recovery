        Not Found

      <p>
        The fact that something is not found does not mean that it does not exist.

        When I worked in a chemistry lab (setting up automated generation of reports), we never used "not found".  We did however used "not detected (ND)" which means <em>either</em> there was not any present, <em>or</em> our test didn't happen to find it in the part of the sample we used, <em>or</em> it might have even been there but below the threshold of sensitivity for the test, <em>or</em> it was detected but at a lower level than the relevant regulatory is interested in so we put ND to help our clients present their closing reports to the regulators.  - <a href="ChrisBaugh.html">ChrisBaugh</a>

        Used by those who <a href="FixYourWiki.html">FixYourWiki</a> to indicate sites (urls) which are no longer content sites.

               When the site is locatable, a OutsideWiki site is entered at the bottom of the page as a "try" this site
