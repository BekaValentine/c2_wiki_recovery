        Bold For Delphi

        Well I don't know, I'm still working out how to use it, but it seems that I can take a class diagram in Rose or <a href="ModelMaker.html">ModelMaker</a>, derive attributes and associations in OCL, and Bold will run this, stick it all in a database (any decent database) and even give me some autoforms to edit my objects, before I get round to writing any code (other than the OCL) or designing any of the GUI (with object aware components).

        OK, You've got to write code for it to actually do anything. But that's a good thing isn't it?
