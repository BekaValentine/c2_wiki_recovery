        Weird Al
      </h1>
      <p>
        Eclectic musician (Alfred Matthew Yankovic, b. Oct. 23, 1959; see  <a href="http://www.davesfunstuff.com/27artbio.htm).">http://www.davesfunstuff.com/27artbio.htm).</a> Well known for various spoofs of other artists' songs (and some random ones of his own). 
      </p>
      <p>
        Credits include "Eat It", "It's all about the Pentiums", "Polka Power", "Pretty Fly for a Rabbi" and various other silly and inane works of music.

        <em>Does "All About The Pentiums" really fall into the category of "inane" here?  "Silly", perhaps, but from what I could tell, </em><a href="WeirdAl.html">WeirdAl</a>'s playful skewering of/homage to the computer culture was both pretty accurate and well received (especially by those who were programming and/or online before the <a href="AolizationOfTheInternet.html">AolizationOfTheInternet</a>).<em></em>

        Acting career consists mainly (from my info) of <em>UHF</em>, where one could see Michael Richards (Kramer from <em>Seinfeld</em>) in his err ... early acting career. (Don't take my mop!)* Good movie, perhaps you should rent it, again, spoofs of everything from Indiana Jones to who knows what else.

        <em>I was always impressed by the songs that he did that were not takeoffs of specific songs, but of specific styles of different rock groups. "Velvet Elvis" as a Police song, "Dog Eat Dog" as something the Talking Heads might have written ... </em> "Dare To Be Stupid" was a dead-on DEVO pastiche.

        I used to know this guy who knew every song of his word for word and his entire social repertoire consisted of quoting Weird Al and <a href="MontyPython.html">MontyPython</a>. I'd really like to hear him go through "Albuquerque". -- <a href="LeeNathan.html">LeeNathan</a>
