        I've learned more about programming here than in most books, and I've learned more about collaboration here than in most jobs.

        <strong>Chemical Emergency Planning</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        I help communities plan for chemical emergencies. I enjoy working with chemicals, people, and computers (but not necessarily in that order). 
      </p>
      <p>
        I liked Wiki so much as a method of collaboration that I created a short-lived <a href="ChemicalEmergencyPlanningWiki.html">ChemicalEmergencyPlanningWiki</a> for co-workers and friends. It never took off, so I never restored it when my webhost's server crashed. 
      </p>
      <p>
        In my job as a planner, I've found Wiki very helpful:
