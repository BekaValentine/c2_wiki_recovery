        Accu Rev
      </h1>
      <p>
        <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> was originally founded in 1998 by Damon Poole and associates to provide consulting services to development organizations, particularly those using <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> (now part of the IBM Rational suite) who required better process support. <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> began shipping commercial software products in 2002 to address the limitations of branch and label software change and configuration management (SCCM) tools with an innovative stream-based architecture and process-centric SCCM product that shares the company name.  see <a href="http://www.accurev.com">http://www.accurev.com</a> .  Many of the people at the <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> company came from a <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a> background, including its VP of Development, David Jabs, one of the original creators of <a href="ClearCase.html">ClearCase</a>.

        AccuWork Issue Tracking (See <a href="http://www.accurev.com/issue-tracking.html)">http://www.accurev.com/issue-tracking.html)</a>
        Issue-based and feature-based development are considered best practices in software engineering. With AccuWork, the integrated issue-tracking software included in <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Enterprise, teams can easily create and manage issues, and keep track of the code changes associated with an issue. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Advanced Merge Tracking (See <a href="http://www.accurev.com/merge-tracking.html)">http://www.accurev.com/merge-tracking.html)</a>
        File merges are a common and often time-consuming activity in parallel software development. With <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Advanced Merge Tracking, determining which files require merges – and performing the actual merge - is easy. <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Streams assure that the full history of all files participating in a merge is tracked, so that complex merges can be understood at a glance. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Change Packages (See <a href="http://www.accurev.com/change-packages.html)">http://www.accurev.com/change-packages.html)</a>
        <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Change Packages are the key to issue-based development and requirements traceability. By creating logical groupings of code changes, Change Packages allow developers and managers to work at the process level, not just at the code level. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Crosslinks and Symbolic Links (<a href="http://www.accurev.com/cross-links-symbolic-links.html)">http://www.accurev.com/cross-links-symbolic-links.html)</a>
        Component reuse is critical to efficient software development. <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Crosslinks and Symbolic links enable teams to share pre-built components and 3rd party libraries without the need to store these artifacts in multiple locations. 
      </p>
      <p>
        History Annotation View (<a href="http://www.accurev.com/histroy-annotation.html)">http://www.accurev.com/histroy-annotation.html)</a>
        The innovative History Annotation view provides developers with a fully annotated view of any source file. Users can view historic versions of files just by dragging the Version Slider. This enables quick comparisons and helps improve the efficiency of code reviews. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Private Workspaces (<a href="http://www.accurev.com/private-versioning.html)">http://www.accurev.com/private-versioning.html)</a>
        By providing fully version controlled private workspaces, <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> enables developers to isolate their in-progress code from others without the need to create a separate branch. Developers can perform local check-ins to keep their code safe in the <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> repository, and then promote it for inclusion in builds and other automated development processes. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Security (<a href="http://www.accurev.com/security.html)">http://www.accurev.com/security.html)</a>
        Enterprises need secure software products, especially when dealing with critical intellectual property such as source code. <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> provides enterprise-class security via secure authentication, access control lists for streams and depots, and custom triggers to fine-tune security policy.
      </p>
      <p>
        Snapshots (<a href="http://www.accurev.com/snapshots.html)">http://www.accurev.com/snapshots.html)</a>
        Tagging a build is time consuming and costly in legacy SCM systems. With <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Snapshots, code lines can be “labeled” instantaneously to uniquely identify any code line and allow for reproducing builds in the future. This is critical for processes such as continuous integration that require frequent builds from identifiable code lines. 
      </p>
      <p>
        StreamBrowser (See <a href="http://www.accurev.com/streambrowser.html)">http://www.accurev.com/streambrowser.html)</a>
        The <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> StreamBrowser brings the power of streams to the desktop by enabling users to visualize and manage their development process in an easy-to-use platform-independent interface. With simple click, drag and drop operations, users can create and modify streams, merge code between streams, view and port issues between streams, and more. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Stream Filters
        Managing a complex development process with a large number of code lines and releases can be challenging. With <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Stream Filters, users can tailor their view of the <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Stream hierarchy to see just those streams that are of interest to them improving productivity and scalability. 
      </p>
      <p>
        TimeSafe Architecture & Sarbanes Oxley
        Unlike legacy SCM systems, where it is easy to remove code, <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> employs the TimeSafe® Architecture. By utilizing an append-only database and atomic transactions, <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> assures that a consistent and immutable audit trail is preserved for all operations. This makes audits and regulatory compliance fact-based and safe. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Version Control
        <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> SCM includes an advanced version control solution that delivers both core version control functionality plus sophisticated graphical configuration and codeline management. The <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Stream architecture enables developers to safely version in-progress code and store it in private workspaces, or share it with other team members. 
      </p>
      <p>
        Web Interface
        With highly distributed teams, wireless laptops and telecommuting pervasive in the world today, the <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> Web User Interface helps remote users gain the power of <a href="AccuRev.html">AccuRev</a> via a standard web browser. Users can browse streams, perform code reviews and even download copies of source files from anywhere on the globe.
