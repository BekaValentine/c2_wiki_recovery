        Asp Dot Net
      </h1>
      <p>
        ASP.NET is a new rendition of the <a href="ActiveServerPages.html">ActiveServerPages</a> (ASP) technology for the <a href="MicrosoftDotNet.html">MicrosoftDotNet</a> framework.
      </p>
      <p>
        It is mostly backwards compatible with ASP.  However, it has several new features that really make it a different technology:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           ASP.NET applications are compiled rather than interpreted; you can author applications in any .NET compatible language, including Visual Basic .NET, <a href="CsharpLanguage.html">CsharpLanguage</a>, and <a href="JscriptDotNet.html">JscriptDotNet</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Direct access to the capabilities of the class libraries of the .NET Framework, including ADO.NET, file I/O, image manipulation, ...
        </li>
        <li>
           It is easier to write well-structured applications using "real object-oriented techniques".  (No more need to use the kinds of hacks described in <a href="OoAspPractices.html">OoAspPractices</a>.)
        </li>
        <li>
           Support for building and using <a href="WebServices.html">WebServices</a>.
        </li>
        <li>
           Support for session management.
        </li>
        <li>
           Enhanced diagnostics, tracing, and debugging facilities.
        </li>
      </ul>

        <em>I think </em><a href="AspDotNet.html">AspDotNet</a> (and JSP/Servlets) implement <a href="TemplateView.html">TemplateView</a> in reverse - HTML ends up as string objects inside the compiled page.  This is really the most important change from classic ASP as far as developers are concerned - it's like the relationship between program code and UI has been reversed.  The eternal struggle...<em></em>
      </p>
      <p>
        That's one way to look at it, but another way is to consider the conversion of the .aspx page into a compiled assembly to just be a run-time optimization.  To the developer, it still seems like <a href="TemplateView.html">TemplateView</a> (until something goes wrong and the developer has to look at the generated code to figure out what).

        But how do you test it? <a href="NunitAsp.html">NunitAsp</a> is interesting, but that's really for <a href="CustomerTest.html">CustomerTest</a>s. What I'd love to do is fake out a request and then assert some things about the Page object (or objects within it). In other words, I'd like to write ProgrammerTests without tearing my hair out. With Java Servlets, I can do this just fine - simply create a fake HttpServletRequest and you're off to the races. In .NET, the world appears to be either sealed or really complicated if you want to use objects in a code behind. Thoughts?
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Can you be more specific about what you do to test a "fake HttpServletRequest" that you can't do with ASP.NET?</em>
      </p>
      <p>
        <em></em><a href="NunitAsp.html">NunitAsp</a> is not actually for <a href="CustomerTest.html">CustomerTest</a>s.  It's for <a href="ProgrammerTest.html">ProgrammerTest</a>s.  The fact that it's client/server is an unfortunate result of intertia, laziness, and incomprehension on the part of the maintainer.  --<a href="JimLittle.html">JimLittle</a> (NUnitAsp maintainer)<em></em>

        I'm fairly impressed with Selenium to test ASP. It's free and powerful and easy to use (but not so easy to setup if you work with multiple sites/domains)
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
           Selenium is incredibly flaky and buggy with Ajax, I would heartily NOT recommend it if you use AJAX. Otherwise it is great.
